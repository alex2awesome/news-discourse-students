(Photo courtesy of Myles Molnar)\n\nBy Michael Pincus April 13, 2023 at 6:32 pm PDT\n\nWhen approached for an interview, Myles Molnar was apprehensive about not having \u201cenough\u201d of a story to write about. But Molnar, a 21-year-old undergraduate student at USC, sold himself short. Born and raised in what he describes as a \u201csmall little suburb\u201d in Pleasanton, California, Molnar beat the notoriously difficult single-player video game \u201cDark Souls\u201d in middle school, because, in his words, he was a \u201cbig old nerd.\u201d He was an athlete, too. Molnar was always much bigger than his peers. When his parents put him in baseball at a young age, he would hit the ball too hard. Soccer wasn\u2019t the right sport for him either \u2014 he hated running because it would trigger his asthma. So he pivoted to wrestling, which he competed in from the fourth grade until halfway through his freshman year of high school.\n\nMolnar moved to Abu Dhabi with his family during the summer before he entered the eighth grade. He spent a year and a half there studying at an American school. There, he continued wrestling, his favorite sport. Then, on January 21, 2017, he was injured. Molnar had a cervical spine dislocation involving the C5\u2013C6 level. His spinal cord was impacted, causing quadriplegia, and now he uses a wheelchair. In that sense, his resulting disability is visible. But this story is not about Molnar\u2019s injury. It\u2019s about what happened years later.\n\nMolnar traveled back to the U.S. to begin treatment at a county hospital in Santa Clara, California, before moving to a hospital in Georgia. Then, he went to Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado \u2014 a leading hospital specializing in neurorehabilitation for individuals with spinal cord injuries. That\u2019s where he learned about the Swim with Mike Foundation.\n\nSwim with Mike was founded in 1981 after Mike Nyeholt, a competitive swimmer at USC and three-time NCAA swimming national champion, was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident. His teammate, Ron Orr, gathered the greater USC community for a swimathon event to successfully fundraise $58,000 for an accessible van for Nyeholt. Beginning the following year, Nyeholt joined Orr in hosting an annual fundraiser event on campus to raise scholarship money for other physically challenged athletes.\n\n\u201cPeople came into our lives for a reason,\u201d said Orr, who now serves as the Executive Director of the foundation. \u201cWe kept coming across people who fit our criteria, which was that they were athletic and were in an organized sport and somehow a catastrophic accident or illness came and they were not able to participate in their sport.\u201d\n\nHearing about Swim with Mike was a game-changer for Molnar. When he first visited USC, Molnar was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by how flat the campus was \u2014 it was \u201ctop of the line\u201d and \u201cthe most accessible\u201d out of every school he toured. Then, he saw the cost of attendance. \u201cUSC is a very nice school,\u201d said Molnar. \u201cIt\u2019s also a very expensive school. And I know that my family could not, can not afford to send me here all alone.\u201d\n\nDuring his campus visit, Molnar met Nyeholt, Orr and other higher-ups from the foundation. \u201cI met the \u2018people who decide,\u2019 which maybe was, you know, a good group to meet,\u201d said Molnar. Sure enough, Molnar received a full-tuition scholarship from the foundation, making his dream of attending USC a possibility. Now, he studies applied and computational mathematics and is a member of Trojan Knights, the university\u2019s oldest service organization.\n\nMolnar attends the annual Swim with Mike fundraiser event, which is held at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center (originally the McDonald\u2019s Olympic Swim Stadium) on campus each spring. He writes thank-you notes to donors. He also speaks at the back-to-school brunch, which mainly hosts current and alumni recipients, their families and some donors. But for Molnar, that was not enough. He wanted to give back to Swim with Mike in bigger ways.\n\nConveniently, the Trojan Knights organization works in partnership with Swim with Mike to plan the annual fundraiser event. Thus, Molnar was in a unique position to engage with the foundation not just as a recipient but also as a volunteer from Trojan Knights.\n\n\u201cWorking with Myles Molnar has been an incredibly positive experience,\u201d said Anna Ellazar, one of the Trojan Knights Swim with Mike chairpersons. \u201cMyles brings a very unique and very valuable perspective as a recipient of the scholarship. Considering the foundation is mostly representing physically challenged athletes, him being a recipient of the award is really important in the planning of the event because the event is in part to celebrate athletes like him.\u201d\n\nMolnar previously held Ellazar\u2019s role, but he now serves in an elected position on the Trojan Knights executive board as the treasurer. Still, together with Ellazar and other Trojan Knights leaders, Molnar volunteered to attend weekly planning committee meetings on Fridays to help make the annual fundraiser event happen.\n\n\u201cWe discuss reaching out to other [student organizations] and we try to spread awareness to students on campus,\u201d said Molnar. \u201cLast year it was very successful when it came to donors and recipients, but not so much when it came to students and random people on campus, who we\u2019re trying to market to more this semester. And then obviously there\u2019s the day of [the event], where Trojan Knights help run the entire show.\u201d\n\nLike Molnar, Orr was a Trojan Knight during his time as a student. The student organization\u2019s legacy includes over a century of community service and school spirit initiatives. Multiple Trojan Knights have been recipients of scholarships from the Swim with Mike Foundation, including two members of the U.S. Table Tennis Para National Team.\n\n\u201cI think the Trojan Knights all can see the impact that scholarship had on [Molnar], you know, to be welcomed into USC \u2014 and he may not be at USC if it wasn\u2019t for that scholarship,\u201d said Orr. \u201cWhen you see someone who has gone through what he has gone through, how they face it and how they face the challenges really makes a big difference in your life.\u201d\n\nThe Swim with Mike Foundation and Trojan Knights came together for the 42nd annual fundraiser event at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday, April 1. When asked why students should attend the event, Molnar turned to the opportunities higher education presents.\n\n\u201cI think you should look at where you are,\u201d said Molnar. \u201cYou\u2019re at USC. This is a great school. It\u2019s giving you a lot of opportunities, freedoms, just so much. And Swim with Mike is doing that same thing but for other people. And they are someone\u2019s way out, someone\u2019s way in, someone\u2019s way up.\u201d The author of this article is a member of Trojan Knights alongside Myles Molnar.\n```"}

Alagot, a photo editor, and Park, an Asian American communities reporter at the LA Times, led a conversation on objectivity, trauma and reporting on Asian communities in the newsroom.\n\nDuring the panel, Park shared his experience covering the mass shooting in Monterey Park this January. Jeong Park: You look at the community where this happened and you try to tell the story of the community past the fact that this tragedy occurred there Monterey Park, obviously it's known as one of the first suburban Chinatowns in America.\n\nAs the panel reflected on the traumatic event, Alagot spoke about steps the LA Times took to improve coverage. Calvin Alagot: I feel like we've been doing a better job at giving space to BIPOC communities... Personally, I get frustrated because I feel like we're not moving fast enough. But I guess change takes time. So at least we're moving in the right direction.\n\nAfterwards, we spoke to Park to hear his thoughts on how the discussion went. Park: I thought the students had really interesting questions about objectivity and how to cover Asian American communities. I can see that they have given a lot of thought about those topics in their time at USC... I'm excited to hear that students are interested in coming into this field, working in this space. So it's good to be here.\n\nThe discussion was part of \"Hear Us,\" conference recently organized by the Annenberg Cross Cultural Association hosting events for the National Associations of Black, Hispanic and Asian Journalists in Annenberg.

The highly classified information spread like wildfire as members of the group chat re-shared the documents on the social platform, Discord. This caught the attention of the New York Times, which reported the leak about a week ago and ultimately led to the search for Teixeira.\n\nTeixeira allegedly shared hundreds of classified documents, including intelligence briefings, to a gaming group chat on Discord. Allegedly, he was trying to educate his group of about 30 online friends.\n\nUSC student reactions to the information leak have been mixed. Samantha Choi, a junior communications major, believes that the information leaked in the last few weeks should never have been top secret to begin with.\n\n\"I think that the Pentagon Papers being leaked and the person who leaked it being arrested as well just further incentivizes people to keep quiet when the government is doing things behind the public\u2019s back. There needs to be more transparency and just more protection for people who do decide to whistle-blow.\"\n\nOthers say the government needs to do more to stop leakers. Mechanical engineering junior Adam White says to start with some basic steps.\n\n\"I think that one obvious form of repercussion would be revoking this person\u2019s security clearance. If they\u2019ve proven that they\u2019re willing to distribute classified documents to those without access, then I feel like it\u2019s not a good idea to give them access to all classified documents.\"\n\nCommunications junior Paulene Ng Chee adds, \"If you don\u2019t want these things to be spread out on social media, then like anyone who has access to them shouldn\u2019t be able to just like have their personal devices on them if they can like record or like send all of these out because obviously, like things spread very fast on social media.\"\n\nTeixeira will be arraigned in Boston tomorrow.

HBO Max seems to be the most popular of the two, while not many people know what Discovery + offers. Some perspectives of Discovery + fall ill to past conceptions and offerings such as Romina Nazari, a Health and Human Sciences major at USC.\n\nRomina Nazari: Is Discovery+ like the nature stuff? No. Yes. I don\u2019t know. I guess. I don\u2019t know. So I probably don\u2019t watch anything on there.\n\nBut some students are excited about what Discovery + can add to the mix. Computational Linguistics major Brian Winn is especially happy to hear about HGTV entering the fold.\n\nBrian Winn: I loved HGTV as a kid. I\u2019m not going to lie. That house renovation stuff is so satisfying. Like, yeah, actually, actually, you might have got me to use HBO Max a little bit more.\n\nThe new \u201cMax\u201d will have different subscription tiers. Per month, Max will cost $9.99 with ads and $15.99 without ads. Max is also set to offer a $19.99 per-month plan with called \u201cUltimate Ad-free\u201d with enhanced picture and audio quality.\n\nGiven that USC currently provides free subscription to its students, some question whether the re-branding will effect the cost for students. Neuroscience major Ani Karajayan wonders if USC\u2019s transition from the Fryft to Shryft program foreshadows what may happen to the HBO Max free subscription.\n\nAni Karajayan: Yeah. It like, makes sense considering how, like, they change. Like the left to the left. So, like, it\u2019s a possibility that they would, like, cut, like, not offer the subscription anymore or like, um, but I mean, it\u2019s not that big of a worry for me because I don\u2019t actively use HBO, Max.\n\nThis re-brand is part of a larger company wide merger between HBO-owner WarnerMedia and Discovery that birthed the multibillion-dollar media company Warner Bros.

Spanning two weekends in April, and being headlined for the first time in festival history by a slate of non-white performers, this year\u2019s Coachella will surely be one for the books. With tickets selling out soon after they went on sale in January, many festivalgoers, including Hayley Bill, a USC theatre major, have put in months of preparation for the weekend\u2019s events. \u201cObviously everybody just wants to get there and listen to music and have a good time with their friends, but you know, we had to make time to figure out grocery shopping, and who\u2019s gonna drive, and who\u2019s gonna pay for gas and all that.\u201d\n\nMadeline Martinez studies Business Administration. She agrees. \u201cMy friends and I had to look for a hotel or like somewhere to stay, and that was obviously really hard because a lot of the hotels around the area booked out really quickly.\u201d Between housing, transportation, food and more, the cost of attending Coachella can skyrocket pretty quickly. Sophomore Jewel Abdo believes there are ways around this. \u201cEating before the festival so then you\u2019re less hungry when you\u2019re watching everyone and you don\u2019t spend $15 on a two-inch pizza..\u201d Experienced concert goers say packing your own food can also save money. \u201cBring snacks.

Have fun, but not too much fun!\u201d\n\nTo make sure the Coachella experience is as seamless as possible, here are a few items students recommends bringing along. \u201cDefinitely a fannypack, lots of water... oh a portable charger for sure because you\u2019re going to be there for long hours, comfortable shoes.\u201d The festival, while definitely fun, can also be a learning experience for first time fans. One student remembers her trip to the Coachella Valley last April. \u201cI definitely learned a lot. I learned stay hydrated. I learned bring a bandana because you\u2019re going to be inhaling dirt no matter where you go, and I also learned you gotta prioritize which artists you wanna see, because there\u2019s just no way to see everybody.\u201d\n\nThe festival gates will open at noon tomorrow and close after a headline performance by Frank Ocean Sunday night. Those who can\u2019t make it to Indio this weekend or end up wanting more time at Coachella can opt in for Weekend Two of the festival, which starts April 21.

Hosting a \u2018get to know me and my department\u2019 Q&A today in the Marshall school, Chief Hill made her commitment to revitalizing DPS through community outreach very clear.\n\nLauretta Hill: That bridge has been broken in our profession. And we know that it\u2019s up to us to make sure that we have the olive branch. And we\u2019re reaching out to try to rebuild that bridge of trust and, you know, to go both ways. But I know we have a lot of work to do on accountability.\n\nChief Hill tells me it is her personal responsibility to rebuild trust between DPS and the USC community they protect. DPS has fallen under fire in recent years due to claims of racial profiling and mishandling situations especially with international students.\n\nChief Hill tells me the solution to the distance felt between students and their Public Safety Officials is solidifying a relationship before crucial moments.\n\nHill: I want to take every opportunity to engage with students. And so I\u2019m making myself available. And I was talking to Dr. Allard when we met about student affairs and the student, the different student groups. To meet them where they are, I said, \u201cthey don\u2019t have to come to me. If they have Wednesdays where they play cards, I\u2019ll go. If they have Tuesdays where they\u2019re eating and it\u2019s on Tommy Trojan, I\u2019ll go. just make I\u2019ll make myself available to meet and greet and talk with the students... We want you to have a relationship with us prior to you needing to call us for some kind of emergency.\n\nWhat I\u2019m telling my my internal folks is that community policing and being out and engaging with our students is not a program. It\u2019s a philosophy.\n\nChief Hill was called out of retirement to pursue this position at USC.\n\nHill: I think it\u2019s important for this profession that I love for me to leave even better than I found it. I wouldn\u2019t, if I left now, would be doing that, just to be honest.\n\nShe\u2019s approaching this job with the recognition of work to be done, and a new cultural understanding of public safety.\n\nSome of the initiatives in the works currently are 45 community-suggested programs curated from a CAB board made of student, faculty, staff, and other surrounding community members. Chief Hill says those are her priority in office.\n\nHill: So the CAB was several listening sessions of student faculty, staff, community members that gave their input on how we reimagined policing. So kind of give us our guiding light, our guiding posts on where the community wanted DPS to go. You want this one vision where you do feel welcome, you feel respected, you feel that your diverse backgrounds and experiences are noted by DPS, and then we respond to you as an individual and not a call. And so that\u2019s that\u2019s what I want people to know about my philosophy. You are a person, not just a call, and we want to do whatever it takes to make sure that you feel safe and respected.\n\nAfter the Q&A, a student approached Chief Hill with a specific issue she had last year with a DPS Officer. When asked about how Chief handles complaints before her time, she tells me.\n\nHill: Most comments brought up is is personal. So their interaction and you have to allow them their voice to be heard because what happened to them happened to them and it\u2019s real to them. So sometimes just listening and answering that extra question and so I make myself available to do that.\n\nThere is difference of being represented and different from feeling like you belong. I know those are two different things and I want people to feel like they feel they belong and I want to be part of that.\n\nChief Hill says she sees great potential in our department here, and is ready to get to work in making DPS just another department on campus that works to ensure and promote student success.\n```"}

Hopes of making a good impression on employers were high. With tables organized alphabetically by organization name, students had no trouble finding their desired employers and using their best practices to succeed.\n\n\u201cI heard about the career fair through connectSC and I was looking at positions over the upcoming summer,\u201d said Angus Carre, a senior who is majoring in philosophy, politics and law. \u201cSo I kind of just put two and two together and came out here, put my resume to as many companies as possible.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent university survey of USC students, career fairs are their top preferred recruiting event. A variety of industries have seen layoffs in the last year, like the tech industry, have made students uneasy about what their prospects are like after graduation. Forbes predicts that as a result of the layoffs, other corporations will want to pull the now available and new talent. These events, though, give students face-to-face interactions with employees to grab such opportunities.\n\nEven though this event is so close to the summer, many of the companies attending still have to fill many of their positions. The Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), was one such company. \u201cWe are looking to fill a lot of our summer internships, actually,\u201d said Hailey Luscher, a recruiter from HACLA. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking for students that want to help the community and help enhance the affordable housing mission in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nThe Career Fair featured a diverse range of employers from different industries, including Fortune 500s, non-profits, government agencies and start-ups. Representatives from these organizations were keen on meeting talented students and recent graduates and giving them insights into their companies and job opportunities.\n\n\u201cI think everyone is aware of how prestigious USC is and what a good track record they have of people in the economy,\u201d said Tom Watkins from Centennial Advisers. \u201cSo we wanted to have a presence here and see if we could make some good connections.\u201d\n\nNot only do these companies want to make connections with prospective interns and employees, but see who is cut out for that line of industry. Many of the employers said they were looking for very specific qualities at the Career Fair. \u201cI think more so that they\u2019re just passionate about what our agency is doing, trying to enhance that mission,\u201d Luscher said. \u201cYou just want people that would like to help the community.\u201d\n\nMany of the students saw the passion these employers were exhibiting as they were hearing from different companies along Trousdale. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s tough is that when you go to stuff like this, you learn so much and people are so passionate about what they do,\u201d said Bradley Frye, a graduate student in marketing. \u201cAnd when you hear that passion, it makes it kind of tough to not feel passionate about it, like for the company or industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to Frye, passion alone isn\u2019t enough for a successful career path. Having the right mindset, one can narrow things down and figure out what they want their career to look like once they leave USC. Even the best degree from a high-ranking university will only go so far. Finding the right position in a modern job market is a challenge, one that requires good networking.\n\n\u201cI think the career fair is very important. It\u2019s about shots on goal, not goals scored,\u201d Carre said. \u201cThe job search is basically throwing everything on the wall and seeing what sticks. So things like these are really important.\u201d```"}

ONE Safety Vision is a program derived from the DPS Community Advisory Board with the intent of fostering \u201ca USC where everyone feels safe, respected and protected from crime, while recognizing that this can only be achieved by addressing the diverse experiences and needs of all USC students, faculty, staff and neighbors.\u201d\n\nEven though some might be suspect of the goal to make everyone on campus feel safe, Lennon Wesley, the moderator of the event and a member of the DPS community advisory board, vouches for how down-to-earth Hill is.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Texas thing or the auntie thing, but she\u2019s extremely genuine, extremely fun to be around,\u201d Wesley said. \u201c[She has] great experience in the field. So being a real person, combined with the fact that she knows a lot about this and can understand even my own personal experience, I think goes a long way.\u201d\n\nHill acknowledges that rebuilding trust within the community through this vision requires facing difficult conversations head-on. Common concerns such as racial profiling, counseling responses to mental health calls and the use of non-lethal weapons were listed as points of reference.\n\nAs the former head of the LAPD Cadet Leadership Program, Natalie Torres-Soriano found excitement in these initiatives at the past three events that she\u2019s attended where Hill has spoken.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s eyes wide open. She wants to resolve the issues,\u201d Torres-Soriano said. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018let me learn about them.\u2019 She knows, and she\u2019s on her path already to make those changes.\u201d\n\nHill has been developing this program to achieve her main goal at USC: to keep USC students safe and make them feel heard.\n\n\u201cI will absolutely be sure that we\u2019re trained, and that we stay on the cutting edge of best practices, working with our different partners here and just listening to the people,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m just as much a part of USC as the next person, as a student, as a faculty, [or] member of the staff. And so our shared experiences and wanting everybody to be safe, we have some of the same goals.\u201d\n\nHill understands, as a member of the USC community, that the university has a wide array of students and faculty who deserve more than just representation, which she hopes to provide as a Black woman.\n\nBeyond that, she wants the community to know who she and her staff are.\n\n\u201cYou will know us before the emergency happens. Before you need to call, you\u2019ll feel like \u2018I know my DPS officer, I know my CSO, I can call and talk to dispatch,\u2019\u201d Hill said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being represented and feeling like you belong. I want to be a part of feeling like people belong.\u201d\n```"}

The Big Ten is the most misunderstood conference in college basketball. Yes, I am aware that its member schools do not perform well in March Madness, including the worst loss in March Madness history when No. 1 seed Purdue was upset by No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson. However, the Big Ten is still an intensely interesting subject to study. As Sun Tzu said in \u201cThe Art of War,\u201d \u201cIf you know your enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the peril of a hundred battles.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2022, USC and UCLA announced that they would be leaving the Pac-12 and joining the Big Ten. While the Trojans won\u2019t become a member of the Big Ten until August 2024, here are five things Trojan fans should know about their new conference.\n\nFor some background: I am from New Jersey, and before I committed to USC, I was a fan of the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. I have watched an unhealthy amount of Big Ten basketball in the last four years. So back to the list.\n\nGalen Center should be packed: The Big Ten\u2019s impressive home courts\n\nFor most of the Pac-12, home court advantage isn\u2019t a big factor. If you didn\u2019t know, Pac-12 home teams had an average attendance of 5,399 per home game last season. This figure was the conference\u2019s lowest since 1983-1984. The fans are not as important when you play Pac-12 teams on the road (aside from Arizona). However, playing road games in the Big Ten is nearly impossible. In the 2019-20 season, every Big Ten team had at least one sell-out. The conference has two incredibly iconic arenas: Mackey Arena (Purdue) and Assembly Hall (Indiana), and it also has other incredibly difficult places to play, like Jersey Mike\u2019s Arena (Rutgers) and Breslin Center (Michigan State). These arenas are loud and full of hostile students and alumni. Why is this important to know? Since it\u2019s almost impossible to win on the road in the Big Ten, USC needs to win as many games as possible at the Galen Center. Unfortunately for USC, the Galen Center is not a very hostile arena. Despite being a state-of-the-art facility where NBA teams have practice, USC basketball only had one game last year with over 9000 attendees. Winning home games will be crucial, so packing Galen is paramount.\n\nThe Big Ten: The \u201cCOVID Senior\u201d conference\n\nThis concept of \u201cCOVID Seniors\u201d isn\u2019t just applicable to the Big Ten and will likely not be a big problem by the time USC gets to the Big Ten, but it does demonstrate how the conference is full of experience. For example, this year\u2019s All-Big Ten First and Second Teams featured zero underclassmen. This is not to say that these players don\u2019t go to the NBA, as Jaden Ivey was notably drafted No. 5 overall last year, but it is true that most Big Ten players spend a lot of time in college. In practice, we see clear continuity and consistency between teams from year to year. USC will be playing teams full of upperclassmen, so the Trojans will need to have some sense of continuity as well.\n\nThe Big Ten\u2019s big men\n\nEach conference in college basketball has its own style. While the Pac-12 is a much more offensive conference with great shooting, the Big Ten is a physical, defensive conference with great big men. The last three Naismith Player of the Year winners from the Big Ten were all frontcourt players (Zach Edey this year, Luka Garza in 2021 and Frank Kaminsky in 2015). The combination of experience and physicality means that USC\u2019s centers are going to need to improve their footwork and post presence. Otherwise, the Trojan big men will foul out of the game and open up easy driving lanes and baskets for the other teams.\n\nReferees\n\nReferees will always be the most highly criticized individuals in their respective sports, so in general, it\u2019s unproductive to blame them for losses. However, Big Ten referees have had some very legitimate criticisms over the years. Just this year, Big Ten officials missed an Ohio State player\u2019s step out of bounds before he came back inbounds and scored a game-winning 3-pointer. This prompted the conference to actually admit that they messed up the call and that the game winner should never have counted. This, combined with the claims that the referees were too easy on Edey, means that referee complaints are guaranteed.\n\nFinally, we have some good streaming options\n\nThis one isn\u2019t a basketball issue, rather we, as fans, are able to better watch the sport. The Big Ten is partnered with Fox Sports, meaning that all of the games are on Fox, one of the Fox Sports channels or the Big Ten Network. With BTN, watching and paying attention to college basketball is far more accessible, as it is widely available in most cable packages. Having to use illegal streams because I didn\u2019t have the Pac-12 network will be a thing of the past, and now it should be easier to watch every game. The Big Ten Network has great studio analysts and even more accurate bracketologists than ESPN, according to BracketMatrix. All in all, the viewing experience should only improve.\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo by Kimberly Aguirre)\n\nBy Kimberly Aguirre April 13, 2023 at 2:38 pm PDT\n\nAfter the Los Angeles storms, Lily Navarro dodged puddles from the recent rain as she walked through South Gate Park. Between family picnics and soccer games, it seemed there was no secluded spot in the almost 100-acre park \u2014 just as Navarro always remembered. On a table at the corner of Hildreth Avenue and Tweedy Boulevard, Navarro spread out multiple drafts of her future zine, El Conocimiento. Bright photos and vibrant colored pencil drawings covered the A4 pages. This park is her favorite part of the city.\n\nWhile Navarro\u2019s heart is full of love for South Gate, she has an appetite for change. Navarro, an artist who recently graduated from California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, noticed the art scene in South Gate was lacking. This wasn\u2019t due to a lack of artists, but a lack of space. She decided to change that.\n\nSoon, Navarro will release the first edition of El Conocimiento, a zine dedicated to providing a space for artists of South and East L.A. The project has been three years in the making. El Conocimiento is not Navarro\u2019s first zine. Navarro created Cajas de Cari\u00f1o, after learning about them in college and getting inspired by 1980s Black, Indigenous and People of Color zines.\n\n\u201c[Zines are] very punk,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIt\u2019s very in your face of different subjects too, it doesn\u2019t really have limits. There\u2019s nobody policing or editing it for you. It\u2019s just like, \u2018I did this. And I printed it. And I\u2019m sharing it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollowing the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, Navarro and other South Gate community members rallied for months of protests, but Navarro, and her partner, Kent Zapata, were dissatisfied with the city\u2019s minimal changes \u2014 especially with the 2% police budget decrease when they initially asked for 30%. Angrier than ever, the pair realized bureaucracy was not working and turned to new means.\n\nIn 2020, The People of South Gate, a collective \u201ccreated by the people for the people,\u201d was born. Through weekly food distribution events, rallies and teach-ins, the collective is dedicated to improving South Gate through mutual aid. Cajas de Cari\u00f1o, now called the People of South Gate, was created as a physical, shareable manifesto of the collective\u2019s mission statement. Navarro was the primary contributor to the zine. She served as the writer, photographer, artist and editor.\n\nBetween balancing the zine, college work and her activism, El Conocimiento \u201cfloated around in limbo\u201d for years. Amanda Tapia, one of the founders of The People of South Gate, is supportive of Navarro\u2019s endeavors.\n\n\u201cOne of the beauties of our collective is whatever skill sets and passions our folks have, we love to see it be used here in our group,\u201d Tapia said. \u201cWe have a lot of members that are artists, and are willing to create a zine that is centered around the community centered around need centered around amazing opportunities that maybe otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been highlighted and showcase other people\u2019s art to within the community.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating in December, Navarro has more time to dedicate to the zine, aspiring to finally build a space for the artists of South East L.A. \u201cWe do need more art in our community because it is very policed. We don\u2019t really have much to share. We don\u2019t have murals here. We barely opened the South Gate Museum,\u201d she said. \u201cI really wanted to be the first to introduce that to here.\u201d\n\nNavarro, and The People of South Gate member Zapata, attribute the \u201clack of an art culture\u201d in the area to the city council\u2019s hopes of maintaining an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d image. Zapata believes the council ignores demographic changes in the area. According to the 2022 United States Census, over 95% of South Gate residents identify as Latino.\n\n\u201cThe city council has this old-fashioned [image of an] upper-class, white, segregated town, even though it hasn\u2019t been since the white flight. With that change in demographic came a change in culture,\u201d Zapata said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have murals on our walls like East L.A. does or Watts does. [City Council] doesn\u2019t allow certain things that don\u2019t cater to the pristine image of South Gate.\u201d\n\nAlthough the plan for El Conocimiento originally started as just providing space for local artists, the zine will hold more than just art. Navarro has plans to add tips for healthy eating, ways to support public libraries and Metro information. Her goal is to have multiple businesses carry the zine to make all information as widely accessible as possible. The People of South Gate zine is currently available at Cruzita\u2019s Deli and Cafe, the location of the group\u2019s weekly food distributions.\n\nAs a child, Navarro\u2019s parents enrolled her in art programs, but she was not able to continue due to the financial burden. In the future, Navarro hopes to head free art programs in the city.\n\n\u201cTimes are just really tough right now. It\u2019s hard to have students go every month or every week [to art classes] because they would have to pay every week,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cWe\u2019re navigating this world of like, \u2018where can we express ourselves?\u2019 And I think art is the most wonderful way.\u201d\n\nThe journey to publication has been challenging, and it is not over yet \u2014 Navarro is currently struggling to find a place where she can produce the physical copies of the zine for free, as the high printing costs would hinder her plans for mass production. She is in contact with local teachers and is also planning to make the zine available digitally. Three years in the making, Navarro hasn\u2019t stopped pushing for the creation of El Conocimiento. For Navarro, art \u2014 and the act of uplifting underrepresented artists \u2014 is activism.\n```"}

Faded pictures of wedding photos, studio portraits of quincea\u00f1eras and family photographs adorn the white brick walls of Quik-Pix, as developed rolls of film hang off of a small drying rack near the rear wall. Tucked behind the glass counter filled with rolls of film and disposable cameras is Gazi Alam, the owner and sole employee of Quik-Pix. Donning a USC beanie and black jacket, Alam scans and edits film photographs on an old scanning machine and prepares to welcome clients into his shop.\n\nBehind Alam and Quik-Pix\u2019s warm exteriors is a history of which many customers are unaware. Akm, Alam\u2019s older brother and the original owner of Quik-Pix, was diagnosed with motor neuron disease around three years ago. Akm had to take a step back from the business due to his diagnosis and pushed Alam to take over to keep Quik-Pix open. Alam became the store\u2019s primary employee in 2021 when his brother\u2019s disease progressed. Akm passed away in January, leaving Alam to run the family business alone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m continuing [the business] now to continue his legacy,\u201d Alam said, smiling. \u201cI know the business. [We] started a long time ago, and I have a lot of experience. Let\u2019s see how long we can go.\u201d\n\nAlam moved to the U.S. from Bangladesh in 1998 after attending university in his home country. As soon as he came to L.A. to join his brother, Alam began working with him in the photo-printing industry. Despite its long history in South L.A. with the Alams, Quik-Pix has not been on Vermont Avenue for its entire existence. The photo shop was located for over 30 years in the former strip mall that the USC Village took over in 2015.\n\nMaria Pati\u00f1o Gutierrez, director of policy and research at the nonprofit Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, said there has been a history of displacement in South L.A. by USC to make the area more accessible and livable for students, such as the construction of the USC Village. When construction of the USC Village began, SAJE worked with the displaced businesses to help them find new locations and information.\n\n\u201cWe have seen many families displaced [and] priced out by USC housing,\u201d Gutierrez said in an email. \u201cIn particular in South Los Angeles, [SAJE] has been working on making the Community Plan Implementation Overlay stronger with demolition protections and the right to return for tenants displaced due to building housing that is likely aimed for students.\u201d\n\nCommunity Plan Implementation Overlay Districts were designated by the City of L.A. to \u201coffer customized protection to individual neighborhoods and corridors and set clear regulations for the size, scale, and bulk of new construction.\u201d\n\nAlam said the leases for the new USC Village storefronts were too expensive for Quik-Pix to afford and that the school offered no benefits or discounts for the businesses that had been there for decades.\n\n\u201cThey said we had to move,\u201d Alam said. \u201cWe had to find a new location, and had to look close by to stay in business because our customers are students. We cannot do anything if we are far away. Luckily we found this location very close to the USC campus, and we started all over again.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alam, about 95% of his business is composed of USC students, who come to Quik-Pix Photo Lab to develop film. International students also go to the store to have their visa and passport photos taken.\n\nCarly Rieger, a sophomore majoring in communication, has been a Quik-Pix customer for over a year. She found Quik-Pix from looking on Google Maps, but was not aware of the store\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about the previous Village location, and I appreciate the fact that [Gazi] is just committed to doing his job and providing the services that he offers,\u201d Rieger said. \u201cI have a camera that I\u2019ve been holding on to for months, and now I want to go over there and give him some more of my business.\u201d\n\nWhile Alam was able to keep the business afloat after the relocation and COVID-19 years, in which Quik-Pix had to close for a period of time, he said the business has never been the same since he and his brother were forced to move from the old University Village.\n\n\u201c[The old store] was at the prime location. Parking was easy; everything was very reliable and people could come easily,\u201d Alam said. \u201cStill, we are struggling. It is not like before, but we are still surviving, staying here. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nMany students don\u2019t know Quik-Pix exists at the Vermont Avenue location, and advertising is difficult with a tight operating budget, according to Alam. Despite the USC Village displacing Alam and his brother from their original business storefront, Alam still considers himself to be a part of the Trojan family.\n\n\u201cWe take care of our customers like family members,\u201d Alam said. \u201cWe build friendships with customers for four or five years. I have customers that have moved to other states, and they are still coming back and sending [film] by mail.\u201d\n\nAlam has a customer that graduated from USC in 1995 who is road-tripping from Washington this summer to develop film with Quik-Pix. The customer previously got his film developed at the original Quik-Pix location and reconnected with Alam after seeing a Daily Trojan article about the business.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve experienced \u2014 in my imagination \u2014 traveling the whole world because students travel here and there,\u201d Alam said. \u201cI can tell from pictures where they travel, and it\u2019s amazing. I love it. It\u2019s a very wonderful experience.\u201d\n\nAlam has plans to revamp the business moving forward. He said he plans to offer personalization services, such as mugs, t-shirts and other products that students can personalize with pictures. While the future of Quik-Pix is uncertain, Alam talks about the future with a smile on his face.\n\n\u201cWe are still here,\u201d Alam said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long we can survive, but let\u2019s see.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/13/mentally-demanding/", "response": "```\nMaster\u2019s students in the USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work walked out of their class on Tuesday to protest unpaid internships and long hours. With some students forced to find outside employment to supplement their graduate work, protesters hope to raise awareness about the changes that need to be made in the social work program.\n\nMarisa Vasquez, a first-year graduate student in the master\u2019s of social work program, said students are required to take about more than six credits of classes and intern for about 20 hours per week. \u201cNot only are we required to do full classes but we also have to do a hands-on internship experience,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cAnd as you\u2019re aware, it\u2019s unpaid.\u201d\n\nStudents said they are protesting because they can barely find time to complete school assignments and demanding internships \u2014 on top of outside work \u2014 just to survive. \u201cThere are times where I\u2019ve caught myself almost falling asleep on the job, and it\u2019s been really difficult turning in assignments on time because it\u2019s one assignment after another,\u201d said Brandy Mendoza, a first-year student in the program. \u201cI\u2019m [also] working with my mom doing Uber Eats just because I need to pay rent and bills and tuition.\u201d\n\nIn an official statement obtained by Annenberg Media, USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work said that \u201cthe request to pay social work students for their practicum placements is a national issue. Our school\u2019s leadership has an open dialog with students on this topic and will continue to work closely with them.\u201d\n\nMost graduate students are allowed only one sick day per internship, they said, and are told to \u201cuse it wisely.\u201d That\u2019s not enough time to even recover from the COVID-19 or even the flu, they said. Hannah Logson, a second-year graduate student in the program, said she was terminated from her internship when she got the flu and could not go to work for three days. \u201cIf you get sick with a flu, or cold, or COVID-19, you\u2019re screwed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to make up hours at that point, or some field placements will drop you because you\u2019ve not met the time or you\u2019ve not met the hours.\u201d\n\nOther graduate students said they are concerned about their mental health amidst the requirements of the program regarding internships and the limited sick days it offers. Jeneva Lindsey, a second-year adult mental health and wellness student in the program, said her mental health has significantly declined because of the overwhelming amount of hours she is expected to put in every week. She said her program doesn\u2019t leave her with time to find another job to supplement her low income, either \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be working that much and to not be able to have any income on top of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was very broke, and it only got worse this year because my rent went up.\u201d\n\nSome students said they did not receive enough support from their supervisors to make accommodations or improve the quality of the work environment, even when they sought it out. \u201cI get it, I\u2019ve struggled with my mental health,\u201d Logson said. \u201cI\u2019ve not done a great job of managing it because I\u2019ve been so overwhelmed. But I was actively trying to find support and look for support and help.\u201d\n\nSome students said they felt discriminated against because of their mental health issues and said they just want to be faced with understanding and honest communication to find better solutions for them. \u201cIt\u2019s just been kind of discrimination,\u201d Logson said. \u201cAnd when I try to be transparent about my experiences, it\u2019s kind of almost been weaponized in a way towards me.\u201d\n\nLogson, who submitted a statement to her student review after being fired from her internship, said she did it not because she wants things to be changed for her but because USC needs to do a quality check before sending students into the placements. All she wants is to learn in a healthy work environment. \u201cI\u2019ve come to terms and acceptance that I\u2019m okay with staying the extra year and paying whatever money I need to pay if it\u2019s going to get me a better experience at a better internship site,\u201d she said. \u201cBut [my] statement was not for me to change any of my outcome. It was just so it\u2019s documented that there\u2019s situations like this happening and USC needs to look.\u201d\n\nKarra Bikson, an associate professor of social work, said the reasons for the walk out come down amount to a social justice issue. \u201cI was so impressed. They are so brilliant. My heart was bursting with pride,\u201d Bikson said. \u201cTo me, the students are already committed to social justice when they come to the program. They are the solution.\u201d\n\nDayshalee Rosario Cruz is a graduate student who said she has had a pleasant learning experience with her internships. But she said she joined the walk out in the name of those who have been negatively affected. \u201cThankfully, my experience with my internship has been very positive. I haven\u2019t had the uncomfortable and negative experiences other students have had and I understand that,\u201d she said. \u201cI am still going to walk out in solidarity for those that maybe don\u2019t have the opportunity to walk out and their experience hasn\u2019t been positive.\u201d \u201cI can walk out for them,\u201d Rosario Cruz added.\n```"}

Several hundred students sat in Bovard Auditorium for over an hour and listened to her discuss her career and opinions on pressing social issues, with some even getting the opportunity to ask her questions themselves.\n\nHsu kicked off the event by expressing her gratitude for being offered the opportunity to speak at USC, saying that she \u201ccould never have imagined that I would be out here with all of you.\u201d She went on to discuss how her entire career has been built on the belief others have had in her. \u201cI could have never imagined a long career in the arts, but so many people opened the door for me and showed me the way,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cMy whole career up to this point has been about finding people that believed in me and showing that [belief], which was key for creating a career for me.\u201d\n\nHsu\u2019s career began in theater, but her film career was jump-started when she was cast in a national commercial advertising the Nest thermostat. After being casted in a second commercial by the same director, Hsu was put on a trajectory to her career in the arts and mused on this rapid success during the Q&A. \u201cI got to sit in the same theater that I initially performed in and got to see how my career shifted in just one year,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cChange feels like it\u2019s trudging along and then sometimes it floods open.\u201d\n\nWhile her career has experienced rapid growth, Hsu does not think the same can be said about representation in the film industry. She cites instances of racism in her own set experiences, stating that she \u201cwalked away from things where people asked her to do things with an accent.\u201d Furthermore, Hsu believes there is a distinct lack of authentic Asian representation within Hollywood. Rather, she said that there are several harmful stereotypes instead. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stereotypes around the APIDA [Asian Pacific Islander Desi American] community that are generated around ignorance.\u201d Hsu said. \u201cThe silent model minority trope.

There\u2019s actually a lot of us.\u201d\n\nThese stereotypes are something that Hsu believes is antithetical to progress. \u201cHow are our parents ever going to evolve away from a trope if we don\u2019t show them anything but that trope?\u201d Hsu said. \u201cIf we get stuck in the old stories and narratives, we get stuck in old stories and can never progress. We need to hope again. We need to show them something else.\u201d\n\nHsu also expressed the importance of \u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once\u201d in the current film landscape and how its accolades are indicative of the impact that Asian people have had on the film industry. \u201cI feel like the APIDA community is a firm patch in the quilt of cinema,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cNo one can say that silly little movie came and went. We did that and that\u2019s going to be in the history books forever.\u201d\n\nDespite her misgivings about the current state of the film industry overall, Hsu is still optimistic about the future after the audience reactions to \u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that people can feel so big,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cI\u2019m worried that these days people won\u2019t be fazed anymore, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s possible for people to witness something and then let it have a life of its own.\u201d\n\nThe reactions to the film have extended beyond tearful watches and 10/10 reviews. Hsu said that she had people walk up to her expressing how the film helped them process personal life events. \u201cI met a Korean writer that was excommunicated from her family because of her queerness, and she told me that after seeing the movie she felt like she was accepted,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cI also had a mother tell me that her daughter is trans and they hadn\u2019t talked in five years and she was really trying.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hsu said that the most impactful reaction that she witnessed came from her own mother. After Hsu first expressed her desire to be an actor, her mother dismissed the notion, stating that \u201cnobody looked like [her], so how could [she] be an actor?\u201d \u201cWhen we watched the movie, my mom pointed to the screen and said, \u2018That\u2019s me,\u2019\u201d Hsu said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, \u2018That\u2019s you.\u2019 That\u2019s the first time my mother has ever seen herself on screen. We haven\u2019t seen three generations in one spot before and the false hope that is passed down to children that is actually more harmful than is good.\u201d\n\nHsu reiterated the emotional impact of the filmmaking process of \u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once\u201d and her role as Joy throughout the Q&A. It is something that she believes has led to \u201cintergenerational healing\u201d for queer people and the Asian community. \u201cPlaying Joy taught me that there are so many people like me experiencing intergenerational trauma,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cThis movie and what the reception has done for me and the Daniels [directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert] has made me feel like there is intergenerational healing. All of the cast has been alive at the same time and it feels like this last year has been a time for us to heal.\u201d\n\nHsu ended the Q&A on a hopeful note by expressing excitement at the progress made by the generations following her and the idea of a more representative film industry. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much growth that has happened since I have been in college in terms of the way people are talking to each other,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited for a time where what we see on screen around us have so many people from diaspora that it is normalized. I want to be human and have my prism of identity to be part of humanness. I hope we can get to a point one day where we don\u2019t need to emphasize our differences to be accepted.\u201d \n```"}

Author Alisa Vitti explains the importance of working out, eating, and incorporating lifestyle changes during the different phases of your menstrual cycle.\n\nBy Alexandra Donovan April 13, 2023 at 9:01 am PDT\n\nWe have all been in the awkward middle school classroom where we received the dreaded \u201ctalk\u201d from our school nurse. Amid the giggles from squirming 13-year-olds, you can hear talk about the ways bodies will change and how to have safe sex, but that\u2019s about it. Young girls learn that they will bleed once a month, what the difference between pads and tampons are and that they now have to be careful not to get pregnant. But there is so much more to your period than just bleeding. That\u2019s where author Alisa Vitti\u2019s book, \u201cIn the FLO,\u201d comes into play.\n\nVitti was studying to be a GYN at Johns Hopkins University when she began suffering from depression, rapid weight gain and severe acne. Her doctors could not come to a conclusive diagnosis for her, and it was not until she was researching hormonal imbalances in her library that she found out she had all the symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). She walked into her GYN\u2019s office the following day to corroborate her findings and finally get the diagnosis she was looking for. While she finally got the diagnosis, her GYN told her PCOS was incurable in western medicine. This inspired Vitti to do her own health research and she was able to reverse her PCOS symptoms with food.\n\nFollowing the knowledge she obtained in her healing process she became a holistic head practitioner and hormone expert, opening a women\u2019s clinic in New York City that now also offers virtual services to thousands of women across the country. Additionally, Vitti offers guidance to women struggling with hormonal imbalances in her books. In \u201cIn the Flo,\u201d Vitti explains the importance of both the circadian and infradian rhythms for women. While both men and women have a circadian rhythm \u2014 our 24-hour biological clock regulating our bodies for sleeping and waking \u2014 only women have an infradian rhythm. A woman\u2019s infradian rhythm is the 28-day cycle that regulates her menstrual cycle and can have influences on the brain, metabolism, immune system, gut microbiome, stress response system and reproductive system.\n\nHeard of cycle syncing on TikTok? Vitti coined the term in her books to describe her plan that offers food, fitness and lifestyle suggestions for the four parts of your cycle. The cycle syncing method is a way of adjusting your lifestyle to match your menstrual cycle in order to optimize your health and wellbeing. This method takes into consideration the natural hormonal fluctuations that occur throughout the menstrual cycle and makes adjustments to diet, exercise and self-care practices accordingly.\n\nSo how can you implement this into your cycle? Menstrual phase (days 1-5): During this phase, estrogen and progesterone levels are low, and many women experience fatigue, cramps, and mood swings. It\u2019s important to rest and prioritize self-care during this time, do slow exercise, and eat nutrient-dense foods like kale, wild rice and blackberries to support your body\u2019s energy needs.\n\nFollicular phase (days 6-14): This phase is characterized by increasing estrogen levels, which can improve mood, motivation and creativity. It\u2019s a good time to focus on physical activity and strength training, as well as eating foods that support liver detoxification and hormone metabolism such as carrots, chicken and parsley.\n\nOvulatory phase (days 15-17): This is when estrogen levels peak and ovulation occurs. It\u2019s a great time to socialize, communicate and engage in creative pursuits, as well as eating foods that support fertility and healthy egg development. This includes salmon, quinoa and spinach.\n\nLuteal phase (days 18-28): During this phase, estrogen levels drop and progesterone levels rise, which can lead to premenstrual symptoms like bloating, irritability and anxiety. It\u2019s important to focus on stress reduction, adequate sleep and eating foods that support healthy progesterone levels and estrogen metabolism like cauliflower, beef and sweet potatoes.\n\nScientific studies on the menstrual cycle\u2019s health aspects provide some evidence for the benefits of cycle syncing. One found that women\u2019s brains show different patterns of connectivity and activity depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle. Another found that women\u2019s muscle strength and power fluctuate throughout their menstrual cycle, with the highest levels occurring in the late follicular phase. A third found that yoga was effective in reducing PMS symptoms.\n\nCycle syncing is a holistic approach to menstrual health that recognizes the interconnectedness of diet, exercise, stress and hormonal balance. By working with your body\u2019s natural rhythms and supporting your unique needs, you can achieve greater vitality, resilience and well-being throughout your cycle. You should always consult with your doctor before trying new diets and supplements.\n```"}

That\u2019s the vision 11 USC School of Dramatic Arts students and acclaimed director and professor Luis Alfaro have realized with the staging of \u201cAnna in the Tropics.\u201d The show will open Thursday night at 7:30 p.m. at 24th Street Theatre.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s much, but we\u2019re focusing just on human emotion and the body on stage,\u201d Alfaro said. \u201cThe virtuosity of the show is that it\u2019s only the actor and their voice. They don\u2019t have anything to hide behind.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge that produces inspiration, according to cast member Natasha Nutkiewicz, a senior studying theater and cinematic arts. In creating art with very little, the actors are inspired to approach the story in innovative ways.\n\n\u201cI said at the first meeting, \u2018There\u2019s no sound cues. Who plays an instrument?\u2019\u201d Alfaro said. \u201cWe have somebody playing guitar, we have someone playing violin. So we\u2019ve created this really beautiful natural thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very bare bones, so we can really explore the poetry that Nilo Cruz, the author, has given us,\u201d Nutkiewicz said.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize winning show created by Cuban American playwright Nilo Cruz, follows the emotional trials of a Cuban family during the Prohibition Era. The show, whose namesake comes from several scenes that parallel Totlsy\u2019s Anna Karenina, has gotten much critical acclaim and even had a stint on Broadway.\n\nIt\u2019s a story \u201cabout a world that is changing very much like ours,\u201d Nutkiewicz said. It\u2019s rich with themes about generational trauma and healing, tradition, machismo and the resilience of love and family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Latine story by Latine actors,\u201d she said.\n\nWith a short rehearsal time frame, the majority Latine cast has been practicing for multiple hours a day over the last few weeks. It has been up to the cast and Alfaro to promote the show, which Alfaro has been doing from his personal Instagram.\n\nTheir show will be the first performance of a new community engagement performance program piloted by the USC School of Dramatic Arts.\n\n\u201cWe have an almost entirely Latino cast getting to perform in Los Angeles, a predominantly Latino city in the U.S.,\u201d cast member Javi Casanova said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor because we\u2019re representatives of that community. And our stories aren\u2019t heard that often. It\u2019s special that we have a chance to be able to put our voices out there, let them be heard outside of the extremely small, white, wealthy bubble that USC tends to cultivate.\u201d\n\nThe 24th Street Theatre is nestled within the neighborhood surrounding USC, several blocks away from campus. The theater is a destination for community gatherings aimed at engaging and educating young people and their families with theater and arts, according to their mission statement.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be able to celebrate and honor the different stories and experiences that are present in the diverse landscape of Los Angeles,\u201d said Anita Dashiell-Sparks, SDA associate dean of equity, diversity and inclusion. \u201cAnd to give our students an opportunity to share and celebrate diverse experiences in partnership with community theaters, cultural centers and nonprofit organizations.\u201d\n\nOne logistical concern that arose from a limited rehearsal timeframe, however, was the level of community engagement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that the play is free, so it\u2019s accessible, but it\u2019s all in English and our surrounding community is primarily Spanish-speaking,\u201d Nutkiewicz said.\n\nThough future projects may cater to a Spanish-speaking audience, Alfaro took on the project knowing that he would have to devote their attention to what could be accomplished in the timeframe.\n\nAccording to Alfaro, the focus was put on choosing material that could be meaningful to the community and engaging a diverse body of actors to tell those stories.\n\nAlfaro said that building deeper connections with the community takes time.\n\nMoving forward with the community engagement program, Alfaro emphasized the importance of intentionally getting to know the community.\n\nAccording to freshman and cast member Pedro Coelho, community engagement is what counts.\n\n\u201cWithout the community there is no theater, there is no arts. It\u2019s important to have these opportunities where theater and the arts are made by the people to give back to the people,\u201d Coelho said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to go out into the community rather than have the community come to us.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of opening night, Nutkiewicz says the show will not be complete until the addition of one final character.\n\nAccording to the actress, that is the audience.\n\n\u201cWe need the final character, we need the audience,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir adrenaline is going to fuel our curiosity, our aura, our energy and our presence.\u201d\n\nThe show will be running from Thursday, April 13 until Sunday, April 16, with a total of five shows. The tickets are free and can be found here.\n```"}

While it\u2019s possible that the ruling could be brought all the way up to the Supreme Court, Cohen says the decision is unlikely to be made anytime soon.\n\nFolks are already talking about this being appealed potentially up to the Supreme Court.

Many students will make the trek from Los Angeles all the way out to Indio, California for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the biggest music festival in the nation. But that\u2019s not the only draw for students this weekend. The annual USC spring football game kicks off at noon Saturday, and the forecast is calling for clear skies and sunshine.\n\nFollowing a very successful bounceback 2022 season for the football team, there is much for students to be excited about. Returning USC star quarterback Caleb Williams will be honored at halftime for winning the Heisman Trophy, the highest honor bestowed upon the nation\u2019s most outstanding quarterback.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an integral part of the team, and he\u2019s going to be a renowned player in the NFL,\u201d said junior entrepreneurship major Sebastian Bustamante. \u201cHe seems like a really good guy and he\u2019s a big part of the community. So it is important to honor that and his commitment to the team.\u201d\n\nThe excitement surrounding the game is not limited to the play on the field and the halftime ceremony. Festivities at the game will include a variety of food trucks, photo opportunities and giveaways. Tickets to the game are free for students.\n\nCoachella, the annual desert music festival in Indio, will also kick off this Friday. Bad Bunny, Blackpink and Frank Ocean are headlining the desert festival. Other performances include Kali Uchis, Dominic Fike and The Kid Laroi. Tickets, which sell for quite a bit more than the free price tag of the USC spring game, are already sold out for the first weekend of the festival, but can still be purchased for the second weekend.\n\nFreshman popular music major Eyen Paredes says that while others are at Coachella, she\u2019ll be performing gigs of her own. \u201cIf you can get tickets [to Coachella] it\u2019s great, but tickets are really expensive now, and I think it\u2019s a little overhyped,\u201d Paredes said. \u201cI\u2019m playing at this \u2018Women in the Music Industry Festival\u2019 ... and then I\u2019m also playing at an event here on campus.\u201d\n\nSophomore communication major Robbie Andrews says that he is excited to see some of his favorite musicians perform at Coachella. \u201cI\u2019s gonna be my first year,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit stressful planning everything, figuring out my outfits, figuring out where I\u2019m staying, but as of now I\u2019m staying with a bunch of friends, so I\u2019m really happy.\u201d\n\nFor many students, the gripe with going to Coachella seems to be with the price of the festival. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of money and going there for a couple of days is not really my scene,\u201d sophomore chemical engineering major Laura Garcia said. \u201cI do love some of the artists that are headlining there.

Patient care and student workers picketed all 10 UC campuses and several medical centers up and down the state. In Westwood, frontline employees marched across the UCLA campus, calling out stagnant wages making it difficult to make ends meet.\n\nUC graduate workers went on strike for six weeks in November 2022, securing pay and benefit increases. Undergraduate students and frontline workers alike have centered the rallies today. AFSCME 329, the chapter of the national labor union that represents more than 30,000 workers UC-wide, led the call for higher wages.\n\nSam Rusk, a UCLA sophomore studying English, works at a cafe on campus and said the university doesn\u2019t pay students for all the hours worked. \u201cWe have students who work 18-hour shifts, and we don\u2019t get overtime pay. We don\u2019t get any sort of benefits whatsoever,\u201d Rusk said. \u201cIt feels really horrible when these are people who bring the university its value and they\u2019re being so exploited.\u201d\n\nRusk said some UCLA students work multiple jobs and drive \u201clong distances\u201d just to get to campus. \u201cA lot of people are falling behind in school. They can\u2019t experience regular college because they have to work so much to afford to stay here and we\u2019re the students \u2014 who the UC should be prioritizing,\u201d Rusk said.\n\nPrice hikes have outpaced student services on campus, Rusk asserted, calling out UCLA for \u201cnot caring about students.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen all of our services being cut. We\u2019ve seen hundreds of workers being laid off, we\u2019re seeing a decline in the value of our education while tuition is raised, like exponentially,\u201d Rusk said. \u201cThis is supposed to be a public university. Who is the school working for?\u201d\n\nStudent workers have joined the hundreds of UC employees fighting for better wages and affordable housing. \u201cWe\u2019re here because the rent is too damn high and wages have not kept pace with inflation,\u201d said Kathryn Lybarger, president of Local 3299, which represents 21,000 UC patient care and service workers.\n\nIn 2017, Lybarger said, about half the people her union represented could afford to live near the UC campuses and medical centers. Now, about 70% of workers cannot afford to live close to UCLA. As frontline workers cry out for a living wage, some UC leaders\u2019 paychecks have surpassed seven figures. UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla, for example, received a $500,000 pay raise in April, stretching his annual salary to $1.14 million.\n\n\u201cWhen you can choose to raise one man\u2019s salary by a half million dollars and extend to all the Chancellor\u2019s the subsidized housing special that you give to all the executives, you can certainly make the decision today \u2014 right away \u2014 to raise the minimum wage for every worker at UC to $25,\u201d Lybarger said. \u201cThe difference that will make will be huge for thousands of people\u2019s families.\u201d\n\nThe University of California responded to the outrage, pointing out that leaders in 2020 negotiated 5 percent annual wage increases for AFSCME-covered employees. \u201cWe are committed to providing competitive and fair compensation to all our employees,\u201d UC leaders said in a statement. \u201cThe pay increases guaranteed in our labor contracts with AFSCME recognize the critical support role our AFSCME-covered staff contributes to operations across our campuses, health enterprise, labs, and centers of expertise.\u201d\n\nStill, workers said the UC system has not appreciated their work and previewed what would happen to the 10 campuses without them. \u201cThis campus will look like crap and it\u2019ll be really unsafe,\u201d Lybarger said. \u201cHonestly, the work that we do is fundamental, making sure that students get fed, that they\u2019re safe [and making sure] that the conditions that you all work, study and live in are clean.\u201d\n\nOther employees like Maria Martinez, an administrative clinical care partner, has devoted 21 years to UCLA. As a single mom, Martinez used to work two jobs to support her four children. Now, she\u2019s struggling to survive on her own. \u201cAfter 20 years I no longer have to support my family, [but] I still can\u2019t quit this job to make as much for myself. It\u2019s a shame,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to live in a crappy neighborhood by myself. The university needs to make more responsible choices not only with our pension money but with the way they pay workers.\u201d\n\nOn average, a gallon of gas costs L.A. County residents $4.93. That\u2019s well above the national average of $3.62, according to AAA. On top of inflation, high gas prices have hurt many UC workers who have been forced to move farther away from UC campuses. \u201cIt\u2019s driving us further and further away. I drive 40 minutes to get to work on a good day of good traffic and people commute from further than that,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to live closer to work.\n\nStruggling workers like Martinez still feel optimistic about the future. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Sometimes I think people don\u2019t care, but when you see so many people come together and actually show up it gives me hope,\u201d Martinez said.\n```"}

The extension created by JonLuca DeCaro currently has over 40,000 installations and over 9,000 weekly users over time.\n\n\u201cWebReg at USC lags significantly behind other institutions,\u201d DeCaro said. \u201cThe lack of a concept of queues or waiting lists and lack of notifications are all problems that have been solved at other universities.\u201d\n\nFor Zhang, the tool does not make much difference in improving the registration experience. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but currently it doesn\u2019t work that well,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cThe notifications for open spots were always late, and there was misinformation about classes being open.\u201d\n\nPatricia Ramos, the office manager at Marshall School of Business, said she cannot recall a time where a student could not take a required class they needed to graduate throughout her experience at the school. \u201cIt might not be the preferred section and there could be other factors, but we can get them the classes that they need,\u201d she said.\n\nFreshman business administration major Henry Hohman recently registered for classes for the upcoming fall semester, but he was not able to get all of the classes he needed. \u201cI spent a few hours Monday night trying to figure out the perfect schedule, but when it comes time to register, it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d Hohman said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when the school doesn\u2019t even give me an opportunity to take the classes I need to fulfill the requirements of my major.\u201d\n\nHohman was only able to get into two of his required classes, and a course he needed as a prerequisite was not available before his registration date.\n\nSenior global studies and economics major Kaavya Rajesh believes it can be particularly hard to register for classes at Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Of USC\u2019s academic divisions, Dornsife is both the largest and oldest school at USC with over 8,000 undergraduate students and around 900 faculty.\n\n\u201cA lot of classes just get full really fast and it becomes hard to switch around,\u201d Rajesh said. \u201cYou have a lot of electives in Dornsife, which is nice, but then you want to choose ones with good professors and times that work.\u201d\n\nSophomore psychology major Este Odegaard also tried to have upperclassmen reserve spots in required classes, but it has not always worked out. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to have seniors hold classes for me, but sometimes they don\u2019t fit their schedule either,\u201d Odegaard said. \u201cI either take a professor that has a two rating, or I just put myself on the waiting list and hope that it opens.\n\nThe Office of Academic Records and Registrar put out a statement concerning issues students have had with Web Registration saying, \u201cThere haven\u2019t been reports of system wide issues for this registration cycle, but we understand issues have come up for some students.\u201d```"}

I asked some students on campus in front of a crowd of trees in front of the village.\n\nKATE MCCAULEY: The cum trees?\n\nZACKIE MCCREE: I actually recently found out about it through reddit and I was like wait what is these cum trees, I\u2019m like okay...\n\nCJ: I cannot stand these trees. I want them to all be, like, chopped down so bad. That\u2019s basically bottom line. I hold my breath as I walk under them before I go to class.\n\nZACKIE MCCREE: Oh, cum tree season is back!\n\nThese white flowering trees dot many areas on USC\u2019s campus, leaving a light snow of petals on the ground. While they\u2019re really pretty\u2013they can be quite smelly. In fact, If you look around the web, there are tweets and posts from annoyed Angelenos who call them \u201ccum trees.\u201d They say the trees have a fishy or bleach-like smell. But of course, they have a more...scientific name.\n\nMIKE WALLICH: Yeah, those are fruitless pear trees or botanically, they\u2019re called pyrus kawakami. They\u2019re actually from Asia.\n\nThis is Mike, USC\u2019s campus arborist. He was responsible for bringing the trees to USC\u2019s campus.\n\nWALLICH: I\u2019m kind of surprised that people think that they they smell odd. I think they smelled just like pear trees. But, most people don\u2019t agree with him.\n\nIn fact there\u2019s a reason why so many Angelenos are tortured by the smell every spring. The flowers of the evergreen pear emits two chemical compounds: trimethylamine and dimethylamine. These compounds are a derivative of ammonia. And what also is coincidentally in semen? Ammonia! As a result, Angeles smell that stinky bleachy smell.\n\nBut these trees are everywhere, not just on USC\u2019s campus. But why are they so popular? Nick Arraya is a master board certified arborist from Tree Care LA, a tree maintenance company.\n\nARRAYA: A landscaper will recommend them. Then the property owner, whether that\u2019s a university or a homeowner, falls in love with the idea of those white flowers in the winter time. Landscapers will choose the trees for aesthetics, regardless of the smell.\n\nNick takes me to a huddle of trees on USC\u2019s campus in front of the Caruso Catholic Center. As cars speed past, we walk up to the snowy branches. Nick plucks a pear off...and then something surprising happens...\n\nARRAYA: I\u2019ll reach up right here. And this is a pear that I just pulled off of it. And you can see that little bit of a speckle pattern that we are all used to. Here, I\u2019ll hand it to you. You can smell it. It has like a sweet...

Now, the daughter of Indian immigrants will assume the high office April 25. Holding the hand of her running mate, Jakatdar, a junior studying political science, lit up with a smile when the results were read. Of the 4,105 ballots cast, students elected the female ticket with 38% of the vote.\n\nJakatdar\u2019s road to the most elite student leadership position on campus was no easy feat. In an interview with Annenberg Media, Jakatdar shared how a long journey to self-acceptance peeled back her passions and purpose.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely self-hate that begins when you\u2019re growing up,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cFrom my own experiences, lots of feeling like I\u2019m not doing enough with the stereotypes that are placed on me.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Silicon Valley with immigrant parents and engineers by trade, Jakatdar said she struggled to find her true north.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing was the spaces that I was interested in being a part of didn\u2019t feel like spaces that were meant for me,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cI felt that I constantly had to prove something, and I constantly felt aware of the way that I looked and the personality that I was supposed to have.\u201d\n\nThe pressure to pursue a career in STEM took a toll on Jakatdar, but she thanks her family for letting her follow her heart.\n\n\u201cMy parents really emphasized that no matter what you do \u2014 if it\u2019s something that you care about \u2014 that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to make a meaningful change,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cWe\u2019re measured by how we benefit other people.\u201d\n\nJakatdar had a lightbulb moment while serving as student body president in high school. Challenged with low attendance rates at social events, Jakatdar led a project to create a subsidy fund, so low-income students could attend prom.\n\nThat next year, the accomplished high school senior traded Northern California for a new adventure in Southern California.\n\nAn activist at heart, Jakatdar said the USG presidency never crossed her mind as the freshman struggled to find her footing on campus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a huge school. I was not so sure I was the perfect representative of the student body when I got here. I was still trying to find who I was,\u201d Jakatdar said.\n\nUSG Vice President-elect Michelle Lu, a sophomore studying business from San Jose, saw her sparkle from the start. After winning their April 2022 senate campaigns, the Bay Area natives bonded over their love for astrology. Jakatdar and Lu were born on the same day \u2014 September 27th, 2002.\n\nTheir whimsical Libra friendship strengthened into a strong working relationship during their time on the USG affordability basic needs committee.\n\n\u201cWe had that work ethic together to get stuff done \u2014 we had the relationship where she could totally tell me when I was being ridiculous and I could do the same \u2014 which is important,\u201d Jakatdar said.\n\nThe all-female ticket believed they had the knowledge and skills to enact change on campus. Neither of them expected to win.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think we were gonna win. It was a very stressful thing. If you saw me during the live stream, I was like, heaving, I was breathing extremely hard,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cA big reason that we didn\u2019t think we were gonna win was because the other candidates in the race were amazing. Everyone put their all into this and it was a very all-consuming process.\u201d\n\nOf the 21,000 undergraduate students, 4,105 casted ballots this election cycle, yielding a 20% turnout rate. It\u2019s a troubling trend the ticket hopes to reverse in their new roles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that less people voted in this election,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cWe need to bump those numbers up. A big thing we need to emphasize is that a lot of students don\u2019t know that the student government created the free Lyft program.\u201d\n\nJakadtar and Lu highlighted accomplishments from past administrations, like the free USC shuttle to LAX, creation of the annual fall break and suit-up program \u2014 an initiative that gives low-income students professional attire to compete for internships.\n\n\u201cI swear we do meaningful things [and] I understand why students might feel that way,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cWe will be getting things done and would love student input on the things that we want to do.\u201d\n\nJakatdar joins a small group of Trojans elected as USC student body president.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nBy Will Camardella April 12, 2023 at 5:23 pm PDT\n\nEntering the week, only two practices separated USC football from the spring game on Saturday. Although spring football is coming to a close, it is never too late to shake things up. In the case of the Trojans, that shake up came in the hiring of Kliff Kingsbury as a senior offensive analyst. Kingsbury, who spent the previous four years as the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals, will return to the college game for the first time since the 2018 season.\n\n\u201cWe connected a month or so ago, just to check in as friends,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cHe ended up coming into town and spending a little bit of time ... I hadn\u2019t quite landed on the right person, so I asked Kliff in passing if it\u2019s something he\u2019d be interested in and described it to him. He thought about it for a little bit, and it ended up being a great fit for both sides.\u201d\n\nKingsbury brings with him a wealth of experience coaching the offensive side of the football on both the collegiate and professional levels. Before coaching the Cardinals, he was an offensive coordinator and head coach for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. At Texas Tech, he is most well known for coaching Patrick Mahomes in college, who just won his second Super Bowl in February.\n\n\u201cThe added benefit with a guy like Kliff is a guy who\u2019s been a head coach both at this level and the professional level,\u201d Riley said. \u201cSomebody who\u2019s had to sit in that chair and make those decisions, whether it\u2019s something on gameday or it\u2019s something just through the course of a normal week, it\u2019s always great to have another opinion and an outside perspective that is not tied to one position.\u201d\n\nOver the years, there have been plenty of connections between Riley, Kingsbury and the Trojans. In fact, Kingsbury briefly held the title of USC offensive coordinator before the 2019 season, but quickly left the position to take the Arizona job. He and Riley also both played college football at Texas Tech under head coach Mike Leach. Additionally, Kingsbury drafted Kyler Murray with the first overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, whom Riley had coached at Oklahoma for two seasons.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t cross over much at Texas Tech; we\u2019ve never really worked together. He was on the way out as I was on my way in,\u201d Riley said. \u201cObviously when he went to the NFL and they drafted Kyler right away, that immediately opened up a really good line of communication. We\u2019ve probably been closer in the last few years than we had been in the early years just because of that.\u201d\n\nGiven Kingsbury\u2019s vast experience working with high-profile quarterbacks, he is expected to be the right guy to coach junior quarterback Caleb Williams. Williams will be the second Heisman winner Kingsbury has coached, as he was the offensive coordinator for Johnny Manziel at Texas A&M in 2012.\n\nWhile Riley had expected this move to happen for some time, some players were just as surprised as many fans were to hear the news.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy. I was talking to my dad, and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s real,\u2019\u201d said redshirt senior running back Austin Jones. \u201cI thought it was just some random news story that just surfaced. It\u2019s a great addition, obviously, you can\u2019t go wrong with a head coach in the NFL. It\u2019s going to be really interesting to see; I can\u2019t wait to meet him. It definitely shocked me; I thought it was fake.\u201d\n\nWhile the Kingsbury hire will help improve a unit that was already dominant a year ago, practices on the defensive end are only getting more intense. With only one week to go in spring ball, defensive coordinator Alex Grinch is making sure his players take advantage of every moment they have left. On Tuesday, the Trojan defense continued to work on tackling, pass coverage and turnover creation. Both players and coaches alike were vocal and animated over the course of each drill.\n\nPerhaps this intensity stems from the anticipation of USC\u2019s return to the Coliseum, which will be the team\u2019s first action in front of fans since a 38-27 win over Notre Dame last November. With the spring game now less than a week away, many players expressed their excitement to return to their home stadium.\n\n\u201cOther than last year, I\u2019d say we\u2019re gonna have more fans at the spring game,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a little bit more fun having the fans going hard for us. Other than that, the Coliseum is always a fun place to be in. It\u2019s a historic place, and it\u2019s awesome to be in every Saturday when we get a chance. It\u2019s gonna be awesome, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nTo get there, the Trojans will need to complete one more practice on Thursday afternoon, when they will finalize their preparation before giving their fans a preview of the 2023 season.\n```"}

Last week I wrote about the top three assistant coaches to watch for this season, but I did not expect to be writing about Kliff Kingsbury joining USC\u2019s staff as an assistant coach this year. Kingsbury was hired as an offensive analyst at USC, according to NFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero. If you remember, Kingsbury was at USC for less than two months in December 2018 when he was hired as the Trojan\u2019s offensive coordinator. However, after he started to generate head coaching buzz in the NFL, Kingsbury\u2019s relationship with the university turned sour. Former USC athletic director Lynn Swann refused to let Kingsbury interview with any NFL team, so Kingsbury resigned after not even being with the team for only a month. Kingsbury was the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals for the past four seasons. His tenure with the Cardinals included a playoff berth, but he had three losing seasons. Last year was the final straw as rumbles began to circle that his relationship with star quarterback Kyler Murray had reached a rough patch. Murray signed a 5-year $230 million extension with the Cardinals this past summer, which forced the team to stay committed to him. This decision left Kingsbury as the scapegoat. It should feel good that Kingsbury was able to work things out with the university and return to USC. Kingsbury\u2019s track record with quarterbacks is superb and features: Case Keenum, Johnny Manziel, Baker Mayfield and Patrick Mahomes. Kingsbury was the one who developed Mahomes at Texas Tech and helped him become both the 10th overall pick in the draft and the best quarterback in the NFL. Kingsbury now joins another quarterback whisperer, Lincoln Riley, as the two will help Caleb Williams on his path to another Heisman and a national championship for his team. In terms of recruiting for the future, this hire is significant. If Riley and Kingsbury walk into your living room as an offensive player, it would be nearly impossible not to want to play in their system. It should also help USC to have the voice of a former head coach in the room, as he knows and sees things that college-level coaches wouldn\u2019t realize. This is a slam dunk hire for USC, and fans should feel really good about Kingsbury joining the staff. \u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

The movie was the Oscar-winning \u201cGood Will Hunting.\u201d After it kickstarted both of their careers and set them on the path to becoming two A-list actors, 25 years later, they\u2019ve returned to write and star in another movie together. \u201cAir,\u201d directed by and featuring Affleck, tells the story of how Sonny Vaccaro, played by Damon, and Phil Knight, played by Affleck, convinced Michael Jordan to sign with Nike in 1984.\n\nWhile the audience knows the outcome of Nike\u2019s push to land Jordan, the film depicts Vaccaro desperately trying to sign the Adidas-bound future superstar. The film opens with some context for the non-sneakerheads in the audience by explaining that even though Nike was a billion dollar publicly traded company, they were the third choice shoe-sponsor for basketball players. Converse dominated the industry with the three best NBA players signed to their roster. To add insult to injury, Nike\u2019s board of directors was actively looking to shut their basketball division, effectively firing Vaccaro and his colleagues Howard White, played by Chris Tucker, and Rob Strasser, played by Jason Bateman.\n\nWe then follow Vaccaro and Strasser as they give up on signing Jordan initially, but after continuously rewinding grainy footage of MJ, Vaccaro comes to the conclusion that he must do whatever it takes to sign Jordan. From start to finish, the combination of an engaging script and top-tier actors make the movie captivating. Affleck\u2019s Phil Knight is a great depiction of the eccentric businessman and Bateman\u2019s Rob Strasser represents a sympathetic side to the often light-hearted script. Tucker is great in the film and his interactions with Damon are incredibly funny.\n\nWhile the movie as a whole is very funny, Messina, playing Jordan\u2019s agent, David Falk, almost steals the show \u2014 the entire theater could not stop laughing during a conversation between himself and Vaccaro, after Vaccaro approached Jordan\u2019s mother to meet with Nike. In addition, Viola Davis, playing Dolores Jordan, puts in one of the best performances of the movie, selling the importance of Jordan\u2019s mother in his life. Jordan also personally requested that his mother\u2019s actor be Viola Davis and that she\u2019d have a much bigger role, according to Affleck in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. Davis undoubtedly deserves award consideration for her performance.\n\nWhile Sonny Vaccaro isn\u2019t the most interesting character, Damon makes him compelling. His pitch to Jordan, combined with the montage of Jordan\u2019s career, is genuinely inspiring. His speech is one of the only times when he is genuinely serious, starkly contrasting the usual sarcastic nature. Just like in \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d Damon and Affleck\u2019s chemistry is off the charts and their characters are each other\u2019s confidants.\n\nNow how did Affleck address the 6\u20326\u2032\u2032 198 pound elephant in the room: Michael Jeffery Jordan. Notably, the film never shows Jordan\u2019s face and he only has one real speaking line. It fits the film\u2019s premises \u2014 that Michael Jordan is a larger than life figure. Since Michael Jordan is the first athlete to have his own signature shoe, he\u2019s different from all other NBA players. But what really demonstrates that Jordan is a larger-than-life figure is a quote that the characters of the film repeat at different times: \u201cA shoe is just a shoe until someone steps inside it.\u201d\n\nWhile it has strong moments and sharp humor, \u201cAir\u201d is not without its drawbacks. It lacks a real feeling of stakes since the audience knows the result of Nike\u2019s pitch. It tries to convey what is on the line through Strasser\u2019s personal life, but even upon learning about Strasser\u2019s family issues, Vaccaro doesn\u2019t undergo changes because of it. What\u2019s worse, the film\u2019s depiction of the process by which Nike landed Jordan plays fast and loose with reality. For instance, in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary \u201cSole Man,\u201d which describes the life of Sonny Vaccaro, a different story is told about how Vaccaro convinced Jordan to sign with Nike. The story goes that he and George Raveling, played by Marlon Wayans in the film, convinced Jordan to sign with Nike. In the film, we see a conversation between Vaccaro and Raveling in which Raveling tells Damon and the audience about Jordan\u2019s reluctance to meet with Nike and a funny anecdote about Martin Luther King Jr. The film\u2019s ending makes reference to the fact that Jordan credits Raveling with convincing him to sign with Nike.\n\nWhether or not this movie tells the true history of the deal, it is undeniable that the film is entertaining. Its under 2-hour runtime and the sharp script keeps the film moving. This is definitely a film to see in theaters and it will likely get a lot of Oscar buzz come next year. \u201cAir\u201d is currently playing in theaters.\n```"}

Don\u2019t worry about making a misstep in your career choice as long as you are trying to learn and totally immerse yourself in your job,\u201d Chang said in an email interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cAlso stop comparing yourself to your peers. You are gonna be on your on timeline. Just keep pushing.\u201d\n\nIn a press release, Dean Willow Bay of USC Annenberg recognized the unique perspective Chang brings to the table as a nontraditional storyteller. \u201cWith his remarkable ability to communicate across mediums and industries, David expands our world view through a fascinating exploration of food and culture,\u201d Bay said. \u201cWhile leveraging the power of storytelling, he has become a trailblazing force for connecting new ideas and traditions in kitchens and the cultures they represent.\u201d\n\nWith a diverse multimedia background, Chang has experienced everything from documentaries to podcasting to writing books and memoirs. As a television personality, Chang has produced and hosted documentaries such as Netflix\u2019s \u201cBreakfast, Lunch & Dinner\u201d and \u201cUgly Delicious.\u201d Chang also runs the Spotify podcasts \u201cThe Dave Chang Show\u201d and \u201cRecipe Club.\u201d His New York Times best-selling cookbooks \u201cMomofuku\u201d and \u201cCooking At Home\u201d along with his memoir, \u201cEat a Peach,\u201d add to his varied media portfolio.\n\nWith his trailblazing approach in combining storytelling with the culinary arts, Chang continues to push the boundaries of media and representation through the unique medium of food. \u201cTake time to explore what exactly is \u2018your voice\u2019 the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities that interest you and only you. You want to make sure that what you\u2019re communicating isn\u2019t the same as anyone else\u2019s,\u201d Chang said.\n\nHaving grown up in suburban Washington, D.C. as the son of North Korean immigrant parents, Chang initially majored in religious studies, but ended up pursuing his passions in the International Culinary Center\u2019s Classic Culinary Arts program after graduating from college. There, he interacted with legendary chefs and perfected combining a classic European culinary training with the art of soba making to produce his own noodle dish. He opened his first restaurant in 2004, kicking off his culinary franchise.\n\nPrevious commencement speakers have included figures such as talk show host and producer Oprah Winfrey, former first lady of California Maria Shriver, sport-marketing businessman and media personality Maverick Carter and most recently, ABC News\u2019 senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott.\n\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from David Chang, obtained by Annenberg Media April 12.\n```"}

During the height of the pandemic, she and another colleague at NBCLA put together an online social media memorial for victims of COVID-19. The goal of this online memorial was to give the victim\u2019s family members a space to mourn and honor their memory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to reach out to people when they are grieving ... a lot of times they want somebody to hear their story and validate them and too even though it\u2019s scary sometimes to reach out across genders and across races,\u201d she said. \u201cAll people got to have their place on our page.\u201d\n\nUpcoming New York Times Styles fellow Frank Rojas also spoke about overcoming challenges during the pandemic and the importance of connecting with communities despite restrictions in the past. Rojas said \u201cshowing faith\u201d during challenges and finding stories and people to talk to has also helped him.\n\n\u201cWhat helps me too is being Latino and using that as the language and building camaraderie through that and culture and community,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I built that network that made it so much easier.\u201d\n\nNavarro and Rojas both urged students to continue to think outside of the box when it comes to journalistic pursuits to distinguish themselves by asking nuanced questions and persisting in their reporting.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really going to cut through it all is if you have a totally different take on the story than everybody else and that also just comes from listening to people too,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nSkyler Pak, who is majoring in communication at USC Annenberg as well as philosophy, politics and economics at USC Dornsife, helped organize the event with ACCSA.

The Arts and Climate Collective (ACC) aimed to answer this question at its \u201cImagining a Fossil-Free L.A.\u201d festival in Founder\u2019s Park on Tuesday. The typically serene space on campus was filled with students stopping by to hear from organizations unified by a common goal: to raise awareness about climate justice and inspire action toward a fossil-free city.\n\nThe free Earth Month event featured conversations with activists, food tastings with many vegan options, live music and a resource fair connecting students to local organizations. Student artwork, films and projects surrounding environmental justice facilitated a dynamic spirit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s especially important for our generation to have events like this,\u201d said Gwenan Walker, a sophomore animation student from Virginia.

In a one-on-one interview with Annenberg Media, he shared about his time covering China and his thoughts on the media coverage of the country today.\n\nChinoy has a long-standing relationship with China. He first went to the country as a student in 1973, but he later went on to spend the next eight years in the country working for CBS News, then NBC News in Hong Kong before joining CNN in 1983, where he spent the next 24 years working as a foreign correspondent for the network in different countries. At CNN, he was the network\u2019s first China bureau chief, covering important stories such as the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Chinoy now works as a non-resident senior fellow at the USC U.S-China Institute.\n\nWhat was your experience like working in China during those eight years?\n\nI was in China for an extremely interesting period, which was marked most dramatically by the crisis in Tiananmen Square in 1989. It was a period when there was a lot of intellectual and political ferment and debate about China\u2019s future path. It was [also] a time before the June 4 crackdown, people advocating political reform to some degree were quite influential. And after the crackdown, the political reformers were sidelined. But by early 1990, Deng Xiaoping had revived this program of economic reform. [By] the last three or four years, I was in China [I witnessed the] early stages of the China boom. I was able to witness a kind of interesting mixture of China pulling further away from the excesses and extremism of the Mao years and then the Tiananmen Crisis, which led to a bloody Chinese army crackdown on student protesters who wanted faster reforms, and then the revival of economic reforms, which really began to dramatically change the Chinese landscape in the 1990s and afterward.\n\nWhat\u2019s your most memorable memory out of your eight years stationed in China?\n\nThe story that I\u2019m most well known for is the Tiananmen Square crisis in 1989. On the night of June 3 and 4, the People\u2019s Liberation Army was ordered into Beijing to clear the streets after weeks and weeks of protest. That was kind of in the pre-cellphone era, [and] there was no way to transmit video from Beijing because Beijing was under martial law. On the night of the crackdown, I was on the balcony of the Beijing Hotel. I could see down [from the] top end of the square, and we kept the phone line open for hours and hours and hours to CNN headquarters. I was essentially narrating what I was seeing, and then there were camera crews and producers over in the square, they would periodically bring their videotapes back to where I was, the CNN workspace in the Great Wall Hotel. We had a new machine that will allow you to transmit a frame of video as a still image over a phone line. It took close to an hour to do that. The next morning, a student intern went out to [the] Beijing airport and found somebody who was flying to Hong Kong and they took the videotapes to Hong Kong and gave the tapes to a CNN colleague in Hong Kong. From Hong Kong, they could book a satellite transmission. And so it was several hours after the videos had been taken before they were actually broadcast. It just gives you a sense of how complex and how primitive it was.\n\nCan you provide a breakdown of how foreign correspondents covered China from before the 70s to now?\n\nIn my book \u201cAssignment China,\u201d which is the history of American journalists, there is a kind of an arc to the story because it begins with American journalists having to leave China when the communist party took power in 1949 and then for almost 30 years, most American news coverage of China was done outside mainland China, especially from Hong Kong. And then you had several decades where China became more and more open. But in the last few years, that trend has been reversed. China now is much less welcoming and accessible to American journalists, and more and more journalists today are being forced to cover China from outside China. So it\u2019s as if the story has come full circle and we\u2019re not quite but almost back to where we were before China opened up in terms of the vast majority of American and other Western journalists covering China from outside of China, rather than being able to be there and see it for themselves.\n\nWhat is the disadvantage of not being physically there?\n\nThe most important thing for journalists is for the journalists to be able to witness for themselves what is happening and then tell their listeners or viewers or readers what they saw and what\u2019s going on. And without that, it becomes very difficult to really get an accurate picture of what\u2019s happening in China. There are various tools and techniques that journalists in the old days used, so-called China watchers. [Is a] technique involved studying articles in the Chinese press or transcripts of Chinese radio broadcasts to see what lessons you could learn about what was going on. And there you have a kind of modern-day version of this old-style China watching where journalists are again studying the Chinese press, but they\u2019re also using Chinese Internet, and Chinese social media posts to monitor what\u2019s going on. And they\u2019re also using tools like commercially available satellite imagery. But it\u2019s not the same thing as being there on the ground [to] see for yourself. It worries me a lot because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting a complete picture of China as we need to give the country importance.\n\nIn the early part of your documentary, it says that American journalists in the 1960s and 1970s had a hard time reporting accurate images of China because of the influence of McCarthyism. A similar thing is happening in Capitol Hill right now with the intense Chinese-American relationship. Do you think that has an impact on the media coverage today in China?\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly the same thing as the McCarthy period. But I would say that certainly the prevailing political climate in China is one of great hostility, and you see members of Congress trying to outdo each other to show how tough they are on China. But, I would be careful about characterizing this in terms of journalism, because this is not a case where journalists are permitted or not permitted to cover what\u2019s going on and I think that the American media system doesn\u2019t work that way. I think a couple of things are a couple of factors here. One is that the tensions between the US and China are central to the political climate in the United States and so journalists have to cover that. It is a legitimate story and I think most serious journalists try to cover it. But one of the problems is that because the Chinese Communist Party has expelled so many journalists, limited visa access for so many journalists. You [see] this combination of a much smaller number of journalists in China who are not able to convey a broader, more complex, more nuanced picture of China as a society, primarily because the Chinese government won\u2019t allow more of them to come. The ones that are face all sorts of difficulties and restrictions at the same time that in Washington the atmosphere is very hostile to China. So a lot of the politicians and other people that journalists would be interviewing are saying highly critical things. I think nobody in The New York Times or at CNN is saying to a journalist, \u201cYou have to be negative about China,\u201d but the negative atmosphere is reflected in the coverage because access in China is so limited, that\u2019s not balanced by a more nuanced portrayal that shows some of the complexities and realities of Chinese society, because journalists can\u2019t go. So together, the net effect is to create an impression in the American press of a much more one-dimensional picture of China that is highly critical.\n\nStudents in USC who don\u2019t have an experience like you reported in China live in China. How do you recommend they understand the media coverage today in China?\n\nI think it\u2019s very important for people who care about this issue to become sophisticated and critical consumers of news. Most people who are not in the media don\u2019t really have any idea of what journalists actually do. In [my book] \u201cAssignment China,\u201d you have well over a hundred journalists who have covered China for the American media [for] nearly 80 years [to] talking about how they did that. Educating yourself about how journalists actually do their jobs is important. [It means] when you read the news or watch the news, not just passively looking at it and having an emotional reaction. It means when you read an article, you look at who wrote it and then Google them to see what they do. You look at where the byline is, in D.C. or in China or in Beijing or in Seoul. You break down who they speak with and you look at the quotes that they use. It involves really engaging yourself with the news in a different kind of way. If you can do that, you\u2019ll have a much more sophisticated understanding of what\u2019s actually happening.\n\nChinoy\u2019s book is out and available for purchase here.\n```"}

Memes about the breakup flooded Twitter as fans mourned Swift\u2019s relationship. \u201cMake sure to check in on your swiftie friends this evening,\u201d Twitter user @nextlevelsteph posted to her feed.\n\nFor senior Maura Ende, the president of the Swift Society at USC, the breakup heavily impacted her, though Ende admits that break-ups are common occurrences. \u201cHonestly, I could say that I\u2019ve given up on love because of this breakup, but that\u2019s not true \u2014 they are just human beings, and people go through breakups,\u201d Ende said. \u201cIt does make me sad that she has to go through this and I love her and her music because they convey feelings and emotions in a way I\u2019ve never heard articulated before,\u201d adding that these things just happen.\n\nEnde also pointed out that Swift breaking up with her long-time boyfriend would fuel the notoriously sexist comments Swift has faced throughout her career. \u201cI am terrified that Taylor\u2019s singleness will resurrect the classic misogynistic discourse surrounding her love life in the past,\u201d Ende said. \u201cOnce again, her love life will be put under a microscope, despite her tendency to keep her personal life private over the past six and some years.\u201d\n\nSome fans were in denial that the longest-running relationship of the singer\u2019s career had come to an end, while others searched for evidence to prove the reports to be true. One popular theory was that Swift confirmed the breakup recently while on her Eras Tour, as she chose to perform \u201cthe 1,\u201d a song about regrets with an ex-partner, in place of performing \u201cinvisible string,\u201d a song Swifties claim is about Alwyn.\n\nWhile social media continues to flood with a discussion about Swift and Alwyn\u2019s ending, knowledge of the situation varies from person to person on USC\u2019s campus. \u201cI actually haven\u2019t heard about Taylor Swift\u2019s breakup yet,\u201d said Cyrus Booth, a freshman economics major from Connecticut. \u201cI guess this is how I\u2019m finding out.\u201d\n\nDespite not having much knowledge about the situation, Booth understood the attention surrounding it. \u201cI think that there are definitely some people who will find this newsworthy,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t really care for or pay attention to the love lives of celebrities.\u201d\n\nTyler Kokes, a freshman political science major from Dallas, echoed Booth. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything about it because I don\u2019t really follow celebrity news,\u201d Kokes said. Though far from being \u201cSwifties,\u201d Booth and Kokes both noticed a musical opportunity behind the breakup. \u201cI know that she has a lot of breakup songs already, so I feel like this will only add to that,\u201d said Booth. \u201cOverall, it sort of gives her more content to work with.\u201d\n\nKokes shared similar thoughts: \u201cShe\u2019ll use the breakup as inspiration for new music, which her fans will love.\u201d\n\nSara Gordon, a sophomore communication major from New York City and a Swiftie herself, has already been mourning the breakup. \u201cI found out about [the breakup] through TikTok,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think that people think that this is newsworthy given that her and her boyfriend dated for six years, which I think is the longest that Taylor Swift has ever publicly dated someone.\u201d\n\nGordon brought up the interesting point of the breakup occurring amidst Swift\u2019s popular Eras Tour, and the effect that it could have on her performances. \u201cI think that this news will honestly benefit her because her fans will show up to her concerts in a way that they haven\u2019t before,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Eras Tour is huge, and the fact that she\u2019s fresh off of a breakup will fuel her fans as well as her performances.\u201d\n\nFans have mourned the breakup by laying flowers at Swift\u2019s old home address in New York City on Cornelia Street. Swift has not publicly responded to the news.\n```"}

(Photo by Steven Cornfield/Unsplash)\n\nBy Veronique Louis-Jacques April 11, 2023 at 6:16 pm PDT\n\nUSC Student Health officially announced today that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be a requirement for students as of May 19, amongst other COVID-19 updates that signal the end of the pandemic. Students were previously notified of the expected removal of the university\u2019s vaccine mandate when Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman made a statement in a briefing with the Daily Trojan last month.\n\nBut in an email sent out on April 11, USC Student Health notified the university that COVID-19 vaccines will not be mandated for the incoming class, with the university changing the vaccine policy from required to \u201cstrongly recommended.\u201d This change only applies to students seeking non-health degrees. Healthcare workers, Keck Medicine faculty and staff, as well as students with health profession degrees will be updated through their school or department.\n\nGrace Love, a freshman majoring in chemistry, wasn\u2019t too concerned about this update, as she believed it wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. \u201cBecause everyone here is mostly vaccinated, lifting that restriction doesn\u2019t seem to be too big of a deal because it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a majority of the population that (is) going to be unvaccinated,\u201d Love said.\n\nWill Stewart, a junior majoring in computer science, said COVID-19 hadn\u2019t been at the forefront of his mind throughout this semester, only wearing a mask when someone was sick, but expressed how the removal of the vaccine requirement gave him something to consider. \u201cI think the only thing really is that it makes me a little more aware of when I\u2019m sick or when my friend is sick with something else, and not going to class or wearing a mask,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nUSC Student Health also announced the closing of testing tents on both the HSC and UPC Campus, but students will still be able to pick up free antigen test kits at USC bookstores, Engemann and Eric Cohen student health centers, and from the CSC desks in USC Housing.\n\nAs of April 1, students are not required to have a negative antigen test to leave isolation after their 5 day and students are now allowed to leave isolation if they have not had a fever within 24 hours and their symptoms have alleviated.\n\nAleeah Flowers, a senior majoring in intelligence and cyber operations, expressed her relief at the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little tough with classes and some restrictions, but I feel like USC made it quite easy to still attend classes with those restrictions,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cI am glad that they are finally leaving us because it was a bit of a hassle, but not anything too crazy.\u201d\n\nThese changes come after Los Angeles County ended the emergency declaration of COVID-19 on March 31, as many restrictions continue to be alleviated. As of April 3, California healthcare workers and those in other high-risk indoor settings are not required to wear a mask, according to the California Department of Public Health.\n\nAmidst these updates, USC Student Health took the opportunity to highlight the efforts that have been made throughout the past three years of the pandemic. \u201cWe could not imagine at the time how hard this would be, how much it would take, and yet many at the university contributed with what seemed to be superhuman effort, putting forward our best selves to help our community when it needed us the most,\u201d Van Orman said.\n```"}

It\u2019s unfortunately in the news a lot these days. A new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation reveals that experiences with gun-related incidents are increasingly common among U.S. adults. Irene Kim breaks down the key findings.\n\nYesterday, five people were killed in Louisville, Kentucky. Two weeks ago, six were killed in Nashville, Tennessee. The weapon used in both tragedies was a gun. A study published this morning by the Kaiser Family Foundation unveils shocking statistics about Americans\u2019 experiences with gun violence.\n\nThe group of researchers behind the study found that about one in five U.S. adults have been threatened with a gun and about the same number have actually witnessed someone being shot. One in five also say a family member was killed by a gun, including incidences of suicide.\n\nThe study also unveils that gun violence doesn\u2019t affect all Americans equally - gun-related injuries and deaths, as well as worries about gun violence, disproportionately affect people of color. For example, one in five Black and Hispanic adults report feeling like gun-related crimes, deaths and injuries are a constant threat to their local community. That\u2019s more than double the share of white people who feel the same.\n\nBlack adults are also twice as likely to witness someone being shot and to have a family member killed by a gun. Three in ten Black adults have witnessed someone being shot. That\u2019s over 13 million Americans who have personally witnessed a shooting.\n\nGun violence in the U.S. is a controversial, and often a partisan issue. But this study found that the prevalence of gun violence is actually causing people to alter their lifestyles. About a third of adults have avoided large crowds to protect themselves or their families. More than eight in ten adults have taken at least one precaution to protect themselves or their families from the possibility of gun violence.\n\nAs a response to the increase of mass shootings, President Biden is calling on Republicans in Congress to enact stricter gun control as he is \u201cpowerless to do anything more\u201d on his own. Neither members of the Kentucky congressional delegation have made pronouncements on gun reforms.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Irene Kim.\n```"}

Maya Gomes has more with the story.\n\nCalifornia State Senate Bill SB10 is making its way to Sacramento. The bill, brought forward by state senator Dave Cortese is nicknamed Melanie\u2019s Law and aims to expand statewide fentanyl overdose prevention for high school students and children. The law is named after 15-year-old Melanie Ramos, who died of a fentanyl overdose at Bernstein high school in Hollywood last September.\n\nIn a press conference today outside LAUSD headquarters, Melanie\u2019s mother Elena Perez announced she will testify on the bill\u2019s behalf in Sacramento, and reflected on the loss of her daughter.\n\nPEREZ: [TRANSLATED] It is a great pain, and each day my pain for Melanie grows. I do not want any family to go through what I am going through, and with this new law, many kids are going to be saved. It is going to be something for the kids.\n\nPart of the changes proposed by SB10 includes providing NARCAN to all public schools, as well as providing treatment prevention for opioid overdoses. It will also provide education on the dangers and prevalence of fentanyl to students, their parents, and school faculty.\n\nPerez\u2019s lawyer, Michael Carrillo spoke on the importance and impact of SB10 at the press conference.\n\nCARRILLO: What we haven\u2019t seen is any announcements from the L.A. Unified School District to Elena saying that we will act, we will protect future kids so that families do not have to suffer like Elena is suffering ... But now the state senator through SB ten will enact those changes which will force the district to take immediate action, will force the district to do something to protect kids.\n\nAs for Perez, the loss of her daughter has left an unfillable void in her life. She remembers her daughter as a wonderful person with big dreams for the future.\n\nPEREZ: [TRANSLATED] She had a lot of desire to study. She was always very happy, and she had dreams. She had a dream of going to the army ... She was a very very pretty girl, very beautiful, with a good heart. Very noble, and all the people that were in her periphery knew how my girl was.\n\nWhile her pain will never fade, Perez hopes that Melanie\u2019s Law will ensure no other families encounter the same.\n\nPEREZ: [TRANSLATED] It\u2019s for my girl because no one did anything for her. If she had been here, if she were with me ... if they had paid more attention at school, we would not be here, and I hope no other parent has to go through what I am going through. That no parent lives with the pain that I am living with because it is forever. No one or nothing will bring back my daughter.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Maya Gomes.\n```"}

There was a food truck, free merch, and bustling conversations about the political future of America. Irene Kim has more with the story.\n\nWith the recent arraignment of former President Donald Trump last week, our political future is changing. As the 2024 presidential election approaches, student organizations gave their insight on the topic at USC\u2019s Annual Political Fest today in Alumni Park.\n\nA member of the USC GOP, David Fuentes, a third year undergraduate student, believes that the former President\u2019s arraignment is being used as a tool more than a fight for justice.\n\nFUENTES: Many of our members do think this that this whole the indictment, the arrest was all very, very politically motivated. It wasn\u2019t so much as a sense of promoting justice and equality. It was more of just promoting Democrats this to maintain the presidency with Biden, of course...but i think right now, regardless of whose in power, whether were Republicans or Democrats, it\u2019s just a bunch of fighting within Congress, a lot of division between the two sides.\n\nOn the other side, James Aranguren, the communications director of the Trojan Democrats, is hesitant to whether or not Trump\u2019s arraignment will actually lead to change.\n\nThe problem is bigger than just one arrest. JAMES: We have seen countless times in the past where powerful people get to avoid jail time or avoid consequences for their illegal actions simply because they are powerful and. What is most concerning is. How our country treats legal abuses.\n\nAranguren thinks there\u2019s more that needs to be addressed in this country.\n\nJAMES: Donald Trump isn\u2019t the problem in this country. I think he\u2019s emblematic of a lot of problems, but he isn\u2019t the problem. If Donald Trump loses in 2024, it doesn\u2019t do anything about income inequality. It doesn\u2019t automatically do anything about racial justice. It doesn\u2019t automatically do anything to protect the LGBT community. It doesn\u2019t automatically mean that things are going to get better on any of those fronts if Donald Trump loses.\n\nClearly, there\u2019s heavy discourse on what this arraignment will mean for his 2024 campaign. In fact, graduate student and worker at the Center for the Political Future, Gabriel Romero predicts that the arraignment reveals more about the importance of abiding the law.\n\nGABRIEL: This indictment proves that, you know, like truly, like in the eyes of our legal system, no one is above the law. No one is is higher than, you know, higher in value or importance than anyone else. Everyone is equal under the eyes of the law.\n\nFor a deeper dive into this topic and many others, join the Political Student Assembly next Tuesday from 5:00 to 7:00 pm at Tommy\u2019s Place for the Spring 2023 Student Debate.\n\nFrom Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Irene Kim.\n```"}

Many USC students share the common experience of being approached by followers of the church as Logan Drone reports.\n\nI was skating in the village one evening with my noise cancelling headphones on when I saw a hand flash in front of my face. It felt like someone was telling me to \u201cTalk to the Hand\u201d. As I abruptly stopped, the person asked \u201cAre you a follower of Christ?\u201d And I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s been asked that.\n\nA recent Bible study group has taken campus by storm, approaching people in the village as they eat, study, or even chat with friends. For context, the group approached me three separate times in the past two weeks asking if I believe in the Bible. So, I decided to look into this.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Allan Ramos, a member and promoter of the Bible Study group, who spoke about his approach in getting students to join the Bible Study:\n\nRAMOS: I usually tell people, Hey, I know this is very random and I know I\u2019m a complete stranger, but a couple of years ago, God really did change my life in a very realistic way. So I wanted to see if by any chance you as an individual would ever issue something like this. And if if they say no, I try to give them maybe one to three reasons why it\u2019s worth their time and if they still aren\u2019t interested. All right. Have a good day.\n\nWhile that may sound innocent, some students have expressed concerns when Bible Study people approach them, often claiming their privacy was evaded or that they simply did not want to be bothered. In turn, the success rate of students attending Bible study is fairly low, according to Zachariah Simons, another member of the Bible Study group.\n\nSIMONS: I\u2019ve gotten two people who said that they want to do Bible studies today. So probably ask like 40, 50 people. So whatever that ratio is probably at least... less than 50%.\n\nFor those who agree to the Bible Study, buckle up. Prepare for plenty of texts regarding Bible study daily --- just ask me, I received six text messages asking to join for Bible Study over a two-week span. Too bad I already read the Bible on a regular basis!\n\nThe intention behind Bible Study is certainly there. Bryce Pablich spoke on what he tries to convey when approaching students about the Bible.\n\nPABLICH: You ask ten people, Hey, what is God? What do you think God is? They\u2019re all going to give you different answers. So we want to say, what does the Bible say about God and that\u2019s what we like to introduce to people.\n\nBible Study is in session regularly in the village. If you see a group of people talking about the Bible, feel free to approach them and ask to join, even if they politely decline at first request!\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Logan Drone.\n```"}

USC observes AAPI month in April instead of May, to avoid the conflicts of finals season and commencement. To commemorate the immigration of the first Japanese to the States on May 7, 1843, and to mark the anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad\u2014the majority of the workers who laid the tracks were Chinese immigrants\u2014 on May 10, 1869, the Congress had chosen the month of May to celebrate and pay tribute to the community.\n\nAPIFSA was formed two years ago following the shooting in Atlanta that targeted spas as the rate and an overall rise of Asian American hate crimes. APIFSA provides a safe space with resources for the AAPI faculty and staff on campus. According to Glenn Osaki, the Senior Advisor to the President of International Communications and Marketing, is one of the staff members from the Asian Pacific Islander Faculty and Staff Association (APIFSA) the university celebrating it in the month of April shows its commitment because nationally it\u2019s celebrated in May, said Osaki. \u201cBut here at USC, we do it in April to ensure that our students, our staff and faculty have a full month, because with commencement in the middle of the month, we really would lose out on that opportunity.\u201d\n\nMore than 24% of undergraduates and 16% of graduates identify as Asian, USC President Carol Folt said at the event. Having events like this increases Asian visibility on campus while celebrating their culture and history. From various dance performances, Trogons A Capella to a Band Kori performance, this event highlighted unity in the Asian diaspora. The smiles on the faces upon making lanterns and getting free boba represented a community coming together in a day of celebration.\n\nGrace Zhang, a junior, majoring in American studies and ethnicities, attended the event in support of the AAPI community. \u201cI think it\u2019s important because I feel like a lot of times people don\u2019t recognize just how diverse the diaspora is,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cI think these events are a good space for people to come together and learn about other people\u2019s cultures that they may have not grown up knowing.\u201d\n\nComing off of USC having 10 former Trojans receiving Oscar nominations and Trojan Ke Huy Quan receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this event was a celebration of the Trojan family and AAPI achievements and visibility. Runyi Li, a graduate student majoring in PR and advertising, found the celebration a success as he was happy to see minorities receive recognition. \u201cNo matter what ethnic background you are from, you should be proud of it and who you are,\u201d said Li. \u201cAs a part of the API community, I feel like we need more representation. Li was happy to see Asian Americans represented on a big stage when the film Everything Everywhere All at Once received high praise at the Oscars. \u201cIt\u2019s great timing since Everything Everywhere All at Once just got an Oscar nomination and just won the award, so I think it is a great time to recall to get more people\u2019s attention,\u201d said Li.\n\nAPIFSA will continue to have events to honor and celebrate AAPI heritage month throughout April.

Whenever I allow my curiosity to get the best of me, I see comments saying Megan Thee Stallion deserved to be shot, Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union are bad parents for loving and supporting their child and Meghan Markle needs to shut up and be grateful that she married \u201cup.\u201d These comments are all examples of misogynoir, a term coined in 2010 by Northwestern University professor, activist and author Moya Bailey. This word is used to describe misogyny directed at Black women specifically.\n\nYou have probably grown up seeing examples of misogynoir your entire life \u2014 the treatment of Venus and Serena Williams, the commentary on First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s appearance and the treatment of the most recent Big Brother US winner, Taylor Hale. \u201cSwarm\u201d is a recently released Amazon Prime show created by Donald Glover. The horror/thriller series follows a young Black woman\u2019s obsession with her favorite pop star, another Black woman, and how her fandom leads her down a murderous path.\n\nWhile interviewing Bailey, we discussed the prevalence of misogynoir in American society and how Black women are regularly forced to endure misogynistic attacks at the hands of mainstream media. \u201cMisogynoir was on full display,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThe actress is amazing, but the way she\u2019s made to be grotesque and a monster, someone irredeemable and somebody so delusional and unwell, it makes it hard for the audience to have empathy for her. The depiction of her and the way other Black women were portrayed was frustrating, and the colorism that gets displayed throughout the show reinforces misogyny more in terms of how people think of who is a worthwhile hero and victim and who they don\u2019t have empathy or care for.\u201d\n\nLike many, Bailey became engulfed in Black Twitter as everyone had something to say about this show. Some Twitter users celebrated the quality of the writing and the impeccable acting, while others were triggered by the limited series\u2019 social commentary about Black women. Nylah Burton, also known as Twitter user @yumcoconutmilk, a Chicago-based writer who has been featured in Vogue, Travel Leisure, Sweet July Magazine and more, posted a snippet of Glover\u2019s interview with Vulture, in which he said that he told the lead actress, Dominique Fishback, to \u201cthink of [her character] more like an animal and less like a person,\u201d and later stating that when creating her character he thought about his fear of dogs.\n\nIn a tweet about the show, Burton posed the question, \u201cIn a world where Black men are misogynistic towards Black women and our interests (including Beyonce) and white women use putting Beyonce down to signal a deeper hostility towards Black people, who does it serve to have a serial killer attacking mostly Black men and white women just because they don\u2019t like Beyonce? What stereotypes is that already reinforcing?\u201d and later wrote an article about it for Vox titled, \u201cSwarm isn\u2019t a love letter to Black women. It\u2019s hate mail.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cSwarm\u201d being one of many examples of misogynoir celebrated without any internal commentary on the treatment and demonization of Black women, Bailey emphasizes the importance of taking care of oneself mentally in the face of discourse and understands the exhaustion that comes with expressing these issues with those who aren\u2019t on the receiving end. \u201cI feel like people who experience misogyny should do whatever they need to protect themselves,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you feel confident and want to engage and try and have those conversations with people, but you shouldn\u2019t feel like you have to do it to your detriment. For people who are unwilling to hear, I think storytelling is powerful. I think narrative is one of a few ways to get people to have different perspectives.\u201d\n\nBailey has spent her career not only studying misogynoir but calling out the neglect of Black women in conversations about misogyny. She wrote a book detailing the history of misogynoir in the digital sphere called \u201cMisogynoir Transformed: Black Women\u2019s Digital Resistance.\u201d In her book, Bailey breaks down the presence and effects of misogynoir in the American healthcare system as well as Black women\u2019s experience with policing, politics and the feminist movement. She calls her research method a \u201charm reduction practice,\u201d but don\u2019t take that to mean it isn\u2019t confrontational. Her method does something that pop culture often fails to do when addressing Black women\u2019s realities: It acknowledges our existence\u2019s complexities.\n\nShe accomplishes this by demonstrating awareness when collecting her data by noting that no group or community is a monolith. \u201cI want community partners to feel like they can ask questions or get their questions answered in relation to the research,\u201d Bailey said. That\u2019s how I think of harm reduction. What I think of as confrontational is more traditional research that doesn\u2019t always consider the needs of the community itself when trying to get what it wants from the community.\u201d\n\nShe discussed her research methods on March 28 at a USC event called Transforming Misogynoir: A Conversation with Moya Bailey and A.E. Stevenson. The event began with a conversation about digital alchemy, which Bailey described during an interview with The Digital Democracies Institute as a practice that \u201ctransforms everyday digital media into valuable social justice media that recodes the failed scripts that negatively impact their lives.\u201d\n\nSimilar to Burton\u2019s tweets about \u201cSwarm,\u201d digital alchemy can spread insight and be used to protest misogynoir. Other examples include the uproar on Twitter after the murder of Breonna Taylor and the anger regarding the initial silence surrounding the shooting; hashtags that have gone on to inspire societal changes, such as #muterkelly, coined by Oronike Odeleye and Tisha Barnes, and #metoo, coined by Tarana Burke, and #oscarssowhite, which April Reign coined\u2013all of whom are Black women.\n\nI asked Bailey about the changes communicators can make to combat misogynoir. Her first suggestion: create space. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for accomplices to make sure that they\u2019re learning from and reading the work of Black feminist scholars. Are there Black feminist scholars integrated into the syllabi? You can start to make sure that the next generation of strategists and communication specialists have that history and knowledge,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI want a world where communication specialists feel like it matters to advocate for those who are marginalized in whatever way they can.\u201d\n\nAnd while an academic education can significantly contribute to learning how to practice awareness, Bailey notes the impact of intentionally building awareness outside the classroom. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that there\u2019s a certain set of skills that you need to learn to be effective on a job, but none of that includes rocking the boat or challenging the system as it exists,\" Bailey said.\n\nA scholar first, Bailey shouts out The Salt Eater Bookstore in Inglewood, where she was shopping before our interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an independent, Black-owned bookstore. They have a Black feminist tool kit. It\u2019s a shelf of books you should have,\u201d Bailey said.\n\nSo how can we participate in digital alchemy? How can we fight back against the constant dehumanization of Black women? By joining digital alchemists like Moya Bailey, Nylah Burton, Zahira Cebrera, Angelica Bastien, Noella Williams, Shannen Dee Williams, Njera Perkins, Letisha Engracia Cardoso Brown, Ezinne Ofoegbu and Leslie Ekpe; all of whom have taken to Twitter to call out misogynoir and demand better the treatment of Black women.\n\nFor more information on Professor Moya Bailey, follow her on Twitter at @moyazb, Instagram @transformisogynoir, or her website: www.moyabailey.com.\n```"}

And as she herself started training on the USC campus after being invited to run at the Trojan Invitational, Felix also remembers falling down on that same track, collapsing into her brother Wes\u2019 arms as she crossed the finish line during an 800-meter final \u2013 a distance that she, a sprinter, wasn\u2019t used to running. That was nearly 20 years ago.\n\nNow, Felix stands tall before the field, speaking to a crowd of several hundred people at the unveiling of the newly renamed Allyson Felix Field. The ceremony was marked by speeches, a musical performance by the Trojan Marching Band and a ceremonial unveiling of the new field name on Monday morning.\n\nTaking the stage, Felix remarked that having the field renamed on her behalf was a \u201cfull circle moment,\u201d recalling the challenge she once associated with the track. \u201cI crossed the finish line, and there was Wes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe ended up having to hold me up. Every time I walk onto this track, on this field, that moment always comes to my mind. I\u2019m grateful to be past that. That was at the beginning of my journey. And to be here today, I never would have imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt honestly means the world to me. This is so much more than I could have ever dreamt of,\u201d Felix added.\n\nOther speakers at the event included university president Carol L. Folt, who highlighted Felix\u2019s tremendous achievements both on and off the track. She emphasized the tenacity behind Felix\u2019s hefty career, including the runner\u2019s 11 Olympic medals and 20 World Championship medals. \u201cYou can pick any one of those medals,\u201d Folt said, \u201cand I bet there is a story behind it of triumph, grit, pain and grace.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, USC athletic director Mike Bohn added that renaming the field helped not only Felix herself, but other Trojans go the distance. \u201cThe naming of this field is not just to honor Allyson, but to inspire Trojans to achieve beyond the ordinary, to be a champion on and off the field, to stand for what is right with confidence and grace and so much more,\u201d Bohn said.\n\nAs a member of the Trojan family, Felix graduated from the USC Rossier School of Education in 2008 with a degree in elementary education. While she followed in her brother\u2019s footsteps \u2014 who sprinted for the school from 2002-2005 \u2014 and attended USC for her education, it\u2019s clear that Felix ran a path of her own.\n\nFelix, a homegrown Angeleno, was already a professional athlete by the time she stepped foot on USC\u2019s campus. Making her Olympic debut at just 18 years old in 2004 and solidifying her as the youngest athlete on the U.S. track and field team at the time, she took home her first medal when she secured silver in the 200-meter dash in Athens, Greece.\n\nAfter an impressive Olympic career, which includes seven Olympic gold medals \u2014 the highest of any female track and field athlete \u2014 Felix retired in 2022 following her final World Championship race. The year not only marked her retirement, but also when she was awarded with an honorary doctorate from USC following her commencement address speech to the class of 2022.\n\nWith such a history behind her, Felix stood with her back towards the field she had once walked past time and time again at USC, speaking on the impact of legacy. \u201cThere is a quote that I love by Beverly Sills, and it says: \u2018Legacy can be defined as planting trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.\u2019 When I think about that quote, it\u2019s really about leaving something behind that other generations can benefit from,\u201d Felix said.\n\nAccording to Rae-Anne Serville, a junior health and human sciences major and 400-meter dash athlete, Felix is a role model of balance and composure for other young female athletes. \u201cShe sets an example for athletes\u2019 potential to also manage common life in the midst of a successful athletic career, and she boosts our confidence in dealing with life after school due to her thriving business endeavors,\u201d Serville said at the event, referring to Felix\u2019s successful footwear company, Saysh. \u201cShe also spreads a message of empowerment and her fights for women\u2019s rights, not only within the sport of track and field, but in all instances.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Folt reinforced that the field represents a space for all students, varsity athlete or not. It acts as a recreational space for active Trojans, students in the Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps and the famed Trojan Marching Band. \u201cAllyson Felix Field is a place of joy,\u201d she said.\n\nThe field was previously named after Dean Cromwell, an anti-Semitic track and field coach who played a role in the removal of two Jewish athletes from the U.S. relay team during the 1936 Olympics, which were held in Nazi Germany. Cromwell, who served as USC\u2019s track and field coach for nearly 40 years, allegedly called Black athletes \u201cprimitive,\u201d according to an article by the L.A. Times.\n\nJulie Rousseau, the USC associate athletic director for diversity, equity, and inclusion spoke to Annenberg Media about the importance of the field\u2019s namesake. \u201cWhen we see a woman who has a space on campus that\u2019s being recognized, I think it also helps our men see that women are doing great things too, and that we can celebrate greatness regardless of gender,\u201d Rousseau said. \u201cWhen people walk into this space, they will remember that they\u2019re walking into a space of greatness.\u201d\n\nAs members of the Trojan Marching Band lined into place and touted their victorious trumpets, gold and red streamers shot into the sky. The tarp covering the newly renovated entrance sign fell to the concrete, revealing bold, red lettering reading, \u201cAllyson Felix Field.\u201d Felix looked at the sign, smiling. While she has already run her race, she now passes the baton to the next generation of Trojan runners.\n\n\u201cI hope that student athletes come to this field at the beginning of their journey, and they experience something like I did coming, getting a foundation, being prepared to face the world. I know that there will be greatness and excellence daily here. I just feel so proud to be a tiny, tiny part of that.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Chuck White, Matthew Tsai, Michael Pincus, Maddy Brown and Nicole Bednar\nApril 10, 2023 at 6:44 pm PDT\n\nIn Los Angeles County, only 17% of people have the annual income needed to purchase a home in 2022, according to the California Association of Realtors; however, once split into racial and ethnic groups, this number becomes even more glaring. Over one-third of white L.A. households can afford a median-priced home, while only 15% of Latinx and 14% of Black households can afford that same median-priced home.\n\nAccording to a report done by the California Association of Realtors, \u201cThe significant difference in housing affordability for Black and Hispanic/Latino households illustrates the homeownership gap and wealth disparity for communities of color, which could worsen as the economy slows and rates remain elevated in 2023.\u201d\n\nAndrea Garcia, who currently rents in Downtown L.A., is Native American and Mexican. She believes that it is harder for people of color to achieve home ownership. \u201cI think it\u2019s just because, statistically, people of color have had to work a little harder to earn their wages, and it\u2019s just harder for them to be moving up in management positions,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nThe report said that in the past year, the number of Californians who earn the minimum income needed to purchase a median-priced home has dropped 6%. This drop has most heavily affected Black and Hispanic/Latino households, where only 12% could afford the same median-priced home in 2022.\n\n\u201c[The decrease in housing affordability] has to do with rising interest rates causing people\u2019s monthly mortgage payments to go up,\u201d said John Loper, associate professor of real estate at USC Price. \u201cWhat you can afford is based on what your mortgage payment is in relationship to your income.\u201d\n\nLike many Angelenos, Garcia doubts that she\u2019ll ever be able to own her own house. \u201cI have not owned a home, and I don\u2019t think in this economy that I will be able to own a home anytime soon,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cMaybe in retirement age, but with the way that the economy is looking, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nKenneth Chavarria, who identifies as Hispanic, said that he has lived in L.A. his whole life and that while he currently rents, he remains hopeful that he will be able to buy his own house in the future. \u201cWhat I\u2019m waiting for right now is for the recession to end,\u201d Chavarria said. \u201cIn the recession, the housing goes down so I can take the opportunity and buy a house.\u201d\n\nOther Angelenos have had different experiences. Mark Patton, who has been a resident of South L.A. for fifty years, said that although he has previously rented in the area, he has owned his own home since 2015. He said that it was not difficult for him to achieve that goal \u2014 it was simply a matter of saving money.\n\nHowever, the median housing price in South L.A. is nearly double the national median, while the median household income is less than half of the nation\u2019s. According to Redfin the median housing price in South L.A. is $695,000, while the national median is $386,797. The median household income in South L.A. is $49,903 compared to $76,367 in L.A. County as a whole, according to Point2 and the Census Bureau.\n\nPatton, who is African American, believes that the struggle to achieve home ownership has more to do with age than race. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a problem personally ... I think it\u2019s harder for young folks than people of color,\u201d Patton said.\n\nPeople under the age of 35 makeup 9.9% of homeowners and 34.4% of renters in the nation, according to Pew Research Center. Twenty-year-old Chavarria feels similar to Patton. \u201cI never had a problem with that. I mean, there is racial profiling, and this is a problem,\u201d Chavarria said. \u201cBut if you have the money to buy a house, just buy, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\nRacial disparities remain. In an effort to combat the growing housing affordability crisis in California and the divide in racial homeownership, CAR is collaborating with nonprofit housing organizations to supply up to $10,000 in closing cost grants for first-time home buyers in underserved communities.\n\nThe previous skyrocketing mortgage rates in California have resulted in a huge population decline: L.A., the largest county in the United States, had the biggest drop in population in the nation last year.\n```"}

FIDM is a school teaching fashion, entertainment, beauty and design. This expansion will happen very soon and some students at FIDM are not happy about it. FIDM was established in 1969. It prides itself on giving students hands-on experience and industry partnerships mostly in the fashion, design, and entertainment worlds. They also focus on innovation in sustainability. Located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, not far from USC, FIDM attracts a diverse community of students from around the world. Almost half the student body comes from out of state and nearly 10% are international.\n\nFIDM working with ASU is part of their expanding move into Los Angeles. ASU\u2019s official press release on the matter states that FIDM will continue operating as a separate educational institution from ASU with a more intentional focus on academic programs related to business in the creative industries. They recently opened what they call the ASU California Center, which includes the LA branch of ASU\u2019s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. ASU sees Los Angeles as a gateway to the West Coast and Asia Pacific and hopes to further expand enrollment here. Specifically, ASU seeks to admit students who have been historically underrepresented in higher education. They do it in Arizona and they hope to do it here, too.\n\nStudents at FIDM are not required to move to Arizona to complete their degree and those who are currently enrolled can start taking the new ASU curriculum classes as early as June 2023. Tuition is not expected to rise. But some students at FIDM had a few concerns about it.\n\nXochi L is a student at FIDM. \u201cI guess with is with ASU merging with FIDM, I mean I guess there\u2019s more diversity and like working to connect with, I suppose. But I guess I\u2019ll kind of miss just that specialty that comes with going to a fashion based school meant for fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cASU requiring FIDM, for one, having it being called ASU FIDM and not FIDM ASU. That\u2019s going to be a turnoff for a lot of people now, like a lot of people come here for FIDM and not for ASU to take over, so it\u2019s it\u2019s definitely going to be a mixed bag, but probably for the negative.\u201d\n\nFIDM student Emme Drue questions ASU\u2019s expansion into LA. \u201cA party school, a major university, especially in Arizona, merging with like a private fashion school that\u2019s like essentially like a trade school. We\u2019re making them look good, but they\u2019re making us look bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause now the credibility that FIDM had and the the name that FIDM has built for itself over the years is kind of like gone because now it\u2019s not going to say, for future generations, luckily, not for us, our diplomas will say FIDM. They won\u2019t say ASU, luckily. But for anybody that\u2019s behind us, their diplomas are going to say ASU or ASU FIDM.\u201d\n\nThe transformation will be in effect by the end of the summer so for now, students await the \u201cSun Devils\u201d arrival. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nicki Berelson.\n\nThe previous version of this story had inaccurate information about the relationship between ASU and FIDM.

Plus, why should you consider Joey Gallo as a pick-up?\n\nMinnesota Twins' Joey Gallo rounds the bases after hitting a home run against the Kansas City Royals during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Sunday, April 2, in Kansas City. (AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza April 10, 2023 at 5:18 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe Strikeout\u201d is a column by Diego Ynzunza dedicated to all things fantasy baseball. Welcome to Week Six of \u201cThe Strikeout.\u201d Man is it fun to have baseball back. I\u2019ve missed the constant checking of my fantasy teams and following my Dodgers on a daily basis. The grind is back and I love it. Still, 10 games is not enough to draw realistic conclusions from a long-term perspective.\n\nNotable performances\n\nTwins outfielder Joey Gallo is ranked third in MLB in barrels per plate appearance at 25%. It\u2019s long been thought that Gallo could break out in a new environment that\u2019s less stressful than New York or L.A. \u2013 Minnesota could be the place. He\u2019s started off strong with three homers and a .278 average. It\u2019s obviously still very early, but his pull percentage is the highest of his career. With the banning of the shift, I wonder if he\u2019s made a conscious decision to stray away from spraying the ball to all fields and really starting to get to his pull-side power. He doesn\u2019t lack anything in power. He is one of the handful of people in the league that I would call a true threat to hit a 500-foot homer. If he is able to keep up the production, he is someone that needs to be rostered in all leagues. When he\u2019s going right, he\u2019s stealing and providing power. I see him as an early trade target and someone I\u2019d like to get on my teams.\n\nYankees Pitcher Jhony Brito turned in a second great start this week at Baltimore where he went five innings and only struck out two. The changeup and sinker have performed well this year, and I believe that that is a product of the Yankees\u2019 pitching development, led by pitching coach Matt Blake. Brito could be the next in a line of pitchers he works his magic on, and I\u2019m here for it. He didn\u2019t get a ton of swinging strikes, but induced a lot of soft contact. I\u2019m looking to pick up Brito in my leagues, and could see him contributing long-term.\n\nTwo-start pitchers for the week of April 10\n\nBraves pitcher Bryce Elder lines up for a two-step this week against the Reds at home and then on the road against the Royals. Elder initially failed to crack the Braves\u2019 starting rotation, with Atlanta instead opting to send the young righty to AAA. Elder had one start there where he went a full six innings, giving up four runs and striking out four as well. He filled in last week against the Cardinals and excelled \u2013 he went six innings, gave up two hits, walked three and struck out six. He is only rostered in 47% of CBS Leagues, so I definitely see him being someone that is attainable in deeper leagues. If he continues to perform like he did last week, he could even be someone that sticks in your lineup long-term. He features a wipeout slider that fools hitters immensely and could be a tool that keeps him in the mix for starts in the Braves rotation.\n\nAngels pitcher Jos\u00e9 Suarez had a tough first outing against the Mariners last week. He lasted only 4.1 innings and gave up six earned runs on eight hits with four strikeouts. I\u2019m not sure how much I trust the skills. He\u2019s mainly throwing a fastball, slider and changeup, and he\u2019s throwing his slider about three MPH harder than he was last year. He\u2019s only 13% rostered in CBS Leagues, so if you really feel like you want to take the risk on some decent matchups, I\u2019d go ahead and do it with some immense caution considering there aren\u2019t a whole lot of good, low-rostered, two-start pitchers to go around this week. He goes against the Nationals at home and the Red Sox on the road. The Nationals have actually performed better than expected so far. While they aren\u2019t a top-10 offensive team, they aren\u2019t at the very bottom of the pack like most predicted, being ranked 20th in team OPS through Sunday. The Red Sox have taken advantage of favorable matchups, en route to performing decently on the offensive side. With all this in mind, I wouldn\u2019t take the risk of starting Suarez.\n\nMitch Keller is 52% rostered in CBS Leagues, and I\u2019m surprised that the number isn\u2019t higher. Keller came out of spring training with a lot of hype and a new cutter that looked promising. The thing is, though, in his most recent start, he only threw it 21% of the time. He went seven innings with seven K\u2019s and only one earned run. He lines up for a start at home against Houston and then at St. Louis. I like Keller long-term, and these matchups aren\u2019t as bad as you would initially think. The Astros are in the bottom 10 in team OPS, and the Cardinals have struggled as of late. I like Keller and would pick him up to start this week.\n\nThanks for joining me for this week\u2019s edition of \u201cThe Strikeout.\u201d \u201cThe Strikeout\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

The renaming of the field was announced earlier this year after the old name was found to be politically incorrect.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, the Tokyo Olympics. \u201cAnd Allyson Felix gets her gold.\u201d Its 2023, outside the track and field stadium at USC. The name of this field is covered in red material. The Trojan Band is playing the fight song. At just the right moment, the material drops, and we see the new name of USC\u2019s Track and Field arena. It\u2019s Allyson Felix Field from now on, and Felix was there to celebrate!\n\nAllyson Felix: You guys, thank you so much. This is overwhelming. It\u2019s just such a full circle moment and everything everyone has said has just meant so much to me.\n\nOn a hazy morning it seemed to be another dreaded gloomy day in Southern California, but the clouds cleared creating a perfect spring day. The birds were chirping and the sun was shining. A crowd of notable USC administration and alumni gather under a tent outside USC\u2019s track and field stadium.\n\nFelix: I hope that I\u2019ve contributed and I hope that I\u2019ve left something behind. And I hope that student athletes come to this field and they come at the beginning of their journey and they experience something like I did coming, getting a foundation, being prepared to face the world. We don\u2019t know what those challenges are going to be, but we know that they\u2019re inevitable. And I think that this is such a special place to get you ready to take on those fights.\n\nFelix is the most decorated woman in Olympic track and field history, having earned 11 medals from five consecutive Olympic games. Winning an Olympic medal as a mom, writing an op-ed for the New York Times, and fighting for women's rights are just a few of Felix\u2019s accomplishments. The 37-year-old continues to be an advocate for women, athletes, and mothers.\n\nFelix never ran for the USC Track Team, but she did graduate from the university with a degree in elementary education from Rossier. Felix continues to visit USC and forge relationships with current Track and Field athletes.\n\nUSC track star Gigi Maccagnini is from Australia and says Felix is not just a role model for the Trojan community.\n\nGigi Maccagnini: I can confirm that Allyson is a worldwide role model looked up to by... Fast forward a few years and I find myself standing here with the honor of speaking about the woman I once and very much still admire. However, today I view it not only as the best athlete the world has seen, but also as the boldest and most inspirational woman the world has been blessed with.\n\nPutting her degree to use, USC athletic director Mike Bohn, says Felix is a model Trojan.\n\nMike Bohn: Allyson serves as an extraordinary example of what we aim to be through her humility, competitive grit, sports and business acumen, but also her kindness, compassion and heart. The naming of this field is not just to honor Alison, but to inspire Trojans to achieve beyond the ordinary, to be a champion on and off the field, to stand for what is right with confidence and grace.\n\nIt seems to already be working. Felix will continue to be a role model for current and former Trojans to come. 11-year-old Sienna Cherry cannot wait to take a few laps on the newly named field.\n\nSienna Cherry: For my future. I hope I can do at least a fraction of what she did and maybe become maybe as quite important.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Hayes Flanagan.\n```"}

The sun peeked through the window as he brushed his teeth and buttoned his pants. His dad told the 7-year-old how to get to his second-grade class on time before the morning bell rang. Christian nervously listened to his dad and walked toward the bus stop. His footsteps grew heavier the closer he got. The weight of notebooks on his back felt heavy. He felt an emotion, too \u2013 sitting on the city bus with strangers.\n\nChristian waited at the bus stop with his dad, looking for a yellow school bus. Instead, a long blue and green bus met him. As the double doors flew open, the gust from the wind nearly knocked him over. Christian leaned forward to peek inside, then stepped in. He found comfort in the bus driver\u2019s smile and, luckily, found an open seat close to the double doors.\n\nAfter a long school day of playing basketball at recess and classroom activities, Christian didn\u2019t go home. Instead, he sat beside a stranger on the city bus and waited for the double doors to open. His stop was the homeless shelter.\n\n\u201cLooking back on my life,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI have been through a lot as a kid and it\u2019s crazy to me because many adults can\u2019t get through some of the challenges I faced.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have respect for my younger self for not making the situation more stressful for my dad,\u201d he added.\n\nHis story embodies the strains a young child has faced and the roller coaster of emotions it takes to overcome a rocky upbringing. Whether living in a homeless shelter, in an apartment with his father or with his best friend\u2019s family, Christian Catlin remained true to himself. He stayed persistent.\n\nNow 22, Christian stands 5 feet, 8 inches tall. The 22-year-old keeps his natural hair confined under his white-and-gold Dr. Dre Beats headphones his teammate Caleb Williams gave him. Christian Catlin taking the field with his teammates.\n\nHe zoomed to a table at the USC Village on his white electric scooter. The USC running back is pursuing a master\u2019s in entrepreneurship and innovation. Attending USC was a dream for Christian. He is now living his reality.\n\nChristian had rough turns in his path but always found a way to stay persistent. Christian lived in a biracial household until he was 5: his mom was Filipino, and his dad -- Black. The one-bedroom Park Haven apartment in Fairfield, California, included Christian, his mother, father and grandmother.\n\nChristian adjusted his posture in the brown chair to visualize his first home environment through the lens of his younger self. He pictured a big yard in front of the apartment where he played tag with other kids. On school days, Christian remembers the aroma of breakfast leaving the stove and entering the bedroom of the room. His dad used a spatula to place scrambled eggs next to bread slices on a white plate. After he used the soft folded bread to scoop the eggs, Christian tasted the absorbed syrup on the scrambled eggs.\n\n\u201cThat was my favorite breakfast,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI was so happy when he made it and I don\u2019t really remember what else I ate, aside from cereal.\u201d\n\nThe one memory that stuck with Christian was hearing loud arguing leave his parents\u2019 lips from his bedroom. The small apartment magnified their heated discussion and piqued the 5-year-old\u2019s interest. He thought, \u201cWhy were they so mad?\u201d\n\nChristian walked into the living room and saw his dad arguing with his mom. His mom\u2019s fragile body broke down as tears fell, one by one, onto the wooden floor. Confused, angry, anxious, a ball of little arms and legs, Christian started yelling at his dad. His father left, at least for a while. His mom, hurting, sought nonetheless to wrap her arms around a boy who could barely sing his ABCs.\n\nDescribing the moment now, Christian paused. He realized he had blocked out the memory for years.\n\n\u201cAfter that day, we started living in a homeless shelter,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI never processed what happened and it stayed in the back of my head because I needed a parent during that time.\u201d\n\nChristian lived in the homeless shelter from 7 to 9 years old with his dad, Samuel Catlin. He can still recall his second-grade memory: \u201cWe got to the homeless shelter and stayed, he said. \u201cThen, we never left.\u201d\n\nThe shelter in Solano County was located just a few miles from the apartment Christian had lived in with both parents \u2013less than a five-minute drive away.\n\n\u201cIt was really scary being around strangers like that and seeing them in their habitats,\u201d Samuel, who works now at Tesla as a production assistant, said of the shelter. \u201cYou had alcoholics, drug addicts, people living on the streets.\u201d\n\nFrom Christian\u2019s memory, the shelter had two buildings: \u2013 a kitchen, a room where everyone slept, \u2013 and showers. Outside of one of the buildings, Christian would play basketball and tag with other kids. Early in the mornings, the staff would wake up Christian, Samuel, \u2013 and the others. Once the adults were awake, they had to leave for the majority of the day to try to find a job.\n\n\u201cI would play Club Penguin or  Disney.com  while my dad would apply for jobs,\u201d Christian \u2013 who went to school \u2013 said. Christian would ask if his dad got work every day, hoping to hear, \u201cYes.\u201d But, recalling those years, Christian feels bad for asking so often.\n\n\u201cHe [Samuel] would say, \u2018No, but [I\u2019m] trying to find a job,\u2019 Christian said. \u201cLooking back on it, he was probably thinking, \u2013 \u2018I have a son and we are in this situation.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, job-hunting could not be 24/7. Instead, Samuel and Christian would go together to the library. Or, Samuel said, to the mall or park to \u201ckill time.\u201d\n\nOn weekdays, when Christian had school, Samuel recalls waking up early for welfare training and to get Christian to school on time.\n\n\u201cWe had to go our separate ways,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cDuring that time, it was really, really scary when Christian had to get onto his bus and go to school because a lot can happen.\u201d\n\nHe would tell Christian to sit next to the bus driver to ease Samuel\u2019s worries.\n\nWhen the sky grew dark, and the neighborhood lights flicked on, the shelter had vans ready for them to go to local churches to eat and sleep there. Every time the van was parked by the church, Christian remembers looking at the cross on top of the church. The church would feed everyone twice a day. Breakfast and dinner. The church served portions buffet style. Despite some variety, Christian was obsessed with oatmeal and Raisin Bran.\n\nChristian and his dad would sit around the tables and talk to Samuel\u2019s friends. Once it was time to sleep, Christian and Samuel would sleep side-by-side on a foldable mattress on the cold marble floor. The room was filled with other people sleeping on beds next to Christian and Samuel. The church also gave blankets to everyone in the chilly, spacious room. Christian had a blanket of his own.\n\n\u201cIt was a tan blanket with red and black designs and a bear on it,\u201d Christian said.\n\nThinking back about the years spent in the shelter, Samuel mentioned the movie \u201cThe Pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me and Christian,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cThe movie showed how we didn\u2019t have a place to go until we went to the shelter.\u201d\n\nSamuel would encourage Christian by reminding him that their living environment was temporary.\n\n\u201cI told him to stay strong, \u2013 God is watching over us,\u201d Samuel would say, \u201c\u2013 and that it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d\n\nBut this wouldn\u2019t be the last time Christian had to find a place to rest his eyes and eat warm home-cooked meals.\n\nWhen 16-year-old Christian was in high school, he lived in an apartment with his dad, Samuel. They lived in Vacaville, California, near Will C. Wood High School. Christian and Samuel lived in the Vacaville apartment for a few years until the apartment cost increased. His dad was evicted again.\n\nChristian didn\u2019t want to transfer to a new high school and learn a new football culture outside of Will C. Wood High School. Then, a week before the eviction, Christian\u2019s best friend, Drew Anderson, mentioned how his siblings had moved out of his [Drew\u2019s] home.\n\nChristian recalls how hesitant he was to ask his best friend, Drew, if he could live with his family. However, Drew remembers the situation differently.\n\nDrew recalls when Christian\u2019s demeanor changed once he learned about the eviction from his apartment.\n\n\u201cI could tell that he wasn\u2019t being himself or even eating much or sleeping,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAfter talking to him, I realized what the situation was. I asked him what he thought about moving in with me before I asked my parents.\u201d\n\nDrew and the Andersons made Christian feel like a part of their family. Christian felt the Andersons\u2019 love for him when they welcomed him at the door.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t treat me any differently,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI was supposed to be there for three months. Instead, I stayed for about two and a half years.\u201d\n\nChristian spent every holiday with the Andersons. There was never any hesitation in calling Drew\u2019s cousins his biological cousins and vice versa. Even now, about five years later, Christian goes to his best friend\u2019s house to spend Christmas Eve with them.\n\n\u201cTo me and my family, he is another family member. He is one of my brothers, \u201cAnderson said. \u201cTo my parents, he is a son.\u201d\n\nAlthough Christian\u2019s living environment wasn\u2019t steady, his love for football was and still is, a consistent feature of his life.\n\nAlthough Christian started playing football in the wet grass on warm summer days with his older stepbrother, once he joined a league in middle school, he was scared of two things: getting hit and meeting new people. He forgot all that after playing football through a league for a couple of weeks. Now, it was about rushing past defenders and scoring touchdowns.\n\nAccording to an article in the Daily Republic, a Solano County newspaper in 2020, in 19 games over three seasons. Christian rushed for 666 yards and 6.8 yards per carry, scoring 10 touchdowns while catching 29 passes for 440 yards and five touchdowns during high school.\n\nDuring Christian\u2019s last high school football game, it made him \u201cstart mentally checking out\u201d of the sport. The Sacramento Dragons played Christian\u2019s varsity team in a playoff game on a \u201creal grass\u201d field. Christian recalls being \u201cblown out\u201d by the 7-5 Dragons. The final score of the game was brutal: 55-3.\n\nChristian suggested that anything that could have gone wrong did. His seventh-grade friend, Asa, who he met when he first started playing football with his older stepbrother, got hurt. Those long-ago football fears? Now they\u2019ve come true.\n\nChristian remembers how Asa ran the ball in hopes of scoring a touchdown. Instead, a moment later, Asa was viciously tackled and thrown onto his spine, with the back of his head hitting the stiff grass.\n\n\u201cHe got hit and got a concussion from the impact of the hit,\u201d Christian said. \u201cAlso, he was taken off of the field in an ambulance.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHe got up feeling dizzy and asked me to help him walk. When I did, his body dropped and I was yelling for the trainer to help him.\u201d\n\nWith all this, there were still about four minutes left in the playoff game.\n\nAfterward, Samuel Catlin couldn\u2019t overlook the moment when Christian told him. \u201cDad, I don\u2019t want to play football anymore.\u201d\n\nIt was the last football game Christian would play for several years.\n\nChristian had used running track as a training method, as a way to channel his speed on the football field in high school. However, he took track and field more seriously than football at UC Berkeley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to play both sports in college and it\u2019s even harder to play Division I for football,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI knew I was going Division I by any means necessary even if it meant running track.\u201d\n\nAt Berkeley in 2022, Christian helped the Bears win the 4x100 relay race at the Brutus Hamilton Invitational in 40.05 seconds. The year before, at the Pac-12 outdoors, he set a personal best in the 100-meter dash, 10.64.\n\nFour years have passed. Now at USC, exploring a master\u2019s degree in business, with a focus on entrepreneurship and innovation degree, he saw a flier for \u2013 football tryouts. Christian slightly smiled. It must, he thought to himself, have been a sign.\n\nThe next thing he knew, he was on the team.\n\nChristian suits up for every game in cardinal red and gold with red \u2018SC\u201d gloves. Playing time? Not this season. Does he mind? No.\n\n\u201cWe have many great running backs playing this season,\u201d Christian said. \u201cI am learning and trying to put on weight to develop right now.\u201d\n\nJohn Armistead, graduate student and USC defensive back, said although he has known Christian for three months, he learned from the first time they were in the weight room Christian had an undeniable football mentality.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made a lot of strides in his numbers in the weight room since the first time we benched, he has gotten stronger, and he has done a good job studying the playbook to learn the running back position,\u201d Armistead said.\n\nThe plan is to graduate from USC in December 2023 \u2013 after another football season \u2013 and to develop a financial education program to help educate minorities and people who live check-to-check to be financially stable. His second goal is to buy his dad a house.\n\nChristian\u2019s motivation derives from a lesson his dad taught him: \u201cPain is only temporary.\u201d```"}

Known for blending R&B with soul influences and hip hop, he embraces raunchiness while maintaining focus on the emotional exchanges in relationships in his most recent album \u201cSincerely for You.\u201d The record, released last December, reflects his maturity as an artist since his adoption of the \u201cKing of R&B\u201d moniker and 2019 sophomore album titled the same.\n\nWhen Jacquees announced that he would be doing a show in Los Angeles for Valentine\u2019s Day, fans knew they were in for a sultry yet energy-filled night. A nearly sold-out crowd showed up to The Novo, ready to sing, dance and celebrate the day of love. But was Jacquees\u2019s live performance ability enough to help him cement his legacy as the \u201cKing of R&B\u201d?\n\nCharacteristic of this genre of music, the show quickly took on a sensual mood. Jacquees began with songs from \u201cSincerely for You.\u201d Carrying on with the newer themes of maturity and treating women right in a relationship in his music, Jacquees highlighted the female backup dancers in his show. He sang with smooth, clear vocals, capturing the undertones of desire present throughout his discography.\n\nJacquees channeled his characteristic swagger into a suave demeanor as he performed heartfelt tracks such as \u201cYou\u201d from his first album \u201c4275.\u201d In \u201cYou,\u201d he sang about sticking with a woman he loved and the feeling of knowing that she was the one for him.\n\nThe crowd cheers for Jacquees\u2019s performance. Of course, Jacquees made sure the crowd had a good time while celebrating the people they loved. The singer kept up a high level of energy throughout the show. While he sang \u201cCome Thru\u201d from his first EP, \u201c19,\u201d he performed a hip hop dance routine with two background dancers. The diverse reciprocated his energy, singing along and dancing out of their seats even on the balcony level of the venue.\n\nAs Jacquees ended the show, he made his love for his fans clear, letting them know that he appreciated everyone who came, from the ladies and to the \u201cfellows who brought their ladies to the show.\u201d The night was a romantic one for all, with themes of self-love, appreciation for supporters and messages of gratitude for significant others that were each touched on during Jacquees\u2019s performance.\n\nUltimately, Jacquees delivered a performance that enraptured the crowd. The cockiness of his previous social media comments was replaced with effortless charm as he crooned to the audience. He strolled across the stage with confidence honed in from years in the spotlight, and any insecurity from the deriding responses to his self-coronation was undetectable.\n\nDespite Jacquees\u2019s strengths as a live performer, he still has a ways to go in order to truly claim the title of \u201cKing of R&B,\u201d even for this generation. The concert marked Jacquees\u2019s first solo headlining concert in LA since he did a nationwide tour in 2020, and although it generated buzz and strong turnout, his fan support was not up to par with the instantaneous ticket-purchasing and song-memorization that an artist referred to as the royalty of their genre would command.\n\nAudience members clearly chanted the verses of Jacquees\u2019s older hits, but many of his newer songs had the crowd feeling the music without the same familiarity. While Jacquees\u2019s music is expanding in the topics it explores, incorporating introspection alongside his tried-and-true lyrics about sex and confidence, he is known first and foremost for doing the definitive aspects of R&B well, not for adding anything new to the genre.\n\nMany of his songs follow a pattern of being slower-paced and having strong beats, while some of the forays he has made into melodic rap feel like unsuccessful attempts to follow mainstream trends. He embodies the essence of R&B but doesn\u2019t have the discography to fully showcase that.\n\nAlthough Jacquees has not closed the case for himself as \u201cKing of R&B,\u201d he succeeded at what he does best: sultry, smooth tracks dedicated to female appreciation. He showed the classic R&B that both his supporters and critics know he delivers. It was a dynamic, groovy night, and few wanted the singer to \u201ctell them it\u2019s over.\u201d```"}

Though this season is over, the next season is only six months away. With the recent conclusion of the high school basketball season, some major programs regain a bit of their honor, while only one top 100 prospect stays uncommitted.\n\nBlue Bloods stay dominant\nKentucky and Duke monopolized the recruiting cycle as they always do and landed some of the best prospects in the nation. Just as people started calling Kentucky\u2019s John Calipari washed, he pulled off an all-time great recruiting class bringing in four McDonald\u2019s All Americans and four five-star recruits. Realistically coach Cal should be bringing in five McDonald\u2019s All Americans, but Rob Dillingham was deemed ineligible. The Wildcats should be really excited for this class, as three of the players in this class are ranked inside the top five and Rob Dillingham is ranked ninth. There is going to be a whole lot of talent on this team; it will really be a matter if the team can gel together because Kentucky will be dangerous if they can play together.\n\nJohn Scheyer\u2019s first year as head coach of Duke should be met with applause by Blue Devil fans as, for the first time in 42 years, Duke\u2019s head coach was not named Mike Krzyzewski. However, after an up-and-down midseason, Scheyer managed to pull his team together and win the ACC tournament. Though the Blue Devils were taken out in the Round of 32 by Tennessee, this recruiting class will send them right back to the top. Duke landed five five-star recruits in the 2023 cycle, all of whom are ranked in the top 20. This recruiting class is loaded with talent in all areas. In the McDonald\u2019s All American game showcases, Blue Devil signees forward Sean Stewart won the dunk contest and guard Jared McCain won the 3-point contest. The Blue Devils will be loaded next year top to bottom on the roster and will be a scary opponent.\n\nWhere will Bronny go?\nBronny James has been one of the most followed recruits in the past decade, as videos of his AAU games first appeared on YouTube when James was around 12. Since then, he has played on some of the most followed basketball teams of all time, from his middle school team, the North Coast Blue Chips, to his high school team and one of the most prestigious California high school basketball programs of all time, Sierra Canyon. James\u2019 game is described as the definition of a great all-around player. His ability to move off the ball is fantastic and he is a great spot-up shooter. In the McDonald\u2019s All American game, James hit five threes. Coupled with great athleticism and size for a point guard, he is a stellar recruit.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about what this entails for the school who ends up getting James. James will affect his team not just on the court, but off the court as well. I went to watch James play at the Les Schwab Invitational this past December up in Portland. I went three hours early, partially to watch my former high school take on Duncanville, but also because that is how early you need to go to get decent seats at a game he is playing in. He attracts media attention like no other prospect we have seen, possibly since his dad. Whichever school he chooses automatically becomes a hot commodity to the sports world.\n\nJames\u2019 top three schools are reported to be USC, Oregon and Ohio State, so let\u2019s talk about the right fit. Obviously as a USC student, I want James to come here, but I will tell you why he should come to USC. First off, let\u2019s talk about playing time. In my opinion, his recruitment is a two-man race between Oregon and USC. Oregon already has two veteran guards in redshirt senior Jermaine Couisnard and junior Keeshawn Barthelemy, who will be getting major minutes. On top of that, there\u2019s Oregon\u2019s golden recruit, Jackson Shelstad, a man who bested James one-on-one in the Les Schwab Invitational. Overall, James would have to scrap out minutes from those three, plus other guards whom Oregon has rostered.\n\nHowever at USC, Bronny would be a perfect shooting guard addition to this team. It was announced on Saturday that senior guard Boogie Ellis would be returning for his fifth season, which may hinder James\u2019 commitment. However, James would be competing for playing time against less experienced guards and will most likely be the first guard off the bench, coming in for Ellis or No. 1 overall recruit, Isaiah Collier. James\u2019 pesky off-ball ability would be a perfect addition to a USC team that at times struggled with 3-pointers.\n\nAnother reason James should come to USC is the seamless transition for him and his family. The James family lives in Los Angeles and LeBron plays only about two miles down the road from Galen Center. USC is just the right fit. James was recently Crystal-Balled to USC by 247 Sports analyst Trevor Andershock, however that was before Ellis announced he was returning. I still believe USC is the front runner with a commitment looming in the near future.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Wendi Lu April 10, 2023 at 12:46 pm PDT\n\nAfter being defeated by UCLA on Thursday in three sets 22-25, 17-25, 22-25 at Pauley Pavilion, the Trojans were up to a rematch at home. However, it didn\u2019t change their fate \u2014 the Bruins dominated the Trojans in three sets 20-25, 17-25, 20-25 Saturday night at Galen Center. The match marked USC\u2019s sixth straight loss against the Bruins.\n\n\u201cThey put a lot of stress on our offense and we hit a little bit below our season average by design,\u201d USC head coach Jeff Nygaard said. \u201cAnd if we can handle them and allow ourselves to be in a better system more often, I think we could hit more efficiently, put more strain and stress on them, and then it\u2019s on us to make sure that we manage the defensive side.\u201d\n\nDespite facing a powerful adversary, the Trojans managed to put up a fight at home. During the first set, the lead changed seven times and the scores were tied twelve times. Junior middle blocker Kyle Paulson achieved a new career-best with three service aces in the opening frame. Graduate outside hitter Kevin Kobrine contributed four kills for USC.\n\n\u201cEvery Kobrine that\u2019s come on over has had a great experience,\u201d Nygaard said about Kobrine\u2019s transition from being a Bruin to a Trojan. \u201cI actually haven\u2019t even thought about him adjusting to the team in months, so I guess he must be doing a great job.\u201d\n\nAs far as Kobrine himself is concerned, he is thriving as a Trojan. \u201cSC has been a very good experience so far,\u201d Kobrine said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a challenge adjusting to a new position because last year I played opposite and now I\u2019m playing outside. But I want to embrace the challenge.\u201d\n\nAt one point, USC had a four-point advantage over UCLA. With an 8-2 run, UCLA was quick to catch up, restoring their advantages. USC came back to lead 18-17 but failed to keep it going when UCLA stopped the Trojans\u2019 momentum with a kill. It\u2019s no wonder UCLA never trailed in the second set \u2014 the side out rate was 94%. The score was tied once at 4-4, but the Bruins were hitting at 52.4% while the Trojans hit just 13.6%.\n\nThe hitting percentage wasn\u2019t any better in the third set. Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Jackson Reed scored all four of his kills and produced 5.5 points in the third set. But the poor placement and the defensive failure allowed UCLA to secure the sweep with a 25-20 win.\n\n\u201cWe have [two] more matches in the season before we go to the [MPSF],\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cAnd the best news about it is that we know specifically what we need to improve. So it\u2019s a challenge and they have to step up and make sure that we get that done.\u201d\n\nAfter USC\u2019s next match, the Trojans will celebrate their senior class of libero George Dyer, middle blocker Lucas Frassrand, redshirt junior opposite hitter Simon Gallas and Kobrine. During the rematch, Frassrand contributed three kills and three blocks.\n\n\u201cAs a senior, this is my second to last time playing at Galen Center,\u201d Frassrand said. \u201cI remember when I came on my visit here, I was probably 17 and I was watching a USC-UCLA game. Now I\u2019m one of the players on the field. I even used to watch videos of the games and now I\u2019m in the videos.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will take on Concordia Thursday April 13 at CU Arena for the Trojans\u2019 final away match before the MPSF tournament. USC\u2019s regular-season finale against the Eagles will take place at Galen Center on Saturday, April 15.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Drake Lee\nApril 09, 2023 at 5:34 pm PDT\n\nAs the final seconds came to a close, so did the Trojans\u2019 adventures on McAlister Field. On an Easter-Sunday Senior Day, the Trojans celebrated their last home game of the season with a fitting 10-7 victory over Stanford. USC improved to a perfect 8-0 at McAlister Field on the season and honored graduate defender Emma Wightman, senior attacker Ella Heaney, graduate midfielder Katie Ramsay, senior defender Olivia Dooley, senior defender Danielle Carson and senior midfielder Sloane Murphy.\n\n\u201cThis game was so emotional,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cIt\u2019s the last time we\u2019ll all be playing on this field because it\u2019s about to get renovated, so it was a final goodbye for everyone.\u201d\n\nAfter surrendering a season-high 15 goals against the Cardinal last Sunday, the Trojans allowed a single-digit goal total for the ninth time this season. Stanford\u2019s seven goals are the Cardinal\u2019s lowest since February 18, 2022. The USC defense forced 13 turnovers, with Wightman\u2019s four leading all players. Stanford only forced four turnovers on the Trojans.\n\n\u201cOur defense is incredible, and they continue to set the bar higher and higher each game,\u201d head coach Lindsey Munday said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky that they\u2019re on our side and that we get to work with them every day. Junior goalie Kait Devir recorded seven saves in the cage, collected two ground balls and picked up the winning decision.\n\nHowever, the main difference was draw control. Last Sunday, The Trojans earned just six of 31 draws against the Cardinal. This time, USC claimed 10 of 21 in the main circle, with junior midfielder Claudia Shevitz and Ramsay winning three each.\n\n\u201cOur main focus this week was to scout the draw and really focus on those possessions,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cThe draw team did a really good job replicating what we were going to see.\u201d\n\nOn offense, Shevitz and redshirt sophomore attacker Isabelle Vitale scored three goals each. In all, six different Trojans scored. The first half saw the Trojans shoot 22% from the field, contributing to a back-and-forth period. However, the Trojans improved to 60% shooting in the second half, rattling off four straight goals near the end of the game to pull away.\n\n\u201cComing out of halftime, we weren\u2019t shooting the best,\u201d Munday said. \u201cTheir goalie made some saves early, but then we got intentional with the shots we were selecting, and we really put them away.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s victory ends a four-game losing streak against Stanford. The Trojans are now 106-18 against unranked opponents and 36-11 in the Pac-12 all-time.\n\n\u201cOur team has the best connection in the country,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cWe make stops and score goals.\u201d\n\nUSC has three more road games on its schedule before the Pac-12 Championships. The Trojans will face the Colorado Buffaloes in a rematch on Friday in Boulder. USC is currently tied with the Buffaloes for first place in the Pac-12.\n```"}

The meet was the Ron and Sharlene Allice Trojan Invitational, the only time the team will be racing at Allyson Felix Field this season.\n\n\u201cThis was a great opportunity for the team to compete all together at home,\u201d USC head coach Quincy Watts said. \u201cA lot of the athletes don\u2019t get the opportunity to travel indoors, so for us to get the opportunity to be here on our track, I just wanted them to come out and give a good effort and I am very pleased.\u201d\n\nNot only that, but seniors were honored before the meet, some of which included distance runner Mihajla Milovanovic, jumper and sprinter Austin Allen and sprinter Davonte Burnett.\n\nSo how did the Trojans fare at their home stadium?\n\nTrack: The biggest competition for USC was Texas A&M. The two schools were consistently competing for first place. The Trojans got an early lead in the women\u2019s 4x100, with USC freshman Jassani Carter taking the baton. Unfortunately for the Trojans, the men\u2019s 4x100 had a much different fate. Lead-off runner Burnett came out of the gate hot but had to drop out of the race after reaggravating a previously pulled hamstring.\n\nFormer Aggie-turned-pro Adidas athlete Sammy Watson accompanied her old team to the field to compete. Watson showed why she is a former NCAA champion as she won the women\u2019s 1500-meter race and her heat\u2019s 400-meter race. In both races, she immediately gained the lead and never looked back.\n\nUSC freshman Yemi John had a great showing in the 400, narrowly edging out her teammate graduate Bailey Lear. The two ran together the whole time, but John outkicked her at the finish line by .05 seconds.\n\nThe men\u2019s 400 was even more star studded as two former Trojans \u2014 now Nike athletes \u2014 returned home. Rai Benjamin and Isaiah Jewett certainly did not disappoint the home crowd back in Los Angeles. Both men put up lifetime bests, with Benjamin finishing in 44.21 seconds and Jewett putting up 45.90 seconds.\n\nThe women\u2019s 100-meter dash was by far the most spectacular race of the day. The best way to describe this race is record breaking. Nearly every competitor put down a personal record. In addition, graduate Caisja Chandler and sophomore Samirah Moody moved to fourth and fifth fastest all-time 100s for USC.\n\nThe 800s were extremely competitive, coming down to the wire on both. Senior Janiah Brown won for the women and Texas A&M sophomore Sam Whitmarsh won for the men.\n\nJunior Jasmine Jones demolished the competition, winning the 400-meter hurdles. USC had a great day in the 200-meter race, winning both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s competition. Freshman Christine Mallard won the women\u2019s race with a time of 23.36 seconds, and sophomore Johnny Brackins Jr. led the whole men\u2019s race, finishing in 21.10 seconds.\n\nThe 3000-meter started with tight packs, but both separated halfway in. Aggie sophomore Maddie Livingston dropped the pack and won by nearly a minute, but USC redshirt freshman Jacqueline Duarte shifted into high gear in the last 100 meters to secure third place.\n\nThe men\u2019s was close, but in the end Texas A&M pulled away from the rest to win.\n\nThe women\u2019s 4x400 was exciting as ever. The Trojans and the Aggies were neck and neck and trading leads the entire race. In the end, the NCAA 400-meter leader sophomore Jermaisha Arnold tied her leading time to get A&M the win.\n\nDespite the loss Watts was still overjoyed with the time \u201cOur mile relay did exceptional,\u201d Watts said. \u201cWe ran 3:26, so that has to be the top in the country.\u201d\n\nIn the men\u2019s, the Aggies pulled away immediately, but USC graduate Bobby Poynter came from behind to claim third place.\n\nJumping: USC demolished the jumping events, winning every event except for women\u2019s high jump and pole vault. The women and men swept long jumps as well as winning the triple jump. Unfortunately, an injury occurred during the triple jump with junior Dominique Ruotolo appearing to injure her foot and had to be helped off the track.\n\nUSC freshman Elias Gerald won the men\u2019s long jump, recording a personal best. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit with Elias having his personal best.\u201d Watt said. \u201cElias did extremely well, so I think that is great for him and his confidence.\u201d\n\nThrowing: Texas A&M dominated the field, winning the shot put and javelin throw for men and women. At Friday\u2019s throwing events, two international athletes won the discus throw for men, but former Trojan Joy McArthur returned to win the hammer throw, nearly breaking the Japanese national record.\n\n\u201cOutside of some really great performances, we had some injuries so we have to heal up. But other than that I am really pleased,\u201d Watts said. \u201cI think it shows we are making our mark in the country and we are starting to gel as a team.\u201d\n\nAfter the Trojan Invitational, the Trojans look to continue the momentum into the Mt.

However, the United States has not always had strong recovery efforts in response to natural disasters.\n\nBy Becca Speier April 08, 2023 at 11:03 pm PDT\n\nThe horrific earthquake in Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023 called on the world for assistance in their efforts to recover from this disaster. President Joe Biden released a statement through the White House later that day that expressed the condolences of the United States, and how the country is prepared to help a NATO ally such as Turkey. In the statement by the White House, Biden assured that \u201csenior American officials reached out immediately to their Turkish counterparts to coordinate any and all needed assistance. Our teams are deploying quickly to begin to support Turkish search and rescue efforts and address the needs of those injured and displaced by the earthquake.\u201d\n\nThe recovery climate of both Turkey and Syria is still undetermined. However, Turkey and Syria\u2019s cost effects are analogous to previous natural disasters within the U.S. Hurricane Katrina has led to the most expensive recovery relief assistance, as around $190 billion was given for relief. Hurricane Harvey is ranked second with $151.3 billion, and Hurricane Ian is ranked third with $112.9 billion given for aid, according to a report from the National Centers for Environmental Information. However, the United Nations\u2019 secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has launched a plan for a humanitarian appeal that would give Syria $397 million over a three-month period. An article in The New York Times said the Syrian government is still in need of more relief efforts and blames the U.S. sanctions for not targeting humanitarian aid and denying their appeals to change them.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a government agency dedicated to responding to natural disasters in the United States. In order to receive FEMA assistance, you need to be approved by the agency. FEMA determines this approval by a scheduled inspection, then an additional 10 days of analysis to determine if assistance is needed. FEMA can then provide rental assistance for up to 18 months. When looking at Hurricane Ian which struck on September 2022 in Florida, FEMA worked with residents in Florida to find temporary shelter. As reported by FEMA\u2019s official website, FEMA has provided assistance to 26 counties and has provided housing to 1,323 households with 3,225 members.\n\nWhile FEMA has been making sufficient development efforts in helping those affected by recent natural disasters in the U.S., they have learned from their errors of low supply count, miscommunication and lack of warnings. In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit, there was a lack of direction in recovery efforts by the political appointees of FEMA. According to disastersrus.org, \u201cFEMA lacked the tools to track the status of shipments, interfering with the management of supplying food, water, ice, and other vital commodities to those in need across the Gulf Coast.\u201d\n\nAfter the catastrophic Hurricane Katrina intertwined with the lack of FEMA direction, there were major changes made in the FEMA program. Former President George W. Bush signed and enacted the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act on October 4, 2006. This act was a step made in the right direction by recognizing the mistakes FEMA made when dealing with Hurricane Katrina\u2019s recovery. This act led to the reorganization of FEMA and offered the program more authority in response efforts.\n\nAccording to FEMA\u2019s Disaster Authority, as of late February, the United States has offered total humanitarian assistance of $185 million to Turkey and Syria. It has been 17 years since the disastrous Hurricane Katrina. While America\u2019s relief efforts and programs have continuously changed for the better, there is still a great deal of work that remains undone.\n```"}

In their final non-conference series of the year, the Trojans took all three games against San Diego State over the weekend. Sweeping a series is challenging enough on its own, yet USC won all three games comfortably, winning 12-2 on Thursday, 7-2 on Friday and 7-0 on Saturday at Dedeaux Field. Saturday afternoon\u2019s victory over the Aztecs marked the 15th win for the Trojans in their last 18 matchups. USC has taken at least two games in all but one weekend series so far this year, with this weekend marking its third sweep.\n\nThe key to victory for the Trojans was the dominance of their pitching across all three games. Their four runs allowed in the series were the fewest given up in a three-game set since 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all starting pitching,\u201d head coach Andy Stankiewicz said after the game. \u201cThe guy that starts and puts the ball in his hand in inning one has got to be the tone setter. We got three really good starts over the weekend between [junior] Tyler [Stromsborg], [sophomore Caden] Aoki, and [redshirt freshman] Eric [Hammond] today. We got that because of those guys.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday night, Stromsborg took the mound. While his outing was not quite as good as his complete-game shutout a week prior, it was still more than enough to earn his fourth win of the season. The only hiccup Stromsborg had came in the top of the third, allowing back-to-back home runs from redshirt sophomore center fielder Shaun Montoya and junior catcher Poncho Ruiz. The home runs not only gave San Diego State a 2-0 lead, but also ended a shutout streak of 18 innings for the right-hander. However, Stromsborg kept the Aztecs off the scoreboard for the remainder of his start. Over the next four frames, the Trojans\u2019 starter allowed just one base hit. He finished with two runs allowed on four hits in seven innings pitched, while recording seven strikeouts. It was the fifth straight quality start for Stromsborg.\n\n\u201c[Stromsborg] has shown himself to be a legit Friday night guy for us,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cYou always want a guy that takes the ball on a Friday night who\u2019s going to be competitive and make pitches. He\u2019s done that three or four times in a row.\u201d\n\nOffensively, USC got production up and down the lineup, as six of its nine starters were credited with at least one RBI. Senior third baseman Johnny Olmstead was the biggest contributor, going 3-for-3 at the plate with five RBIs. Olmstead evened the score in the bottom of the third, with a double down the left-field line that brought two runners home. In the fourth, freshman center fielder Austin Overn drove in the go-ahead run by hitting the ball to the opposite field to score junior shortstop Ryan Jackson. That pattern of timely hitting continued throughout the entire game, as the Trojans compiled 14 base hits against Aztec pitching and hit .381 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\u201cA big component of our offense is going to the back side,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cCoach [Travis] Jewett has done a great job of making sure our guys understand that with two strikes, if they want to work away, we have to take the back-side knock. A good offense uses the whole field, so if we can continue to do that, it will certainly be helpful.\u201d\n\nIn the sixth, Olmstead struck again, hitting a moonshot to deep left field that easily left the park. Besides Olmstead, Overn had the only other multi-hit game for the Trojans. He was 4-for-6 at the plate with two RBI\u2019s.\n\nJunior pitcher TJ Fondtain started the game for San Diego State on Friday night. Overall, the left hander was very effective in his six innings of work, allowing just one earned run. That run came in the bottom of the second. On the very first pitch of the inning, senior right fielder Cole Gabrielson crushed a ball to the opposite field that deflected off the top of the glove of sophomore right fielder Tyler Glowacki and left the park. The solo shot was Gabrielson\u2019s first homer since March 15th.\n\nAfter Gabrielson\u2019s long ball tied the game, USC earned the lead by taking full advantage of every mistake the Aztecs made. Junior left fielder Carson Wells scored an unearned run in the fourth on a sacrifice fly from Olmstead to give his team the lead. In Fondtain\u2019s final inning of work, the Trojans added two more insurance runs when Ruiz threw the ball past third base on a double-steal attempt. The Trojans knocked in three more runs against the Aztec bullpen, one on a monstrous solo shot by senior first baseman Nick Lopez.\n\nSan Diego State\u2019s starting pitching was good, but USC\u2019s was even better. Right hander Caden Aoki pitched a career-high six innings, allowing just one unearned run on three hits. He also set a new career high with seven strikeouts. Aoki was remarkably efficient, facing the minimum in three of his six innings of work. He only threw 71 pitches in his start, thanks in part to senior catcher Connor Clift, who threw out two baserunners. Senior reliever Kyle Wisch finished the job for the Trojans, getting the final six outs of the game in dominant fashion. The right-hander pitched two innings of no-hit ball to shut the door.\n\nLooking for the sweep, Hammond got the ball for USC on Saturday afternoon. Following in the footsteps of Stromsborg and Aoki, he delivered his best start as a Trojan. The right-hander matched his career high in length, giving his team five full innings of two-hit, shutout baseball. It was the first time in his career Hammond did not allow a single run. The fifth inning was the only time Hammond retired the side in order, but he was at his best pitching from the stretch. In the first four innings, Hammond stranded five baserunners.\n\nAfter Hammond\u2019s day came to an end in the sixth, the USC bullpen picked up right where he left off. Sophomore relievers Fisher Johnson and Caden Connolly, along with redshirt senior Garrett Clarke, pitched the final four innings out of the bullpen and did not allow a single hit. Overall, San Diego State was held to just two base hits in 29 at-bats Saturday for a batting average of .069, and the Aztecs hit 0-for-12 with runners on.\n\nOnce again, the Trojan offense put together a consistent offensive day, scratching runs across home plate in all but three innings in which they came to bat. In the leadoff spot in the bottom of the first, Overn reached base on a bunt single. Two at-bats later, senior left fielder Adrian Colon-Rosado went the other way for a single into left field to drive in the first run. After showing off his speed his first time up, Overn used his power in the fifth. With a runner on first, he hit a two-run homer to right field that cleared the wall in a hurry and extended the USC lead to 5-0. The freshman was 2-for-4 on the day, and 7-for-14 over the weekend.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s exciting to watch,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to hit home runs, he\u2019s trying to hit line drives and hard ground balls. That\u2019s a guy who can beat you different ways. As a freshman, just watching his growth has been very impressive.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans improved to 20-10-1 on the season with the three-game sweep. They will wrap up their streak of five straight non-conference home games on Tuesday night when they welcome in Cal State Fullerton.\n```"}

The book deftly explores body liberation, identity, intersectionality, fatphobia and more.\n\nKent emphasizes her desire to use writing as a tool to examine and embrace her identities rather than downplay their significance in her life. \u201cI wrote the memoir because I am these different identities and marginalizations,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve experienced because of them, or maybe in spite of them, are things that I definitely wanted to document, especially for people who shared these identities with me and maybe are looking for someone who speaks about them candidly \u2014 all the good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d\n\nThe memoir also serves as a way to reflect on past traumas from her childhood with a transformed perspective. \u201cI am always writing for, essentially, young Clarkisha and the horrific things she experienced and she witnessed and she couldn\u2019t name at the time.

According to Psychology Today, \u201ctoxic positivity is the act of avoiding, suppressing, or rejecting negative emotions or experiences. This may take the form of denying your own emotions or someone else denying your emotions, insisting on positive thinking instead.\u201d Some believe that the body positivity movement, while well-intentioned, has drifted toward the toxic notion that one should never be allowed to entertain or voice negative thoughts about themselves or their figure.\n\nAdditionally, Kent believes that today\u2019s body positivity movement can be redundant. She sees that certain bodies are celebrated, but others are still overlooked. The author aligns herself more closely with the fat liberation movement, which allows her to have \u201ca shitty day about my body right now and still agree that I don\u2019t deserve to be mistreated because I\u2019m fat. We can hold these two things together. And I don\u2019t think the modern body positivity movement allows us to.\u201d\n\nThe insidiousness of fatphobia extends well beyond a rude comment or two \u2014 Kent also argues that it\u2019s \u201cthe reason for terrible airline seats.\u201d \u201c99.9% [of clothing stores are] not going to carry our sizes,\u201d Kent said. \u201cBeing passed over jobs, being passed over for housing ... fatphobia is all around you.\u201d The messaging that accompanies a world which refuses to accommodate or accept all sizes is clear, despite being largely unspoken. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to fly with us. That\u2019s the message, right? Even though they\u2019re not saying it out loud,\u201d Kent said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us in their fucking store. That\u2019s the silent message, right?\u201d\n\nIn addition to the exploration of fatphobia, Kent believes her work might also be of particular interest to \u201cqueer people who have survived the church ... because I tried to really go into detail about how my journey to really discovering and also owning my queerness was extremely hampered and put to the test because of the church.\u201d This profound account of her life works to empower and liberate readers who may relate to Kent by outlining \u201chow we might begin the difficult \u2014 but joyful \u2014 work of setting ourselves free.\u201d\n\nThe memoir\u2019s message is, crucially, a gesture of support, Kent says, to \u201cBlack queer people [who] will relate to the experiences that I have laid out. So I definitely want to dedicate this work to them as well, because the world really does not like us. And sometimes that world includes our community, and it can be very sad. But I just want them to know that we\u2019re going to be okay. And it\u2019s going to be tough, but we have each other.\u201d \n```"}

The Huskies dominated the rest of the field with near-unprecedented levels of transcendent team play, the likes of which this tournament may never see again. The victory puts UConn in a tie for fourth all-time in titles alongside Duke and Indiana while still trailing North Carolina (6), Kentucky (8), and UCLA (11). Those five schools - along with Kansas, which holds four national championships of its own - make up the elite inner circle of Division 1 basketball known as the \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s ludicrous that that moniker exists in the first place, but since it does, I think it\u2019s time for UConn to join the party. The Huskies run since 1999 is among the best in history. Over that timeframe, they have won five national championships in as many appearances as UCLA and Duke and played in six Final Fours. I don\u2019t know about you, but that screams elite to me. If we\u2019re going to include the Hoosiers as a blue blood, it\u2019s only fair to say the Huskies are as well.\n\nFor one thing, Indiana hasn\u2019t been relevant in two decades. To join this exclusive club, a team needs to be consistently well regarded in both the regular season and in the tournament. Indiana has had only one Elite 8 appearance since 2002 and one championship (1987) since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. UConn\u2019s numbers post-expansion absolutely dwarf Indiana\u2019s. It\u2019s not even a contest. Most importantly, they\u2019re not even blue. That should be the bare minimum. So either they\u2019re both in, or Indiana\u2019s out, too.\n\nIf the argument is all-time legacy and total wins, then sure, UConn doesn\u2019t really rival any of those top 5. They\u2019re still 187 wins away from fifth-place UCLA. Furthermore, while UConn has the championship pedigree, their consistency as a top program could be considered questionable. After all, they weren\u2019t regarded as such until they won their first banner in \u201899, and obviously most if not all of their best seasons record-wise have occurred in the 24-year window since. The Huskies also failed to make the tournament for the majority of the years throughout the 2010s.\n\nConsidering Kansas hasn\u2019t missed it since George H.W. Bush was in office and the other four programs have made it pretty consistently throughout the turn of the century, UConn definitely falters in that department. But what does \u201cblue blood\u201d really even mean? I think of three things: titles, consistency, and relevancy...and blue has to be one of your school colors. Five championships? That\u2019s already more than Kansas. Consider the title\u2019s benchmark checked off.\n\nNow for consistency. Like I said before, Kansas has made the tournament every year for 30-plus years, but that\u2019s only resulted in two national championships. Not only has UConn won more than twice that amount, but they\u2019ve managed to do so with three separate head coaches. And they\u2019re also the only program to have won a championship in each of the past four decades. That sounds pretty consistent to me.\n\nBut have they been relevant throughout? Well, yeah. A big part of that has to do with the fact that when they do make the tournament, they tend to do rather well. I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s not too much of a point in making the tournament if you don\u2019t win it all anyway. When they do make the tournament, the Huskies seem to have continually taken advantage. I\u2019m willing to bet that even the most casual of college basketball fans remember that Kemba Walker-led run from 2011.\n\nThat brings me back to the crux of my argument: winning. Without a lot of winning, you are not not even a good program, let alone an elite program. But UConn wins. They win in the regular season. They win in the Big East. And most importantly, they win when it matters most, in March. And they\u2019ve done a better job at that than these so-called blue bloods over the past quarter century.\n\nActually, the real point of this is that this kind of thing is stupid and doesn\u2019t matter. Fans and analysts are dumb for giving immortal status to a few teams of the hundred-plus Division 1 men\u2019s college basketball programs across the country just because they\u2019ve won a couple of games over the past century. Who honestly cares which colleges should be considered blue blood elites and which one\u2019s aren\u2019t? I don\u2019t. That\u2019s why I wrote this. A men\u2019s team in a Power 5 conference that has been a threat for two and a half decades, produced a solid number of professional stars, and earned a literal handful of rings, deserves that same kind of status. Oh, and you can\u2019t forget about that beautiful shade of navy blue. That seals the deal right there. Bark bark.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Creative Commons)\n\nBy Sixx Orange April 07, 2023 at 2:35 pm PDT\n\nUSC has a known history of producing professional athletes. But beyond that, USC has equipped many Trojan women to change the culture in the sports industry behind the scenes. The sports industry has been male-dominated for centuries, whether in broadcast, media, analytics or any head position. According to Sports Business, women generally hold positions of responsibility in between 10% and 20% of the total jobs in the sports industry field. Every day, women must prove themselves capable of being involved in the industry that claims to be a \u201cman\u2019s game.\u201d Therefore, the women who continue to persevere and break the mold need to be recognized.\n\nHolding the position of director of football Communications for USC is Katie Ryan, who graduated with her master\u2019s degree in strategic public relations from USC in 2022. Ryan oversees all media about the coaching staff or any of the 101 players on the roster. Whether on or off the field, the realm of football is fairly male-centric and a huge undertaking for everyone involved. For Ryan, this was something she was prepared for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked in this space for about 10 years and you need to know the game, be able to talk the talk and walk the walk and immerse yourself in it,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up playing football, so I had to learn the game ... I read countless articles, I watched countless games, I would talk to my dad growing up and he would bring me to USC football practice when I was a kid just to learn as much as possible.\u201d\n\nThese women are blazing a path for others who feel there may be no place for women in the sports business.\n\n\u201cThe Trojan family is real,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI can think of countless members of the media right now that are Trojans and want to offer help [to other women], whether it\u2019s a phone call, advice or an internship.\u201d\n\nIsabel Castillo is a production assistant on the production and talent development team at FOX Sports \u2014 not to mention a 2021 graduate of USC. Castillo has worked on various sporting events with NASCAR, WWE and the Super Bowl LVII. While Castillo herself is marking milestones in her career, the women around her continue to play the part of role models and influence her future aspirations.\n\n\u201cWhen I meet all of these women in different areas of sports, it gives me hope that maybe one day I can be in those areas of achievement and really give back to other women and continue that cycle,\u201d Castillo said.\n\nClosing the gap between women and sports is not only for the benefit of aspiring women but also for the betterment of the industry itself. Gia Larez is the assistant director of sports brands and communication for USC Athletics and graduated with her master\u2019s degree from USC in 2020.\n\n\u201cWomen offer a different perspective and voice that I think is truly valuable in the sports world,\u201d Larez said. Women and men have the same goal when it comes to athletics: to appreciate sports, the athletes and to share that passion with the world.\n\n\u201cI realized that [Division I] athletes face numerous struggles off the field that aren\u2019t recognized,\u201d Larez said. \u201cThat piqued my interest to work in college athletics and find ways to help student athletes reduce distractions off the field so that they can focus on their performance on the field.\u201d\n\nThese women are trailblazing for people of all genders. They are powerful. They are resilient. They are women of USC.\n```"}

After finishing 10th at the PING/ASU Invitational in late March, the team was able to pick up its stride and enter the top five this week. USC finished fifth in this tournament last year and won it in both 2018 and 2021.\n\nAfter the first day, freshman Catherine Park led the Trojans after shooting a 70, with the team finishing at 6 over par \u2014 10 shots behind the leader, Northwestern. On the second day, the Trojans moved up two spots to fourth place with another under-par round from Park as well as an even-par round from junior Christine Wang.\n\n\u201cWe put ourselves in position early in the second round to make a move and get in really close contention to win the tournament going into the final day, and then made a bunch of errors late which cost us,\u201d head coach Justin Silverstein said.\n\nAfter the final day, USC finished with a team score of 22 over (294-297-295) and was 7 over in the final round. Park shot a 73 on the final day to tie for second place individually with a combined three-day score of 2 under par (70-71-73), just three shots behind first place. This was Park\u2019s fifth career finish in the top 20 and the best finish of her college golf career.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty spectacular, she played really well, she had a really good chance to win that golf tournament going into the back nine [on the final day], and put herself in a really good position,\u201d Silverstein said of Park. \u201cShe\u2019s been working really hard and really smart, so that was a really clear highlight of the week.\u201d\n\nSenior Malia Nam also produced a top-20 individual performance after not competing for a month. Nam tied for 15th with a final cumulative score of 7 over par (74-77-72) and shot the Trojans\u2019 best score in the final round.\n\nNorthwestern ended up winning the invitational with a three-day combined score of 9 over par. USC was missing one of its strongest players, Amari Avery, who is currently ranked 11th in the Women\u2019s Amateur Golf Rankings. She was given the week off after competing in both the Ping/ASU Invitational as well as the Augusta National Women\u2019s Golf Amateur last weekend.\n\nDespite Avery not being in the lineup, the Trojans still played strong and finished in the top five. \u201cI think that us being able to compete in a top five college event at that level without Amari Avery in our lineup proved to the rest of the team that they\u2019re capable of putting up a really good finish without her,\u201d Silverstein said.\n\nSilverstein explained that the team\u2019s biggest challenge was their mental games, which led to bad decisions being made during rounds which cost the players many shots. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the issue, they\u2019re aware of the issue, and we\u2019re working on it,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a snap-your-fingers fix, but we\u2019re excited to get back to practice tomorrow and continue working on these things, and I think the work we\u2019ve put in all year on that stuff will start paying dividends eventually and it kind of needs to because we\u2019re getting ready for the postseason in about a week and a half.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will begin the postseason with the Pac-12 Championships in Phoenix, Arizona, at Papago Golf Course on April 17-19. \u201cOur expectation is to win every tournament or put ourselves in a position to win every tournament that we play,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cThat\u2019s the standard that\u2019s been set here over the years.\u201d\n```"}

Jeffrey Lee has more on the significance of the event.\n\nMostly what I wanted to say is congratulations...I just love it when we have these opportunities to talk about each other\u2019s culture. And I love it that people from all cultures love to participate in it. That was USC President Carol Folt, who spoke earlier today at the at the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month Kickoff Celebration.\n\nAmid performances from student groups, guest speakers, and free food, attendants of the event weighed in on why they found the celebration to be so important to them. Jeffrey Dang is a junior at USC. He found a community through events like the kickoff celebration.\n\nDang: I\u2019m from Louisiana, so like out of a school of 2000 people, I was maybe like one of only like five Asians there. So like, these events are or the first opportunity my life I\u2019ve had to I connect with my culture and like peers my age from like a similar ethnic background.\n\nAda Yeh is a USC alum and is also the President of the Asian Pacific Alumni Association. She sees this event as a way to highlight the diversity in the Asian community, both in terms of countries and socio-economic statuses.\n\nYeh: I think that we tend to not have corporate support in terms of scholarships and funding because the assumption is that Asians are doing fine. There\u2019s a lot of first generation college students, parents that are blue collar workers, hard working non-college backgrounds where the students really don\u2019t get to come to USC or to certain schools of stature or, you know, private schools because they can\u2019t afford it. So I think that if we can get our stories out there and that there\u2019s a general a more real understanding of our community, that other groups would come to the forefront and also support the Asian community.\n\nGoing forward, community members like Glenn Osaki, who is a senior advisor for international communications and marketing at the University of Southern California and part of the Asian Pacific Islander Faculty and Staff Association, want to further help AAPI students in their work.\n\nOsaki: We want to be mentors and we want to help them in advancing their career and networking and things like that. So we\u2019re starting to work with a parser and a pass to be able to identify those ways that we as adults who have worked in the profession can support our students more.\n\nSo this AAPI Heritage Month, keep in mind the incredible diversity that exists in the AAPI community, enjoy any upcoming performances and of course the food, and celebrate with us!\n```"}

We have ten artists featured here today in about a semi half circle, each one deserving a portrait in each winner, having an audio story dedicated to said artist. So this is an exhibit on Los Angeles hip hop. The purpose of this project is for my practicum or my capstone project. The reason why I chose Los Angeles hip hop is because in the world of public diplomacy, the purpose is to engage foreign publics through a state and non-state actors. And what that means is that you engage people from lands in places that you\u2019re not familiar with through means that you are familiar with. So what I chose to do is know what I know the best and use hip hop culture as a means to communicate with people all across the world, which are heavily concentrated here at USC.\n\nSafira Khan: Yeah, definitely. And what kind of inspired you to take on this idea for this project?\n\nCline: Well, I\u2019m an audio journalist, as you know, and I have experience putting together stories and I like the idea of storytelling, and I think storytelling is an essential tool to communicate with people who are different from you. So if you see right here, each one of these pictures has a QR code attached to them, and each one of these QR codes tell about two or two and a half minute story regarding to the specific artist or event happening at a specific posting. So if you were to scan that Tupac poster right there, would tell you about two and a half minute story about the life of Tupac.\n\nKhan: The following is an excerpt of Spencer\u2019s exhibit on the story of Tupac, told by Spencer himself.\n\nCline: Tupac was more than just a rapper. He was a visionary, a poet and a voice for a generation of young people who were searching for hope and meaning in the world that often seemed hostile and unjust.\n\nKhan: What do you hope people get out of this exhibition?\n\nCline: Well, there are certainly people who know the subject matter. What I hope to get out of it is reach an audience that hasn\u2019t known about the subject matter. So we have to we have to set out a target audience on who we want this exhibit to impact and reach out to. And I specifically pointed out people who are not from Los Angeles. More specifically, international students.\n\nKhan: How do you think that, you know, having it be audio focused is different or more powerful or more impactful?\n\nSpencer Cline: Well, audio is easier in my in my respect, I believe it\u2019s more it\u2019s more mobile, too. No one wants to sit down and watch a video for two and a half minutes for every single exhibit. I think this lets them in their ears and look at the art themselves. And also I just copy and paste sort of what I\u2019ve seen in other museums and other exhibitions I\u2019ve seen across the country.\n\nKhan: Yeah, definitely. I think. Just to finish this off. What what have you learned from this project? You know, as someone who is an audio creator and how have you possibly grown from this?\n\nCline: I would say that in order to get people to listen, you got to make them feel interesting. And the way to do that, there are various strategies. So I did send an invitation via Slack, via Facebook, Google, you know, all the other social media sites. But the most important guest is the one that shows up on the day who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.

But Curry\u2019s discography is much more than just \u201cUltimate\u201d. The rapper has come out with seven other hit albums and other successful singles and eps.\n\nDarcy Hatcher is a sophomore loves Springfest. He is especially excited about this year\u2019s headliner. \nDarcy Hatcher: Denzel\u2019s going to be super high energy, it\u2019s going to be super fun. But, while you\u2019re waiting for Denzel, go check out the student stages.\n\nCurry\u2019s music touches a large range of genres, from cloud rap to drill hip hop. Zak Syed: I love his music but to be honest I love him as a person, his energy is so different. That\u2019s Zak Syed. He\u2019s a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies. He\u2019s about to cover the event as part of the USC Concert Committee\u2019s Media Team and is looking forward to seeing Curry\u2019s performance. He talked about his hopes of getting the perfect photo.\n\nSyed: I just want to get a shot of him interacting with the crowd really well, a dream is always an artists jumping into the crowd and getting that shot of them. But don\u2019t just come for the headliner. Syed says there\u2019s more that Springfest has to offer, including USC student performers.\n\nSyed: I think the student artists are really fun. I had a great time last year during the student artist. They\u2019re really high energy. The artist is right in front of you. It\u2019s just you, your camera and then the USC audience. It\u2019s a surreal experience to see that artist so up close and personal and to see like the people who are at the barricade, they have so much energy, they\u2019re so excited.\n\nLook forward for Springfest 2023 tomorrow admission is free but don\u2019t forget to register at myrecsports.usc.edu.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Josh Flowers, Maisy White, and Alexis Lara\nApril 06, 2023 at 6:32 pm PDT\n\nWith Ramadan, Passover, and Easter celebrations all taking place this weekend, many college students are reflecting on what their faith means to them. A study conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA found that over the last 30 years, the number of students with no religious affiliation has tripled while their attendance at religious services simultaneously dropped by around 15%. So why are students becoming less religious?\n\nThis weekend will be particularly holy for those who practice any of the three Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Islam, or Christianity. The celebrations of Passover, Ramadan, and Easter will all take place this weekend. These springtime holidays only overlap around every 33 years. Though each is observed differently, the three celebrations serve to bring together communities united by their beliefs. For those who may not practice religion often, these holidays offer an opportunity to reconnect and rediscover religious relationships... or not.\n\nJada Jo: I think I started questioning it in high school. Jada Jo is a USC senior studying theater. Jo: And then when I got here and there wasn\u2019t a family influence that drove me to continue practicing it and I was able to really make those decisions for myself that\u2019s when I made those decisions and realized it didn\u2019t really align with what I believe.\n\nMany students, like Jo, find that their relationship with practicing faith is different now that they\u2019re on their own. That\u2019s the case for communications major Ehi Osifo. Ehi Osifo: When I was younger and I lived in Nigeria, I used to have to go every Wednesday and Sunday, and I felt like it was me being forced to be there rather than me wanting to be there. As soon as I had the option to not go to church, I decided to say no, nada, and I stopped going.\n\nCollege is often depicted as the time in a young adult\u2019s journey where they\u2019re meant to explore all aspects of their lives... including religion. For some, this may mean not practicing religion at all. Others may lessen their practice. And some students discover that being away from home strengthens their faith. Talha Barberousse is a senior studying musical theater. Talha Barberousse: Me and my friends, we go to a church because we like the church and it\u2019s very contemporary, so we just go together on Sundays.\n\nNow they can... because churches have reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic which forced so many places of worship to close. That strongly affected the religious practices of many students like Business Administration major Sophia Malaret. Sophia Malaret: Me and a lot of my friends stopped attending mass when the pandemic started and churches shut down.\n\nFor others, COVID, mortality, all the things we were thinking about during those years made them want to worship more. Public policy major Talia Wansikehian says her faith deepened... at least for a while. Wansikehian: I feel like during the pandemic it was more because you like wanted to keep faith or like a positive mindset, but then after with school, it like went down.\n\nWith the pandemic largely in the rearview mirror for many folks, it will be interesting to see how attendance at religious observances this weekend is affected. As the weekend approaches and millions of people around the world prepare to celebrate by gathering, fasting, praying and more, many students at USC will join in on the festivities while others will continue exploring what religion means to them.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Josh Flowers.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nBy Tatiana Sataua and Sana Mahmud\nApril 06, 2023 at 6:17 pm PDT\n\nA massive oil drilling project approved by the Biden administration went into effect Monday, despite the objections of environmental organizations who believe this plan violates the president\u2019s climate goals. The ConocoPhillips $8 billion Willow Project is a massive oil drill that spans 30 miles on Alaska\u2019s North Slope in the National Petroleum Reserve. The company says the project is expected to produce 600 million barrels of oil as well as adding around 260 million metric tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere over the next 30 years.\n\nAccording to Carbon Brief, one quarter of the United States\u2019 carbon emissions since 2005 come from fossil fuels on public lands. \u201cApproving what would be the largest oil extraction project on federal land is incredibly hypocritical from President Biden, who just in the State of the Union [address] called the climate crisis an existential threat.\u201d said Tyler Kruse, the senior communication specialist with Greenpeace USA.\n\nEarth Justice filed a lawsuit on March 15, when the Biden administration first announced the approval of the Willow Project. The lawsuit was on behalf of many other green groups like Greenpeace USA, who also felt betrayed by the president.\n\nGen Z has joined climate groups in taking the fight for greener solutions to social media. Many videos advocating to stop the Willow Project on TikTok have gone viral along with thousands of reposts to sign the petition to say \u201cno\u201d to the project. The petition had over five million signatures as of Thursday.\n\n\u201cGen Z has carried a lot of that load as far as educating people and spreading the message,\u201d Kruse said. \u201cThere\u2019s one generation that\u2019s actually going to be most impacted by whether or not we act today, and that\u2019s going to be Gen Z. We owe it to them to take action on this thing.\u201d\n\nSamatha Frederico, a freshman studying chemical engineering, said she sees how rough the trade off on both sides is, but says the important thing to consider when approving projects like these is that companies should be more environmentally friendly.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure we have a regulatory framework that regulates these oil companies to make sure they\u2019re being safe, it\u2019s important to be diligent.\u201d Federico said.\u201dIt\u2019s such a dire issue (climate change) it\u2019s going to affect us whether we like it or not, so I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t care about it.\u201d\n\nIndigenous groups on the North Slope like the Native village of Nuiqsut are highly affected by this as well. On one hand, oil revenues fund local governments as well as dividends to shareholders in the region\u2019s Indigenous-owned corporations according to Alaska Department of Revenue analysis. While some have expressed concerns about the impacts to their lifestyles as well as their voices, heritage, and traditions in a recent article by Grist.\n\nWhile some people believe climate efforts that were made in the Inflation Reduction Act have been wasted, Robin Craig, a USC professor of environmental law, doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cThis new oil project takes a while to get up and going. We are not yet positioned in the United States to give up our dependence on petroleum,\u201d Craig said. \u201cIn the Infrastructure Act, it\u2019s going to take some time to get the infrastructure we need for clean energy built.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is currently in a transitional moment by trying to maintain our standard of living and by transitioning to something less energy intensive according to Craig. However, Kruse believes that there is no way to achieve Biden\u2019s initial climate goals and the goals of the Paris agreement without phasing out fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\nAfter the announcement of the Willow Project, data showed that Biden has lost support among young voters as well as independents, according to a poll conducted by Data for Progress. Before the Biden administration announced the Willow Project, 48% of voters ages 18-29 said they approved the way the administration has handled climate change and the environment, but that dropped after the project was announced to now only 35%.\n\nKruse said that approving these types of progress is a \u201cpretty stupid move\u201d for Biden, who is campaigning for reelection in 2024. \u201cThe youth vote and the climate vote is what helped him win the election in the first place. And now he\u2019s betraying those same voters.\u201d he said.\n\nThe Willow Project not only affects the land and species around it, but the surrounding community, too. \u201cPeople should start paying attention to it because it\u2019s happening and it\u2019s preventable,\u201d Kruse said. \u201cIt is something that if we take action now, we can secure a future we can thrive in.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Kassydi Rone and Thomas Johnson\nApril 06, 2023 at 6:00 pm PDT\n\nThe heart of campus beat to a different rhythm today when students stopped by the Alumni Park fountain to immerse themselves in sounds and stories of hip hop history. For his capstone project through the public diplomacy master\u2019s program, Spencer Cline covered over 50 years of the hip hop genre and its origins in South Los Angeles and broader L.A.\n\nAccording to Cline, the public diplomacy curriculum focuses on \u201chow state and non-state actors interact with people who live in other countries,\u201d and an effective way to do this is through cultural exhibits. He mentioned that museums in places like L.A. or New York dedicate exhibits to cultures outside of the U.S. because it gives people a chance to learn about experiences that may be foreign to them.\n\n\u201cWhat I wanted to replicate is having an audio exhibit dedicated to a culture in South Central Los Angeles, which is not really showcased here specifically in a place like USC and academia,\u201d Cline said.\n\nSpectators were greeted with framed posters of influential artists \u2014 like Ice Cube, N.W.A., Tupac, Nipsey Hussle, Kendrick Lamar, Tyler the Creator and Doja Cat \u2014 in chronological order of their prime within the genre. Exhibit attendees scanned QR codes to hear the curated audio with Cline\u2019s narration, archival artist interviews and hit songs.\n\n\u201cI am a fan of almost every one of them,\u201d said Kaustubh Rai, a computer science master\u2019s student. \u201cI thought it was just a display, but then when I started listening to them ... the explanation was so good, and the background music of the artists takes you back to the old songs that you may have forgotten. It was literally remembering back everything I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\nCline himself held a similar sense of nostalgia when choosing a subject for his capstone. He cycled through a few topics, but ultimately settled on hip hop because of his secret love for the genre throughout his childhood.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to listen to rap and hip hop as a kid because my parents were like, \u2018No, it\u2019s degrading music,\u2019\u201d Cline said. \u201cSo, we always went towards gospel, but I would always find a way to sneak rapping in my life. I would rename songs on my iPod as gospel songs, but they were actually like 50 Cent and Jay-Z.\u201d\n\nAs a radio producer at Annenberg Media, Cline understands the effectiveness of audio storytelling. This is not the first time he blended his passion for music with the skills he\u2019s learned in the public diplomacy program.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been able to translate his love of music and his apparent capacity in music into the work that we do in class, and apply it to different concepts in public diplomacy in terms of international exchanges and other types of programs,\u201d said Robert Banks, the Clinical Associate Professor of Public Diplomacy. \u201cYou know, we get a lot of students that do research papers ... but this is a true capstone in the sense that he\u2019s bringing forth a major public-facing exhibit.\u201d\n\nYara Alas, another public diplomacy graduate student, carved out the time to visit the exhibit before a meeting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really rewarding just to see all his efforts come to fruition in one event,\u201d Alas said. \u201cI know he\u2019s very interested in hip hop culture, and he\u2019s mentioned that before in various classes, so it\u2019s fun to see this concise experience.\u201d\n\nWhile USC campus life is often equated to \u201cliving in a bubble,\u201d this project allowed students an accessible opportunity to glimpse into the South Central community culture. According to former USC student Erica Johnson, it\u2019s important, especially at a predominantly white institution, to educate people about what the history of this place is.\n\n\u201cEven though SC is this big conglomerate in the middle of South Central,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSouth Central has a lot of Black and brown people ... who have contributed to the culture and contributed to what Los Angeles is, what hip hop is, and what R&B is.\u201d\n\nJohnson added that she appreciated the strategic placement of the exhibit, as a culmination of people to people connections.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bringing Black people to this white space. Smack dab in the middle of campus for people to not ignore. They have to come by, they have to see this,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThis project is Cline\u2019s last before he graduates with his master\u2019s degree in May. He hopes to work for a publication or radio station as an audio journalist or producer after graduation. After a few years of work, he wants to become a foreign affairs journalist for Voice of America.\n\n\u201cIt feels bittersweet,\u201d Cline said. \u201cThis is a really nice school, [with] really intelligent, smart faculty and some of the best people I ever met. But I\u2019m done with school. Eight years of schooling, and I\u2019m ready to get out into the real world.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/06/the-march-towards-march-what-a-historic-ncaa-tournament-can-tell-us-about-the-future-of-college-basketball/", "response": "```\nThe March Toward March: What a historic NCAA tournament can tell us about the future of college basketball\n\nBy Curran Rastogi April 06, 2023 at 2:33 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d is a column by Curran Rastogi about men\u2019s college basketball teams and their journeys to March Madness. As the final scraps of confetti were cleaned off of the court at NRG Stadium, the 2022-2023 season came to an end. It was a truly historic tournament (especially for my home state of New Jersey), with the second 16-seed upset, a Sweet Sixteen run for Princeton and a new national championship-winning head coach in Dan Hurley. The tournament and season also represent the start of a new era in the college basketball landscape.\n\nFirst of all, congratulations to the UConn Huskies for pulling off the most dominant national championship tournament run ever. The Huskies trailed for a grand total of 5 minutes and 22 seconds in the entire tournament, and if you take away the first half of their first game, that number would be down to a total of 55 seconds. Also, congratulations to Jim Nantz, long-time play-by-play announcer for the Final Four, who announced that this would be his last Final Four. Nantz is a college basketball legend, and his familiar, friendly voice will be missed in future tournaments.\n\nBut, back to the main point of this article, this tournament represents a paradigm shift for college basketball. We, as college basketball fans, saw a new side of the sport with changes in NIL, college eligibility, the transfer portal and recruiting. The result? One of the most memorable tournaments in history.\n\nFor years, NCAA Athletes in major sports like football and basketball have received recruiting money under the table. But, after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling that allowed athletes to make money off their name, image and likeness, the money has been less of a secret. And it\u2019s definitely made an impact. The best example of this is the Miami basketball team. Sophomore guard Nijel Pack infamously transferred to Miami after signing a NIL deal reportedly worth $800,000 that included a car. Senior guard Isaiah Wong threatened to enter the transfer portal after seeing Pack\u2019s NIL deal but ultimately stayed at Miami, receiving more deals. These were two of the best players on Miami\u2019s Final Four team. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with players taking NIL money, Miami doesn\u2019t make the Final Four without NIL. It just demonstrates how important NIL can be if used correctly, as Miami made it to its first Final Four in school history.\n\nThe extra year of eligibility due to COVID has manifested itself in teams like San Diego State. SDSU had four of these seniors in their rotation who played big roles for the team. Guards Adam Seiko and Matt Bradley and forwards Nathan Mensah and Aguek Arop have all exhausted their eligibility. Without these four players and their eligibility, SDSU wouldn\u2019t have gone on the tournament run they did. The Aztecs were full of talent and these players will have to be replaced on top of whoever they lose in the transfer portal. While the extra year of COVID eligibility will not be a factor in a few years, the prevalence of \u201cCOVIDseniors\u201d may lead to more players playing college basketball longer. This includes future graduate transfer students.\n\nThe element that has undoubtedly had the greatest impact is the transfer portal. Looking at the top transfer portal teams, there is a pattern with their success in the NCAA tournament. The No. 3 team in 247Sports\u2019 transfer class rankings is Texas, who was very nearly in the Final Four. Other teams making up the top of the leaderboard include Arkansas, who upset Kansas in the Round of 32, Missouri, who made the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2018 and Miami, whose two transfers ended up being the two of the most important players on the team. This year\u2019s tournament demonstrates that, as a program, hitting the transfer portal and getting the best players will lead to success in college basketball. Looking ahead to next year, centers Hunter Dickinson and Kel\u2019el Ware and guards Max Abmas and Caleb Love will be players who can make immediate impacts for their respective teams. The transfer portal\u2019s importance has been on full display after Georgetown and ex-Providence head coach Ed Cooley recruited players to join him at Georgetown while still officially at Providence.\n\nLastly, high school recruiting has changed with the allure of G-League Ignite and Overtime Elite. Before, blue chip prospects had to spend a year at college or go overseas, but now some of the best players are choosing to play professional basketball in the U.S. and then move to the NBA. Jalen Green infamously did it last year, and this year the prospective No. 2 overall pick, Scoot Henderson, played for G-League Ignite. Along with that, Amen and Ausar Thompson are both projected to be high lottery picks after their season at Overtime Elite. Matas Buzelis, 247Sports\u2019 No. 5 player, is also headed to G-League Ignite and with success may go as high as No. 1 overall. With these options being legitimate opportunities for players to go professional, it presents a new challenge for colleges. Now they must compete with other leagues that can officially pay players in order to land high-profile recruits. This may drain some of the NBA talent from college basketball.\n\nAll of these factors helped make college basketball thrilling to pay attention to this year. While it\u2019s uncertain whether or not college basketball\u2019s new era will prove good or bad for the sport, it\u2019s undeniable that a new era is upon us. \u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

What did that look like, deciding what would furnish the shelves and 34-foot-high walls of his flat? Shirley was also the gifted painter behind the cover of his 1956 record, \u201cOrpheus in the Underworld.\u201d At what hours of the day would he paint? Did Shirley ever sit alone by those lofty windows and look down on New York with the stillness of Lee Kang-sheng in a Ming-liang Tsai film when he couldn\u2019t sleep? Or did his neighbor Marlon Brando and other LGBTQ+ icons in the building join him? How did Shirley wear the raw wounds of heartbreak? Stoically, or proudly on his sleeve as his way of telling the world:  I have loved once before and never again ? Those are the questions that went unanswered in Peter Farrelly\u2019s \u201cGreen Book.\u201d\n\nWhen Shirley died 10 years ago today at 86, he had long left the public eye. Then \u201cGreen Book\u201d thrust Shirley back into the spotlight in 2019 when the film was honored with Best Picture at the 91st Academy Awards \u2014 to the dismay of those  in  and  out  of the Black community who had raised red flags about this telling, including Spike Lee, who attempted to leave before the speeches concluded. Lee\u2019s \u201cDo The Right Thing\u201d didn\u2019t get the Best Picture nomination in 1990, but \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d did \u2014 and it won.\n\n\u201cGreen Book,\u201d named after a travel guide that listed safe places to eat and sleep for traveling African Americans during Jim Crow America, follows a racist Copacabana club bouncer, an Italian American from the Bronx named Frank \u201cTony Lip\u201d Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), who\u2019s hired to drive world-class Jamaican American pianist Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) through the South for a series of concerts that span two months in 1962. Much of the basis for the story came from Lip\u2019s recollection and a few tapes. While \u201cinspired by a true friendship\u201d is far from historical accuracy, as audience members, we have to question the integrity of a story about race filtered through the gaze of a proud, grade-A \u201cbullshit artist\u201d and racist. But even in cinema, the racist gets top billing.\n\nNothing is more disappointing than this outdated exploit with its storybook ending, sanitized ideas of racism in the Jim Crow era, and surface-level condemnation that would\u2019ve weathered the awards circuit in the 1990s, but shouldn\u2019t have done so in 2019. If something like this is validated by the Academy, it only justifies the cyclical production of these films that can\u2019t look past the illusion of unity with any real finesse.\n\nThe opera \"Orpheus in the Underworld\" is a satirical spin on the tragic myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nFarrelly, cautious of both the white and Black savior tropes,  told  Newsweek magazine: \u201cWe were careful not to make this film either of those.\u201d So he made the film about both \u2014 Lip as Shirley\u2019s literal lifesaver as the pianist\u2019s driver (and, for some reason, the man who schools Shirley \u2014 who worked closely with Duke Ellington, but apparently never heard Aretha Franklin sing \u2014 on Black artists of the day), and Shirley the sole person responsible for changing Lip\u2019s ways. But why is it that Shirley was tasked with solving prejudice that he didn\u2019t create, just as countless Black historical figures, activists and characters in cinema have had to do?\n\nThe brilliant essayist and poet Hanif Abdurraqib argues that these films rarely take the most honest and simple approach to their themes: racism is about power, and in order to quell racism, it involves one\u2019s willingness to give up that power. \u201cGreen Book\u201d had everything to do with the harnessing of this power.\n\nAccording to the Shirley family, the making of the film was kept from them until it wrapped. The pianist\u2019s nephew, Edwin Shirley III,  said  his uncle \u201cflatly refused\u201d when he was approached by the Vallelongas about the film in the \u201880s. According to Edwin, Shirley also said: \u201cNo matter what they say to me now, I will not have any control over how I am portrayed.\u201d\n\nAt the premiere of the film, Nick Vallelonga, Lip\u2019s son and \u201cGreen Book\u201d co-writer, told Edwin that the Vallelongas got Shirley\u2019s permission to make the film, but no proof exists. In a  letter  to Black Enterprise magazine penned by Maurice Shirley, the pianist\u2019s then only living brother, he addressed the alleged inaccuracies of the film, such as Shirley\u2019s estrangement from his own family and the Black community, the color of the Cadillac that Shirley rode in the film, and Shirley and Lip\u2019s supposed friendship. The latter has been contested with voice recordings published by  Deadline Hollywood  in which Shirley can be heard alluding otherwise.\n\nEdwin has also argued that Shirley never studied at the Leningrad Conservatory as a child, but his record label pushed that because it was more palatable than Shirley\u2019s HBCU background, which the film avoids. In the book \u201cA Rediscovered Trio\u201d by Evelin T\u00e4ht and Atro Mikkola, Don Shirley Trio cellist Juri T\u00e4ht agrees with Edwin. T\u00e4ht, born in Estonia, was also written as Russian in the film. \u201c[Juri] is quite upset at this fact, and hopefully he will not be remembered simply as a Russian member of the Don Shirley Trio because of the movie,\u201d Evelyn writes. \u201c[Juri] lost a lot in his life because of Stalin and the Russians, and making him one ... there are no words to describe that level of injustice.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the three screenwriters who accepted the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for \u201cGreen Book\u201d were all white men who didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to thank Victor Hugo Green, author of the travel guide, or Shirley in their acceptance speeches (since Shirley allegedly gave them his blessing). After all, would we know about Lip if Shirley hadn\u2019t been who he was?\n\nThe reverence for the film fueled the ongoing passiveness towards the silencing of Black voices, whether it\u2019s voter suppression or educational disparities. The filmworkers involved, including Lip\u2019s character in the film, are one and the same as Americans who insist on the consumption of and benefit from Black culture, talent and ideas without having anything to do with Black people.\n\nBut all this didn\u2019t matter because the film soothed Academy voters and America\u2019s insecurities tied to its longstanding, troubling relationship with the Black community. The pacing of movie logic can\u2019t believably absolve a crass understanding of generational and institutional racism, nor can the film be something more when little can be truly understood of Shirley, the most enigmatic person in the film by far, as a man without the shepherding by white people.\n\nWhen Lip writes a letter to his wife from the road, he brings up Shirley: \u201cHe\u2019s like a genius, I think. When I look at him in the rearview mirror, I can tell he\u2019s always thinking about stuff in his head. I guess that\u2019s what geniuses do. But it don\u2019t look fun to be that smart.\u201d Lip also notes: \u201cBut sometimes I think he gets sad and that\u2019s why he drinks too much.\u201d But why should the depths of Shirley\u2019s intellect, despair or joy go only as far as Lip\u2019s gaze?\n\nEven Shirley\u2019s attraction to men (Shirley never came out himself, this was on Lip\u2019s word and everyone ran with it) is only ever suggested in a sequence and immediately brushed off in the film \u2014 as if that detail was included to simply provoke. Yes, Ali shares almost the same screen time as his lead actor, Mortensen, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean equality because we know Lip more intimately than we ever will Shirley.\n\nAnd I\u2019d bet my bottom dollar that if this were told from the perspective of Shirley, we could all learn something new for a change.\n\nEarlier this year, I picked up Hanif Abdurraqib\u2019s \u201cA Little Devil in America,\u201d a masterful and poignant chronicle of Black performance. In one chapter, the author gives us an alternative to the Shirley interpretation in Farrelly\u2019s film. \u201cI want a movie in which Don Shirley is driven but doesn\u2019t feel the need to speak to the white driver,\u201d Abdurraqib writes. \u201cA movie in which we don\u2019t even know the driver\u2019s name, but we know what Don Shirley\u2019s favorite flower is by the way he rolls down his window and cranes his neck toward a field when the car drives by.\u201d\n\nTo me, this feels like a single cloud in a sea of blue. Abdurraqib makes us conscious of the mundane and transcendental moments that the pianist potentially embraced in between inventing his own sound. Thumbing through the pages of a magazine, laying flowers on the burial site of a loved one and then retreating to his solitude, going to the movies.\n\nI imagine that Barry Jenkins would offer his patience and tenderness for these moments, or the musicality of Shirley\u2019s mannerisms and thoughts could manifest itself through Steve McQueen\u2019s eloquence. But tone deaf and uninspired studios, filmmakers and Academy voters would much rather celebrate the chicken banter between a musical genius and his white driver instead of giving the due to one Black man\u2019s forgotten legacy, so as to monetize the satisfaction of a cut-and-dry solution for racism in America.\n\nJosef Astor\u2019s documentary, \u201cLet It Shine: Don Shirley in His Own Words,\u201d will likely be the definitive film of Shirley\u2019s prime, as an aged Shirley recalls various moments in his life in the trailer. But the release date remains unknown.\n\nAnd it\u2019s unlikely that Shirley will get an official biography anytime soon, but writers such as Abdurraqib give the reader every reason to value Shirley\u2019s personhood, even as \u201cGreen Book\u201d has minimized it. \u201cMy favorite thing about Don Shirley is not that he was a genius who led a sometimes spectacular life,\u201d Abdurraqib writes. \u201cIt is that in the moments in between, he likely led a life that was very normal. And that is spectacular too.\u201d\n\nToday marks a decade since Shirley died of heart disease. Perhaps the greatest account of his little bohemia in the sky is in the tapestry of emotions that form when Shirley plays his scales, true as the one before it, and more akin to this thing called life than any Hollywood clich\u00e9.\n```"}

USC welcomed the Lions to Dedeaux Field after a riveting series win against Pac-12 opponent Utah. The recent tear from the Trojans \u2014 winners of seven of their last nine \u2014 puts USC and first-year head coach Andy Stankiewicz in Baseball America\u2019s College Top 25 rankings for the first time since week four in 2022. This was the first time USC was ranked in the Top 25 after week five since 2015 when the Trojans made NCAA regionals.\n\nJunior pitcher Jaden Agassi was on the bump for the Trojans as they looked to win the first game of their upcoming five-game homestand. After getting roughed up early, USC found itself in an early 3-0 hole. The Trojans responded in the second thanks to senior designated hitter Adrian Colon-Rosado\u2019s first longball of the year. Freshman second baseman Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek ripped a two-run double down the line shortly thereafter, tying the game at three. After exchanging runs, the Trojans entered the fifth trailing 5-4. Senior third baseman Johnny Olmstead got the inning started with a bunt single; implementing small ball to apply pressure on the opposing defense is a common theme for USC\u2019s success this season. Colon-Rosado immediately followed up Olmstead\u2019s hit with an RBI single. A bloop single from freshman first baseman Ethan Hedges drove in two more, giving the Trojans a 7-5 lead.\n\nUSC\u2019s offense poured it on in the sixth when LMU walked the first three Trojan hitters to load the bases for senior right fielder Cole Gabrielson. Gabrielson broke the game open, driving a bases-clearing double down the left-field line. USC scored one more run to lengthen its lead to 11-5. Freshman reliever Michael Ebner made his collegiate debut for the Trojans in the eighth, retiring the side in order. After allowing a few runs in the top of the ninth, senior Kyle Wisch entered the game for USC, closing the door on the Lions\u2019 comeback bid. Wisch earned his third save of the season as the Trojans defeated LMU 11-9.\n\nUSC baseball has now won 12 of its last 15 games, bolstering its record to 17-10-1 on the season. The Trojans aim to stay hot as they welcome San Diego State at home for a three-game series beginning Thursday night. Senior and Pac-12 Pitcher of the Week Tyler Stromsburg will likely take the bump for USC on Thursday as he looks to hurl his fifth straight quality start for the Trojans.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Amy Harris/Invision/AP, File)\n\nBy Zachary Gibbs\nApril 05, 2023 at 8:14 pm PDT\n\nTyler, The Creator has experimented with rap, R&B, lo-fi, and soul music throughout his career, but in \u201cCall Me If You Get Lost: The Estate Sale,\u201d the deluxe edition of his Grammy-winning sixth studio album, Tyler proves once again that he is truly a rapper at heart. Tyler has defined the \u201cCall Me If You Get Lost\u201d era by giving fans a throwback to his Odd Future days, where he was known for his grimy flows. And the \u201cEstate Sale\u201d ties all of these elements together to poetically conclude this chapter of Tyler\u2019s career.\n\nHe illustrates his versatility as a rapper as he effortlessly glides onto both dark and serene instrumentals. No matter the type of song, Tyler can simply execute as a rapper. For instance, \u201cStuntman,\u201d featuring rapper Vince Staples is a track that exhibits Tyler\u2019s ability to glide on a piercing and thundering beat. This track resembles \u201cYonkers\u201d from his first studio album, \u201cGoblin,\u201d as it creates this villainous energy through the hard-hitting bass that truly makes you want to run through a brick wall.\n\nTo contrast \u201cStuntman,\u201d Tyler proceeds to peacefully admire the beauty of life in \u201cHeaven to Me,\u201d which samples John Legend\u2019s 2006 track \u201cHeaven.\u201d Tyler has shown that he is never truly satisfied, even with his colossal success, but on this track he decides to illustrate the idea that the secret to having it all in life is knowing that you already do. This track illustrates Tyler stopping to smell the roses and appreciating what life has to offer. Although this track has sentimental value, he still is able to effortlessly flow on the beat, regardless of its tranquility and the calmer energy than the other tracks.\n\nThe most notable track in this project is the outro, \u201cSorry Not Sorry.\u201d This monumental track serves as a monologue where Tyler reflects on his life decisions and apologizes for his past mistakes throughout his time in the spotlight. A lyric that stands out is \u201cSorry to my old friends. The stories we could\u2019ve wrote if our egos didn\u2019t take the pen.\u201d Similarly to \u201cHeaven To Me,\u201d this track is more of an example of the calm side of Tyler as a rapper. Instead of an optimistic approach, though, this track is more of a remorseful message to some of the closest and most important people in his life, specifically as his family and closest friends, for his perceived lack of support.\n\nAlthough the change of tone is drastic when you compare tracks like \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d and \u201cStuntman,\u201d Tyler ties everything together by creating this feeling that he\u2019s reading the pages to the novel that is his life. The infinite ways Tyler can express himself through his skillful rapping is what allows fans to see the many sides of him and to better understand who he truly is.\n\nWhen reflecting on this era of Tyler, The Creator\u2019s career, what stands out most is that even if he ventures into other musical lanes, he has always shown the ability to be the rapper that made him the creator he is today. \u201cCall Me If You Get Lost: The Estate Sale\u201d is available to stream on Apple Music, Spotify and other streaming services.\n```"}

New Genesis is an audio series about the Black woman reporter and executive experience. On today\u2019s episode, we have a special guest, the Vice President of Original Content and Entertainment at NFL Media, Angela Ellis.\n\nMy first question for you is how does it feel to be the first person in your position in original content at NFL media? And what kind of legacy do you want to leave in this position?\n\nELLIS: That\u2019s a big question. It\u2019s a big responsibility. I just started in this role. I\u2019ve been with the NFL for two years in July, and there\u2019s always been great content that comes out of the NFL. Whether it\u2019s NFL films, our shows on NFL Network to NFL 360, which is one of our magazine type longform storytelling series that\u2019s won several Emmys and broken records. There\u2019s always been great content, but never all put under one umbrella with a focus that is looking at a strategy for how this department grows. How do we get our content out there? More and more people see what we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s really being able to set for the first time the direction for a department. And then now it\u2019s figuring out the right strategy for what content goes where and how we can keep raising the bar and the stories that we tell.\n\nMy next question for you is how has the transition been working daytime to sports, especially since those are two totally different audiences?\n\nELLIS: The daytime experience was a nice bridge between the majority of what my career was in news. And when I decided to make that transition first to know that I was ready to move out of news and still figure out a role in the media space and storytelling; but that wasn\u2019t tied to the news cycle. When the opportunity came up to work in daytime, I looked at it as an opportunity to get more information. Could this be the type of show or storytelling that could be the next step for me? But it was a really great experience where I learned more than what I did in the news. And then I was able to take things that I learned from news and my past experience to this industry, to sports. And in the end, when I got the call from a recruiter about this position, what they kept telling me was \u201cno we want a different perspective. We don\u2019t want someone who comes up with the same traditional way of telling sports stories because in the end it\u2019s storytelling.\u201d What\u2019s an interesting story to tell? Our approach is called Helmet\u2019s off, so players take their helmet off. Who are they in the world off the field, and what are the things that they do and how do they contribute? Those are the stories that we like to focus on that give this other picture of them not just as athletes on the field.\n\nMy next question is regarding original content. What are your thoughts on social media today versus the ideal future?\n\nELLIS: Seeing in the course of my career how much this new technology and platforms have changed how we tell stories, I think it happened more quickly than anybody anticipated. And there are more platforms that are now for streaming. At some point I feel we\u2019re going to hit a ceiling? Right now there\u2019s so much content everywhere, it\u2019s going to reach its saturation. So it\u2019s a flood of content to reset and figure out what\u2019s going to be the next thing.\n\nThat\u2019s a wrap for New Genesis. Stay tuned in for more episodes.

Open to all majors, Spanish Language News Media Production is now available to USC students to take in the fall semester.\n\nAllan Lopez, USC adjunct instructor and professor of this class, said the class is going to be valuable because the school is expanding its offerings to Latinx audiences and students. \u201cFor our communities, the language is really important, and for a lot of aspiring journalists, Spanish language news is a place that is a stepping stone and maybe is a career path,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that we have the leaders like Dean [Willow] Bay, [School of Journalism] director Gordon Stables and associate director Rebecca Haggerty who have been open and willing to create this space.\u201d\n\nThe new class included in Annenberg\u2019s curriculum could open more doors for Latinx and Hispanic journalists or writers who want to build a bilingual career or feel closer to their culture by sharing content with their communities. \u201cWe know that Spanish language media like Univision, Telemundo, TV Azteca, are such important players in the field,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important for students who are interested in those areas to have those opportunities and to have a class to be able to go down this path.\u201d\n\nThe class also counts towards the new Latinx news media minor that Annenberg has been offering to journalism students since the beginning of the year to provide the tools and experience students may need to create content for Latinx and Hispanic audiences.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually really excited to hear about this new class coming up,\u201d said Maria Robles, a sophomore majoring in communication. \u201cJust hearing about this class, especially with Allan Lopez being our professor ...

{"key": "/2023/04/05/as-usc-baseball-surges-attendance-falls/", "response": "```\nAs USC baseball surges, attendance falls\n\nBy Samuel Spitz April 05, 2023 at  6:06 pm PDT\n\nEven if you build it, they still may not come. New head coach Andy Stankiewicz has gotten the USC baseball team off to a 17-10-1 start, a very good sign after a few underwhelming seasons. This start even earned them a spot in Baseball America\u2019s Top 25 poll earlier this week. Despite this vast improvement in play, attendance at USC baseball games is down. In fact, it is the  lowest number  since USC started keeping track of attendance in 2018.\n\nDuring the 2018 and 2019 seasons, the Trojans brought in roughly 599 and 542 fans per game, respectively. Even in 2020, while a pandemic was beginning to storm through the country, Dedeaux Field was attracting 650 fans per game. In 2022, after two years of being held out of attending games, the Trojans were drawing about 573 fans per game. But in 2023, that trend appears to be changing. And not for the better. Through the first 16 home games of the season, the Trojans are only averaging 454 fans at their games despite their fast start.\n\nCrosstown rival UCLA is not having the same problem. In the same time period of 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022, the Bruins brought in over 1,000 fans per game in both 2018 and 2019. Earlier this season, USC was forced to move their three-game series with Auburn to Alabama because of bad weather. And even with a game that was not originally on the schedule, Auburn fans showed up. In three games with the Trojans, Auburn put up attendance numbers of 2,809, 3,313, and 2,813 fans.\n\nSo why does a baseball program that has produced MLB sluggers like Mark McGwire and former Cy Young winners like Randy Johnson, Barry Zito and Tom Seaver struggle to attract fans? \u201cI know USC has a good baseball team, but I have just never really been interested in going,\u201d said Andrew Turquie, a junior majoring in intelligence and cyber operations. \u201cThe atmosphere on campus is more based around football and basketball, but I never see any advertisements or hype for baseball games.\u201d\n\nThe lack of success the Trojans have had over the past two decades probably does not help. The Trojans have not made an appearance in the College World Series since 2001, even though they are one of the most historically successful and relevant college baseball programs of all time. \u201cThe basketball team will get a buzz because they\u2019ve got a guy who\u2019s ranked No. 1 among the five-star players out there,\u201d said Jeff Fellenzer, USC professor and longtime Trojan baseball supporter. \u201cI saw it with O.J. Mayo years ago. He had a big name and people heard the name so they came to the Galen Center to see him play.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the Trojans do not have a huge star, and it might be holding them back. Going to baseball games is a classic, simple spring pastime, but students simply are not going to games. The problems the Trojans have might not only be limited to their play on the field. With the students making up a strong part of the passionate USC fanbase, they do not even know about the games. Multiple students even expressed that they had little to no interest in attending in the future.\n\n\u201cI would maybe go if my friends were going, but that\u2019s about it,\u201d freshman business major Lauren Orlando said. There may even be a reason for the general lack of interest. \u201cStudents just are not plugged into the sport. College baseball, even though I love it, I still would call it an acquired taste,\u201d Fellenzer said. \u201cIn my class, when I offer extra credit [for going to games], a couple of people have gone and said that it was the first baseball game they have gone to, but that they really enjoyed it.\u201d```"}

Some of the other event highlights for the weekend include a panel with the executive editor of the L.A. Times Kevin Merida. There will also be a conversation with Matthew Perry about his new book, \u201cFriends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,\u201d and a panel with Jeff Pearlman and Jason Reid about their respective books about athletes. Pearlman has written several best-selling books about the NFL, NBA and MLB, and Jason Reid recently wrote \u201cThe Rise of the Black Quarterback: What It Means for America,\u201d which was released in August 2022.\n\nEmily Starr, a USC sophomore studying political science and Spanish, was a volunteer at the festival last year. Starr was in charge of welcoming people in as they entered. As a self-proclaimed avid book lover, Starr recounts loving the events that took place last year and walking around the book-filled campus.\n\n\u201cIt was really fun how many families were there, and there are specific sections for different interests which I thought was really cool,\u201d Starr said. \u201cIt just feels like one massive Barnes and Noble but in a really fun and interactive way and you get to meet the authors and I think it\u2019s just a really cool space.\u201d\n\nAdam Rosen, USC\u2019s vice president of cultural relations and university events, has been attending the festival for nearly 13 years. Rosen\u2019s main role in coordinating the festival specifically is to work with the L.A. Times and decide on appropriate dates to hold the event.\n\nFor people who have never attended the festival and plan on doing so this year, Rosen would advise to see everything it has to offer from different authors there, celebrity guests and booths.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much in the booths, and it changes every year,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cDepending on where your interests are, whether it\u2019s comic books, graphic novels or fiction, there\u2019s so much tucked into every corner of the university.\u201d\n\nIn the time the festival has been held at USC, the community on campus and in the surrounding area have embraced the event as an annual tradition. Rosen says the festival has become so well-known that it draws crowds from outside of L.A. that include people from San Diego, Santa Barbara and even overseas.\n\n\u201cI think the reason that the university really wanted to hold the festival here was to bring in the community,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much you can do at the festival and so much that is tied to what I think we as a university stand for when we talk about learning and literacy.\u201d\n```"}

Joggers are taking the scenic route on their daily morning runs. Families are enjoying the grassy hills and bright blue skies. And your occasional happy couple is having a romantic picnic underneath the lush trees. But soon this community park may soon be home to an aerial electric gondola hanging from cables about a hundred feet in the air.\n\nThe L.A. Aerial Rapid Transit project or LA ART for short hopes to create a new and faster way for Dodgers fans and concert goers to get from Union Station to Dodger Stadium.\n\nPHYLLIS LING: How it makes me feel is kind of a little bit exasperated and exhausted. it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Phyllis Ling IS an organizer with the Stop the Gondola project and a current resident of Chinatown.\n\nLING: My house would actually be across the street from one of the intermediate stations. There\u2019ll be three intermediate stations. Phyllis would live across the street from the Chinatown Station. The proposed plan is to connect the line from union station over alameda street and up bishops road to Dodger Stadium \u2014 right through the heart of Chinatown.\n\nLING: You know, they\u2019re making it big so that they can have that 5000 per hour maximum capacity that they\u2019re talking about. And they\u2019re telling us they\u2019re running 18 hours per day. So, yeah, it would be pretty, pretty invasive for me and for my neighbors, too.\n\nAnd she\u2019s right, the plan is to have three gondolas operate year-round. So in her free time, she and her mom create flyers in Chinese and English and go door to door to keep her neighbors informed. But she says her neighbors have a lot of questions and so does she.\n\nLIN: For a long time we were promised that we would have a lot of our questions answered in the draft D.I.R. And then when we kind of looked into the draft D.I.R., it seemed like they weren\u2019t really answering a lot of those questions.\n\nShe says questions like privacy when the gondola is traveling over her neighborhood, structural integrity for earthquake, and maintenance for when the gondola breaks down.\n\nAnd Phyllis is not alone in her concerns for the community. JINTANA WILLIAMS: The gondola, you know, hasn\u2019t had a lot of community input.\n\nJintana Williams lives nearby the route to Dodger Stadium.\n\nWILLIAMS: Chinatown has been a community that\u2019s been rapidly gentrified over the last few years. And this plaza is like a really, actually great example of it. // What experience do they have to be building this horrendous eyesore? I don\u2019t understand. Like, I truly don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s even gone this far.\n\nJintana is an organizer with Chinatown Community for Equitable Development or CCED for short. CCED has an extensive background fighting for the rights of the working class tenants in Chinatown.\n\nThe 125 million dollar project is funded by former Dodgers owner, Frank McCourt. He promises the project won\u2019t displace any residents since the gondola runs along public right-of-ways. Jintana disagrees.\n\nI reached out to LA ART for comment but they didn\u2019t respond.\n\nJintana also says the project will divert traffic away from Chinatown businesses.\n\nWILLIAMS: These gondola cable cars, like they\u2019re going to be flying over Chinatown, you know, and then to Union Station so that you\u2019re actually like diverting traffic away from these businesses. And then especially for like the legacy businesses, like they\u2019re going to have to compete with other trendy businesses. I don\u2019t really see it actually doing them a lot of good. You know, there actually needs to be more investment in community owned businesses and buildings instead of. Using public resources to build this gondola.\n\nGentrification has long threatened the community\u2019s existence as a working-class immigrant ethnic enclave. An influx of these luxury developments like this project has increased property values and slowly kicked out the original residents of Chinatown.\n\nBut the residents aren\u2019t the only ones who are feeling the pains of gentrification. KING CHEUNG: Chinatown is also a place I met my wife. So does have some historical significance. My mom used to live in Chinatown and work in Chinatown in the sewing factory. So those things connect me to Chinatown. I even now, I don\u2019t live in Chinatown. I feel very close to the people there.\n\nChinese Angelenos like King Cheung have found a home in this neighborhood and continue to fight for its existence. He has been volunteering and organizing in Chinatown since the 70s and has watched as the neighborhood has slowly morphed into something he doesn\u2019t recognize anymore.\n\nCHEUNG: I think this project is benefit the billionaire that proposed it. As is nothing more than debt. And there\u2019s a lot of false hope and a lot of propaganda saying how good it is, how how forward is to the community, which is not true and in fact can harm the small businesses harmed working class immigrant residents in Chinatown overall. And we don\u2019t need him.\n\nAnd Williams couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nWILLIAMS: It\u2019s really unfortunate because Chinatown, like, it might seem dramatic to say this, but I don\u2019t think Chinatown is gonna exist in five years. Like, oh, at least the Chinatown that we know now.\n\nIf the proposal goes through, the gondola will be built in 5 years time, just in time for the 2028 Olympics. But for now, whether it\u2019s the delicious food at local restaurants gorgeous views at the Los Angeles State Historic Park we can still enjoy the beauty within Chinatown while it lasts.\n```"}

Guzman, dean of the USC Gould School of Law, will become the next USC provost and senior vice president for academic affairs.\n\nBy Jacob Wheeler\nApril 05, 2023 at 5:36 pm PDT\n\nAndrew T. Guzman, dean of the USC Gould School of Law, will be USC\u2019s next provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. He will fill the shoes of Charles Zukoski, who in December, stepped down from a three-year long run as provost. Guzman, an international law and economics expert, will be the second most powerful university official and first Latino to serve as provost.\n\nBorn in Canada, Guzman said his passion for international politics stems from a multicultural upbringing. \u201cMy father was Dominican, and when I would visit family in the Dominican Republic, I would see poverty that I didn\u2019t see in Canada,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cI became very interested in international issues and global poverty, and that\u2019s been a thread that has continued throughout my career.\u201d\n\nGuzman graduated from the University of Toronto and earned a doctorate in economics and law degree from Harvard University. \u201cI believe higher education is the real engine of success in our society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opportunity to have this leadership position at an institution that has the scale, scope and excellence of USC is incredibly exciting.\u201d\n\nBefore landing at USC in 2015, Guzman worked at UC Berkeley for 17 years as a law professor then associate dean for international and advanced programs. At USC, Guzman introduced a new bachelor\u2019s degree in legal studies for students and oversaw the establishment of the Center for Transnational Law and Business.\n\n\u201cOne of the assets I bring to the role is that I have a relationship with all the other Dean\u2019s and that allows me to communicate with them in a more seamless manner,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about relationships. This is a human business.\u201d\n\nIn a Tuesday letter to the campus community, USC President Carol Folt said Guzman will be a \u201cterrific partner\u201d in elevating academic excellence at the university. \u201cHe brings a spirit of compassion, a love of innovation and a depth of experience to his new role,\u201d Folt said.\n\nGuzman said plagiarism wasn\u2019t a top concern but new artificial intelligence software has changed the landscape of academia. \u201cI\u2019m worried about [Chat]GPT,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cRight now, the solution we have is largely leaving that to the faculty, which I think is the right solution right now because how could we possibly have wrapped our arms around that?\u201d\n\nGuzman said there\u2019s a \u201clong tradition\u201d of allowing faculty to control their classrooms but added that it\u2019s not a long term solution. \u201cWe need to figure out what sorts of strategies and policies make sense and I don\u2019t pretend to have crisp answers to that just yet,\u201d Guzman said.\n\nMore than 73 individuals were considered for the job. A search committee made up of trustees, faculty, staff and students showed \u201cgreat dedication and care throughout the process,\u201d Folt said.\n\nGuzman will take his seat as USC provost starting July 1.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story spelled the former provost\u2019s name incorrectly.

The last time Mammoth stayed open this long was in 2017, when they extended their season into August after getting 617 inches of snow. This year, they topped that with 702 inches, making the 2022-23 season the biggest in their history.\n\nIn a statement on their Instagram, Mammoth said, \u201cWe are stoked to announce that we will be open daily for skiing and riding until at least the end of July. As always, we do not have a closing date set, but will plan to stay open as long as conditions allow.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Palisades Tahoe Ski Resort will stay open until July 4, weather and conditions permitting. Skiers like Charlotte Kroll, who is a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, are eager to celebrate the holiday on the mountain.\n\nKROLL: it\u2019s really, really fun cause a lot of people like to see on 4th of July and it\u2019s just like a big, like celebration because it\u2019s like whoever associate skiing with July. Yeah, so it\u2019s a lot of fun. I personally have not gotten to do it, but it\u2019s always a really fun season for people like to dress up and stuff and it\u2019s like really exciting when you get to ski past even April sometimes.\n\nKroll is the secretary of USC Ski And Snowboard, an organization that gives about 145 members unlimited access to Mammoth each year.\n\nKROLL: The skiing is never going to be super, super excited about the snow. It definitely comes with its challenges, but I think everybody\u2019s risen to the challenge and we\u2019re really excited for a very good summer.\n\nAlthough skiers and snowboarders might be excited about the extra chances to go down the slopes, residents and staff have been facing issues due to the extra snowy conditions. Snow melt and flooding are major concerns, especially for towns along U.S. Highway 395. But Kroll believes that resorts like Mammoth are equipped to handle so much snowfall.\n\nKROLL: so the snow pack usually is pretty extreme. The good thing about mariners, they\u2019ve done a very good job. I mean, you know, when you have a record here, you never know what you\u2019re going to get because it\u2019s so amazing and and like insane how much snow we\u2019ve gotten so far. They\u2019re doing the best they can.\n\nUSC Ski And Snowboard offers ikon pass discounts to students through a form found on their Instagram. You can find them at @uscskiandsnowboard.\n```"}

(Andrew Kelly/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nBy Lorenzo Arce\nApril 05, 2023 at 5:15 pm PDT\n\nOn June 16th, 1918, Eugene V. Debs, a Socialist Leader running for president, made a speech in Canton, Ohio encouraging people resist the draft into World War I. Two weeks later, Debs was arrested under the Espionage Act of 1917, preventing anyone from encouraging any sedition against the United States. He was later charged with 10 counts of sedition, and thus, ten years in prison. From jail, his campaign continued, where he received 6% of the vote in the election of 1920.\n\nThe arrest of Former President Donald Trump has added another layer of complexity to the country\u2019s contentious political situation. Trump pled not guilty on all 34 charges being brought against him by the the New York supreme court this Monday in connection to the Stormy Daniels hush money scandal. After his two hours in custody, Trump rallied his supporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence with a speech professing no wrong-doing while accusing the justice system of attempting to end his political career at all cost.\n\nDespite being the first US president to have criminal charges filed against him, it is still possible for him to be a contender in the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Ann Crigler is an expert in political campaign communication at USC\u2019s Dornsife School of Social Sciences. She explains that Trump is a special case in a long line of presidential campaigns, especially given today\u2019s Republican Party.\n\nCRIGLER: The Republican Party has largely, although not entirely backed former President Trump and has been supportive and claims that this case is not worthy of being brought. Despite this being only one of the potential legal situations Trump faces that could manifest in imprisonment; Crigler thinks he is playing them to his advantage.\n\nCRIGLER: I think he\u2019s using it as a way of rallying his supporters. And he\u2019s very good at that because he wants to identify with them and they identify with him as beleaguered and being put upon by the system. And so he is reinforcing that story of the system altogether. So it\u2019s part of the consistent story has been telling.\n\nDespite having a diminished presence within the Republican party, Trump could possibly be their go-to presidential candidate for the third time if he manages to win the primaries.\n\nCRIGLER: It\u2019s a really tough problem for the Republicans because that group of supporters that Trump has are highly motivated to vote. They are so far very loyal and likely to motivate, be motivated to get their friends out to vote, too. So he could possibly win the Republican nomination.\n\nCrigler points out we can only guess what the political climate will be when election season comes around later this year.\n\nCRIGLER: There\u2019s the other cases that are being investigated. There\u2019s the: is Biden really running or not? It looks like he is. No. There\u2019s all kinds of things going on in the world right now which are causing lots of reconsideration\u2019s because political preferences.\n\nThe true impact Trump could have in the upcoming election will only be known as the events of the world unflold.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Lorenzo Arce\n```"}

His rise to office reflects a lifetime challenge of finding his voice.\n\nNewly elected Triston Ezidore takes office on the Culver City School Board. (Photo Courtesy of Triston Ezidore)\n\nBy Jacob Wheeler April 05, 2023 at 5:12 pm PDT\n\nTriston Ezidore has a saying. He believes those closest to the pain should be closest to power. Growing up, Ezidore knew never to get too comfortable. A lack of affordable housing drove his single mother to crisscross the country to wherever the \u201cdollars would stretch longer.\u201d Ezidore\u2019s on-the-road childhood took him through a handful of cities: St. Paul, Las Vegas, Syracuse and Los Angeles. It was \u201cnot ideal,\u201d he said. He went through seven school systems before finding his home: Culver City High School.\n\nFor some, leadership is a burden; for others, it\u2019s a calling. Three school board seats opened upon Ezidore\u2019s graduation. Now a first-generation college student, he didn\u2019t blink twice. With over 6,000 votes, Ezidore, 19, won the election in November 2022 to the Culver City School Board. He\u2019s the youngest elected leader in L.A. County and the first Black man to serve on the board.\n\n\u201cAdversity and life experience has led me here,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cBut, it\u2019s also about making sure the bench is built and throwing down that ladder so [young] people can achieve and have a seat at the table as well.\n\nEzidore\u2019s improbable victory reflects a lifetime challenge of finding his voice, threading the needle between his identity and advocacy work. Born in Minnesota, Ezidore was raised by his mother, Hanh Pruitt, an \u201cintroverted\u201d immigrant who came to the United States from Vietnam as a toddler. Growing up, Ezidore spent time at his Vietnamese grandparents\u2019 restaurant. Over food and faith, Ezidore learned how love overcomes worldly barriers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting relationship because my grandparents speak very little English. Having a relationship with them is purely emotional because it doesn\u2019t show up through words, but actions and culture,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cI think that\u2019s wholesome \u2014 the bond we have been able to make [even though] we don\u2019t fully understand each other.\u201d\n\nMinnesota wasn\u2019t home for long. Ezidore, along with his mom and sister, Samone, bounced around the country to make ends meet. Money was tight, but Ezidore said changing cities pushed him ahead.\n\n\u201c[Moving around] gave me a bunch of tools that have helped me get to where I am right now,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cIt\u2019s taught me how to meet new people, how to start conversations, how to be in new environments and speak with people for the first time.\u201d\n\nIn Vegas, Ezidore went through grade school and learned the ropes of life without his father. It wasn\u2019t until the fourth grade that his dad \u2014 who played little to no role in his son\u2019s life \u2014 started to make an effort.\n\n\u201cWe recount the stories differently. I say no [there was no relationship]. We weren\u2019t talking every day,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cWe\u2019re better now, I think we have an OK relationship, [but] there\u2019s always room for improvement.\u201d\n\nMuch of Ezidore\u2019s childhood was marked by \u201cuncomfortable\u201d feelings of confusion over his race, sexuality and career choice. Standing at 6 feet 3 inches tall, the future elected leader shot down calls from his mother to play basketball.\n\nIt\u2019s in Culver City where Ezidore found his voice and passion for activism but struggled like many of the students he represents. In high school geometry, Ezidore bagged a D.\n\n\u201cMath comprehension was definitely something that was super-hard for me to grasp.\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cMy mom was tough on me. When we talk about stereotypes and cultural norms, doing well in school, getting good grades and getting into college \u2014 that was expected.\u201d\n\nCulver City\u2019s \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d white and Asian populations, 56% and 18% respectively, Ezidore asserted, has left students of color behind.\n\n\u201cThe data is telling us that our Asian students are achieving the highest in the district, and are achieving higher than our white students,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we look at who\u2019s underachieving it\u2019s the other half of my identity, so I believe my voice is distributed equitably.\u201d\n\nA high school counselor once discouraged Ezidore from taking AP U.S. History over performance concerns. Ezidore ignored her plea and ended up passing the college credit exam.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen that a certain body for a long time wasn\u2019t electing candidates that looked like me, so the resources and policy was only geared towards one specific student,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cWhen only one type of person is represented in positions of power, I think that it trickles down and only supports those who look like those in power.\u201d\n\nEzidore pointed out data showing that white male students are three times more likely to be reading proficiently in fourth grade than their African-American peers.\n\nSusana Fattorini, a visual arts teacher at CCUSD, worked with Ezidore during the pandemic to put together the school\u2019s yearbook.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an active listener. He takes note of what you\u2019re saying. He asks you to clarify what you\u2019re saying. I think in that way, he\u2019s sort of a sponge for different ideas that help him crystallize his position,\u201d Fattorini said. \u201cHe exuded a confidence that I didn\u2019t have at his age and a confidence that people my age don\u2019t have. It was remarkable.\u201d\n\nIn his senior year of high school, students voted Ezidore class president. After George Floyd\u2019s murder, Ezidore joined a youth-led organization known as poc4change, which pushed the Culver City government to listen to the voices and experiences of young people.\n\nOrganizing a march with over 2,000 people, Ezidore challenged city leaders over budgets and policing on campus.\n\n\u201cThe best people \u2014 and the people that we want in office \u2014 are the people that we need to convince to run,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cI ran for office because I fundamentally believe that the people closest to the pain should be closest to power.\u201d\n\nA \u201cpersonal connection\u201d to the role motivated Ezidore to run. Winning a seat on the board meant representing Aiden, his eighth-grade brother and video game \u201cnerd.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to think about the whole district \u2014 there are more little brothers, more sons, more daughters, more people in the district,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cWe are all someone\u2019s something and if it takes that personal connection to humanize and actualize the work that we\u2019re doing, then we have to do that.\u201d\n\nEzidore connected during the campaign with voters such as Disa Lindgren, a 1979 Culver City High graduate.\n\n\u201cInitially, Lindgren said, \u201cI was surprised, thinking someone so young, running for a leadership position in our school board \u2014 is that a good idea? But Triston has proved himself to be extremely capable,\u201d\n\n\u201cTriston is unusual as a human being because he really is thoughtful and intelligent but has this heart and spirit for everyone.\u201d\n\nFor thousands of voters, Ezidore represented a fresh set of eyes to tackle decade-old problems.\n\n\u201cHe was very honest about the challenges, but also very hopeful,\u201d Lindgren said. \u201cI found that really encouraging, because we need leaders that are real about what\u2019s happening but also that have vision, and I feel like Triston was really that kind of person.\u201d\n\nIf Ezidore is \u201creal about what\u2019s happening,\u201d perhaps that\u2019s because he\u2019s in many respects, like any other 19-year-old college student. He\u2019s a full-time student at USC studying political science.\n\nErik Matos, a West Hollywood planning commissioner, and delegate to the California Democratic party, recalled a January 2022 bike ride with Ezidore.\n\n\u201cHe enjoys hanging out with his friends. He\u2019s very, very personable. He\u2019s a joy,\u201d Matos said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of the first one to crack a joke or, you know, make the room laugh. And he\u2019s got this really natural swagger to him. People gravitate toward his personality.\u201d\n\nThat same swagger and energy have shaped Ezidore\u2019s personal and political identity.\n\nIn February, the Culver City School Board approved Ezidore\u2019s proposed Black Student Achievement Plan. The resolution lit a fire among some constituents, who said Ezidore\u2019s leadership was emotionally driven.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course for me, but what I couldn\u2019t allow was for young people to see that public display of disrespect and to allow that to go,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cIt was important for me to publicly call out and support our young leaders because I think that as a leader myself, that\u2019s what I would have wanted.\n\nStill, the 19-year-old and his supporters feel considerable hope about the future of the board and Culver City.\n\n\u201cPeople need to see that something is possible,\u201d Lindgren said.\n\nAs he looks ahead, Ezidore said he\u2019ll never forget how it all began.\n\n\u201cIt was just me, my mom, my sister, we were kind of all we had \u2014 was each other,\u201d Ezidore said. \u201cMy mom shaped how I think.

(Photo by Nicole Santos)\n\nBy Nicole Santos\nApril 05, 2023 at 4:44 pm PDT\n\nBreakdancing is set for a breakout moment at the next Olympics, but a lack of support from the United States is making the would-be Olympians\u2019 heads spin after their headspins. Breakdancing is the newest summer Olympic sport participating in the 2024 Paris Games \u2014 the first dance sport ever to be included. Following the success of the sport in the 2018 Youth Olympics, breakdancing is enjoying new and immense popularity.\n\nHip-hop artists and breakers, also known as b-boys and b-girls, said they are excited \u2014 and a little worried \u2014 to see their passion in the spotlight. \u201cI\u2019m always very happy whenever we get the opportunity to show a bigger audience what we are capable of,\u201d said Dant\u00e9 Rose, a hip-hop and breaking professor at USC. \u201cThe thing that makes me anxious is what does this mean for the culture? Because it is still a dance culture.\u201d\n\nB-girl Randi Rascal Freitas, who is competing to go to the Olympics, said she found breaking when she needed it, and it helped her free her emotions in a healthy way. \u201cI had a lot of energy. I also was a little angry or just had dealt with some stuff when I was young and had some frustration [that I felt] very physically,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cBreaking was a way for me to get that physical frustration out in a healthy way and also find a community.\u201d\n\nFreitas said breaking also gave her the support and family she was looking for at the time. \u201cI really was looking for a family away from home and people that would support me in my artistic journey. So I think breaking allowed for that,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first crew was everything to me at that time, and I really needed them.\u201d\n\nDancing with friends and neighbors with no real purpose other than having fun and communicating with each other, the crowd cheering everything, the inclusion and diversity among the artists from the community, the creativity and the self-expression. All this and more is part of this culture they want to preserve.\n\n\u201cI think the original culture was more reliant on people just gathering and coming together, dancing with each other, enjoying themselves,\u201d said Tony Ynot, a hip-hop artist and breaker. \u201cSure, there were competitive moments, but I don\u2019t think it was based on a tournament looking event. It was just people coming together and enjoying music.\u201d\n\nSome breakdancers said breakdancing could certainly go mainstream after the games, but the culture will never get lost. \u201cCulture can\u2019t be lost unless individuals stop doing it, it\u2019s something that is within the body,\u201d said Moncell Durden, hip-hop associate professor of practice. \u201cYou can move to another environment that doesn\u2019t have the same type of access, but you can reproduce based on memory and so it will never be lost.\u201d\n\nVicky Chang, who goes by the name \u201cLa Vix,\u201d is the No.1 b-girl in the country, also participating in Team USA for the Olympics. Chang said there is enough space for breaking to be in big events like this and also preserve its cultural meaning. \u201cI know there are people in the community who don\u2019t want breaking in the Olympics because it\u2019s hard for us to control our own narrative. But I think both can happen,\u201d Chang said. \u201cWe can always have the community-oriented events happening and we can also kind of have it in the eyes of the world ... And then in that way, we can bring more people into our community.\u201d\n\nShe said the Olympics is a good venue for breakers to showcase their culture and their community, and that as a participant, she is taking the responsibility to represent it in the correct way so it does not get \u201cwashed down.\u201d\n\nBreakdancing evolved from hip-hop in the streets and squares of the Bronx, New York, in the 1970s, when mainly African American and Latin American youth created a whole new dance style by incorporating more acrobatic and intricate body movements \u2014 many of them inspired by James Brown \u2014 for a chance to show their moves to others.\n\nIn the beginning, breaking was a way for rival street gangs to settle disputes and have battles. They would show their moves and the one with the most innovative and complex moves was the winner. Today, breakdancers have taken the positives of breakdancing to create avenues for self-expression and communication.\n\nChang started breaking when she began college 15 years ago. She said some young people around her would learn breaking because they love the music, wanted to learn steps they watched on TV or to show their moves, and for some men, to impress girls. But Chang said she enjoys breaking because it makes her feel free. \u201cI really enjoyed that in breaking you could put anything into it,\u201d Chang said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a creative dance that as long as there\u2019s still some foundation there, you can just do anything that you really want.\u201d\n\nEven though breakdance originated in the United States, breakdancers said they do not see enough support from the country to make the sport a profitable career and represent the culture outside of their communities. \u201cIt is unfortunate,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThis thought that sponsoring breakers or breakdancers is not profitable in the U.S., which isn\u2019t really based on anything.\u201d\n\nYnot said breaking does not even have a governing body approved by the International Olympic Committee yet and relies on organizations like Breaking For Gold USA that they have created on their own. \u201cI worry about the support for Americans because I\u2019m not quite sure it will be the same for us here as it is in other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see anything about Breaking for Gold, that\u2019s been the step forward that the community has done on their own ... But we\u2019re not officially represented by the IOC as of right now.\u201d\n\nMargo Apostolos, a USC professor of dance who is also a member of the USC LA2028 Olympic Planning Committee, said she hopes this new visibility for the sport will increase standard safety protocols for dancers. \u201cI hope that this visibility on this huge stage will help the world of dance overall increase standards of safety protocol, and injury prevention,\u201d Apostolos said. \u201dI hope that that can sort of spill over into the dance culture, which in many ways has been not standardized with very little protocol as far as safety and injury prevention,\u201d she said.\n\nYnot said he hopes the Olympics will draw the attention of more companies to invest in breaking organizations to support the athletes participating. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that if other countries start to step up in terms of their support, that America will maybe wake up to that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it may happen after the fact that I think a lot of places and organizations, corporations, need to see what it is first before they get on board.\u201d\n\nSteve Miller, who is currently the CEO of Agassi Graf Holdings and was the director of global sports marketing for 10 years at Nike, explained the lack of support may be because of a lack of visibility and recognition outside of their communities. Miller said more companies may get involved in sponsoring breakers now that they are going to the Olympics and breakdancing is considered a sport. He said this process is similar to what other new sports have gone through on their way to massive popularity.\n\n\u201cThe same thing is true in almost all other sports,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, wrestling, weightlifting, track and field. Not every athlete gets sponsored. Only the really good ones, which is probably the same thing in breakdancing.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons private companies like Nike and Red Bull invest money in famous athletes is because of their international visualization and because they can get a return from their investment. Now that breakdancing is going to the Olympics, companies could change their minds and give their support to breakers.\n\nHowever, some hip-hop artists like Durden, said they want to see this support going to organizations that actually care and know their culture to fundraise for their events instead of through companies that just care about the money. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that grassroots organizations are trying to secure funding for events through organizations that have no clue what hip-hop is,\u201d he said. \u201cThese organizations that focus on dance should be able to write into organizations that are perhaps developed by successful rappers or successful people in hip-hop to apply for grant funding to grow their events through organizations that actually know what hip-hop is.\u201d\n\nHip-hop and breaker professors like him and Rose also hope to see more support for education to pass their history and to be acknowledged. \u201cHip-hop dance started getting into universities around 50 years now,\u201d Durden said. \u201cUSC was actually working on having a master\u2019s degree in hip-hop. It\u2019s time that people understand how rich it is in cultural dynamics and that it is on par with any other dance form.\u201d\n\nRose said more education is key. \u201cEvery time we\u2019re doing something, especially in the arts, it usually gets blown out of proportion and then we lose the vision of why we do it in the first place,\u201d Rose said.\n\nAfter the Olympics, breakers are expecting to see major improvements and are excited to see what\u2019s going to happen next. \u201cI would love to see the government and companies put money into it and support it. It\u2019s really hard to make a living off breaking alone,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cI would love to see it grow beyond what we even see it\u2019s capable of.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreaking is such a beautiful sport and then also such a rich history that I would love to see those two things acknowledged collectively and have people see that they\u2019re inseparable,\u201d she said.\n```"}

She decided to move forward by helping to spare others her pain, and got began volunteering with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). Ryan, who is studying nonprofits and social change, has been deeply involved with AFSP ever since. She has worked as a field advocate, fundraiser and is currently an intern for the media team in their national office.\n\nOn April 4, she hosted the first Out of the Darkness Walk on USC\u2019s campus. As part of AFSP, these walks take place across the country to raise funds and to create awareness about suicide prevention. The event was in partnership with the Undergraduate Student Government, the National Alliance on Mental Health, USC Hillel and their survivor support community and many mental health organizations on campus.\n\nBefore hosting USC\u2019s Out of the Darkness Walk, Ryan had taken part in four walks on \u201cTeam Sabrina\u201d \u2014 in memory of her mom. Ryan was able to see first hand that these walks can cultivate hope and a sense of community for survivors and their loved ones. She wanted to create this space on campus to save lives and bring hope to those going through similar situations to her.\n\nRyan recalled her first suicide walk in 2018 in her hometown Omaha, Nebraska. \u201cI was convinced no one else had felt such grief the way I was feeling.\u201d Being among others who had lost loved ones to suicide changed her perspective. \u201cSuddenly, I wasn\u2019t alone anymore,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nAt the walk yesterday, \u201cTeam Sabrina\u201d carried the AFSP banner to lead the walk as the top fundraising team. The purpose of these walks is to bring to light difficult topics surrounding mental health, instead of perpetuating the stigma around them. If we are not having these conversations, there is no way people can receive the help they need.\n\n\u201cMy mom was successful, motivated and kind, but still struggled with many mental health implications. I was lost as to why she was so sad when in my mind there were so many things going well for her,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nRyan\u2019s work with AFSP has helped her gain a greater understanding of mental health issues and has led her to understand that she was neglecting her own mental health even before her mom\u2019s passing. Ryan felt ashamed to tell people she was in therapy because of the stigma, and recalled that her mother would also hold her feelings inside. Now, she\u2019s open about her struggles \u2014 and wants others to be, too.\n\n\u201cThe more we talk about our feelings, the more comfortable people will be when they are struggling,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.\n```"}

Seven schools were invited to present examples of their work at the panel, set up like a science fair with visits from some members of the Board of Trustees, school deans and high-profile officials such as Athletic Director Mike Bohn.\n\nPresident Carol Folt had high praise for the students at the event, called the Amazing Trojans student panel. \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful. Seeing all these students putting together these amazing games, studios, and inventions makes us all see that it\u2019s not just us thinking about it, it\u2019s all of you doing it,\u201d Folt said during an interview with Annenberg Media student leaders in front of a green screen depiction of Studio C in the Annenberg Media Center.\n\nMuna Malik, a graduate student at the Roski School of Art and Design, showcased artwork that tells the stories of people displaced from their homelands for her school\u2019s presentation. She said she hopes the event will push trustees to further support Roski students and their artistic endeavors moving forward.\n\nOther students also conveyed similar aspirations. Jenna Gestetner, a sophomore in the Iovine and Young Academy (IYA), was eager to share her and her peers\u2019 work in hopes of better explaining what exactly her school does. \u201cI\u2019m just excited that we get to show the work that we did and present the kind of things that we do at IYA because I don\u2019t think that a lot of people know,\u201d Gestetner said. \u201cIf they think they know what we do, they don\u2019t fully understand the extent of some of the projects we work on.\u201d\n\nIovine and Young is USC\u2019s interdisciplinary school combining the arts, technology and business. Students from the academy showed their work on the Care Reimagined industry lab team, a project that involved consulting with companies to think about the future of the healthcare industry.\n\nThe other schools represented were the School of Cinematic Arts, Marshall School of Business, Viterbi School of Engineering and School of Gerontology. The room buzzed with live pitches, art galleries and even virtual reality simulations.\n\nStudents part of the Advanced Games Project, a joint venture between the Viterbi School of Engineering and the School of Cinematic Arts, presented their video game project called \u201cManas,\u201d based on the Kyrgyzstan cultural poem: the Epic of Manas. And, Ana Silverstein, a Ph.D. candidate who discovered a peptide as part of her research on healthy aging, represented the School of Gerontology.\n\nAnnenberg Media staged a newsroom simulation as its presentation. In the hour allotted, seven students from across Annenberg graduate programs and majors worked together to show how they would cover stories from a variety of platforms. One of the stories from the simulation was about the Amazing Trojans event itself, and the students showed Folt and others the work on video and digital \u2014 in English, Spanish and Mandarin.\n\nAnnenberg\u2019s Radio Executive Producer Jeffrey Lee said that not only was the event an opportunity for the board members to learn, but an opportunity for students to learn as well. \u201cThe whole thing serves sort of a dual purpose, in the sense that the trustees were able to see the things that we\u2019ve been producing and have been working on, and on the flip side, we were able to get a sense of how committed the trustees are to USC in keeping up with us students,\u201d said Lee, a senior majoring in communication.\n\nLee described his experience speaking with members as a bonding moment: a shared love and appreciation for USC and its history. Folt believed the event to be a success. \u201cI loved that I got to give the overview of the university,\u201d she said while being interviewed in the virtual Studio C. \u201cThis year, my whole goal was to make people see things they\u2019d never seen before.

Starbucks released their latest menu item, the Oleato, an olive oil coffee drink which has stirred controversy. There are polarizing opinions on the Oleato, with many finding the combination of olive oil and coffee unappetizing, reluctant to give the new drink a try. However, those who have tasted the drink for themselves claim to enjoy it.\n\n\u201cI was hesitant to try it because I didn\u2019t know what to expect. But [the barista] sweet-talked me into giving it a taste and I have to say, it was really good,\u201d said Carolyn Kennedy, a customer at the USC Village Starbucks. Kennedy continues on to describe the taste of the new drink. \u201cIt felt satisfying, refreshing and surprisingly not oversweet. It just had such a nice taste that I wanted to have more of it,\u201d she said.\n\nGiselle Galindo, a sophomore majoring in art history and cyber operations, said she has enjoyed olive oil coffee in the past from more authentic cafes; however, she isn\u2019t looking forward to tasting Starbucks\u2019 version. \u201cMy initial reaction was that it was gonna to be really horrendous because just thinking of Starbucks putting olive oil in a drink kind of grosses me out,\u201d said Galindo, \u201cSeeing the pictures of it and like the TikTok videos I\u2019ve seen so far, it\u2019s not looking good.\u201d\n\nJamie Hogan, a senior majoring in public relations, said he doesn\u2019t plan to buy the drink anytime soon; however, he saw the advertisement displayed throughout the store and was full of questions. \u201cI was intrigued. I think, confused as to what it is, and what it tastes like and where the olive oil is [inside the drink],\u201d Hogan said.\n\nDespite the olive oil drink igniting polarized opinions, there has been a lot of positive feedback on the different forms it comes in \u2014 including the iced shaken espresso and Golden Foam Cold Brew. \u201cIt\u2019s quite new and a lot of people have been ordering it. I think a lot of people like it,\u201d said Adrian Melendrez, a Starbucks employee at the USC Village. \u201cI personally like it. My favorite version of it would be the cold brew with the foam on top.\u201d\n\nAside from the culinary benefits of olive oil, it has been known for its health benefits as well. According to a study conducted by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, including a daily intake of olive oil to your diet can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe Oleato was first introduced in Italy starting late February and is now available in select Starbucks locations in Seattle, New York and Los Angeles, including multiple stores surrounding USC. Starbucks plans to expand the Oleato into other countries but remain exclusive to only certain locations.\n\nThe interim CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, is excited for the release of the Oleato and describes this as a gamechanger in the way people enjoy their daily coffee. \u201cOleato represents the next revolution in coffee that brings together an alchemy of nature\u2019s finest ingredients \u2014 Starbucks arabica coffee beans and Partanna cold pressed extra virgin olive oil,\u201d Schultz said on the Starbucks website.\n\nAlthough some customers at the USC Village Starbucks refuse to try the new drink, there is no denying that the Oleato has sparked conversations among people. With all the publicity the drink has received, even those who are most skeptical see its potential. \u201cBut if it tastes good and it actually works, maybe it will be a new trend or something,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nOverall the question remains: Does oil and coffee mix or is it the new oil and water?\n```"}

Everyone knows the top head coaches in the Pac-12 from USC\u2019s Lincoln Riley, UCLA\u2019s Chip Kelly, Utah\u2019s Kyle Whittingham and Oregon\u2019s Dan Lanning. But who are the guys whose faces you don\u2019t see on TV every weekend? The guys who do all the behind-the-scenes work that doesn\u2019t get recognized enough. I wanted to give them their spotlight this week. I guess FAU\u2019s run inspired me to do an underdog theme this week. I analyzed every coaching staff in the Pac-12 to find out who is the best of the assistant coaches in the Pac-12. In this week\u2019s  Unpack The Pac Offseason Edition , I talk about three assistant coaches who should be in contention to land head coaching jobs next season.\n\n3. Ben Arbuckle, offensive coordinator, Washington State\nBen Arbuckle is one of the most exciting stories that has gone under the radar in college football this offseason. Arbuckle was hired as Washington State\u2019s head coach after Eric Morris left the position to become North Texas\u2019s head coach. Arbuckle is only 27 years old, making him the nation\u2019s youngest power five coordinator. Arbuckle was a quarterback at West Texas A&M from 2016 to 2017 and was named Western Kentucky\u2019s quality control coach in 2021. Within one year at WKU, he was promoted to the quarterbacks coach and co-offensive coordinator. In his first year as co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, Western Kentucky finished first in total passing yards per game and led one of the best offenses in the nation last year. In his previous stint as Houston Baptist quarterback coach from 2018 to 2020, he worked with senior transfer quarterback Bailey Zappe, who broke the FBS record for passing yards with 5,967.  Washington State made a great hire with Arbuckle, and his fast rise should continue as I expect him to get a head coaching job soon.\n\n2. Josh Henson, offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, USC\nA former offensive lineman at Oklahoma State, Josh Henson has risen to one of the top assistant coaches in the country. Henson has 24 years of coaching experience with stops at Kingfisher, Oklahoma State, LSU, Missouri and Texas A&M before joining Lincoln Riley in his first season with the Trojans in 2022. This year he helped guide offensive linemen Brett Neilon and Andrew Vorhees to first-team All-American seasons. Unfortunately, Vorhees is dealing with a torn ACL that he suffered at the combine, and Neilon is dealing with a ruptured Achilles severed in USC\u2019s loss to Utah in the Pac-12 championship. However, both are still expected to hear their names called at the 2023 NFL draft. Henson also coached two-time All-American Kenyon Green at Texas A&M, drafted in the first round by the Houston Texans last season. With the recent success of these superstar performances under Henson, I would not be surprised to see him interviewing for some head coaching jobs next season. Even moving up to the NFL level would be within the realm for him.\n\n1. Tosh Lupoi, defensive coordinator and linebackers coach, Oregon\nThe former Cal defensive lineman has now helped Dan Lanning run one of the best defenses in the Pac-12 after joining his staff in 2022. Lupoi is also a two-time national champion as a coach. He won in 2015 as a defensive analyst for Alabama and again in 2017 when he became their defensive coordinator. That year, he helped Nick Saban lead the best defense in the nation as the top ranked scoring defense. Lupoi also has NFL experience, as he was the defensive line coach for the Browns, Falcons and Jaguars. Lupoi could make a case to be an NFL defensive coordinator next season if Oregon has a successful fall.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

Cohn came as a \u201crepresentative of the Jewish community at USC\u201d to share the comforts he found in the daily prayers of his religion.\n\nMany students and faculty members shared emotional statements, stories, and gratitude to those who attended and organized the vigil. \u201cYour presence really matters,\u201d said Anthony Khoory, co-executive of the campus Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly.\n\nRahsan Akbulut, a professor from the Marshall School of Business, spoke to the crowd openly and honestly about her struggles since the earthquakes. \u201cI have moments where I feel anger, a constant heavy pain, and also guilt to try to go through life normally,\u201d Akbulut said.\n\nShe said she was driven to share these feelings because she knew many others were experiencing similar emotions. Although it is a time of immense sadness, Akbulut expressed her amazement at the outpouring of support and love from USC and the international community.\n\n\u201cTo see all of a sudden borders disappear, religious differences disappear, differences in language and culture, everything disappears, what\u2019s left is just human,\u201d Akbulut said.\n\nThose who wished to speak were offered the mic. The gathering ended with many loving hugs, quiet words of support and prayers. Several clubs raised money for the victims by selling Turkish coffee and desserts.\n\nSoni ended the vigil with powerful words of togetherness. \u201cPlease remember that it is with love that we come together, with love that we go, and with love that we will remain with each other,\u201d Soni said.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson April 04, 2023 at 10:49 pm PDT\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley took a long pause. But, in this case, the long pause was a good thing. That\u2019s because he struggled to name any position group which was falling behind the pack.\n\n\u201cIt would be tough to single one out honestly,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of spring, there\u2019s so much to get better, there\u2019s a lot to be excited about. And there\u2019s not a position group that I\u2019m not really excited about right now.\u201d\n\nHe added this was far from the case at this point last year, even if he expressed that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could\u2019ve honestly said [that] last year,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIf I said it, I lied well.\u201d\n\nMany of the position groups had to be rebuilt from top to bottom, either to replace losses or improve the position group as a whole. Tight end was one such position group, as it lost redshirt seniors Josh Falo to the NFL draft and Malcolm Epps to the transfer portal. USC recently announced the signing of five-star tight end Duce Robinson, which will help the position group, but he will not begin practicing until the fall.\n\nTo help the depth issues, the team moved sophomore Luke Otte and redshirt freshman Carson Tabaracci over to the tight end position. Otte was originally on the defensive line and Tabaracci was at linebacker before they made the switch to the offense.\n\n\u201cI just love offense. I feel like it\u2019s a little bit more natural for me,\u201d Tabaracci said. \u201cIt\u2019s been awesome, I moved over and [the other tight ends] are taking me under their wing right away.\u201d\n\nSimilarly to the tight end room, the offensive line had to replace the likes of redshirt seniors Andrew Vorhees, Bobby Haskins and Brett Neilon. Rather than bringing over players from the defense, the USC coaching staff rebuilt the unit through the transfer portal. To date, USC has signed offensive linemen Ethan White, Jarrett Kingston and Michael Tarquin.\n\nEven with all the transfers coming in, redshirt senior Cooper Lovelace says there is no animosity in the group.\n\n\u201cWe get along like nobody\u2019s business. A lot of people on the outside of buildings think that it\u2019s a problem when you got guys transferring in and out,\u201d Lovelace said. \u201cHere, there is no hostility. No [players not liking] each other behind the back. We\u2019re one brotherhood.\u201d\n\nEven across the offensive line, the players are expected to learn multiple positions so they can play anywhere on the line.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one-trick ponies in football,\u201d Lovelace said. \u201cThe way they teach it is so you can know everything. They don\u2019t just teach center. They don\u2019t just teach right guard ... They kind of teach everything so they can pit and pull and plug around any time.\u201d\n\nMoving players around to different positions has been a common theme throughout this spring. Players like junior Korey Foreman and redshirt freshman Devan Thompkins have been moved around on the defensive line in the offseason. Defensive coordinator Alex Grinch did that all season last year with junior defensive lineman and NFL draft-hopeful Tuli Tuipulotu and might look to use many of his defensive players in similar hybrid roles this upcoming season.\n\nEven though Lincoln Riley likes where his position groups are at, there is always room for player and position movement as the spring winds down and the team gets ready for the upcoming fall season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to unfold. There\u2019s going to be so many more position battles and there\u2019ll be a lot of different ebbs and flows with this group through the end of spring and obviously into the fall,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be really interesting to see it all play out. And obviously we\u2019re going to add the rest of our high school signees and probably a couple more transfers before it\u2019s all said and done as well.\u201d\n\nThe ending of spring ball is coming up for the football team, with their spring game on April 15. But what is not ending is Riley and Grinch working and tinkering with their players to put the best product on the field in the fall.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Payton May, Annie Bang, and Veronique Louis-Jacques\nApril 04, 2023 at 8:47 pm PDT\n\nThe annual Climate Forward Conference brought together high-profile politicians and individuals to find common ground surrounding the climate crisis at a panel held Tuesday, April 4. The event saw high-profile guests such as Gina McCarthy, the first ever White House climate advisor and former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, and Bret Stephens, a conservative opinion columnist for the New York Times and editor-in-chief of Sapir.\n\nMichigan State, Notre Dame, and Vanderbilt University also held watch parties for the event. The USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies, USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future, and Common Ground Committee sponsored the event and hosted two panels discussing the theme of \u201cBridging Divides, Sharing Solutions.\u201d\n\nStephens had previously denied climate change but last October, he released a column in the New York Times agreeing to the problem of the climate crisis as he spoke with an oceanographer and witnessed the melting of the ice caps in Greenland. Stephens said that John Englander, the oceanographer who offered him the trip, spoke to him in a way he hoped more people would.\n\n\u201cHe did not approach me as either an imbecile or as a bad guy. He approached me as a guy who wanted to have a conversation with me,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI think that\u2019s really important when we have conversations across differences.\u201d\n\nThe panelists reiterated the importance of finding common ground, as well as how to better communicate effectively about the climate crisis. McCarthy, who served as administrator of the EPA for four years, discussed this ongoing struggle.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that scientists got so excited about climate, and they translate that into the language of science that isn\u2019t easily translatable into how you talk to normal human beings,\u201d McCarthy said. McCarthy also expressed frustration about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s annual report, noting that their pessimistic rhetoric isn\u2019t adding value to conversations about climate change.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great to articulate a problem, but maybe the answer is not just having scientists do papers,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be folks sitting down and fashioning the solutions, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to matter.\u201d\n\nStudents who attended the event reacted positively to the discussions that took place, despite bringing in individuals with opposing political beliefs.\n\n\u201cI thought this was a fantastic panel,\u201d Junior business administration student Sean McCalla said. \u201cIt gave me this feeling of hope and this feeling that the solutions that are required for this issue are a lot closer than they may seem.\u201d\n\nKris Liu, a doctoral student in the population, health, and place program, appreciated USC\u2019s efforts in highlighting the importance of climate change and solutions.\n\n\u201cI would say USC is probably one of the best universities I\u2019ve been to when talking about sustainability,\u201d Liu said.\n\nStephens and McCarthy also discussed the role the economy will play in seeking climate solutions moving forward. As the White House\u2019s national climate advisor from 2021 to 2022, McCarthy touched on her team\u2019s reframing of the climate crisis into one of economic opportunity and investment. She added that legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act were evidence of climate solutions directly impacting economic growth as well.\n\n\u201c[Those] were an investment in rebuilding the United States in a way that would grow jobs, in a way that would advance equity and in a way that would make us much more resilient to the challenges of climate,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nStephens added that while the work of the EPA and climate scientists are hugely valuable, these improvements will have to begin elsewhere.\n\n\u201c[Solutions are] going to come from entrepreneurs who are probably in this room right now who are thinking about how they put their environmental passions together with their entrepreneurial abilities and find something nobody has thought of before,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we usually get out of our jams in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe event ended with panelists McCarthy and Stephens emphasizing their hope for the future in regards to the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting in the trenches for 30 years, trying to get answers to the world\u2019s most challenging problem,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cAnd I think we have solutions now that we\u2019ve never had before. I\u2019m confident that we can land those solutions and advance them, and there\u2019ll be more to follow.\u201d```"}

(Andrew Kelly/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nBy Megan Duncan, Tony Fajardo and Kaitlin Becenti\nApril 04, 2023 at 7:42 pm PDT\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony charges by a New York Grand Jury. In the indictment, The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office alleges Trump attempted to suppress damaging information during the 2016 elections by paying off an adult porn star, Stormy Daniels who he had an alleged affair with, as well as falsifying the business records related to the payments. This is the first time that a former president has been charged with a criminal act.\n\nHere are some FAQs USC students and Annenberg Media reporters had about the case.\n\nHow long will this process last?\nThe process of Trump\u2019s indictment is going to be long and is expected to continue into his 2024 campaign. Trump has made it very clear that he will continue to the fight charges. It is also expected that Trump will argue that he will not be able to receive a fair trial in Manhattan which could result in the trial being moved. It is also expected that Trump\u2019s legal team will try to delay the trial for as long as possible. Besides the 34 felony counts of falsification of business records, Trump is also currently the focus of three other investigations. The Department of Justice is currently investigating Trump\u2019s involvement in the January 6 attack on the U.S. capitol and his broader efforts to overturn the election. His interference with the Georgia 2020 election results, where he and his team allegedly pressured state officials to change the outcome. New York Attorney General, Letitia James, is suing Trump, three of his adult children, and the Trump Organization surrounding a decade-long scheme to manipulate Trump\u2019s assets and net worth. Trump has denied wrongdoing in all of these investigations.\n\nIs paying someone hush money a crime?\nAlthough in most cases paying hush money is not a crime, it depends on the payment\u2019s purpose. The issue isn\u2019t paying the money per se, but allegedly falsifying these payments as business expenses. Rachel Fiset from Zweiback, Fiset, and Zalduendo Law says that \u201cwhat will be undisputed is that he paid Michael Cohen $130,000 and wrote that off as a legal expense\u201d and he later wrote it off as a legal expense. \u201cYou can\u2019t make hush money payments and write them off,\u201d said Fiset.\n\nCan Trump still run for president if he is found guilty of a felony?\nTrump still can run for the presidency if found guilty of a felony. There is nothing in the Constitution that directly states that a president cannot be a felon. Although being convicted of crimes might offer other personal problems for Trump, his eligibility for candidacy is not one. While Trump\u2019s felony charges do not affect his candidacy, it is unprecedented territory for such a high-ranking political official to receive these charges. \u201cThis is the first time that a former president has been charged with a criminal act and that is incredibly historic when you think of all of the weight and gravitas that the president of the United States has,\u201d said Fiset. Professor Bennett Gershman from Pace Law School said this could possibly affect Trump\u2019s campaign politically. \u201cTrump thinks it\u2019s going to improve his political position, it\u2019s going to make him appear to be a victim,\u201d said Gershman. \u201cI think that his political rivals will use this as a way of attacking him and undermining his candidacy on the grounds that you shouldn\u2019t be president because of statements like this that have occurred... I think it\u2019s going to damage and seriously.\u201d\n\nWill Trump go to jail?\nWhile jail time is possible, it is extremely unlikely in Trump\u2019s case. Charges such as falsifying business records in the first degree can carry a sentence of up to four years of jail time. However, this is unlikely since this is Trump\u2019s first and non-violent offense, coupled with his age of 76. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is way, way, way down the route, thinking of conviction... There are a lot of things that are going to happen before we have a jury trial here and so we have to kind of take it step by step and not look to the far reaches of where this thing might take us,\u201d said Gershman. At this time, Trump still resides in his Florida home.\n\nWhy is there no mugshot of Trump?\nTrump will be treated in most respects like any other criminal defendant, but no mugshot was taken. Under New York State law, enforcement officials have discretion over whether they take mug shots of certain individuals. Mugshots are usually used to identify defendants, but since Trump is extremely high profile a mugshot is not needed. The court case will likely extend to 2024, during election season and it could also last beyond that. Trump is likely to use different routes to prolong the case.\n```"}

Instead, a lot of the attention was on LSU\u2019s forward Angel Reese making the famous \u201cCena taunt\u201d towards her rival Caitlin Clark. Several people started to call her actions unsportsmanlike and petty, with others being much more critical. What some didn\u2019t know, or did not acknowledge, was that Clark had done a similar hand gesture to Reese before. The hypocrisy of some condemning Reese while letting Clark off the hook prompted several people to call out the double standard that was created. Reese, a Black woman was called \u201cclassless\u201d for her actions, but no comments were made about Clark.\n\nUSC senior Reagan Griffin plays on the scout team that helps the USC women\u2019s basketball team practice. He said there is often a lot of trash talk during practice and that some players definitely talk trash in games as well. As a competitor, he thinks Caitlin Clark is probably more disappointed about losing than anything else:\n\nGRIFFIN: Trust and believe Caitlin Clark, if she\u2019s mad about anything, she\u2019s mad about the fact that she lost, you know, she\u2019s not mad about the fact that Angel Reese is doing whatever. When you are an athlete of that caliber, some taunting is not going to cause any type of reaction. GRIFFIN: I would say Caitlin Clark has been the best college basketball player, man or woman by far. And Angel Reese having been another one of those better players wants to assert herself as somebody who can compete on that level. Right. So from my vantage point, it\u2019s like I kind of just comes with the territory of being the best.\n\nJournalism professor and sports columnist, Miki Turner said that this type of criticism comes from the inherent sexism and racism that exists in sports today. Turner thinks that Clark is not thinking about her interaction with Reese, she is only focused on this memorable loss for Iowa state.\n\nTURNER: Angel has been called ghetto. She has been called all kinds of names. And that\u2019s the way she plays. She\u2019s playing, you know, out her culture, as it were. And, you know, it\u2019s it\u2019s it\u2019s a shame that it\u2019s happened, particularly at this point in the women\u2019s game, because, you know, women have come so far in athletics, particularly women\u2019s basketball and the collegiate level. And it\u2019s a shame that something like this has to overshadow what was a momentous win for LSU.\n\nTurner says a double standard exists within sports and in today\u2019s political climate, reactions like this are not unexpected, but still are disappointing.\n\nTURNER: Caitlin had been doing this throughout most of the dance, actually, you know, throwing up the hand and the ring finger. And, you know, she just got it\u2019s, you know, thrown back at her by angel. So, you know, no harm, no foul, as Chick Hearn used to say.\n\nDespite the attention being on the drama between Clark and Reese, Clark came to the defense of Reese, saying that it is part of competition.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Grace Gerstner.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/04/meet-the-district-6-candidates-isaac-kim/", "response": "```\nMeet the District 6 candidates: Isaac Kim\n\nIsaac Kim, your normal neighbor guy running for City Council.\n\nBy Emma Chen April 04, 2023 at 5:22 pm PDT\n\nOn sunny weekends, Isaac Kim and his wife take their dog, Billie, to the Sepulveda Basin Park in the San Fernando Valley to enjoy the weather and watch their dog crash into a pile of leaves. As the only park in the neighborhood, it is always overcrowded. The lack of green space is one issue Kim sees in the district and wishes to change.\n\nKim sees this lack of green space as an issue he\u2019d like to change - just one of the concerns that have led him to run in the special election to fill the vacancy in Los Angeles Council District 6. \u201cI love where I live, and it is the place I call home,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBut the district is going through a tough time, and I think the citizens have had enough political schemes. I think it\u2019s when a private citizen, who is really from the area, brings in a different perspective and makes actual changes.\u201d\n\nIsaac Kim is a 34 years old Asian American, a second-generation immigrant from Korea, and a small skin-care business owner. He graduated from Columbia University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Philosophy and Economics. Kim worked in operations and forecasting for international cosmetics companies such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Armani Beauty, and YSL.\n\nIn the first 34 years of his life, politics was a field he\u2019d never envisioned himself in; it wasn\u2019t until the Nury Martinez scandal Kim decided to stand out and make the district better. Kim isn\u2019t native to Los Angeles. He was born in Cupertino and moved six times before he was 10 years old. Growing up, Kim was a competitive fencer and part of the U.S. World Championship and national teams. Kim gained a broader perspective on life from this experience as an athlete. He regularly traveled to see the world and interacted with people from different cultures. At a very young age, he learned to deal with losing, also the importance of practice and hard work as the only way to succeed.\n\nIn October, LA Times published a leaked tape of former City Council President and Council District (CD) 6 Councilmember Nury Martinez. The tape captured the conversation between Martinez and other Latin council members. They discussed consolidating and preserving the Latino seats in the council from Black candidates. The recording also included their racist remarks toward other colleagues and Councilmember Mike Bonin\u2019s son. The audio sparked outrage and led to Martinez\u2019s resignation, which left a vacancy in the council for CD6. Therefore, the L.A. City Council will hold a special primary election on April 4, 2023, to fill the seat.\n\nWhen he heard about the leaked tape, Kim\u2019s reaction was anger, not particularly about their words, but their actions. \u201cWhat motivated me to run to present CD6 is the corruption in the system,\u201d Kim said. \u201cFor years, politics have been occupied by selfish politicians to gain power and to try to get reelected. And they are not here for the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same type of people in power and elected, and citizens complain that they don\u2019t see changes. It\u2019s because we\u2019ve had individuals who watch their political self-interests before the people,\u201d Kim said.\n\nEnvironmental issues are Kim\u2019s priority, and his parents heavily influence that stance. He describes them as environmentalists, advocating sustainability and renewable energy. Their small business California Water Conservation, contracts with the government to install water-saving toilets for residents. \u201cI tell people I was wearing Patagonia recycled shirts way before it was cool,\u201d Kim joked. Patagonia is a clothing company that uses recycled fabrics and has programs implemented to lower the ecological impact of making their products. \u201cJust because my parents loved anything sustainable and better for the environment.\u201d\n\nThough Kim has no political experience, he is very transparent about his strengths and weaknesses. One thing Kim highlighted about himself is his identity as a \u201cnormal guy.\u201d \u201cI am just a normal citizen living here and a normal voter like everyone else. I observe the city from the level of a normal guy and struggle through the issues they face with them at the same time,\u201d Kim said. \u201cOne big issue in CD6 is the lack of protected bike lanes. I bike a lot, and I feel the danger when a car comes from behind.\u201d\n\nBeing a first-time politician is an advantage and a disadvantage for Kim. Without the recognition, it was hard for him to reach the audience. One of Kim\u2019s weaknesses is his rawness in politics; however, knowing his shortcomings, Kim doesn\u2019t view them as an embarrassment. Instead, he openly admits his lack of knowledge of certain issues and seeks advice from experts.\n\nIn the climate and environment part of his platform, Kim received assistance from Youth Climate Strike Los Angeles, a youth-led organizing group that fights for climate action in the city of Los Angeles, to identify the issues and improvements for CD6. \u201cI wrote the environment platform for Isaac,\u201d Sim Bilal said, a 21-year-old campaign volunteer, also an environmental activist in L.A. \u201cMy organization and I talked to all the candidates, and Isaac stood out. Some politicians pretend like they know everything, and a lot of times, they just get into trouble. I hear some criticism people talk about like \u2018Isaac doesn\u2019t know anything,\u2019 but more importantly, is his willingness to learn and to listen.\u201d\n\nHomelessness is another issue Kim focuses on, and even before the election, Kim found homelessness an issue and partnered his grooming business with a local church, donating part of every order to help someone experiencing homelessness. He also donates cleaning supplies and collaborates with the church to provide hot water showers for those who need them.\n\nCouncil District Six consists of Arleta, Van Nuys, Sun Valley, North Hollywood, Lake Balboa, North Hills, and Panorama City. The total population of District 6 is about 280,000 people and comprises 71% of Latinos, 15% of White, 9% of Asians, and 3% of Black people.\n\nWith involvement in the community, Kim is also winning the hearts of the citizens. One of the volunteers, Keshaw Huang, a 24-year-old Chinese American resident in CD6, recently graduated from Columbia University. Huang befriended Kim first, then decided to help him in the election. \u201cThe first time we met Isaac knocking on my door for the signatures to put his name on the ballot. And so that\u2019s how we got to talk,\u201d the volunteer in charge of strategy and operations for Kim\u2019s campaign said. \u201cIt was exciting because he was the only candidate that came to my door to talk about the platform and what they were running for. So it was very, I guess, nice to meet Isaac in person. That\u2019s where it all started.\u201d\n\nHuang describes the campaign as \u201cflat\u201d and completely run by volunteers, including money contributions from friends and family members. Kim highlighted his campaign as a grassroots organization, which volunteers run, and he committed to forgoing fundraising money from real estate, lobbyists, and police interests.\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s ethics website, which reported how much each candidate has raised, received, and spent, Kim\u2019s campaign has approximately $16,000 in contributions from individuals who truly support Kim\u2019s beliefs and his impact on the district.\n\n\u201cWorking with Isaac is refreshing,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cbecause while other candidates refer to the residents as constituents, Kim refers to them as \u2018neighbors,\u2019 which is his most valuable quality.\u201d\n\nAnd Kim is ready for that seat on the table. \u201cRight now is a crucial time in L.A. City Council, there\u2019s a big progressive wave happening, and I would like to be part of that,\u201d he said.\n```"}

People were singing and dancing at the event, and there were big lines to try the food and tea. Nour Myra Geha, international relations major and the co-director of MENASA, said that having the university formally recognize a month of celebration for Arab Americans is a true honor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so thankful. We started [last year] with a $100 budget for the entire event,\u201d Myra Geha said. \u201cKnowing that all of us worked so hard with the university to make this much bigger and much nicer shows that perseverance and determination get you places because you always need to start small.\u201d\n\nLast year, the celebration had no stage, no speaker and few features to highlight the festival, according to Myra Geha. This year, the event drew larger support, with event speakers including university president Carol L. Folt, Arab American Civil Council research fellow Amin Nash, and USC Marshall associate professor Christine El Haddad.\n\n\u201cIt means so much to me because I think this is the first time people have come to me and said, \u2018Oh my God, there is Arabic music on campus,\u2018\u201d Geha said. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d\n\nThe event comes a year after President Joe Biden became the first president to formally recognize April as Arab American Heritage Month. This year, Biden penned a letter to further acknowledge Arab Americans for their contributions to the United States while opening a broader conversation around what it means to be Arab American.\n\nFor years, organizations like the Arab American Institute have advocated for formal recognition of the Arab identity within the Census to get a more precise picture of the community within the US and the issues they face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a box,\" said Anthony Khoory, Co-Director of MENASA. \"(Is) a reflection of the diversity of a place, being there validates who we are.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, an \u2018Arab\u2019 refers mainly to someone who speaks Arabic as their first language. Arab is not considered a race, but Arabs are connected through common history and culture. Community members considered Arab to be an ethnicity. Twenty-two countries are considered Arab countries by the ADC, including Egypt, Iraq, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The ADC also includes Kurds, Armenians, Berbers and others within the Arab classification, many of whom have been part of the ethnic diversity within Arab countries for centuries.\n\nAt USC, there is little information on the number of Arabic-identifying students attending the university. Arab and Middle Eastern students often cannot identify themselves as such in official documents.\n\nTheir next event will be a Dabke Night with the Lebanese Club on April 5 at 8 p.m. in STU 100.

Last night, out of curiosity, I wondered what ChatGPT could say about how popular figure skating is in the United States. It answered that, in terms of participation, \u201caccording to data from the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, in 2020, about 1.8 million people in the U.S. participated in ice skating (which includes figure skating, speed skating, and ice hockey), which represents only about 0.6% of the U.S. population.\u201d It is safe to say that figure skating is a niche sport in the United States, well, at least compared to all the major league sports. But this sport has an equally passionate and devoted fan community. Figure skating always holds a special place in our hearts because something sets it apart from other sports worldwide.\n\nAs part of my efforts to increase awareness of this sport among the student body, I have collected thoughts from the skaters representing USC at ice rinks. And we would love to share them with you. What do you wish people knew about figure skating? Nathan Dennler: \u201cI wish people knew how freeing it feels to skate.\u201d Risha Surana: \u201c[I wish people knew] how much strength it takes to jump, spin and wake up at 4 in the morning for practices in a cold rink.\u201d Sara: \u201cIt\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows. There are very rigid gender roles in the sport, and it can be pretty cis-heteronormative. Also, eating disorders and body image issues are pretty prevalent issues in competitive skating.\u201d Cassidy Idenoshita: \u201cI wish people knew that figure skating is a sport you can start at any time of your life. I feel like it has a connotation that people can\u2019t start it after they have become an adult, but I believe it\u2019s never too late to learn the art of figure skating.\u201d\n\nMany competitive figure skaters are battling eating disorders because of body image issues and some problematic training methods designed by their coaches. If you are interested in learning more about this, here is a detailed article on how Eteri Tutberidze\u2019s young girls rely on low body weight to complete jump rotations instead of properly building muscles. It means that her students suffer from restrictive eating (including not being allowed to drink water on competition days and for the entire duration of the Olympics), taking puberty blocks and maintaining a diet of only powdered nutrients to lose weight. One of Tutberidze\u2019s previous students, Yulia Lipnitskaya, who helped Russia win a gold team medal back in Sochi 2014, had to be hospitalized for three months to treat anorexia and other severe injuries.\n\nAnd yes! You can pick up skating at any stage of your life! The Pasadena Ice Skating Center is the closest indoor ice skating rink to campus that I know of. If you want to venture further, I strongly recommend skating at Irvine\u2019s gorgeous Great Park Ice. It has the most well-established facilities and training system I have seen at an ice rink. Olympians can teach you, and who knows, you might bump into the most famous figure skating coach in America, Rafael Arutyunyan, and a couple of his Olympic and World Champions.\n\nWhat do you think is the No. 1 reason for people to love figure skating? Nathan: \u201cFor me, it is the stories your programs can tell.\u201d Risha: \u201cThe feeling of weightlessness.\u201d Sara: \u201cEveryone has different No. 1 reasons for loving figure skating. [It] could be the costumes, music, artistry, self-expression, jumps, drama, speed and more.\u201d Cassidy: \u201cFrom the [audience\u2019s] point of view, I think the number one reason for people to love figure skating is because the sport is a combination of elegance and strength. It\u2019s fascinating and entertaining to watch and is entertaining throughout the whole performance. From a figure skater\u2019s point of view, I think people love figure skating because it\u2019s such a complex sport that once you get drawn in, it\u2019s kind of hard to get out. I remember learning my first jumps and spins, and once I was able to do them, I wanted to keep going. And being able to perform to people and make them happy is a part of it that I love as well.\u201d\n\nThe duality of athleticism and art is certainly one of the things that make figure skating unique. If a skater masters this quality, they can create magic on ice. I would also add that because figure skating is a niche sport in the United States, it has an almost intimate feeling. We have a tight-knit community of skaters, fans, officials and volunteers. You do not feel all that distanced from those figure skating stars!\n\nAnd finally, if someone asks you what figure skating is and you can show them only one program, which one would it be? Nathan: \u201cI think this one (Kim Yuna\u2019s Les Miserables free skate at 2013 Worlds) shows a lot of dynamic range in emotion and is probably one of my favorite ones.\u201d Sara: \u201cYuzuru Hanyu\u2019s long program at the 2018 Olympics. Not a technically perfect program, but I think it slays.\u201d Cassidy: \u201cI would say figure skating combines ballet and gymnastics. Here\u2019s a link to a program (Cassidy\u2019s performance at the 2017 Southern California Open Championships) I would show people.\u201d In honor of the cosmic composer Sakamoto Ryuichi who passed away on March 28, I would choose Mihara Mai\u2019s short program choreographed by David Wilson this season \u2014 Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.\n\nWe hope you can see that, like any other sports, the athletes\u2019 ease and graciousness on ice are achieved with diligent training, consistent attention to detail and a strong willingness for improvement. It may have moments of drama and scandals, but its special connection with artistry keeps people coming back to and loving this sport. Now, are you ready to give ice skating a try? \u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/04/meet-the-district-6-candidates-rose-grigoryan/", "response": "```\nMeet the District 6 candidates: Rose Grigoryan\n\nSmall business owner, and former journalist, Grigoryan runs a campaign based on mental health response and small business support.\n\nBy Melisa Cabello Cuahutle April 04, 2023 at 3:10 pm PDT\n\nLos Angeles District 6 City Council candidates must deal with more than just a special election. On top of issues like homelessness, the environment and public safety, whoever wins the seat at the table will face the social and political tensions that former Council President Nury Martinez\u2019s racist remarks left. But Rose Grigoryan thinks she is up for the challenge.\n\nGrigoryan, who is originally from Armenia but has spent the last 10 years in the U.S., is a small business owner and former journalist at a local T.V. station, and now she is one of the candidates running in the April 4 special election for the seat left vacant by Martinez\u2019s resignation last year.\n\n\u201cI decided to put all my efforts because I have been (helping my community) for years,\u201d said Grigoryan. \u201cI can do anything I want to do on a higher level, to be able to help people and to resolve very important issues in the community.\u201d\n\nBefore coming to the US, Grigoryan grew up in Artashat, a provincial manufacturing city near the Turkish border, and her mother was a teacher, and her father had a small furniture business, although he passed away when she was just 7 months old. With a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and psychology and a master\u2019s degree in social philosophy, Grigoryan was about to complete her final examinations to receive her Ph.D. from Yerevan State University when she got into the Green Card lottery to come to the U.S.\n\nThe lottery afforded her a rare opportunity that few people got, so Grigoryan pushed all her plans aside and came to Los Angeles. She arrived in September of 2013, and by the time December came, she didn\u2019t even have anyone to say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d to. She was all alone.\n\nBefore she was a candidate and owned her own business, Grigoryan\u2019s first job in the U.S. was at a bridal shop, carrying dresses to the fitting rooms. She would later spend seven years at the Southern California T.V. network, the Armenian Television Network, the first and largest Armenian T.V. network in Los Angeles.\n\nToday, she owns her business, specializing in marketing and financial investment for other businesses. Outside of that, she enjoys baking in her free time, making things from scratch, including making her yeast. Her favorite dish is a pesto roll with salmon and sour cream inside.\n\nFor those who follow her on her social media, Grigoryan sometimes shares available city services for those who need them. But her plans for the City Council go beyond that.\n\nGrigoryan was motivated to run for City Council when she heard the recording where Martinez and two fellow Council members discussed carving up Black and Latino political power at City Hall while making racist remarks against a Black child and Indigenous people. Martinez resigned in October of 2022, three days after the Los Angeles Times published the leaked audio of a year-old conversation between Martinez and former City Councilman Gil Cedillo, current City Councilman Kevin de Le\u00f3n and Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera.\n\n\u201cI heard it. And I felt like we need somebody here who will share for the community, who knows the community, who will care for the community and who is not running for a paycheck or position or political career,\u201d said Grigoryan.\n\nDistrict 6, which includes Sun Valley, Arleta, Panorama City, Lake Balboa and Van Nuys, hasn\u2019t had a full-time representative since the leak. The district comprises predominantly Hispanic people, representing 72% of the population; Asian people represent 9%, while Black people conform for 3% of the population. The median household income is a little over $40,000, and around 17% of the population lives in poverty.\n\nGrigoryan says her top priorities are affordable housing, public safety and small businesses. She plans to support small businesses and improve housing affordability in a partnership-like plan. While in public safety, she wants to alleviate the 911 emergency line and work with personnel specializing in mental health instead of policing.\n\nFor affordable housing, she believes that focusing on small businesses is the way to go as Grigoryan says, \u201cThey are the center part of (the) development of the community.\u201d She plans to create incentives for developers and build temporary housing to fill the gap.\n\nIn regards to public safety, Grigoryan does believe that when there is a violent case, police officers are needed, but she is also interested in creating a non-emergency line in which mental health experts can act when appropriate.\n\n\u201cIf there is no violence there, social workers, psychologists or psychiatrists, somebody from, of course, not the law enforcement should be the responder,\u201d said Grigoryan, adding that she plans to educate the community on when this type of response will be appropriate.\n\nGrigoryan mentioned several examples of where the funds could be allocated: \u201cWe can get the funding from the homeless services departments, (and other) associations, nonprofits. We can ask (for) money from the state and the federal government.\u201d\n\nGrigoryan has a similar approach to homelessness, opting for a mental health experts approach. Her website states, \u201cAnti-camp ordinances must come with caseworker services to provide rehabilitation. Merely using police to remove campers is not effective. Instead, police and social workers should collaborate to allocate caseworker services to help individuals access resources and become productive members of society.\u201d\n\nAnother of her priorities relies on the environment, and she wants to address the pollution in factories and the Van Nuys Airport. The Van Nuys airport is well known among private jet owners, however, Van Nuys residents, which is located in District 6, have long been discontented with the environmental and health consequences that they have to live with. District 6 residents and community organizers agreed this is one of their top priorities.\n\nLionel Mares, a Board Member at the Sun Valley Neighborhood Council, says that air pollution \u201cis a pressing matter,\u201d but he isn\u2019t picking Grigoryan to be the one to face that challenge at District 6.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s well-rounded enough or she doesn\u2019t have the experience or knowledge of what\u2019s going on because she\u2019s new, so her lack of public sector or nonprofit sector experience,\u201d said Mares.\n\nAt a different District 6 Neighborhood Council, Grigoryan was not favored to be elected, although for different reasons. Raymond Duran, president of the Arleta Neighborhood Council, says he prefers to have an older representative of young candidates in general, he said, \u201c(The) issue I have with (young candidates) is that a lot of times these young people, they\u2019re trying to look for a career. And a lot of times in politics, you\u2019ve got to bend different ways to stay in that career,\u201d said Duran.\n\nDuran says that if you have a career to fall back to, you will stay in politics because you want to make a change, not because you need the income. But Grigoryan has a business to fall back to, which she says pays better than the City Council.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running for a position for a political career because, through my business, I can get at least two times more than when I am at the city council,\u201d said Grigoryan. \u201cBut I do feel that we need somebody who will put the brains, the drive, the heart in the community to rebuild the trust and to make that change.\u201d\n\nBut Grigoryan faces a challenge ahead. Traditionally, candidates with the biggest name recognition, the most funds and the better endorsements have the biggest advantage to win, and Grigoryan has none of this. With $43,000 funds gathered and then matched from the city, Grigoryan finds herself in the middle of the race, with candidates like Isaac Kim or Douglas Sierra having fewer funds than her and others having a lot more funds, like Marisa Alcaraz, who has gathered almost $156,000.\n\nOther candidates have more public roles, such as Alcaraz, who currently works as Deputy Chief of Staff for Councilman Curren Price, or Marco Santana, Director of Engagement at L.A. Family Housing.\n\nLastly, Grigoryan lacks enough endorsements to say a victory is possible safely. Her website lists no endorsements, and big endorsements have gone to other candidates, such as The Los Angeles Times endorsing Santana.\n\nBut with one week left for the election, Grigoryan\u2019s campaign is not lost. Per the Los Angeles election system, the new District 6 Council Member will need at least 50% of the votes this April 4. If no one gets those votes, there will be a runoff in June.\n\nDistrict 6 is predominantly Latinx, but Los Angeles has a significant Armenian population. One might think the latter could give Grigoryan an advantage, but Grigoryan rejects this, saying this shouldn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cI run for the community itself,\u201d said Grigoryan. \u201cI have always told my friends that you shouldn\u2019t vote for (Armenians) just because he or she is an Armenian. You should vote for a candidate who is willing to support his or her drive, energy, their brain, their heart in doing something.\u201d\n\nTo not do this, she says, is a mistake.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to walk the path of Nury Martinez. I want the new leader to take the path of humanity,\u201d said Grigoryan.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/04/meet-the-district-6-candidates-marco-santana/", "response": "```\nMeet the District 6 candidates: Marco Santana\n\nWith experience in homelessness services, Santana is ready to take over District 6.\n\nMarco Santana has never held elective office, but a raft of powerful endorsements has propelled him to sudden prominence in the crowded field of candidates in the special Los Angeles City Council election to fill the vacant seat in the San Fernando Valley\u2019s District 6. From Democratic clubs, newspapers like the Los Angeles Times, and influential politicians like current council member Nithya Raman, his long list of influential supporters put him as one of the top contenders for the role.\n\nHis status as a veteran Latino political aide and nonprofit executive may also give him a leg up in the majority-Hispanic district formerly served by Nury Martinez, who was forced to resign in October of 2022. Santana was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, one of the children of a Mexican couple who immigrated to L.A. At 32, he\u2019s spent most of his life there, graduating from California State University Northridge and renting out a place in the area for himself and his dog.\n\nRegarding jobs, he\u2019s also mainly kept things local, working in different political organizations and occasionally serving as an aide to other politicians, such as Congressman Tony Cardenas and Senator Bob Hertzberg. His most recent job, however, is as the director of engagement of L.A. Family Housing, a nonprofit organization that offers services to those experiencing homelessness and advocates for their needs.\n\nWhile his connection with the valley is longstanding, Santana said he considered leaving it late last year. \u201cI was being recruited by another homeless service provider, and they were asking me if I wanted to take a job in Santa Barbara to be their regional homeless director, and I would oversee all homeless services in Santa Barbara,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo I was like. Wow! This is a huge opportunity. I\u2019ve never thought about leaving the valley, let alone Los Angeles. Let me think it over.\u201d\n\nThat was Friday, Oct. 7. On Sunday, a team of L.A. Times reporters published the now-infamous audio tape of L.A. City Council president Nury Martinez\u2019s meeting with other council members and a union leader. In it, she espoused racial slurs toward the child of another council member, discussed the redistricting issue using racist language towards many local communities, berated other council members using offensive language, and demonstrated what the L.A. Times later described as the \u201cbare-knuckle fighting\u201d present behind closed doors.\n\nBy the following Friday, Martinez had resigned, leaving her seat vacant and leading to the current special election. For Santana, that was a defining moment. Although he acknowledged having his grievances about Martinez\u2019s policies in a recent podcast with former council member Mike Bonin, he was still glad to see a Latino like her leading a mostly Hispanic district. But after hearing the tapes, Santana confided to Bonin. He was scared that L.A. would plummet back into the tension-ridden days of the early 90s, with minority communities being hostile to one another instead of working together.\n\nStill, this was insufficient to convince him to run for the vacant seat. \u201cI started having friends reaching out, telling me, \u2018Hey, this is your home. This is where you grew up. This is where you\u2019ve worked. You should run,\u2019\u201d he said. After a while, though, he thought about the leadership he\u2019d like to see and considered, why not step up himself? \u201cI told myself ... why not (run for city council)? I\u2019ve stayed here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve given back. I\u2019ve found more ways to give back, and I\u2019ve continuously tried empowering and providing resources to this district. So, if I\u2019m already doing that work, why not take it to the next level?\u201d\n\nSantana\u2019s policies are detailed, especially those concerning homelessness. On his website, recently updated to reflect his platform, there are several paragraphs concerning the issue from various angles, from how to build more housing using current policies to how to keep it affordable and accessible to people in the district. For example, he advocates for more houses in transit corridors, to allow religious organizations to build housing on their vacant land, and creating more accessory dwelling units while emphasizing the city\u2019s role in promoting equity in homeownership in a proposed system like Detroit\u2019s neighborhood initiative, where the city provides cheaper and less constraining mortgages for citizens in need.\n\nHis policies regarding other matters, including the contentious lack of public transportation that plagues the San Fernando Valley, are vaguer but still detailed enough compared to his competition. In general, his solutions are more progressive than not by his acknowledgment. Santana also seems to be comfortable in a leadership position, which is even clearer when contrasted to other first-time candidates with no political experience.\n\nIn endorsing him, the L.A. Times outlined how he is a \u201crespected leader, someone equally comfortable working with homeless clients or speaking at a conference.\u201d Unsurprisingly, this up-and-coming profile, paired with these policies, attracts a particular type of voter who routinely supports more progressive causes and candidates. And, certainly, Santana has his fair share of those.\n\nHowever, as the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission page reveals, his support also extends to those who usually would rarely support such a candidate, including executives at real estate companies and law firms. Because of such discrepancy, some criticized him for being too willing to compromise on his ideas. Some, especially business owners, go almost as far as calling him hypocritical for it.\n\nFor example, in that same Bonin podcast, when asked whether he would enforce the zones where homeless people cannot stay, Santana gave a lukewarm response, highlighting the importance of providing them with services while protecting the \u201cfew green spaces\u201d that the district has. That ambivalence and overall vagueness have also cost him a run-in with the county\u2019s Democratic Party over one of his fliers. A door hanger distributed around the district read that Santana was supported by the \u201cDemocratic Party,\u201d which is untrue. While supported by various Democratic clubs, including the Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley, he is not officially endorsed by the Los Angeles County Democratic Party.\n\nHis fellow candidate Imelda Padilla criticized him, describing his attitude as \u201cvery slick.\u201d Santana is aware of these criticisms. In his eyes, this attitude is desirable and proves he is pragmatic about his campaign objectives. \u201cYou\u2019re identifying that I care about progressive values but that I\u2019m realistic in what we can accomplish,\u201d he commented.\n\nEven if he believes it to be one of his strong suits, Santana still sometimes struggles to exercise that pragmatism and toe the line between his progressive values and moderate supporter base, leaving him wide open to harsher criticism. According to the L.A. City Ethics Commission page, Santana is the only candidate in the race with independent expenditures levied against him. The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the LAPD union, has spent almost $60,000 to mount a mail campaign criticizing his homelessness policies.\n\nIn that mailer, they cite two times when Santana talked about repealing the city\u2019s anti-camping laws, prohibiting homeless encampments from being built near schools and parks. Although limited circulation, the mailer still managed to capitalize on moments where Santana was \u201ctoo\u201d progressive and may be effective in convincing part of his moderate support base to reconsider their votes.\n\nDespite these criticisms, one of the main reasons he believes he has such a vast amount of support is his image as a local, down-to-earth leader. He bets on the idea that, regardless of your political background, you can appreciate someone you know. \u201cI think one of the biggest things that stood out is that, and I\u2019ve had a lot of folks tell me: \u2018Hey, Marco, I\u2019m so excited because I know you. Even if you\u2019re not my friend, you\u2019re not speaking like a politician; you\u2019re speaking like a regular person, and that gets me excited about your candidacy. You\u2019re not posturing yourself as someone you\u2019re not. Whatever the case, you\u2019re talking to me as a friend and person, so I think that\u2019s made people more inclined to get involved.\u201d\n\nThe race is tight, less than a week away from the election. Although he ranks third among the candidates in a long list of significant endorsers, Santana does not believe his victory is inevitable. His campaign still faces an obstacle many believed to be behind him: to be known. \u201cAt the end of the day, the money, the endorsements, none of that matters. If we\u2019re not out there getting our message out... if I\u2019m not the first person that knocks on that door that gives them a phone call...that would be the downfall,\u201d he concluded.\n```"}

It was the day Nury Martinez, then Los Angeles City Council President, was exposed for making racist remarks on a leaked audio recording, eventually leading to her resignation. Now, Scully is running to take her place.\n\nThe tape didn\u2019t just upset Scully, it put her life on a new trajectory. After the Los Angeles Times broke the story in October 2022, several elected officials, including President Joe Biden, called for Martinez to step down. Meanwhile, Scully\u2019s phone buzzed with messages from her friends organizing protests against Martinez.\n\nAround two weeks after the infamous tape was revealed, Scully started to wonder if she should run for the vacant spot in the neighborhood she calls home, \u201cWhat would it feel like if the person who was in charge of governing this part of town cared deeply about everyone here?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if they moved in spaces from an anti-racist, anti-oppression lens?\u201d\n\nRealizing someone who is an activist like her, rather than a career politician, might offer an appealing alternative in the current political climate \u2013 Scully decided to take the leap and launch her campaign to \u201cbring care to the Valley,\u201d her website says.\n\nDistrict 6 has been left without permanent representation. A special election is set for April 4 to fill her vacancy, and if no candidate gets a majority, there will be a run-off on June 27.\n\nScully describes herself on social media as a \u201cqueer, Black feminist and mother of two,\u201d though she\u2019d like to keep her children, ages 9 and 11, out of the campaign spotlight. Scully is a 38-year-old national organizer for the Unitarian Universalist Women\u2019s Federation. She has a Master\u2019s in teaching from the University of Southern California and a dual Bachelor\u2019s in humanities and philosophy from Stetson University in DeLand, Florida.\n\nShe is the founder of Valley Justice Collective, an organization aimed at ending oppressive systems harming marginalized communities through aid, protest and civic engagement. Scully has also worked to support those experiencing homelessness through the NoHo Home Alliance.\n\nScully moved to Southern California in 2008, but she grew up in Eatonville, Florida, the first town successfully established by African American freedmen after emancipation. Many of her beliefs today can be traced back to her hometown of about 2,200 people.\n\nScully\u2019s parents met in high school but have been divorced her entire life. Her father moved to Phoenix, Arizona, when she was a teenager, leaving their relationship strained. However, she remains very close to her mother, who had Scully at 17. Scully\u2019s mother has ping-ponged between jobs but currently works as a cake decorator in Florida.\n\nScully\u2019s community, she said, catapulted her into a life of activism. \u201cI think about all of the other strong people I grew up with \u2013 my uncle, my grandparents, and all of the hard work they do,\u201d Scully said. \u201cThose are the kinds of relationships and people that I saw as heroes, everyday people volunteering at church, putting together festivals, people who had community gardens.\u201d\n\nScully sports a yellow sunflower hair clip tucked into her locks nearly everywhere she goes. While it has been a recognizable symbol on the campaign trail, her rationale for the accessory has more meaning.\n\nScully hopes the yellow bloom serves a higher purpose: softening the blow of her messages and making people more receptive, \u201cI wanted to give people the chance to still see me as a full person.\u201d\n\nTake Scully at first glance: a Black woman often displaying messages such as \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201cabolitionist for everyone\u201d across her t-shirt. Her appearance, she said, makes people dismissive and even resentful. \u201cThey look at a protest shirt with a very clear message, and they think, \u2018Ugh, that person is not my kind of person,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nOn a recent episode of former city councilman Mike Bonin\u2019s podcast, What\u2019s Next, Los Angeles?, Scully explained she feels scrutinized, \u201cI think that there are a lot of other people in this race who are going to be given a lot more grace than I am.\u201d\n\nMany have taken to Twitter to critique her, accusing Scully of identity politics and being \u201cwoke.\u201d Several Twitter users have questioned her capacity to hold the city council position.\n\nUnder a Tweet Bonin posted about his interview with Scully, Twitter user @faster_paster1 commented, \u201cEnough with identity politics. Pave the roads, pick up the trash, reduce crime, create opportunities for people to succeed.\u201d\n\nAnother user, @Eugenesnail, questioned Scully\u2019s motive for running, saying, \u201c... does she have any qualifications worthy of the job she seeks? Or is it she just needs a job?\u201d\n\nScully\u2019s partner, Jolly Hollamon who goes by they/them pronouns, described how people often reverse their course when they meet her, \u201cShe\u2019s got this aura about her where you can tell she\u2019s kind and caring and compassionate, and it\u2019s really disarming for people who think they want to be enemies with her.\u201d\n\nAlong with organizing events for her church and singing in the choir, Scully can be seen outdoors: learning to kayak, and biking with her partner while her children roller skate and scooter.\n\nScully has been an avid bookworm since she could read at just four years old. \u201cI could read sooner than I could speak a lot of words,\u201d she said. She created the Black and Bookish Literary Collective a few years ago, a website that celebrates Black literature, and posts her current reads on her campaign website.\n\nOne of Scully\u2019s favorite District 6 eateries is Guido\u2019s Pizza and Pasta, which she and Hollamon have been regulars at since they met in 2019. When Scully switches up their usual order \u2013 an eggplant and cheese pizza \u2013 the restaurant often calls back to confirm they didn\u2019t mishear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so nice to build a community in this space,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get to know everybody around you, and I love that about these neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nScully is running a grassroots campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do it any other way,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t have the stomach to do it in a way that is not authentic or intentional.\u201d\n\nAs of March 18, Scully has raised $12,487, the second lowest among her five official competitors, according to the L.A. City Ethics Commission.\n\nDistrict 6 is located in northeast Los Angeles and spans the neighborhoods of Arleta, Van Nuys, Sun Valley, Lake Balboa, Panorama City, North Hills and North Hollywood. According to 2016 estimates by L.A. County, District 6 is a majority Latino/Latina district (71%) with just over 283,000 people. Residents have a medium household income of around $45,500 a year, and nearly 23% live below the poverty line.\n\nDistrict 6 is facing a host of issues that Scully hopes to tackle in the office with her activist experience, including the unhoused crisis, crime, transportation and environmental matters. For Scully, these problems should be looked at through an equity-seeking perspective.\n\nHomelessness, she said, is going to take several solutions to address its many causes. Scully advocates for more broadly issued rental caps, limiting the percentage points rent can be increased yearly. However, doing so would require repealing the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, a state law that supersedes council ordinances.\n\nScully advocates for more extensive outreach programs and relationship building among the unhoused, case workers and landlords to help get more people inside and off the streets. \u201cIt starts with talking to unhoused people and asking them what they need and want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt continues with building more shelters ... more access to affordable housing.\u201d\n\nScully wants to repeal city ordinance 41.18, which makes it illegal for anyone to obstruct a street, sidewalk, or another public right-of-way by sitting, lying, or sleeping. As a police abolitionist, Scully would like to see the eradication of the police force entirely. \u201c[Policing] is an infrastructure put in place to harm Black and brown people,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have a world for police.\u201d\n\nCritics of abolition have stated a police force is necessary to protect citizens. Scully thinks the LAPD budget could be better served elsewhere in housing, parks, afterschool programs and education.\n\nFor Scully, transportation access is also an issue of equity. She prioritizes taking the Metro and public transit herself, she said. According to the 2022 Metro Customer Experience Survey, 58% of Metro riders are Latinx, representing the largest ethnic group, followed by Black (14%) and white (12%). These riders are often low-income, with 83% making less than $49,000 annually.\n\nBus and Metro stops are often uncovered and without seating. She said she would like to see physical improvements in transit stops along with more reliable and increased transit schedules.\n\nDistrict 6 is home to the Van Nuys Airport, a non-commercial airport that saw over 300,000 take-offs and landings in 2021. Scully sees the airport as \u201cmass pollution in brown neighborhoods by privileged people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t live in these neighborhoods ... They come to where we live, they fly their jet planes and that pollution stays in our community,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe are getting the brunt of this in every aspect.\u201d\n\nScully would like to see the airport closed or for homes in Van Nuys to receive retrofitted double-paned windows and insulation to help divert some harmful pollutants.\n\nScully intends to expand inclusivity and equity in the council and the district. \u201cI am coming at this [position] from a collaboration standpoint at every turn: I want to get things done, I want to build the infrastructure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes voices from all aspects, all walks of life.\u201d\n\nIf a candidate came along who could be a better advocate for her district, Scully said she\u2019d gladly drop out to support them. \u201cThat person has not shown up,\u201d she said. \u201cI am still in the race and hoping to win.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the 2023 campaign of James Thomas)\n\nBy Taylor Marie Contarino April 04, 2023 at 2:06 pm PDT\n\nThose closest to the Rev. Dr. James Thomas from San Fernando Valley never anticipated him entering politics. However, they were not surprised that he did. A long-time advocate for everyone around him, Thomas has been a constant in the lives of his friends, family, and peers \u2013 and is now running for Los Angeles City Council.\n\n\u201cMr. Thomas has been such an advocate for us all the way from being in high school. Mr. Thomas is why I am still an American,\u201d said Baffour Osei, a high school friend of Mr. Thomas\u2019s son. Osei was at risk of deportation before Thomas stepped in and helped him navigate the collegiate search process as an international student. Today, Osei is a graduate of both Fisk and Vanderbilt University, and he now works at Princeton University\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Science as the Robotics Lab Manager.\n\nThomas is running in the upcoming Special City Council Election for the District 6 seat of former councilwoman Nury Martinez, who resigned last year after racist commentary of her and her fellow councilmen was made public, leading to a fevered frenzy of protests and calls for resignation.\n\nThomas has a long list of community-oriented roles. He is an activist in the San Fernando Valley, a pastor at the Living Word Community Church in Chatsworth, and a Pan-African Studies professor at California State University Los Angeles. Thomas is also an alumnus of USC\u2019s Price School of Public Policy, studied at Fisk University and Southern Illinois University, and founded the Culturally Based Algebra Camp.\n\nAfter hearing the racist comments from former councilwoman Martinez and her fellow councilmen, Thomas had enough, and he felt that his background had equipped him to be the perfect candidate for this seat.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, it was difficult for me to get as many signatures as I needed,\u201d said Thomas, \u201cI was able to get almost 700 signatures, but many of them were not valid signatures, and so we ran into a lot of different issues.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Thomas decided to continue anyway in his election pursuit, regardless of not receiving an official slot on the ballot for this April\u2019s election. Not getting enough signatures to qualify for the ballot would be a dealbreaker for many political hopefuls. Thomas, however, says he has a unique belief and trust in God that he believes can bring him to the finish line of the upcoming special election.\n\nIn this campaign, topics include street vending regulations, noise and fumes from Van Nuys Airport, homelessness, and policing. The City Council\u2019s District 6 is home to neighborhoods including Lake Balboa, Van Nuys, Panorama City, Arleta, North Hills, North Hollywood, and Sun Valley.\n\nAs of June 2018, the City Council 6th District is populated mainly by Latino people, who comprise 72% of the district. White people make up 15% of the district, Asian people make up 9% of the district, and Black people make up 3% of the district. 65% of the population is between 18 and 64 years old, according to \u2018City and Community Health Profiles: Los Angeles City Council District 6.\u2019\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of crime and safety, Thomas wants to operate with a community-first mindset. \u201cI think that an effort to reduce poverty is the most important way to reduce crime. What I mean is - \u2018refunding the police.\u2019 Police should offer a certain standard of service. This money should be refunded, invested, and invested into poverty reduction programs,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nWhen it comes to unhoused communities, Thomas aims to provide resources to get unhoused communities sheltered. \u201cThey should be given $5,000 a month guaranteed universal income immediately. We can afford that. $5,000 a month would get them off the streets immediately and give them the resources they need. Remember- being unhoused happens because of lack of affordability and availability,\u201d said Thomas, additionally- \u201cthere are people who can\u2019t find housing because of race.\u201d\n\nThose closest to Thomas are confident in his morals and ability to lead. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably one of the only people I know and including myself, that does things just for the good of his heart and not for anything in return,\u201d said Thomas\u2019s daughter, Imani, 21.\n\nDuring the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, Thomas was active in the city, protesting and working toward the rights of Black people in Los Angeles and all over the country. He was even photographed on his knees while praying as the LAPD were standing guard outside the residence of Mayor Eric Garcetti during the seventh consecutive day of Black Lives Matter protests in Los Angeles.\n\nFueled by his religious beliefs, Thomas has continued his campaign for office, even though people have urged him to drop out due to the historical lack of success for write-in candidates.\n\n\u201cThe reason that I\u2019m running is that I want all of L.A. to know that the San Fernando Valley is L.A.,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cA lot of times, we are not treated as such. A lot of times, we\u2019re treated as if we\u2019re on a whole separate island. We don\u2019t get the kind of resources that we need. We need a strong voice in the City Council chambers so that we can advocate for what citizens of the 6th district. That\u2019s who I am, that\u2019s my story, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m about.\u201d\n\nA community member of the San Fernando Valley, Thomas, believes the area doesn\u2019t get enough attention and care from the City Council. He believes that racial reconciliation needs to happen in District 6, and he hopes that he can jumpstart the healing if given the chance to join the City Council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for city leaders to address these issues and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable Los Angeles for all its residents, including African Americans,\u201d said Thomas.\n\nThomas, an active and involved member of the NAACP of the San Fernando Valley, is concerned about the many Black folks leaving Los Angeles at disproportionate rates throughout the city due to gentrification. Being in office is something he never thought he would do, but he never thought he would be a pastor or professor, and he is now both.\n\nDarnell Singleton is a filmmaker and a close friend of Thomas. The two have been friends since 1986, when they met during their undergraduate studies. Singleton was friends with Thomas\u2019 now wife, Mona Thomas, who runs the Culturally Based Algebra Camp alongside her husband.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a surprise, but he\u2019s always been a people person,\u201d remarks Singleton when asked if he foresaw Thomas entering politics. \u201cSince he\u2019s a pastor, I think he has a deep understanding of people and meeting people where they are.\u201d\n\nSingleton reflected on a time that he and Thomas reunited upon Singleton\u2019s move to Los Angeles, where the reverend was the one to make the trek to Los Angeles International Airport to pick him and his belongings up.\n\n\u201cThe first time I came to L.A., James came to pick me up from the airport. He said, \u2018okay, before we get started, I wanna take you somewhere ...We go downtown, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh cool,\u2019 I\u2019ve never seen Downtown before... We keep driving, and he\u2019s like, \u2018no, that\u2019s not what I wanna show you.\u2019 He pulls around the corner, and we pull up on Skid Row.\u201d\n\nWhen Singleton asked Thomas why they went to Skid Row, the reverend responded: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever forget what it\u2019s all about. I don\u2019t ever want you to forget what\u2019s most important.\u201d\n\nAngela LeFlore has known Thomas since her childhood. \u201cI think it is awesome,\u201d said LeFlore regarding the campaign. \u201cI know he would do an excellent job. I am hoping and praying he is able to get the seat because of his passion and love for the people.\u201d\n\nAccording to his peers, a central identity of Thomas is that he doesn\u2019t compromise his morals, ethics, or beliefs for anything. \u201cAll his life, he has always been a person who wanted to help the underdog. If he saw anybody being mistreated or going through something, he\u2019s always a person who would go out of his way to help, and sacrificially help. All of his life, that\u2019s just who he\u2019s been since [he was] a kid. That is who he has been,\u201d said LeFlore.\n\nAs an activist and a pastor, the community lies at the center of Thomas\u2019 world. \u201cHe is a person that doesn\u2019t compromise and wouldn\u2019t compromise what\u2019s best for the people for his own gain,\u201d finished LeFlore.\n\nThomas has been part of the race as an unofficial candidate since January 18. The special election will take place on April 4, and Thomas will go against fellow candidates, including Marisa Alcaraz, Rose Grigoryan, Isaac Kim, Imelda Padilla, Marco Santana, Antoinette Scully, and Douglas Sierra. If necessary, a runoff will conclude the election on June 27.\n```"}

When Padilla was eight years old, a local city council member invited Padilla and her classmates to take pictures at the town\u2019s pool reopening after it had been closed for years. Standing with her classmates posing for the photo-op, she realized that the government not just existed but affected real life \u2014 someone had to be in charge for things to run. There, the initial seeds of her interest in politics were sown.\n\nPadilla is one of six candidates on the special election ballot in Los Angeles City Council District 6. As a lifelong resident of the Valley, Padilla hopes to bring her skills from years of experience at nonprofit organizations, county projects and lessons from her own life into the job. Six months ago, she had no plans to launch a campaign soon. Still, despite telling herself to stop caring, whenever she drove around the community, she could not help but notice things she wanted to make better.\n\n\u201cSomewhere in my heart, I\u2019ve always had a knack for wanting to improve our community ... I have been in the trenches of getting our community connected with the halls of power,\u201d Padilla said to her supporters at her March 4th campaign rally. \u201cI have worked as hard as I possibly could make sure our stories, our experiences, are considered valid so people at City Hall know what should be permitted in the rules that make up and impact our lives.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming election on April 4th was spurred by former City Council President Nury Martinez\u2019s leaked audio tape, where outrage from across Los Angeles County led to her resignation. With trust levels for politicians sinking across the county over the last few years, District 6 is wary of another Martinez. Padilla, in particular, has come under scrutiny for her ties to Martinez, with some tweets on @LACandidates comparing her to Nury, even calling her \u201cNury clone 2.0.\u201d Padilla has previously worked under her at Pacoima the Beautiful, where Martinez allowed 22-year-old Padilla to be a community organizer, one of Padilla\u2019s favorite past jobs.\n\nDespite their past, Padilla was angry and disappointed when the audio was released. \u201cIt was a lot of people on there that a lot of people in my circles looked up to, so it hit me like a ton of bricks,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to mourn this out \u2014 [the community is] allowed to be sad and mad and upset.\u201d\n\nPadilla has always kept the community in mind. The seeds of political interest continued to take root as a young Padilla became more involved in community activism. Padilla, who had rickets, a childhood vitamin D deficiency that can cause bone deformities, struggled with being picked on when her condition was most visible. It was \u201cnormal\u201d for people to stare at her at family parties or even in Mexico. Though she credits her experience with making her tough, she created a safe environment when she got to elementary school, where she made a base of very close friends and fell in love with the school and the idea of community.\n\n\u201c[They are the kind of friends] that were like, \u2018if you\u2019re going to pick on our friend, you\u2019re going to pick on us,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I always loved school \u2014 I always had that close-knit sense of community.\u201d\n\nEmbracing her love for her community, Padilla followed in the footsteps of her older sisters, Carmen Pilar Padilla and Veronica Padilla, who \u201cgravitated toward community service.\u201d They worked on a private-public partnership project called Clean & Green, which aims to provide community beautification services across the city. When Padilla reached the ninth grade, her sisters introduced her to the L.A. City Youth Council, where youth from across the city can observe and work with local civic and elected leaders. It was there that Padilla was able not only to learn how the city functions but also how the city prioritizes different projects and how the city collects funds.\n\nPadilla credits learning all these things from a young age inspired her to study political science. She graduated from UC Berkeley and then went to Cal State Northridge for her master\u2019s degree in public administration.\n\nIn high school in Sun Valley, Padilla traveled with classmates, her teacher, Dr. Ron Lehavi, and classmates to Europe. Lehavi, who also taught her a few college courses, recalls how her leadership skills were evident back then. \u201cAlways the organizer,\u201d he says, remembering Padilla helping students try new foods and experiences and always being open-minded no matter the circumstance.\n\nAfter Padilla left school, Lehavi continued collaborating with her on various projects, from establishing Padilla as a founder of Pacoima the Beautiful. This organization focused on community clean-ups and tree-planting events to help Padilla with her unsuccessful LAUSD school board campaign bid in 2017; the pair have worked on various local programs and campaigns over the last 20 years.\n\nWorking with her was wonderful, Lehavi said, as he felt like she saw activism as a situation where everyone can win. Instead of excluding voices, she looks at the community as a whole, always trying to add more people and stakeholders rather than \u201cbattling and attacking them.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike some of the previous people who worked here who saw [the Valley] as a battleground, she sees things as a meeting ground,\u201d Lehavi said.\n\nFrom founding her nonprofit organization, Together We Do More, which helps middle and high school students consider higher education and professional development, to working on L.A. County Commission on Women and Girls, Padilla learned two important skills she hopes to bring to the office: coalition building and being outcome driven.\n\n\u201cNot only do I like to build the coalitions, but I like to make sure that everybody feels like what they\u2019re creating is sustainable,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cEverything that I do, I\u2019m always thinking six months ahead, three years ahead, seven to 10 years ahead ... I want to be intergenerational \u2014 consistently be thinking about the future while respecting the past and finding that balance. Plan it out, build the coalitions and make those outcomes come through.\u201d\n\nAccording to the L.A. City Census, District 6 is a majority Hispanic district also made up of about 10% Asian people, 18% Non-Hispanic white people and 3.2% Non-Hispanic Black people. About 22% live in poverty, and around 35% have not graduated high school.\n\nPadilla\u2019s campaign has already brought together endorsements from District 6, the Valley and greater Los Angeles. From local labor unions in the Valley and community leaders to notable politicians like Congressman Tony Cardenas, Padilla has support from many corners of Los Angeles.\n\nAs of March 18th, Padilla\u2019s campaign had over $90,000 in campaign contributions and over $150,000 in matching funds from the city.\n\nAt her March 4th campaign rally, over 150 people supported her, from Labor 300 members to Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez. The rally was bursting with energy; despite chairs lined around the room\u2019s perimeter, everyone was on their feet, cheering and clapping.\n\nEven before the rally began, Padilla welcomed everyone with a handshake or a hug, speaking English and Spanish as necessary. Along with decadent pastries, coffee and other beverages, the walls were lined with campaign posters and a District 6 map showing volunteers exactly where they should go to talk to voters.\n\nRoger Ortiz, a Lake Balboa resident and volunteer with Padilla\u2019s campaign, said it was heartbreaking when Martinez\u2019s tape came out. Despite previous disappointments, he believes that Padilla is running for the right reasons. He knows her as someone whose passion for the community and activism has never been for a title.\n\nOther volunteers and friends at the rally, including Councilwoman Rodriguez, echoed similar sentiments, describing Padilla as a \u201cfighter,\u201d as Rodriguez yelled out to the crowd, \u201cFor the love of the valley, for the love of the city of Los Angeles, we need to elect Imelda Padilla!\u201d. In contrast, the rest of the crowd burst into cheers and applause.\n\nRodriguez has watched Padilla\u2019s activism during the raise the minimum wage campaign and her leading the fight to establish the city\u2019s first youth department. The councilwoman sees Padilla as someone who can roll up her sleeves and do the work that needs to be done for the community.\n\nWith trust levels at an all-time low across Los Angeles, Rodriguez thinks it\u2019s important for elected officials to understand what it takes to get things done on a street level, not just \u201cespouse\u201d policies. To Rodriquez, it\u2019s more important to \u201cdeliver change on the ground,\u201d and Padilla is the one who knows how to do it.\n\n\u201cWhether it was raising the minimum wage or organizing environmental justice, she\u2019s been at the forefront for doing it for the very people that have been her friends and neighbors her entire life,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nPadilla\u2019s plans after college always included returning to her community, whether in community activism or policy. Youth programs are particularly important to Padilla, and she believes that the city of Los Angeles needs to do more to ensure young people have something to do after school, a sentiment she shares with Rodriquez.\n\nHer homelessness solution begins with emergency remediation of the encampments and connecting the unhoused populations to essential services that will support them in finding housing, employment and health services. Padilla also supports controversial homeless measure 41.18, which bars people from camping on streets or sidewalks in ways that block passage but is critical of the policy, seeing it as a tool for extreme cases only.\n\nFor public safety, she believes that the city\u2019s goals should be more in line with preventing crime rather than reactionary. The problem is personal for her, as her older brother, Antonio Padilla, fell victim to the school-to-prison pipeline and is still in prison. Her safety plan also includes a pilot program in which police would cooperate with social workers to help answer mental health-related 911 calls.\n\nPadilla self-identifies as \u201cChicana\u201d and said she is a \u201cfirst-generation politicized Mexican American.\u201d As a lifelong Valley resident, her mother was a factory worker at AVX filters Co for 30 years. Her father was a gardener all over Southern California until he died in an accident in 2013. She credits her parents for her work ethic, which Padilla considers her biggest strength. She also has a younger brother, Alberto Padilla, who is a chef.\n\nWith experience in various sectors, from environmental justice, and economic justice to gender justice at the nonprofit and county level, Padilla said she plans to bring an intergovernmental lens approach if elected.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do with the city on its own \u2014 we have to work with the county, we have to work with nonprofits,\u201d said Padilla. \u201cWe have to decide who has best practices and hold each other accountable.\u201d```"}

Welcome to Week Five of \u201cThe Strikeout.\u201d That first weekend went by quickly, and it featured some incredible performances. However, there is a lot of ground to cover from a fantasy perspective, so let\u2019s get into it. Keep in mind that these performances should be taken with a grain of salt considering that the hitters only had 3-4 games worth of AB\u2019s, and some pitchers have only had 1 appearance.\n\nNotable performances\n\nWander Franco went 7-for-11 with a homer, two doubles and a stolen base. Baseball\u2019s former top prospect took advantage of the Tigers\u2019 subpar arms and put up a noteworthy weekend. For those of you who roster him, I believe that this is only the beginning. We could see Franco going in the top 20 of drafts next year if he continues to hit like this. The stolen bases should keep coming as well. I\u2019m a big Franco guy and hope he keeps it up.\n\nA.J. Puk secured the save for the Marlins on Friday. Unfortunately, that was the only save situation for the Marlins all weekend. Matt Barnes pitched Saturday and Sunday, most likely cementing Puk as the Marlins go-to guy for saves. He did give up a homer to Pete Alonso, but the stuff looked good. He\u2019s only rostered in 37% of CBS leagues, so get him now while you can.\n\nNolan Gorman went 4-for-9 over the weekend with two homers. Gorman carries with him an immense amount of prospect pedigree, with power being his most tantalizing tool. I liked Gorman a lot coming into the year. He\u2019s going to get regular playing time at second base, as the Cardinals believe it\u2019s time to let their prized prospect loose at the major league level. I like Gorman as a breakout player this year, and this first weekend was a good place to start.\n\nSeth Lugo had an incredible day on Sunday. He made his first start in years for his new team in San Diego, and he did not disappoint. He went seven innings, while only giving up one earned run on four hits and seven strikeouts. Lugo is intriguing because he\u2019s always wanted to be a starting pitcher but never got the opportunity to with the Mets. The Padres have seemingly given him the opportunity to earn a spot in their rotation, and his first start of the regular season did not disappoint. While it was against an average Rockies lineup away from Coors Field, he still performed excellently and is someone you should consider picking up, as he is only 32% rostered in CBS leagues.\n\nTwo-start pitchers for the week of April 3\n\nMichael Grove won the Dodgers\u2019 fifth spot in the starting rotation, and is projected to make a start on Monday at home against the Rockies and also some time this weekend at Arizona. Grove had a 5.40 ERA and 1.08 WHIP during spring training, as well as 17 K\u2019s. These matchups are decent. The Rockies away from Coors Field are always good to bet on, and I\u2019m not fully sold on the revamped D-Backs lineup. However, if you want to take a wait-and-see approach with Grove, I wouldn\u2019t blame you.\n\nKyle Bradish emerged toward the end of last season as a legitimate rosterable fantasy starting pitcher. He put up a really good final stretch, which he looks to continue to build on this year. Bradish has matchups against the Rangers and Yankees. While the Yankees will definitely be a tough lineup to deal with, I think Bradish has the skills to limit the damage. He features a wipeout slider, above-average curveball and a mediocre fastball by movement. I\u2019d be willing to take the risk on Bradish, even in spite of the Yankees matchup.\n\nYusei Kikuchi is only 55% rostered in CBS leagues and probably deservedly so. He put up a 5.19 ERA with a 1.50 WHIP last year, but that wasn\u2019t with his new increase in velocity. He came into spring training throwing a couple miles per hour harder, which could help him increase effectiveness. He has matchups against the Royals and Angels this week, and I see him putting up great starts in both games. He was great at getting whiffs last year (top 15% in the league) and put up 31 strikeouts in 20.2 innings this spring. Let\u2019s hope the swing and miss and increased velocity lead to good outcomes.\n\nThanks for joining me for this week\u2019s edition of \u201cThe Strikeout.\u201d This first full week of games is exciting, and I hope you all enjoy the action. \u201cThe Strikeout\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

A small California city that was overrun by visitors four years ago when heavy winter rains produced a spring \"super bloom\" of wild poppies has a message for the public after this year's deluge: Do not come. You could be arrested. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nBy Joseph Hyslop, Nicole Bednar, and Maddy Brown April 03, 2023 at 6:11 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s often said that April showers bring May flowers. But in Southern California, March\u2019s monsoon has brought in a superbloom. Wildfire superblooms are rare occurrences, happening only after long periods of heavy precipitation \u2014 such as the recent rain that moved through Southern California. In fact, 2023 was Los Angeles\u2019 wettest March in 45 years. Superblooms, however, have occurred more frequently in Southern California recently, with the last two superblooms occurring in 2019 and 2017.\n\nSuperblooms are an incredibly popular attraction for California residents. During the 2019 superbloom, crowds were so overwhelming at times that Walker Canyon, a spot for blooms in Riverside, even closed temporarily due to overcrowding. Despite weekend crowds often reaching the hundreds of thousands, some Californians don\u2019t pay much mind to the event. Nathan Barrios, a West Covina resident, said that he frequently drives by areas where wildflowers are growing in abundance.\n\n\u201cI drive by it all the time so it\u2019s not really a big deal for me,\u201d Barrios said, but still noted that he thinks \u201cit\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Yet, for California visitors traveling from out of town, seeing this year\u2019s superbloom could be a once in a lifetime opportunity. East Bay resident Jaclyn Sollars said she hadn\u2019t heard of the superbloom before, but that it had caught her and her family\u2019s eye as they made their way south into L.A.\n\n\u201cDriving down here, we saw a lot of it through the national forest area. We actually noticed it, it was beautiful,\u201d she said. Her mother, Deb Sollars, said that although the family is only in the area for a couple of days, she would love to see the superbloom.\n\nHowever, the rolling hills of blooming flowers are threatened by the throngs of visitors who lack the knowledge or respect to protect the orange and yellow blossoms. This has prompted parks where the superbloom occurs to enforce protective rules in order to keep the area safe and beautiful. Experts have also offered tips on visiting these superblooms safely.\n\nThe L.A.-based Theodore Payne Foundation for Wild Flowers and Native Plants wrote in their wildflower report that \u201cif wild flowers along trails are picked or trampled, they may not set seed and deposit that seed into the soil\u2019s \u2018seed bank\u2019 as they come to the end of their life,\u201d meaning that those flowers may not rebloom the following year. Therefore, both parks and wildlife conservation agencies discourage picking the flowers from the ground.\n\nEsther Margulies, a landscape architect and part-time lecturer at USC, remained optimistic about human impact on these blooms. \u201cIn my personal experience, many of the visitors who are coming to these locations have some appreciation for the fragility,\u201d Margulies said. However, Margulies also acknowledged the inevitable occurrence of some destruction with human interaction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really impossible to not have some impact,\u201d Margulies said. Some L.A. County locals, like Orange County resident Connie Hughes, are equally concerned about the effect of so many visitors on the superbloom. Hughes is familiar with the superbloom and even knows close friends who have witnessed it, yet she, herself, has never been.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of friends who\u2019ve gone,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI was going to go down to the desert area a couple years ago and then it was such a mess with the parking and people trampling on things that I decided to give it a break.\u201d Hughes added that she would only be interested in attempting to see the superbloom in the future if it is not \u201cprecipitously bad for the environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to see,\u201d Barrios said. \u201cI feel like the natural beauty of California should be respected and kept safe so that other people can see it as well.\u201d For those who still wish to witness the superbloom, it\u2019s still possible to enjoy the phenomenon while respecting the natural environment.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Parks and Recreation website, \u201cCalifornia State Parks welcomes all to enjoy these unpredictable, rare occurrences but asks visitors to \u2018Don\u2019t Doom the Bloom\u2019 by staying on designated trails and taking only photos, not flowers.\u201d The rules laid out by CADPR include:\n\nStay on designated trails.\nTread lightly in the desert.\nDo not trample flowers.\nOnly take pictures of the flowers.\nFlower picking is prohibited.\nIf dogs are permitted, they must remain on a leash, on designated roads, in campgrounds and picnic areas.\nDrone use may be prohibited.\nIf drone use is allowed, a filming permit from individual state park units must be requested.\nLeave the landscape better than when you arrived.\nUse Leave no Trace and Leave it Better principles.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in seeing the superbloom for yourself, Annenberg Media has compiled a list of locations to check out the flowers. Early April is one of the best times to see the blooms, so if you\u2019re interested, don\u2019t wait! Locations:\n\nChino Hills State Park (45 min drive)\nSanta Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (1 hr drive)\nPoint Mugu State Park (1 hr drive)\nAntelope Valley Poppy Reserve (1 hr 40 min drive)\nDiamond Valley Lake (1 hr 45 min drive)\nJoshua Tree National Park (2 hr 25 min drive)\nAnza-Borrego State Park (2 hr 40 min drive)\n```"}

These scenes of agony and horror are increasingly all too familiar in America. In fact, 39 mass shootings have taken place across the country in just the first three weeks of 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nHallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney, Cynthia Peak, Mike Hill and Katherine Koonce lost their lives to gun violence on March 27 in the Nashville, Tennessee, Covenant School Shooting. Evelyn, 9, was in the hallway trying to pull the fire alarm to warn her peers. In a world where politicians want to ban TikTok because it harms children, but not guns, it\u2019s easy to feel hopeless, distraught and dismayed every time a new headline surfaces about another school shooting.\n\nAs of 2023, gun violence is the leading cause of death for children in the United States. Each day, 12 children die from gun violence in America at home, in the streets and at school. Another 32 are shot and injured, according to the Sandy Hook Promise. One out of every 10 gun deaths happen to a person age 19 or younger, and almost 20% of all child deaths are from gun violence.\n\nThere have been 13 school shootings in 2023 that have resulted in injuries or deaths. The Covenant School\u2019s mass school shooting on March 27 marks the 131st mass shooting in the U.S. just this year. Since 2018, 157 school shootings have taken place. In 2021, there were 35 school shootings with injuries or death. Another 10 in 2020, and 24 each in 2019 and 2018. The highest number of school shootings with injuries or deaths in a single year took place in 2022 according to Education Week, which began tracking such data in 2018. There were 51 school shootings with injuries or deaths last year.\n\nAs college students, what can we do as we watch K-12 schools being targeted as the sites of terror-filled, violent attacks? Registering to vote can allow you to participate in legislation working to decrease gun violence. You can use resources including Vote.gov and Headcount to ensure that you\u2019re registered, informed and prepared to participate in the next election that is open to you. Once registered, you can begin voting for legislation that you align with, as well as vote for those whose morals align with yours into office.\n\nWe can vote for elected officials who will support legislation to create safer laws around guns and assault rifles or weapons. Right now, there are policies being considered that could help significantly in the fight to end gun violence, including gun bans. Being aware of these and voting on them has the potential to save lives. An assault weapon ban would prohibit the legal purchase of assault, military-style weapons, such as the semiautomatic rifles used in the mass school shooting at the Covenant School. While the idea has been introduced in Congress, opposition from the GOP and the NRA has led to stagnancy in moving the bill forward. From 1994 to 2004, the United States had an assault weapon ban in place. Since that ban expired in 2004, mass shooting deaths have nearly tripled.\n\nWe can join protests and marches hosted by organizations such as March For Our Lives. They host demonstrations across the country to build solidarity amongst people who oppose gun violence. We can create and join student groups and coalitions like \u201cStudents Demand Action,\u201d in an effort to join forces with others who are passionate about ending gun violence in schools across the U.S. We can share information and raise awareness about gun violence in schools by sharing informational graphics from platforms such as Impact. We can support causes, foundations and non-profit organizations like the Sandy Hook Promise, March For Our Lives and Protect Our Schools.\n\nWe can support journalists doing important work on gun violence issues. Such platforms include Everytown and Education Week. According to the Sandy Hook Promise, \u201cin 4 out of 5 school shootings, at least one other person had knowledge of the attacker\u2019s plan but failed to report it.\u201d One study from the Secret Service and Department of Education found that 93% of school shooters planned the attack in advance. We can develop community systems to keep each other safe. Being educated on and vigilant of warning signs can help prevent school shootings before they even happen. Having these hard conversations can save lives.\n\nAccording to the Educational Fund To Stop Gun Violence, two-thirds of mass shootings either begin with an act of domestic violence or are perpetrated by shooters with a history of domestic violence. There are higher fatalities in mass shootings connected with acts of domestic violence, than those without the connection. Being able to recognize warning signs and instances of domestic abuse (from a victim\u2019s perspective as well as witnesses\u2019) can help in the fight against mass shootings. Practicing survivor-centered justice to keep survivors safe, hold abusers accountable and thus deter domestic violence is a holistic first step.\n\nA harsh reality of gun violence in our schools is that perpetrators are often cisgender, white men. In order to combat mass shootings in our schools and in our country, we also must examine the issue from an intersectional perspective. Our cultural perspective needs to change just as much as our legislation needs to change. Actively working to fight against and dismantle misogyny and white supremacy can also help in the fight against gun violence. Additionally, many acts of gun violence end in acts of suicide. Acknowledging this, and destigmatizing suicidality are two more ways we can get ahead of the curve. Preventing mental and social crisis would minimize the likelihood of depression-influenced instances of mass shootings.\n\nAs we navigate our 20s and enter the world, with all of its truths \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly, it can be scary for us to have to traverse through such painful times as we grow into our own individualities. While the issue of gun violence is heavily nuanced and complex, and we can often feel helpless in the fight against gun violence, there are ways we can show our support and awareness in preventing further mass school shootings. Even though changing laws and passing policies to fight gun violence will lie in the hands of lawmakers, there are still things we can actively be doing to show our awareness and support of those affected by gun violence in schools across America.\n```"}

Applause erupts from the crowd as Mariachi Los Troyanos de USC \u2013 USC\u2019s only official mariachi band \u2013 blares its trumpets and begins its song.\n\nMariachi Los Troyanos de USC celebrated its back to back victory at Songfest Saturday night, one of USC\u2019s oldest and largest musical traditions. A competition that dates back to 1954, the event fosters friendly competition amongst student performers while raising money for Troy Camp, a student-run organization that mentors underprivileged youth in South Los Angeles.\n\nThis year, 11 student organizations competed against one another for Songfest\u2019s winning title, including groups like the Mariachi Los Troyanos, Trojan Men (an all-male a cappella group), the USC Magic Association, USComedians and Spade A Dance.\n\nNicky Guzman, a sophomore majoring in human biology, plays the violin and works as social media chair in Mariachi Los Troyanos de USC. He said that winning at Songfest with the band felt surreal. For him, the victory was a full circle moment.\n\n\u201cLast year, I wasn\u2019t a part of the mariachi. I was an audience member, and I watched [the mariachi band] and I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh. That\u2019s amazing,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to be a part of that, so then I joined the mariachi, then performed at Songfest, and we won it again. It just came full circle, really.\u201d\n\nIn the fall of 2021, the mariachi band burst onto the scene as a new student-run mariachi ensemble at USC. Bringing together students from diverse backgrounds who share a love for mariachi music, the group quickly found its stride. They\u2019ve made a name for themselves outside of their two consecutive Songfest titles, also having performed at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the East L.A. Classic \u2013 the homecoming football game between James A. Garfield High School and Theodore Roosevelt High School.\n\nThe group has even caught the attention of NBC, which featured the band in 2022. But garnering accolades isn\u2019t the band\u2019s only goal. Guzman finds Songfest to be an important showcase of talent at USC.\n\n\u201c[Songfest] is a great way to show what everyone is interested in besides academics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives them a voice and a way for them to express themselves in a way that\u2019s eye-catching and jaw dropping.\u201d\n\nFor sophomore law, history and culture major Logan Barth, the competition is also an opportunity to reignite the spirit of tradition at the university. As the president of Trojan Pride \u2013 USC\u2019s official spirit organization, which hosted Songfest \u2013 Barth said that Songfest allows Trojan Pride to bring intersectional students together in a united celebration of arts, culture and entertainment.\n\n\u201cI think when you\u2019re applying to USC and learning about USC in general, the \u2018Trojan family,\u2019 is constantly brought up,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people wonder, is that a real thing? And then you come to USC, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god, it actually is a real thing.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe say, \u2018Fight on,\u2019 all around the world. Trojan Pride just wants to keep that tradition going. Songfest definitely contributes to the spirit,\u201d he added.\n\nDani Zand, a sophomore majoring in business administration, is Trojan Pride\u2019s assistant director. He added that the event\u2019s diversity is a reflection of the school\u2019s diverse student body, where Songfest unifies students across all acts.\n\n\u201cEven though we all have our own niche here at USC, we have to remind ourselves that at the end of the day, we\u2019re all Trojans. We\u2019re all USC students,\u201d he said. \u201cSongfest is a great way to bring all these different niches that people have found here at USC, the different homes people have found at USC together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zand and Barth, Songfest has a rich history at USC, starting in 1954, when two USC sophomores wanted to create a university-wide singing competition that also raised money for Troy Camp. The first three Songfests were held at the Greek Theatre in Griffith Park, where student performers played to the outdoor theater\u2019s nearly 6,000 person capacity. As the competition grew in popularity, it switched venues to the Hollywood Bowl, which drew crowds of nearly 20,000 people and celebrity judges.\n\nA plaque situated in front of the Norris Cinema Theatre states that by 1959, Songfest was billed the largest collegiate musicale in the United States. The tradition, originally tied to Greek life on campus, was revived last year after a seven-year hiatus.\n\nBarth said that by having Trojan Pride host and organize the event, organizers hope to preserve Songfest\u2019s longevity.\n\n\u201cWhen we took it back, we definitely wanted to rework it,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully next year, [we can] take it in a direction where it embraces the past, but also embraces a new vision.\u201d\n```"}

USC is holding an event today and tomorrow, which may be a lifesaver. Nicki Berelson reports.\n\nWith the cost of tuition at USC being raised thousands of dollars every year, many students have expressed concerns about financing their education. But what about education for their financing? According to a 2021 financial literacy survey by The Harris Poll, 75% of teens lack confident knowledge of their personal finances and a quarter of Americans claim that they don\u2019t have someone to go to for financial guidance.\n\nAt USC, the consensus is clear, students don\u2019t know much about preparing their finances for the future. This idea is summarized by sophomore Tyler Marquis, who says that this is a widespread issue.\n\nTyler Marquis: You know, I feel like there\u2019s--it\u2019s like certain people at the school know tons about finances and other people, its like nothing.\n\nTo address this gap in knowledge, USC is holding a financial literacy conference today and tomorrow to teach students about saving, investing, credit score, debt management, and much more. The USC career center\u2019s financial literacy conference was packed with dozens of students lining up outside the hall 30 minutes before and after the event to talk with speakers. The room was buzzing with questions about taxes, savings, and investments.\n\nPublic accountant and USC alum Kathryn Shirley was joined by financial planner Max Pashman to guide students through their journey to financial empowerment. Shirley expressed concern about the younger generation\u2019s financial knowledge.\n\nKathryn Shirley: Financial literacy is difficult for this generation because they just don\u2019t get the education that they need.\n\nShe believes that the key to financial independence is to start thinking about your future from an early age.\n\nKathryn Shirley: I really think that it should start in high school at least so that they can start talking about it, getting used to it, getting comfortable with it. So by the time they\u2019re in college and become young adults, it will be second hand for sure.\n\nPashman agrees with Shirley, but he believes that this whole ordeal shouldn\u2019t be scary to begin with.\n\nMax Pashman: Take your time with it. I mean, I think that what people underestimate is just how simple it can be. It\u2019s not rocket science. You just have to stick to whatever you lay out.\n\nIf you are also among the students confused about the world of personal finances, you can sign up for tomorrow\u2019s event, with topics including budgeting and building financial wealth, by visiting the USC career center website.\n\nFrom Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nicki Berelson.\n```"}

Before the historic event, students shared their perspective on the situation. Kimberly Aguirre reports.\n\nToday, former President Donald Trump flew from Florida to New York and landed in La Guardia airport in preparation of his arraignment tomorrow. This comes after Trump was indicted by a grand jury in Manhattan last Thursday. As of Monday afternoon, the exact charges against Trump are unknown, but they are believed to involve hush money that Trump allegedly paid to an adult film actress.\n\nPraveen Fernandes, the vice president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a nonprofit public interest law firm in Washington D.C., believes that although the courtroom process will be typical, the nature of the situation is extraordinary.\n\nPraveen Fernandes: I think there has rightly been a lot of attention on the unprecedented nature of the defendants here. And we have never had a president go through his process of fingerprinting, a mug shot instead of being a former president who has been charged and indicted for a crime. But the actual process itself is is not that exceptional.\n\nAccording to information provided by Fernandes, Trump plans to plead not guilty. Yet, if Trump is found guilty, the ruling would not bar him from running for office.\n\nThe unprecedented nature of this event is also something that resonates with the USC community. All around campus, students are reacting to this historic event. One of them is Luc Hosy, a junior studying arts, technology, and the business of innovation, who believes that Trump still being able to run for president speaks to a larger issue.\n\nLuc Hosy: I think the fact that he\u2019s running for president despite being indicted, I think that shows that there might be a gap in the political system in which we need to create edits and need to think about because now we have this new example in our history. I think that\u2019s cause for some change.\n\nOthers such as Macie Burgard, a senior studying civil engineering, believe that changes should also come in the way that presidents conduct themselves.\n\nMacie Burgard: Presidents will maybe feel like a little bit more responsibility and less like laws don\u2019t apply to them, because I feel like that\u2019s maybe an issue in the past, like being above the law a little bit. But ultimately, what this has done is create conversations.\n\nSomething that Jake Berg, a sophomore studying intelligence and cyber operations, hopes will cause a moment of reckoning for all Americans.\n\nJake Berg: Hopefully people realize that it\u2019s important to talk to people across the aisle or respect your counterpart\u2019s like I think both sides need to take back you, right? Like obviously MAGA people are pretty intense, but also on the other side of the aisle, people who condemn them and and don\u2019t recognize them as like fellow Americans, I think that\u2019s a step too far as well.

A speeding car ran a red light and plowed into cars in a crowded intersection Thursday in a fiery crash that killed several people, including a baby, just outside of Los Angeles, authorities said.\n\nBy Vincent Demonte, Hayes Flanagan, and Salome Nebiyu\nApril 03, 2023 at 5:25 pm PDT\n\nDo you look at your phone while driving? Well, distracted driving kills 9 people a day. April is National Distracted Driving Awareness Month, The Automotive Club of California, the LAPD and the California Highway Patrol had an event today with nine empty chairs. Hayes Flanagan has the story.\n\nOn a cloudy Monday morning...a couple of sun rays shine on the front of a gray car. Next to the car sit 9 chairs. On each one lies a white rose. And a photo of a person who lost their life to the dangers of distracted driving. LAPD officers wander the quiet patio ready to discuss ways to help prevent distracted driving.\n\nDistracted driving caused about 28,000 crashes nationwide in 2021. Doug Shupe intends to do something about it. He\u2019s the spokesperson for the Automotive Club of Southern California. Shupe recently did some fieldwork on the topic.\n\nDoug Shupe: During a two-day period, we went around Southern California, the auto club, with a videographer to capture how prevalent distracted driving is. We saw hundreds of drivers looking down at their smartphones, going at freeway speeds. Oftentimes, their heads were looking down for up to 5 seconds at a time. Five seconds, that means you are not looking at the road until I speak again...(wait 5 seconds) That\u2019s five seconds. Driving at 55 miles an hour. In five seconds you\u2019ll go the length of a football field.\n\nThe Auto Club of Southern California says if you have to text or call someone pull over to the side of the road and program your GPS before you start driving. Their biggest recommendation: put away your phone while you are driving and use the built-in features it has to help you.\n\nDoug Shupe: We\u2019re really encouraging people to use driving focus features on their phones. Those are features that would restrict incoming calls and text messages while a vehicle is in motion. It\u2019s not only Shupe\u2019s thinking, it\u2019s nationwide statistics.\n\nDoug Shupe: Triple A just did a nationwide survey on these types of driving focus features and found that 81% of drivers are aware that they exist, yet 54% have never used them.\n\nIn the middle of the Automotive Clubs event, they\u2019ve hauled in a smashed Toyota Corolla.\n\nDoug Shupe: This car was involved in a crash just this past February. The driver of the vehicle was driving in Buena Park near the 91 and admitted that he looked down a GPS because he was unfamiliar with that area while he was looking down at his phone to see that GPS directions. He ran a red light and T-boned another vehicle. This was an injury crash. So, you know, not everybody dies in these collisions. You might just get injured, or you might injure someone else, to avoid this put your phone away while driving.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Hayes Flanagan.\n```"}

The film has earned widespread praise, with some even calling it  \u201cone of the greatest action movies ever made.\u201d This film, like the others in the series, is praised for its thrilling and innovative action sequences, creating a cinematic experience whose straightforward narrative is conveyed through fisticuffs and bullet wounds.\n\nCompared to the first three installments, \u201cChapter 4\u2032\u2032 expands these action scenes to be not only longer, but also grander in scale. One of the ways director Chad Stahelski does this is by recognizing that an action set piece is only as good as the environment it takes place in. Nearly every action sequence is placed in a unique space, and the setting becomes a character within the choreography.\n\nThe first major action scenes take place in the Osaka Continental, a neon-colored luxury hotel filled with glass artwork and samurai relics. Wick kills a man by repeatedly bludgeoning and shooting him against a taiko drum, and as glass cases shatter, more weapons become available in his arsenal. In the final act, Wick finds himself fighting his way through traffic at the Arc de Triomphe. He and the hitman extras are constantly being hit by oncoming traffic while they also utilize their vehicles to battle each other in creative ways. In one instance, Wick drives a car in circles with the doors torn off while shooting at a group of hitmen.\n\nOf course, one of the most memorable moments near the end is the long march up to the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica. As he fights his way up the hundreds of stairs, the audience feels the clock ticking, and the slow climb to the top as Wick battles assassin after assassin. In a mind-blowing stunt, Wick is wounded and tumbles down all 300 steps, and finds himself at the bottom once more.\n\nKeanu Reeves as John Wick, Donnie Yen as Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa (Photo courtesy of Murray Close for Lionsgate)\n\nThis is only topped by an incredible sequence where Wick fights his way through an apartment building wielding Dragon\u2019s Breath ammo that practically vaporizes his targets. The twist in this scene, however, is the top-down camerawork that turns the whole battle into a mouse in a maze. Stahelski  cites the video game \u201cHong Kong Massacre\u201d  as the biggest influence on this scene, and the creative camerawork coupled with flashing gunfire create a jaw-dropping cinematic experience.\n\nThe film finds a way to cram every style of action imaginable into its runtime. While the classic \u201cJohn Wick\u201d gun and fistfights are back, the introduction of the Japanese yakuza also brings in sword fights, archery and even sumo wrestling into the fold. There are car chases, Keanu Reeves with nunchucks, and Shamier Anderson\u2019s Mr. Nobody even gets to sick his dog onto enemies a la \u201cMetal Gear Solid V.\u201d\n\nTo top it all off, the intense action throughout the whole film ends with a climactic duel, the quiet, but suspenseful tradition used to settle disagreements dating back centuries. It is a stark contrast to the rest of the film, allowing the audience to catch their breath while staying on their toes to see how the conflict comes to a head.\n\nRina Sawayama as Akira and Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu. (Photo courtesy of Murray Close for Lionsgate)\n\nThese distinct modes of action are all conveyed through its impressive cast. \u201cChapter 4\u2032\u2032 unites martial arts legends and newcomers alike to chew scenery and give incredible, unique action performances. With Reeves at the forefront, he is now joined by Donnie Yen as Caine. This is not the first time the Hong Kong star played the role of the blind warrior, but it may be one of the more creative uses of that archetype. Armed with doorbells to alert his hearing, he battles beautifully with cane and pistol in a style that feels slightly clumsy, yet ever so precise.\n\nThat freeform style of action becomes a signature of Caine and serves as a contrast to Wick\u2019s more animalistic tendencies. Meanwhile, Hiroyuki Sanada and Rina Sawayama serve as a powerful father-daughter duo, with Sanada having the chance to play the old friend and loving father, but also the stern and focused warrior, fighting with sword and gun. Sawayama on the other hand, makes her acting debut in a role that highlights her action chops. Armed with a bow and arrow, she shoots, clubs and even uses her arrows to \u201cclimb\u201d a man while he is down.\n\nScott Adkins was one of the biggest surprises for the film. The chiseled martial artist shocked fans when his teaser poster revealed that he would be donning a fat suit to play the role of Killa. The result is a character with the air of a cartoon villain coupled with an intimidating and imposing figure. According to Stahelski, Killa\u2019s character is a  direct homage to the great Sammo Hung , the Hong Kongese pioneer in martial arts cinema. The reddish-purple suit he wears is even inspired by Hung\u2019s character in the film \u201cSPL: Kill Zone,\u201d where he faces off against Donnie Yen.\n\nDonnie Yen as Caine (Photo courtesy of Murray Close for Lionsgate)\n\nIt is with all of these characters that the film is one of the more personal installments of the series. Although few words are spoken throughout all the noise, it provides enough personal investment into Wick and his relationship with this underworld that audiences stay engaged. This is the first film in the series where the primary hitman is someone rooted in Wick\u2019s history. The rivalry between Wick and Caine holds weight because they are both worth rooting for despite their competing interests. What keeps viewers going is the thought of how they can find a third path where both of them can reach their own peace.\n\nThe \u201caction star,\u201d much like other types of movie stars, has become less relevant as time continues and the industry becomes saturated with IP blockbusters and superhero movies. The \u201cJohn Wick\u201d franchise stands on its own as an original story led by an actor who can sell with his face and real-life charm. \u201cChapter 4\u2032\u2032 is a fitting send off to the character but sets the stage for more original action films in the future. With at least two spinoffs on the way, Stahelski and his team are not finished just yet. In the meantime, other filmmakers have taken notes, as the trope of the retired killer returning for revenge has become a popular story to tell in films like \u201cNobody.\u201d\n\nAlthough \u201cChapter 4\u2032\u2032 draws on everything from Buster Keaton to Hong Kong cinema to even recent video games, it creates an identity of its own as a defining work of the action genre, all led by a man who can command the screen with a simple \u201cyeah.\u201d \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u2032\u2032 is currently available in theaters.\n```"}

Show creators Donald Glover and Janine Nabers drew from a myriad of real and rumored events to spin this twisted tale that has left viewers buzzing since its debut on March 17. Yet, what has captivated fans the most is a lingering feeling of terror that grips them through the screen.\n\nFresh off the heels of \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Glover\u2019s most recent project, \u201cSwarm\u201d drills into Dre\u2019s life, her fandom and an unrelenting \u201chabit\u201d of killing. Whenever she encounters someone not reverent enough of her favorite artist Ni\u2019jah, they end up on Dre\u2019s long list of ravenous and messy attempts to \u201cprotect\u201d the artist \u2014 always with the closest brutal object at her disposal.\n\nWith the help of Nabers and much of his foundational crew from \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Glover has created the next installation in popular TV and film that infuses horror into drama. At its core, this creepy mini-series carries a similar quietude that made Glover\u2019s hit series so compelling, this time more eerie than serene. Watching \u201cSwarm\u201d feels like a weight slowly pressing into your chest.\n\nThis crew has heavy and woozy down-packed. \u201cWe were really interested in creating an antihero story,\u201d Nabers told Vanity Fair, \u201cthrough the lens of a Black, modern-day woman.\u201d Fishback\u2019s offbeat character challenges the typical portrayal of the antihero in film, and she sends viewers reeling as they try to sort out such an unassuming yet ruthless killer.\n\nGlover only doubles down on his trademark combination of the ordinary and the weird with the series\u2019 unsettling soundtrack. The sound of bees buzzing, Dre panting and her victims screaming cuts through the dialogue with enough force to send a chill all the way from the spine to the toes.\n\nBut the show\u2019s insistence on being \u201ctrue\u201d is the most disturbing aspect of the entire series. For starters, every episode begins with a title card that reads \u201cthis is not a work of fiction. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is intentional.\u201d Each episode contains subtle and overt references to actual events or Internet rumors that have circulated about fans being obsessed with celebrities. And at the center of it all is Dre and the on-the-nose correlation between Ni\u2019Jah\u2019s Killer Bees and Beyonc\u00e9's BeyHive.\n\nSome of the Beyonc\u00e9 parallels are obvious like the Ni\u2019jah visual album as a nod to Beyonc\u00e9's 2018 hit visual album \u201cLemonade\u201d or the Jay-Z and Solange-edge elevator attack. But one odd reference you may have missed was that Dre biting Ni\u2019jah in Episode 3 is based on a story comedian Tiffany Haddish told about Beyonc\u00e9 being bitten by a fan.\n\nThis insistence comes to a head in episode six when the story format shifts to documentary style. The episode introduces Loretta Greene, a detective who has been following a string of murders she eventually links to Andrea Greene (meant to invoke \u201cDre\u201d). The viewer immediately questions whether what they have been watching for the past five episodes has actually been a dramatization of real events all along. And, in a way, the answer is yes. The show does dramatize reality, but not in the way the episode purports.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, Loretta Greene is not a real detective and she is not investigating Andrea Greene\u2019s murders. Remember: this is Donald Glover and the mockumentary is his thing. Glover and his \u201cSwarm\u201d/\u201cAtlanta\u201d crew used the same narrative technique in an episode of \u201cAtlanta\u201d titled \u201cThe Goof Who Sat by the Door.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the LA Times, Nabers reminds viewers that every insinuation of reality is very intentional. \u201cEpisode 6 is a step-out episode that allows us to intellectualize some of the stuff that we\u2019ve seen in a way that we probably haven\u2019t intellectualized before.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwarm\u201d makes us think \u2014 about our addiction to social media, about the lengths that people will go to protect the ones we love and about steaming, unwavering desire. The fear that \u201cSwarm\u201d evokes is not only a feeling of blood-curdling terror but the feeling that love and loss could catalyze dangerous obsession is all too real.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/03/college-basketball-catch-up-a-map-of-the-madness/", "response": "```\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest men\u2019s college basketball headlines. In a season which featured top-10 upsets seemingly every single week, I cannot think of a better way to end this season than with the NCAA tournament we have had. From No. 15 seed Princeton becoming the fourth ever No. 15 seed to make the Sweet 16 to Fairleigh Dickinson knocking off No. 1 seed Purdue after making the tournament on a technicality, this season was truly madness. With that being said, here are my top headlines from the NCAA tournament.\n\nNo. 1 seeds disappoint. Heavily. Coming into this year\u2019s tournament, I thought that anyone could win of course, but I imagined teams like Alabama, Houston and Kansas would be heavily chosen favorites. Yet, for the first time in tournament history, not a single No. 1 seed made it to the Elite Eight, with two of them bowing out even before the Sweet 16. Alabama lost at the hands of No. 5 San Diego State, who of course is in the championship for the first time in program history. The story of why this Crimson Tide team couldn\u2019t perform? Brandon Miller. Alabama\u2019s best player and the SEC Player of the Year, freshman forward Miller, shot a wickedly horrible 8-for-41 from the field through the three games the Tide played. While Miller is a projected top-five pick in this year\u2019s NBA Draft, this sure did hinder his stock a bit after a fantastic season.\n\nHouston was never that team. Now, this could come with some controversy, but I truly don\u2019t believe Houston was ever going to win the tournament. The Cougars played in a mediocre AAC conference and played average out of conference opponents, the most notable being Virginia, Saint Mary\u2019s and Oregon. The cracks showed early in this team when the Cougars barely beat No. 16 seed Northern Kentucky, and coupled with a Marcus Sasser injury in the AAC tournament, I was never a huge fan of Houston.\n\nThe defending national champs never stood a chance. Kansas was an extremely talented team and once had the potential to go back to back. However, with a mysterious health concern of legendary head coach Bill Self keeping him from both the Big 12 and NCAA tournament as well as drawing an extremely talented Arkansas team in the second round, it would have been very difficult to get the second consecutive championship for the Jayhawks.\n\nOh, Purdue. Exactly five years and one day prior, Virginia became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed and was the laughing stock of the nation. Purdue has since then foiled the country\u2019s comedic relief of Virginia with a loss to No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson. Purdue is another team I just wasn\u2019t high on. They were truly a one-man army with junior forward Zach Edey carrying them on his 7-foot-4-inch figure to a No. 1 seed. But when push came to shove, the rest of the Boilermakers drug Edey right down to the dark pits of West Lafayette. The only thing Purdue can do is be like Virginia and win a national championship next year \u2014 it is quite literally the only thing that will redeem them.\n\nThis wacky, wild Final Four Last year, we had pure Blue Blood. This year, it is all new blood. As I have said, I cannot think of a better end to this crazy season than to have a Final Four with three teams who have never made it before. It is why I love college basketball and March Madness specifically. Anything can happen. This Final Four gave us an all time classic between Florida Atlantic and San Diego State. After a missed shot by FAU with 10 seconds to play, SDSU junior guard Lamont Butler raced up the floor with the ball, got stuck on the baseline, nearly stepped out of bounds, pulled it out, then ... bang! With no time remaining, Butler hit a shot every kid dreams of hitting to send the Aztecs to the championship. I mean you can\u2019t really make a story better than that game: down 14 in the second half, the Aztecs came back and hit only the fifth ever buzzer beater in Final Four history to send them to their first NCAA title game. Hats off to Florida Atlantic, though. To be a No. 9 seed and make the final four \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t happen. Especially because it is only its second time ever being in March Madness. Absolutely wild.\n\nThe second game was a whole lot less eventful with UConn, as they have this whole tournament, dominating for pretty much the entire game. Miami made an incredible run, but this UConn team is just something else. Realistically they should have been a No. 1 seed, but a rough patch in Big East play hindered that. The Huskies have won every game in the NCAA tournament by an average of 20.2 points per game, and the championship could very well be similar. For tonight, I\u2019m just hoping for a close game. I\u2019d like to see the Aztecs win, but I went to Las Vegas and watched the Huskies beat Gonzaga to a pulp. I just don\u2019t see how they lose this thing.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

It was all going Omos\u2019 way until Omos missed a big splash into the corner leading to three German suplexes to the giant, followed by an F-5 by Lesnar for the win. The Beast Incarnate is one of the only people who could believably beat Omos. Lesnar needed this win after losing his past rivalries against Roman Reigns and Bobby Lashley. He is always a draw and always seems like the biggest threat in WWE history. However, I cannot give a five-minute match that high of a rating. It was also predictable that the match would start with Omos in control and then Lesnar would hit a few suplexes and an F-5. It was a classic Lesnar match but not anything special. Rating: 2.5 out of 5\n\nWrestleMania Women\u2019s Showcase: Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan vs. Natalya and Shotzi, Chelsea Green and Sonya Deville vs. Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler: Similarly to the men\u2019s match, all eight women have worked hard the whole year to get to this moment and it\u2019s great to see them all here. You also can\u2019t have WrestleMania without Ronda Rousey. This was a fast-paced, entertaining match. Lots of high flying. A notable bump in the match was when Rodriguez powerbombed her partner, Morgan, outside the ring into the rest of the opponents. Natalya and Shotzi hit a Hart attack and then Natalya locked in a double sharpshooter on Green and Deville. Rodriquez used her size and strength advantage the whole match. The match came to an end when Rousey tagged in and locked in an arm bar on Shotzi. It was another very fun match. It was very similar to last night\u2019s showcase match, although last night was probably a little better. It came to a disappointing ending since Rousey only entered the match once and got the win. It was good to see the likes of Morgan, Rodriguez, Green and Baszler on the card, though, after the year they have had. Rating: 3.5 out of 5\n\nGunther (C) vs. Sheamus vs. Drew McIntyre for the Intercontinental Championship: Six months ago, Sheamus and Gunther had a match of the year candidate fight at Clash at the Castle. They have a lot of history and animosity towards each other, but every time Gunther and Sheamus step in the ring with each other, they have a banger match. With the addition of McIntyre, this was sure to be one of the hardest hitting matches in WrestleMania history. The two best friends will have to put everything aside in order to beat the unstoppable Gunther. Right out of the gate, each man started throwing hard strikes. Gunther did his classic chops to both and it looked like he was caving in their chests. McIntyre had a great looking belly-to-belly to throw Sheamus into Gunther. Sheamus went deep into his arsenal with a celtic cross, but Gunther still kicked out. Sheamus almost won with a brogue kick but his longtime best friend, McIntyre, broke up the pin. McIntyre and Sheamus both kicked out of each other\u2019s finishes back to back. Sheamus hit a final brogue kick and pinned McIntyre, but Gunther broke it up with a top rope splash on both. Gunther followed that and ended the match by powerbombing Sheamus on McIntyre and then powerbombing McIntyre. This was not a match, this was a fight. Total brutality. The foreigners put on a stellar performance and destroyed each other. The fans were fully behind Sheamus and were really pulling for him to win. Alas, the celtic warrior was unable to win the one title that has eluded his whole career. Gunther is having the run of a lifetime, and, if it continues, he will go down as one of the best intercontinental champions ever. He has brought honor and respect back to the title. Rating: 4.25 out of 5\n\nBianca Belair (C) vs. Asuka for the Raw Women\u2019s Championship: Two of the best women on the roster set out to prove who the best wrestler on Raw is. It is hard to bet against Belair who has proven she is one of the best in the world the last few years. However, Asuka is a veteran and no one knows what to expect out of her new persona. It may have been Asuka\u2019s time, so was Belair ready for Asuka? Belair took control right away, but Asuka came back with some hard strikes. The empress of tomorrow was able to turn nearly everything Belair threw at her into a submission maneuver. Belair landed a devastating gutwrench powerbomb on the outside and Belair was also able to lift Asuka over the ropes to hit a superplex. Toward the end, Asuka sprayed the blue mist while the ref was distracted, but Belair ducked it. The ending sequence was Asuka trapping Belair in an arm bar on the ground, but Belair was somehow able to lift up Asuka into a KOD to silence her. Pound for pound, Belair might be one of the strongest superstars, man or woman, and is definitely the most athletic. These two had great chemistry together and should work with each other more often. Belair has now been Raw women\u2019s champion for a year and this was her third year in a row winning at WrestleMania in a title match. It\u2019s a shame though to see that Asuka still was not able to win the big one and remains winless at WrestleMania after competing at four of them. Rating: 3.75 out of 5\n\nImpromptu Match: The Miz vs. Shane McMahon Snoop Dogg pulled another fast one on The Miz by having the prodigal son return to take on The Miz. Unfortunately, McMahon injured his leg about 30 seconds into the match. Luckily Snoop Dogg improvised and knocked out The Miz with a haymaker right hand and delivered his own version of the people\u2019s elbow, pinning him for the three count afterwards. Rating: 5 out of 5\n\nEdge vs. \u201cThe Demon\u201d Finn B\u00e1lor of The Judgment Day inside Hell in a Cell: For the first time in seven years, Hell in a Cell returned to WrestleMania. This was not the only thing to return in this match as B\u00e1lor donned his demon war paint for the first time since September 2021. After nearly a year of B\u00e1lor and The Judgment Day tormenting Edge\u2019s life, the only way for this to end is inside the most dangerous structure in WWE. Edge is a veteran inside the cell but \u201cThe Demon\u201d is like nothing WWE has ever seen and this could have gone south for Edge very quickly. Edge came to the ring channeling his history with the brood, rising through the ramp surrounded by fire. B\u00e1lor immediately used a kendo stick and the cell walls to his advantage. Edge trapped B\u00e1lor in the cell with kendo sticks and delivered a diving drop kick. Balor followed up by delivering a devastating shotgun drop kick to put Edge through a table propped against the cell. Edge threw a ladder at B\u00e1lor whose head bounced hard off it. This busted B\u00e1lor open. The two men climbed to the top of the ladder and Edge dove off with an impaler DDT on B\u00e1lor. B\u00e1lor set Edge up on a table and tried to hit Edge like a dagger with a coup de gr\u00e2ce off the cell wall, but Edge rolled off the table causing B\u00e1lor to crash through the table. Edge followed up with a big spear but \u201cThe Demon\u201d still got up. To finally slay \u201cThe Demon,\u201d Edge had to go to a dark place and nail B\u00e1lor with a con-chair-toe. This was the brawl we expected out of these two. B\u00e1lor never disappoints, especially as \u201cThe Demon\u201d and Edge is synonymous with Hell in a Cell. After nearly a year of The Judgment Day getting the better of Edge, he finally ended their story. The only thing is this could have been given more time. Also, this is the second loss in a row for \u201cThe Demon\u201d and if WWE keeps bringing him back to lose, it will delegitimize him. Rating: 4 out of 5\n\nMain Event: Roman Reigns (C) with Paul Heyman and Solo Sikoa of The Bloodline vs. Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship: For the royal match winner, Cody Rhodes, this match meant everything. He needed to win this for his family and his legacy. He needed to finish the story and win the championship his late father, Dusty Rhodes, never could. However, Reigns is the most dominant champion in WWE history and this was set to be his seventh WrestleMania main event match and his third championship match at a mania in a row. But for the first time in a long time, it seemed like The Tribal Chief can be beat. Was the American Nightmare able to dethrone the Head of the Table at the grandest stage of them all? The match began with each man staring daggers at each other and a face off. Reigns started slow and methodical just as he likes it. Reigns looked to powerbomb Rhodes through the announcer\u2019s table, but Rhodes countered and put Reigns through the announcer\u2019s table himself. Rhodes gained control, but Sikoa whipped Rhodes with the weight belt. The ref saw something was up and ejected Sikoa. Reigns tried to use the belt, but ate a super kick and a cross Rhodes from Rhodes, but Reigns kicked out at two. Rhodes countered a Superman punch into a pedigree but still somehow Reigns kicked out. A disaster kick led to disaster because Reigns countered with a Superman punch. Rhodes jumped off the top rope, but Reigns dodged and Rhodes ran into a spear. The ref went down while Rhodes hit a cross Rhodes, allowing the Usos to intervene and hit a double superkick and 1D on Rhodes. Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn ran in and took out the Usos. Owens and Zayn hit Reigns with a Stunner and Helluva kick, but he refused to lose and kicked out. Rhodes paid homage to his father and hit a bionic elbow and two cross Rhodes. Rhodes was going for a third cross Rhodes, but Heyman distracted the ref, allowing Sikoa to run back in and nail Rhodes with a Samoan spike. Reigns finished the main event match with a spear to win. For the third year in a row the WWE and fans are forced to acknowledge The Tribal Chief. This match delivered on all expectations and was a great main event. The 945-day title reign will continue and it looks like he will surely hit 1,000 days as champion. The crowd was hot and loud for Rhodes who had by far the loudest crowd reactions of the night, if not the whole weekend. It was a big heart breaker to see him lose. There are only two critiques to this match: ending the main event of WrestleMania from interference is not a great go-home angle and sending the fans home unhappy for the third year in a row is not a perfect decision. It is now even more unclear who can possibly beat Reigns, but, when Reigns is finally overthrown, it will go down as one of the biggest moments in wrestling history. Rating: 4.5 out of 5\n\nThat\u2019s it for WrestleMania 39. The showcase of the immortals lived up to its name and delivered a phenomenal show. Night Two was a fantastic show, but Night One was slightly better. All around, though, it was a great show for the first WrestleMania under Triple H.\n```"}

Not only that, but this is also the first WrestleMania without Vince McMahon in power. The inaugural WrestleMania under Triple H has the most story going into it in years. Almost every match had a purpose and some form of long-term storytelling, whether it was months or even years in the making. Fans had high expectations for Triple H, and he certainly did not disappoint.\n\nIn one of the biggest WrestleManias of all time, the two-night extravaganza kicked off with a plethora of exciting matches.\n\nAustin Theory vs. John Cena for the United States Championship: Cena\u2019s first WrestleMania was the opening match for the U.S title and now, nineteen years later, in possibly his last WrestleMania, he opened for the U.S. title once again. In a battle of past vs. future, the returning G.O.A.T, John Cena, took on the current United States Champion Austin Theory. Going into this match, Cena had nothing to lose, but Theory was in a must-win situation. Theory did not understand why everyone was talking about John Cena when he is the \u201cNow\u201d and a current champion. Theory challenged the face of WWE to earn respect, but did he bite off more than he can chew? Theory took that saying a little too literally and bit Cena twice throughout the match.\n\nThe match began with the leader of the Cenation taking advantage of the cocky up-and-comer Theory. Theory showed off his athleticism throughout with a running blockbuster neckbreaker and a rolling dropkick. Cena hit all of his classics until he went for his finisher, the Attitude Adjustment. While attempting this, he knocked into the ref, taking the ref down. Cena locked in the STF submission and forced Theory to tap out, but the ref didn\u2019t see it. Theory took advantage and hit Cena below the belt, then hit his finish, A-Town Down, to put Cena away. This was a good standard match. Nothing overly flashy or new but it hit all the basics a good match needs. They played on the story of the veteran taking on the disrespectful young wrestler. The crowd was entirely supporting Cena and there was not one person cheering for Austin Theory. It may have been a disappointing ending for the fans, especially since Austin Theory had to cheat to win, but this legitimizes that Theory will be a big star in the near future. Rating: 3.5 out of 5\n\nWrestleMania Men\u2019s Showcase: Ricochet and Braun Strowman vs. Alpha Academy vs. Street Profits vs. Viking Raiders: All eight men have worked extremely hard this past year and it is great to see that they are being rewarded with a showcase match. The story behind this match was all four teams wanted to prove themselves and get a mania win. The fans did not know what to expect out of this match, but they definitely did not expect it to deliver on the way it did. This was a very fast-paced, fun match. All eight superstars showed out and gave a performance of a lifetime. Notable highlights included the 5-foot-8-inch, 203-pound Chad Gable lifting up the 6-foot-8-inch, 344-pound Braun Strowman for a German suplex, Strowman landing a splash from the top rope on Ivar, Angelo Dawkins of the Street Profits intercepting Strowman like an NFL defender and Montez Ford hitting a beautiful From the Heavens frog splash to secure the win for his team. This match exceeded all expectations. All eight superstars had great chemistry with each other. There might not have been a lot of story behind this match, but it honestly did not need it. This match was an unseen classic and was picture perfect. It would have been nice to see this get more time, but, nonetheless, it was one of the funniest matches of the night. Rating: 3.75 out of 5\n\nSeth Rollins vs. Logan Paul: This all began three months ago at the Royal Rumble when Logan Paul eliminated Seth Rollins from the Royal Rumble match. Paul wasn\u2019t done there and continued to antagonize Rollins when Paul cost him the United States title at Elimination Chamber. Rollins\u2019 disdain for Paul has reached an all-time high and he is ready to silence the problem child. Paul was out to prove to everyone that he belongs in WWE and that he is better than Rollins. Paul had possibly the best entrance of the night by zip-lining high in the air down to the ring. Not only that, but he was accompanied to the ring by someone dressed as a Prime energy drink (his drink brand). Not to be outdone, Seth Rollins came to the ring with the conductor of the Los Angeles orchestra, who conducted the audience singing Rollins\u2019s theme song. Both men had some big spots in an incredibly fast-paced and fun match. An important note is that Paul has a 40-millimeter screw in his right hand that he uses as a knockout punch. At one point, Rollins stomped this hand on the steel steps. The climax of the match was when the Prime energy drink person was revealed to be YouTuber KSI! He helped Paul put Rollins on the announce table. Paul went for a frog splash, but Rollins rolled out of the way and pulled KSI in, causing Paul to put KSI through the table. Back in the ring, Rollins hit the stomp for the win. It really is annoying how good Logan Paul is at professional wrestling. He is a natural in the ring and looks like he has been doing this for years when this is just his first year. He gets better and better every time. Rollins is also one of the best wrestlers in the world, so these two were bound to have a great match. This marks Rollins\u2019 first WrestleMania win in four years \u2014 his first win since WrestleMania 35. This was a great match and the right person won. It will be interesting to see if the rivalry ends here and what the two men do after this. Rating: 4.25 out of 5\n\nBecky Lynch, Lita, Trish Stratus vs. Damage CTRL: This was the first match of the weekend that was truly months in the making. Lynch has been fighting Damage CTRL since August and it all came to a head. From War Games, steel cages and now WrestleMania. Damage CTRL has run roughshod over the women\u2019s division and has been close to unstoppable. So much so that Lynch had to call in reinforcements in hall of famers Trish Stratus and Lita. Stratus came out of retirement for her first WrestleMania match since 2011 and Lita\u2019s first WrestleMania appearance since 2016. All three members of Damage CTRL used to look up to Stratus and Lita, but now they wanted to put an end to them. This match was special given that Lita and Stratus, two women who paved the way for women\u2019s wrestling, came out of retirement. Damage CTRL didn\u2019t hold anything back, though. They were relentless as ever and never let up. Lita pulled off a fantastic looking hurricanrana as well as a double DDT. There was a very cool spot when Lita and Lynch assisted Stratus with a Stratusphere, sending Dakota Kai into the rest of Damage CTRL on the outside. IYO SKY lived up to her name as the genius of the sky and had two beautiful over the moonsaults. Lynch even kicked off Bayley\u2019s finisher: the rose plant. The match ended with Stratus landing a chick kick, Lita hitting a Litasault and Lynch slamming Bayley with a manhandle slam from the top rope. It is really incredible that Lita and Stratus, who are both 47, are able to move so fluidly in the ring. They certainly haven\u2019t lost a step and were able to turn back the clock to their prime. It was also great to see SKY and Kai, who were even in WWE last year, have a WrestleMania match against three of the best to ever do it. SKY also definitely has the best moonsault in wrestling. Bayley is great in her role as the group\u2019s leader, but now that Damage CTRL has lost, what\u2019s next? Will SKY and Kai leave Bayley on her own? Is this the end of Damage CTRL? Regardless, the biggest takeaway from this match is that Trish Stratus and Lita still got it. Rating: 3.75 out of 5\n\nFather vs. Son: Dominik Mysterio of The Judgment Day vs. Rey Mysterio: This was years in the making. Ever since Dominik joined WWE, fans have wanted to see this match. And that desire was only exacerbated when Dom betrayed his father and joined The Judgment Day. It seemed like this match never would\u2019ve happened, but when Dom disrespected his own mother, Rey reached his breaking point. Now it was time for the 2023 Hall of Fame inductee Rey Mysterio to beat some sense into his son. From being the first father-son tag team champions, to betraying Rey, to Dom going to jail, to yelling at his own mother, it has all led to this match. Dom came to the ring disrespecting his father yet again by wearing his mask and coming in a police car. Rey paid homage to the late great Eddie Guerrero by coming out to his theme song and in his low rider, which was driven by the one and only Snoop Dogg. It was a highly anticipated match everyone wanted to watch. Rey\u2019s wife and daughter, Dom\u2019s mother and sister, were watching ringside and even Bad Bunny was on Spanish commentary. Dom continued being a punk kid and disrespected his family the entire match. In the beginning, he threw a drink at his own sister and mouthed off to his mother who proceeded to slap the taste out of his mouth. Rey took a crazy bump when Dom hit an alley-oop facebuster face first into the turnbuckle. Finn B\u00e1lor and Damian Priest came out to help Dom cheat, but then the new Latino World Order, Legado Del Fantasma, came out to even the odds and take out Priest and Balor. Dom even hit Rey\u2019s famous move \u2014 the 619 \u2014 on him. Dom attempted to cheat by hitting Rey with a chain, but Bad Bunny grabbed it away from him, allowing Rey to hit the 619 and frog splash. This earned the win for the greatest luchador ever. Dominik is quite possibly the most hated superstar in WWE right now. The boos from the crowd were defining and they were overjoyed to finally see Rey beat him up. The story of the match was told excellently. It would have been a really big win for Dom and could have set his future up well, but after months of tormenting his family he finally got his comeuppance. Rating: 3.75 out 5\n\nRhea Ripley of The Judgment Day vs. Charlotte Flair (C) for the Smackdown Women\u2019s Championship: In a rematch from WrestleMania 36, Ripley looked to rewrite history and finally defeat The Queen Charlotte Flair. Only this time, the roles are reversed: Ripley is the royal rumble winner and Flair is the champion. Ripley has beaten everyone who has stepped in front of her and is even more unstoppable alongside Judgment Day, but Flair seems to be her kryptonite. Could Ripley\u2019s new mean streak finally give her the edge over the 14-time women\u2019s champion? Ripley came to the ring with no one from The Judgment Day and with a new look of black face paint dripping down her forehead. You could tell she was ready and that this was not the same person who Flair beat three years ago. This is also the first-ever WrestleMania match consisting of all women: two woman competitors, a female referee and a female ring announcer. Ripley showed that she might be the women\u2019s version of Brock Lesnar when it comes to German suplexes because she delivered some nasty looking ones, including one off the top rope. Flair had an amazing counter to the riptide turning it into a DDT mid move. Both women kicked out of each other\u2019s finishing moves, but Ripley also gave Flair a brutal headbutt to the back of her head. The match came to a close with Ripley smacking Flair\u2019s head against the top of the ringpost and then hitting an avalanche riptide off the top rope to dethrone the Queen. This match was the epitome of wrestling. It was an amazing contest that will go down in history as a WrestleMania classic and one of the best women\u2019s matches in WrestleMania history. The story was there and these women hit every beat. Ripley has changed the landscape of the women\u2019s division and finally got the one win that has eluded her throughout her whole career. Now Ripley will make a transition from Raw to Smackdown and the thought of her there is mouthwatering for fans. Now she can have matches with the likes of Raquel Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey. It will also be interesting to see if The Judgment Day goes with her or if she separates from her stablemates. This win also makes Ripley a grand slam champion having won the smackdown, raw, NXT and tag team women\u2019s championships. Rating: 4.75 out of 5\n\nImpromptu Match: Pat McAfee vs. The Miz: The returning McAfee came out to accept an open challenge from The Miz and Snoop Dogg made it official. It was very quick with McAfee in control the whole time. The Miz tried to leave and on his way out, shoved NFL tight end George Kittle who then jumped the barricade and clotheslined his head off. McAfee hit the punt for the win. Rating: 2.5 out of 5 (but was entertaining)\n\nMain Event: The Usos of The Bloodline (C) vs. Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens for Undisputed Tag Team Championship: In a weekend full of personal matches, this one was the most personal of all of them. It was twin brothers against two people as close as brothers. Sami Zayn has had one of the wildest years of his career. He went from being the honorary Uso in the bloodline to having to prove himself week after week to finally being able to stand up for himself and reuniting with his best friend Kevin Owens after The Bloodline tore them even further apart. Zayn has promised to destroy The Bloodline and the only way he can do it is with his \u201cbrother\u201d Kevin Owens. But it would take nothing less than a miracle to beat the Usos, the longest reigning tag team champions in history at 622 days. The Usos are in a must-win situation, especially with their leader, The Tribal Chief, and the Undisputed WWE Universal champion Roman Reigns watching them. Lil Uzi Vert performed \u201cI Just Wanna Rock\u2019' before the Usos made their entrance. The crowd erupted when Zayn came out. The match started with Zayn against Jey Uso, the man who ended up treating Zayn like family while he was in The Bloodline. The match continued at a fast pace, leaving no room for a breather. Owens hit frog splashes, swanton bombs, cannon balls and super kicks on the Usos as well as kicking out of an Uso splash. Zayn hit a brain buster on the apron and went for Jimmy\u2019s own move on him, the Uso splash. Jey tagged himself in when Zayn didn\u2019t realize. Zayn hit a blue thunder bomb on Jimmy, but he wasn\u2019t the legal man and Jey came in with a big super kick to Zayn\u2019s head. The Usos then threw a superkick party, unleashing a relentless barrage of kicks on Zayn. When Owens tried to intervene, the Usos brought him to the outside and slammed him through the announcer\u2019s table. The Usos got back in and hit Zayn with their finisher, the one and done (1D), but he somehow kicked out of it. This made Zayn the first person to ever kick out of the 1D. Jey landed a helluva kick on Zayn, his own move against him. He yelled that Zayn should have never left The Bloodline, but Zayn hit an exploder suplex into the turnbuckle. Owens hit a pop up powerbomb on both Usos, Zayn hit a helluva kick on Jey and Owen hit a stunner on Jey, but still everyone kicked out. The Usos took back control and they both went to the top for a double Uso splash on Owens. After all the punishment Owens took so far, he somehow still kicked out. The Usos looked to hit an avalanche 1D, but Zayn and Owens prevented it. Zayn landed two helluva kicks on Jey, Jimmy tried to stop the third but ran into a stunner from Owens. Finally, Zayn landed the third and final helluva kick to win. Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens dethroned the greatest tag team in WWE history for the Undisputed Tag Team Championships. The match of the night will be the match of the weekend and the match of the year. This had everything. The match had story, drama, emotion and, most importantly, outstanding wrestling. The story was told exquisitely. There were years worth of storytelling in this match and it all culminated in the main event on the grandest stage of them all. Zayn used to treat the Usos like family, but they turned their back on him. His \u201cbrother\u201d Kevin Owens didn\u2019t though. Zayn and Owens started off their careers by teaming together in front of ten people and now they did it in front of 80,000 people. This win makes Kevin Owens a grand slam champion. Zayn is by far the most over person in wrestling today and when he won the titles it was the loudest crowd reaction of the night. The Usos\u2019 620-day championship reign is over but even in defeat, they cemented their legacy and claim as the greatest tag team in WWE history. It was also amazing to see a tag team match in the main event at WrestleMania. Tag team wrestling can be very underrated and underappreciated, but there was no better match to show why it deserves a main event spot. Ranking: 5 out of 5\n\nOverall the first night of WrestleMania 39, and the first night under the Triple H era, was a major success. The superstars performing on Night Two better get ready because they have a tough act to follow. We\u2019ll have to see on Sunday April 2 at 5 p.m.\n```"}

After being a student and a faculty member at USC, she is now ready to open the door to her new permanent position as the vice president for student life. \u201cI am really excited, I am really honored, and it really is wonderful to be a part of our campus for so many years; USC is home to me,\u201d Allard said. The new vice president completed her master\u2019s degree and doctorate in education at Rossier School of Education. Allard has over 25 years of experience in the realm of student affairs, albeit advising, counseling or simply giving students a voice. Additionally, she has served as an adjunct assistant professor at Rossier, as well as the senior leader in student affairs since 2013. \u201cI come here [to USC] every day to serve,\u201d Allard said. \u201cI know a lot of us are excited about future planning and really looking at how we can think critically about our systems and our programs \u2014 how they are set up as best as possible not only just for the students we have today, but for all the students who are coming to us ten years from now.\u201d Allard didn\u2019t hesitate to take action during her time at USC. Prior to her new position as vice president for student life, she served as the interim vice president. Since 2021, Allard has helped put the Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards process to create the new Office of Community Expectations and Office of Academic Integrity. She also expanded student equity and inclusion programs, including the new First Generation Plus Success Center in Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Dr. Allard has a few goals on her agenda that she looks forward to focusing on. One such goal is student well-being. \u201cStudent well-being has been one of my top priorities for some time; it\u2019s important for us to think about how we foster and facilitate student well-being,\u201d Allard said. \u201cOur students are really accomplished, but in addition to being academically accomplished, we also want all of our students to be healthy, active and engaged human beings.\u201d The rising vice president also mentioned her dedication to student success and strengthening the school\u2019s partnerships because, according to Allard, the more connected we are, the better she and her team can serve the student body. As vice president, Allard will oversee student affairs staff in addition to 20,000 undergraduate and 28,000 graduate students.

County COVID-19 emergency rules set to expire March 31\n\nThe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors rejected a proposal to re-extend the emergency rules\u2019 expiry date.\n\nUniversity of Southern California's Pardee/Marks COVID Testing site on Sept. 25, 2021. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Nicholas Wald, Eric Yeh, Michael Pincus, and Charlotte Shook\nMarch 31, 2023 at 3:47 pm PDT\n\nAfter three years of shielding tenants from eviction due to missed rent payments, Los Angeles County is rolling back COVID-19 protections and state of emergency rules. Renter and other COVID-19 related protections will expire March 31. This is the end of a state of emergency in the county that was originally set to expire at the end of January, before the Board of Supervisors voted to extend the deadline by two months.\n\nThis comes after county leaders rejected a proposal to extend the deadline even further and introduce new protections that would \u201csoften the blow\u201d for renters who may be evicted for missing a payment. The extended proposal would have required landlords to state specific reasons for eviction, allowed renters who moved in roommates or pets without authorization to stay an extra year and prevented landlords from raising rents by more than 3%.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors\u2019 decision to end all emergency tenant protections marks a new direction for county officials, who repeatedly extended policies aimed at helping renters. For many, the largest concern is how many people may now become unhoused if they are unable to meet payments. But while COVID-influenced renter safeguards in L.A. County are set to disappear, new local protections will likely take their place.\n\n\u201cThere has been time for our cities to put in place their own protections,\u201d Supervisor Janice Hahn, who voted no on the question of another extension, said during the meeting. \u201cAt this point, it feels like an overreach right now to impose these [rules] on the incorporated cities.\u201d\n\nThere is also concern for people enduring food insecurity due to the emergency expiration. David May, the director of marketing and communications at the L.A. Regional Food Bank, explained how they plan to compensate.\n\n\u201cOur work is made possible through the generosity of the community,\u201d May said. \u201cSo the way we\u2019re able to provide so much food throughout the community at such little cost is because we have so much donated food products and donated time in the form of volunteer hours [as well as] cash donations.\u201d\n\nThere is a fairly high need for food assistance in L.A. County, regardless of the COVID-19 emergency expirations. Prior to the pandemic, the L.A. Region Food Bank, with its network of about 600 partner agencies, was assisting about 300,000 people per month. At the peak of the pandemic, they reached over one million people, but now serve 800,000 people each month. Their hope is that this number does not increase considering the new end to emergency protocols.\n\n\u201cWe have a high cost of living. There\u2019s a high need for assistance, because by the time people pay their rent or their utilities or other bills that you have to pay, sometimes people consider their food budget [to be flexible],\u201d May said. \u201cAnd of course, we don\u2019t want people to be skipping meals to pay [for] these other things.\u201d\n\nAlong with the end of rent protections and food security concerns, the expiration of L.A.\u2019s state of emergency will trigger healthcare coverage and access changes across the county. The L.A. County Department of Public Health, Health Services and the Department of Social Services will be conducting a review of public health orders that must be completed by the end of March.\n\nAs far as the life of the average patient is concerned, there will be no drastic changes following the COVID-19 health emergency expiration. Rather, the expiration will move toward treating COVID-19 just as other communicable diseases and shifting intervention actions to patients\u2019 individual healthcare providers. Vaccines will remain widely accessible and testing for COVID-19 will continue to be provided at public health sites for anyone in need.\n\nSafety precautions also will not be affected; if infected, individuals testing positive for COVID-19 are required to isolate themselves from others for a minimum of five days. Businesses and schools are required to continue reporting COVID-19 case clusters to the LADPH. Healthcare workers will still need to have vaccinations against COVID-19 and must continue to wear masks when providing patient care. All three major L.A. County health departments will continue their mask mandate for health workers when near patients. The state, by comparison, will roll back both such mask guidelines on April 3.\n\nFor more information on housing protections in L.A.

Listed in USC\u2019s Sustainability 2028 Framework, the two goals are just one component of Assignment: Earth \u2014 the university\u2019s framework for a \u201cgreener campus and planet.\u201d Nearly one year later, USC Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple said he believes the university is still on track.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a moving target,\u201d Mick said in an interview from February 24 with Annenberg Media. \u201cZero waste is zero waste, 100% carbon free or energy is 100% carbon free energy ... we\u2019re just really trying to push for that growth.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2022 address, Folt also said that the Presidential Working Group (PWG) on Sustainability in Research, Education and Operations \u2014 which is made up of over 100 USC faculty, staff and students \u2014 was the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind USC\u2019s sustainability initiatives. Sean McCalla, a member of the PWG Student Sustainability committee, said he thinks the university is on track to accomplish their goals by 2028.\n\n\u201cI think that we are on track to accomplish the 2028 framework,\u201d McCalla said. \u201cThe goals within Assignment Earth have almost holistically been met up until this point, and I don\u2019t see many reasons for them not to be [in the future].\u201d\n\nMcCalla credited Folt with much of the recent progress. \u201cI think she\u2019s done a fantastic job ... It\u2019s very easy to kind of be overtaken with hubris when it comes to sustainability efforts and become really wide ranging really quickly and go over your head.\u201d McCalla said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I think [Folt] is incredibly cognizant of and is being careful not to fall into. So a lot of the sustainability work comes to creating strong data points to go after, and that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nMcCalla said that Folt\u2019s promise of climate neutrality has been especially imperative to the project. Highlighted in the Office of Sustainability\u2019s annual report released last month, absolute greenhouse gas scope emissions have seen a 31% reduction since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through the various ethics and the various standards of carbon offsets and created a guideline or a framework for the university to purchase offsets that are sound,\u201d McCalla said.\n\nStudents are also hopping on the green wave. Yusung Hong, a freshman majoring in business administration, said USC\u2019s sustainability efforts caught his eye even before attending.\n\n\u201cI definitely love it,\u201d Hong said. \u201cBefore I even applied to this school, I was looking at the sustainability initiative and I was amazed by it; it\u2019s actually working out around the campus.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, called for more channels of dialog between USC and the student population. \u201cThere should be more communication channels,\u201d said Andrew Ta, a graduate student studying computer science. \u201cI know I get some emails from the university, but most of them are not environmental or related to the environment.\u201d\n\nSydney Byun, a junior majoring in law, history and culture, reaffirmed the notion. \u201cI think, generally, the student body is not super aware of USC\u2019s sustainability efforts. I know they send out a sustainability survey every year,\u201d Byun said. \u201c[But,] I do think implementing more student awareness could definitely help.\u201d\n```"}

But long-time residents of East Los Angeles neighborhoods say otherwise. \u201cLa vivienda es un derecho humano. Housing is a human right.\u201d \u201cNo community benefit, no investment. Keep families home. Blackstone = Homelessness.\u201d These were just a few of the signs raised by a crowd of tenant protestors as they gathered in Currie Hall, a student housing building at the USC Health Sciences Campus on Wednesday.\n\nThe protest, organized by the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment L.A. (ACCE Action), consisted of tenant demands for affordable housing and an outcry against displacement in the neighborhoods surrounding USC, particularly in East L.A., where the HSC campus is located.\n\n\u201cLincoln Heights completely opposes USC development,\u201d Pamela Agustin, Coalition Director of the East Side LEADS, said at the protest. \u201cWe cannot live with erasure. Lincoln Heights is not for sale.\u201d\n\nIn the lobby resembling a modern hotel with luxury amenities, the protestors expressed their frustrations with USC housing developments that they said have increasingly encroached into their community.\n\n\u201cThe problem that we\u2019re having with USC is that they\u2019re building extremely expensive dormitories for students,\u201d South L.A. resident Maria Briones said. \u201cBut most people like me, we are fixed-income or low-income families that have been displaced from their living places because the properties have gone up so high and the rents as well.\u201d\n\nOn an income of less than $650 a month, Briones said she worries that as rent becomes increasingly unaffordable, she\u2019ll be the next person to lose her home. She is facing eviction.\n\n\u201cNext year or maybe in a few months, I\u2019ll be out on the street,\u201d Briones said. \u201cWe have been pressured to live on the street and that\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nBriones has lived in L.A. for 35 years and considers the city her permanent home.\n\n\u201cIt is my home. It is part of my heart. It is part of my story,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re raising the prices of the rent, but they\u2019re also destroying part of history in L.A. They have destroyed so many homes that have been here more than 100 years.\u201d\n\nHer story, like many others, is a chapter in the long history of gentrification in L.A. The number of gentrified census tracts in L.A. County increased by 16% between 1990 and 2015, according to a 2016 study by the UCLA Urban Displacement Project. The risk of displacement of low-income households is shown to be ongoing.\n\nThe Wednesday protest at Currie Hall is part of a larger series of protests spread out across the county this week, called ACCE\u2019s Week of Action. On Monday, tenant leaders and supporters gathered to protest at Blackstone offices in Santa Monica.\n\nThe Blackstone Group is a major private financial firm that has skyrocketed to become one of the world\u2019s largest corporate residential landlords. It has amassed control of properties across the United States, including homes and apartments in California, but it doesn\u2019t stop there. Blackstone\u2019s array of assets also includes companies like Bumble, Hilton hotels, CentreParcs resorts and even Legoland.\n\nIn 2022, Blackstone Funds completed a $13 billion acquisition of American Campus Communities, Inc. (\u201cACC\u201d), the company that owns and manages Currie Hall, where the protest took place Wednesday. ACC claims to be the largest owner, manager and developer of student housing communities in the United States, according to their website.\n\n\u201cWe are proud and excited to have our best-in-class company join Blackstone, whose expertise, resources and consistent access to capital will allow us to grow and continue to lead the student housing industry,\u201d ACC Chief Executive Officer Bill Bayles said in a statement released by Blackstone last August.\n\nLess enthused, tenant leaders and members of ACCE said that as one of America\u2019s largest landlords, Blackstone is \u201cone of the biggest drivers of the housing and homelessness crisis,\u201d via an Instagram post.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Fernanda Sanchez, a tenant organizer. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of them creating loopholes within our laws, within our bylaws, allowing corporations such as Blackstone to come and take over our spaces, take over our housing, displace our communities.\u201d\n\nACCE said that Blackstone is \u201cfunneling money to lobbyists and politicians to block new, stronger tenant protections that will prevent more Californians from becoming housing insecure or being thrown out onto the streets,\u201d according to the caption of an ACCE Instagram post.\n\nTo combat this, ACCE and community members are strongly advocating for the passing of Senate Bill 567, the Homelessness Prevention Act which builds on existing law to protect low-income renters in California from unjust evictions and unreasonably high rent increases.\n\nAngel, a community member present for the Wednesday protest, said that he has been a victim of displacement twice. According to Angel, passing SB567 will make it harder for landlords to raise the rent for everyone else in the community, where he has personally seen fellow community members, primarily people of color, displaced.\n\nIn rebuttal, Blackstone said that they believe they have \u201cthe most favorable resident policies among any large landlord in the U.S., including not making a single non-payment eviction for over two years during COVID,\u201d according to a statement provided to Annenberg Media by the financial firm.\n\n\u201cWe operate in accordance with California\u2019s rent stabilization laws and are investing $100 million to make these communities better places to live,\u201d Blackstone said.\n\nAs for the university, they said in a statement to Annenberg Media that they do not have a development relationship with Blackstone, and that the university \u201ccontinues to partner with community members on solutions to the region\u2019s housing crisis.\u201d\n\nBut the fight continues for the ACCE protestors and community members, who say that in order to hold Blackstone and other corporate landlords accountable, passing SB567 is crucial. Until this happens, they will continue to gather.\n\nThe next protest in ACCE\u2019s Week of Action took place on Friday morning at the Lafayette Multipurpose Community Center in East L.A.\n\nAs for Currie Hall, the protestors say they are not done. As they exited the lobby Wednesday afternoon, they shouted, \u201cwe\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n```"}

But a deep dive into what\u2019s happened this tournament is one for the history books.\n\n\u201cTourney Talk\u201d is a column by Michael Fiumefreddo about the men\u2019s basketball NCAA tournament.\n\nWow. Just. Wow. Over the course of this column, I continued to stress how strange this season in college basketball has been. Of the 9.2 quintillion possible outcomes, never in a million years did I see a Final Four of Florida Atlantic, San Diego State, Miami and UConn.\n\nI talked with Annenberg Media columnist Kamyar Moradi on Tuesday. One thing he said to me has been a dark cloud over my head ever since. \u201cIf you say you are a college basketball expert, no, you\u2019re not. You know nothing.\u201d As an analyst and columnist on college ball myself, I hate to say it, but he\u2019s right. No matter how much research I put into this column each week, the exact opposite of my predictions would occur days later. I swear, I thought I was a jinx.\n\nWhen my bracket was completely busted by the Sweet 16, I could only think how I\u2019d be better off flipping a coin next year and hoping for the best. But upon further examination, this is a once-in-a-lifetime tournament. The Cinderella stories, massive upsets and this unlikely Final Four will never be replicated again \u2014 no matter how chaotic future tournaments get.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious. For just the second time in tournament history, a No. 16 seed knocked off a No. 1 seed. Even though UMBC was the first, what Fairleigh Dickinson did this year was much more impressive when looking at the details. There\u2019s the fact that FDU shouldn\u2019t have even been here. The Knights lost their conference championship game to Merrimack, who was ineligible for the Big Dance because it\u2019s their first season in D1 (a stupid rule if you ask me, but what a butterfly effect it had).\n\nFDU traveled to Dayton, Ohio, as the lowest-ranked team in the 68-team field but ran through Texas Southern to set up a date with the Boilermakers in Columbus. Speaking of Dayton, the Dayton University band played the FDU fight song. Fairleigh Dickinson doesn\u2019t even have a school band, but Dayton\u2019s stepped up, and the honorary Knights witnessed history.\n\nThe broadcasts during their games only made the small school even smaller. Anyone tuned into FDU\u2019s games learned they have a junior at the university running media relations for the athletic department and players have to shower in their jerseys to clean them. On the court, the small school from Teaneck, New Jersey, also fielded the smallest roster size-wise out of the entire field.\n\nHead coach Tobin Anderson, who was in his first season coaching at the D1 level, had to figure out how to defend 7\u20323\u2032\u2032 Zach Edey. But Anderson called his shot, famously saying, \u201cThe more I watch [Purdue], the more I think we can beat them.\u201d Anderson will take on a new role as head coach for Iona, succeeding Rick Pitino. He \u2014 or any coach for that matter \u2014 might never have the chance to pull off an upset of this magnitude ever again.\n\nMoving on to the less absurd but just as impressive upsets, No. 13 Furman\u2019s victory over No. 4 Virginia will go down in history for all the wrong reasons. Virginia graduate guard Kihei Clark got trapped in a corner with seven seconds to go, the Cavaliers up one with a timeout. Instead of calling time, Clark blindly shot put the ball to half court. Furman junior forward Garrett Hien intercepted the heave, and passed it to sophomore guard JP Pegues, who knocked down a three to take a two-point lead and the win.\n\nTalk about how to throw away a win, literally. Every few years, we get one of these games, which live on in history. Hopefully Clark\u2019s 2019 national championship ring and 2023\u2032s overall chaos help soften the blow.\n\nYet Furman was overshadowed by another Cinderella in the same region. Ivy League schools are known for their prestigious histories and academic excellence, not basketball programs. No. 15 seed Princeton snatched the conference\u2019s tourney bid from Yale in the Ivy League championship game, quite an accomplishment in itself. But the magic continued. The Tigers took down No. 2 Arizona and a surging No. 7 Missouri team to reach the Sweet 16.\n\nA TikTok video surfaced of players in the hotel doing calculus homework the night before their matchup against Creighton, so in their honor, let\u2019s do some math of our own: After winning two games, the 2023 Princeton Tigers now own one-third of all Ivy League March Madness wins since 1978, and one-half of the conference\u2019s Sweet 16 appearances in that same span.\n\nWhile Cinderellas are fun for the first weekend, the clock usually strikes midnight around the start of the second weekend; third time\u2019s not the charm for some lower seeds, and the top seeds bring the bracket back to normal. Not this year. For the first time since 1979, All four No. 1 seeds failed to reach the Final Four. In fact, for the first time EVER, all were eliminated before the Elite Eight.\n\nAfter a five-year run of No. 1 seeds winning the title, none will even get the chance to take home the hardware. But no glory should be taken away from the Final Four teams, who, against all odds, have a shot to have their \u2018One Shining Moment.\u2019\n\nThree teams \u2014 FAU, SDSU and Miami \u2014 are in their first Final Four, and UConn\u2019s back after seven straight first round losses since their 2014 championship. Most USC people know FAU as Lane Kiffin\u2019s return to glory. I only know them as the school across the street from the restaurant in Boca Raton, Florida, where my family celebrates Easter Sunday (I\u2019ll be there again next week, might have to move my flight up if they win).\n\nBut this No. 9 seed took down two Power 5 teams to get here, so the Mountain West team they\u2019ll face tomorrow shouldn\u2019t scare them. However, the way the San Diego State Aztecs have been playing, you would think Kawhi Leonard has been suiting up for his alma mater. SDSU is a top-25 defensive unit in all of college basketball and one of two teams in this Final Four to take down a No. 1 seed.\n\nThe other is Miami, who I did say in an earlier column was a sleeper title contender. It looked like all hope was lost when the Canes faced a 64-51 deficit with 13 minutes to play against Texas, but by the end, the \u2018U\u2019 emerged as the Midwest champions and have been a betting favorite heading into this weekend.\n\nThe smart money is on UConn, though. The Huskies have won all four of their tournament games by double digits, and they\u2019re the highest remaining seed. Readers of my column from the very beginning might recall they were in the Week 6 AP Poll top 12, which featured the eventual champion in every year but one since 1988.\n\nBut this should scare the Huskies more than assure them victory because this tournament is defying all historical data as we know it. Since this March Madness has been such an anomaly, I\u2019m not even going to ATTEMPT to predict a winner. However, the handwritten bracket sitting next to me at my desk just needs Miami to beat SDSU in the championship to stay perfect. I sure hope that happens because I\u2019m all out of erasers.\n\n\u2018Tourney Talk\u2019 runs every Friday.\n```"}

USC Dornsife hosts panel on AI technology advancement.\n\nStudents use ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence platform. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Claire Sures, Daniel Palmore, Jack Noveck Holmes, Matthew Dutrisac, Kassydi Rone, and Marco Ramirez March 30, 2023 at 9:58 pm PDT\n\nUSC Dornsife held the \u201cExploring the Enigma of Consciousness\u201d seminar, discussing the latest enhancements surrounding consciousness and its relationship with artificial intelligence on Wednesday. The event, hosted by Jonas Kaplan, co-director of Dornsife\u2019s Cognitive Neuroimaging Center, focused on the latest enhancements and research in AI.\n\n\u201cThe event touches on two main themes, the rise in AI and the interest in computer intelligence,\u201d said Tok Thompson, author and professor of anthropology and communication. \u201cI think it points to the importance of the topics we\u2019re discussing: the ideas of \u2018What is consciousness?,\u2019 \u2018What is it to be human?\u2019 and the animal term, \u2018What is it to think?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe seminar encouraged students to bring their questions and concerns regarding A.I. With students doubtful about AI chatbots being able to have a consciousness, think, or make decisions on their own, the panelists worked to provide answers to these uncertainties.\n\n\u201c[Chatbots] appear to be thinking and doing things on their own ... they are not because they actually don\u2019t have life in themselves,\u201d said Antonio Damasio, professor of neuroscience. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a possibility of mind, they don\u2019t have a possibility of consciousness in the sense that we do.\u201d\n\nAs Thompson later mentioned, these questions of advancement in AI technology have recently made their way to \u201cthe forefront of the news.\u201d Renowned tech developers, such as Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, agreed on a six-month pause on AI systems more powerful than OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 proposed in an open letter by the non-profit Future of Life Institute.\n\nThe letter talks about the potential dangers of AI systems that can complete general human tasks, including a GPT-4 system that passed a stimulated bar exam. Future of Life questions if researchers should \u201ccontinue to develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us.\u201d\n\nChatGPT-3.5 is available at no cost to users; however, the latest version, ChatGPT-4, requires a monthly $20 subscription. The latest version proves how quickly AI is developing, as the new system not only can process text, but also images.\n\nRahul Jain, a professor of engineering at Viterbi, believes that tools such as ChatGPT may not have even reached their full potential in terms of capabilities. \u201cA development of this technology is still happening,\u201d Jain said. \u201cWhere we are now, it\u2019s game changing, no question in my mind.\u201d\n\nJain says that in terms of student life, the wave of using AI technology to finish simple assignments is likely the new normal. \u201cI think the era of asking students to write essays that don\u2019t require creativity could be over,\u201d Jain said. \u201cThose things can be done by pretty much any student that gets inspired to use these tools.\u201d\n\nKaplan refers to this common concern of AI domination as \u201cthe alignment problem.\u201d \u201cIf we create these machines and we don\u2019t want them to harm us, we need to have their intentions and goals stay in alignment with our intentions and goals,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nThis is something that companies like OpenAI are currently working on. According to the OpenGI website, their alignment research aims to make artificial general intelligence in line with human values and follow human intent. \u201cUsing scientific experiments, we study how alignment techniques scale and where they will break,\u201d it says.\n\nThe USC office of research and innovation conducts a variety of labs geared towards better understanding all aspects of AI. The team of researchers are diverse, as they come from a background of multiple application domains, like health care and linguistics.\n\n\u201cOur students are going to use this technology, and we need to teach them how to use it responsibly. We want to harness the power of AI for the public good,\u201d Ishwar K.

Originally from Illinois, Romero grew up around music at the School of Rock. Romero\u2019s music is a mix of \u201cheavyish rock meets that kind of punky indie soft.\u201d Through his music, Romero aims to be an \u201cunfiltered queer spokesperson\u201d as he tells stories of queer love. His emotional storytelling picks up influence from the likes of Jeff Buckley. His recent song, \u201cDaisies,\u201d tells a queer take on the classic Romeo & Juliet.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with Romero to learn more about his inspirations and creative processes while working on \u201cDaisies.\u201d\n\nSC Unplugged graphic by Steven Vargas. Full transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: My name is Jack Romero. I am a junior in the pop vocal program. I am originally from Chicago, Illinois. Well, actually, Naperville. But then I went to school, high school, in the city in Chicago. I went to Chicago Academy for the Arts. But then. Yeah, So then I came out here.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: My role in music. I mean, as a creator, I try to be like an unfiltered, queer spokesperson. I feel that\u2019s kind of my purpose when it comes to my music and not writing queer stories and create music in a way where it\u2019s, I guess, like formulated or in a way that\u2019s about the negative aspects of queer love or even just specificities about queer love, but more just like love in general, and just using like same sex pronouns, you know what I mean? It\u2019s kind of like taking that like \u2018love is love\u2019 type of - that like iconic phrase in a more and like the most literal sense as possible.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: So I went to this kindergarten called Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me, and they had a lot of extracurricular stuff. It was just a wack preschool. And I loved it. On top of tennis and other extracurriculars they had, they had piano lessons. And her name was like Ms. Suzie. And I remembered my parents signed me up for that. And I have a vivid memory from when I was a kid - the first thing we do in every one of our lessons is play each note of the piano all the way through, like all 88 keys. I still don\u2019t know why, but just a vivid memory that I have.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: My first single that I released as a fully out gay man, which very gay title, called \u201cTwo Boys in Love,\u201d that was kind of a premature love song to this guy that I was dating. Actually, during COVID, we met in let\u2019s see, right at the start of 2020. And we talked for a while and then we started dating and all that. And then right after we kind of made things official, like the day that we made things official, I sat down and wrote that song.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: Oh, God. So, so much change. So, when I first started releasing music, it was very much just like a cluster fuck of just stuff. Every single song that I would write, I would bring in and it was like more of an artist development type relationship with my producer. And there was a lot of deadlines that we had and a lot of it just felt forced and rushed.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: My first one when it comes to live performance. Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to be asked to play the Spark! welcome week concert through Visions and Voices which is at McCarthy Quad and it was just such a magical experience.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: Yeah. So there\u2019s, you know, the two aspects of it, which is like music and then how people perceive the music. And when it comes to music, I think the biggest pressure for me is just that a project has to end at some point. You can\u2019t keep making tweaks to it, you can\u2019t overdo it and kind of letting, you know, like your baby go is a huge thing.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: \u201cDaisies\u201d started out in late 2020. One of my best friends at home, her name is Bri Joi, who\u2019s also an artist. She is stunning and amazing and one of the best songwriters ever. She was coming over. We were going to have a sleepover, a little girl\u2019s night. And I literally just got out of the shower, and I was just sitting on my bedroom floor and I was on facetime with her just talking about our plan.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: So that one specifically was focused a lot on the parts of my coming out journey that were not all too bright. The whole premise of the song is it\u2019s a point of view from a lover who lost their partner to suicide because of a hostile, unaccepting environment that the other man unfortunately was in.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: I definitely like whenever I go to write a song or whenever I\u2019m trying to think of a song, the first thing I do is I take my capo, I close my eyes and I kind of just zhuzh it wherever I want to put it. And then I find a fret and I just lay it down and then I just start fucking around with some chords.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: So I because the song is so sad, I wanted to create some type of - it still is a sad video, but I wanted to create it in a way where it\u2019s not just the story itself because the story you can hear in the song. But I wanted it to be like, what is the after life with these two boys? What does it look like?\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: After \u201cDaisies\u201d I released a song called \u201cInto Men.\u201d When did I release that? I released that in September, I believe. Which is another queer song, obviously. That one I tried focusing solely just on - \u201cDaisies,\u201d obviously was very analytical and very in-depth and specific.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: My all time goal. Okay, so I have three separate paths that I would want to go down as an artist. My first path, well my first goal first goal, and this is kind of like my next big goal as an artist, one that\u2019s like, you know, a huge reach but not not out of reach, if that makes sense. Is I would love to be an open, like be an opening act for somebody on tour.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cDaisies\u201d by Jack Romero]\n\nRomero: I don\u2019t know if I have anything else to say other than like, it just makes me happy. It\u2019s a good outlet. And I love creating and I love the networking side of it, too. I love meeting people in music. I love hearing about other people\u2019s music, I love learning about music. I just think I mean, there\u2019s something so satisfying about finishing a song.\n```"}

Regular admission alternatives, like Trojan Transfer, set students up for higher rates of success.  Expand Tommy Trojan. (Photo by Ling Luo)  By   Thomas Johnson  and  Dominic Varela March 30, 2023 at  7:14 pm PDT \n \nUSC\u2019s soon-to-be-freshman class of 2027 earned their spot at University Park despite battling the school\u2019s lowest acceptance rate on record. The 80,000-plus applications received by the university meant the standards for admittance  were higher than ever before . With that in mind, it begs the question: What if you weren\u2019t accepted, but still want to come to USC? Considering that a mere 9.9% of prospective students were admitted for the fall semester, that left 70,000 high school students without a spot. At least for the moment. For those not accepted into the fall or spring semesters, USC offers a different method for non-standard admission: transfer applications. One specific form of applying as a transfer student is Trojan Transfer planning meetings, which is an invite-only program. The admissions office invites all legacy applicants and other select applicants who \u201cwere not admitted but stood out during application review.\u201d These meetings are designed to help those applicants make a plan to apply as a transfer. One common misconception is that going through a meeting guarantees future admission, but that is not the case according to the USC admissions office. However, the USC admissions office says \u201cwe have found that students following our guidance are more likely to gain transfer admission.\u201d Wyatt Murrell, a sophomore studying business administration, was initially rejected from USC when he first applied. But, as a legacy applicant, he was offered a Trojan Transfer planning meeting. At the bottom of his admissions decision, he received the details of this meeting to help him apply as a transfer. \u201cThis decision was especially difficult for us given your ties to the Trojan Family,\u201d Murrell\u2019s admission\u2019s decision said. \u201cYour eventual enrollment at USC is of great interest to us, so I invite you to consider a Trojan Transfer planning meeting, which will assist you in gaining admission to USC as a transfer student within the next two or three semesters.\u201d Murrell said the Zoom meeting he had with an admissions representative helped lay out his course plan for his freshman year at Golden West College, a community college in Huntington Beach. \u201cThey just said, here\u2019s what you should take there,\u201d Murrell said. \u201cHere\u2019s what credits will transfer over to USC. Everything transferred over like they said, so it worked out perfectly.\u201d Most students who have the Trojan Transfer planning meeting choose to attend community colleges, such as Santa Monica Community College, or go abroad to cities like London, Rome or Paris. Santa Monica Community College sent 124 students to USC in the most recent transfer admissions cycle. Murrell said the advisor he met with did not recommend that he attend a four-year university for his freshman year. \u201cWe believe that community college is the best path for most students wishing to transfer and these [Trojan Transfer] counseling sessions will promote that as an appropriate pathway,\u201d the USC admissions office said in a comment. \u201cUSC maintains articulation agreements with California community colleges, which allows for precise advisement, as well as specific and dedicated support for prospective transfer students.\u201d According to USC\u2019s transfer admissions statistics,  36%  of transfer students they accept are Scions, or legacy students. The statistics, however, do not offer any information about what percentage of those students went through a Trojan Transfer planning meeting. Although it was not recommended to Murrell during his Trojan Transfer planning meeting, students may still transfer to USC from four-year colleges, although the acceptance rate from four-year university transfer applicants is slightly lower than applicants from two-year colleges. In 2022, the fall transfer acceptance rate was around 24%, according to the USC admissions office. That\u2019s almost double the acceptance rate of the traditional cycle. Of those transfers, 47% came from four-year universities, while 53% came from two-year institutions. Justin Hindi, a sophomore trying to get into the civil engineering program, chose to attend the University of Oregon for his freshman year before transferring to USC. Hindi also went through the Trojan Transfer planning meeting and was told to go to a two-year institution rather than going to a four-year university like Oregon, but did not want to put all of his eggs into USC\u2019s basket. \u201cI just wanted experience college all four years,\u201d Hindi said. \u201cAnd so Oregon is another big school like USC, obviously ... So I just went to Oregon thinking that if I get into USC, obviously I\u2019ll come. But I would not be disappointed if I didn\u2019t get in.\u201d Many people did not get a positive admissions decision in this most recent cycle. But students still have the opportunity to get into USC as a transfer student.

He opened his remarks by acknowledging the importance of the report\u2019s focus.\n\nMichael Moore: We recognize that homicides devastate communities, it grips people with fear. It causes immeasurable damage to families, friends and loved ones.\n\nOverall, the city saw a 5% decrease in homicides in 2022. The biggest decrease in homicides occurred in the areas south of the 10 Freeway, with 27 fewer homicides than in 2021. Guns are still the primary murder weapon in homicide cases by a large margin, and two hundred thirty two fewer guns were seized last year. However, the clearance rate, or the amount of crimes resolved with an arrest or being investigated to its fullest extent, increased to 75%, up from 68% in 2021.\n\nOne of the biggest announcements at the press conference was the launch of a new LAPD website dedicated to tracking homicides. It will not only list victims\u2019 names and photos, but also tell people the date of the homicide, as well as whether any arrests were made in connection to it.\n\nMoore: It\u2019s our hope that as people see those victims [they] recognize that they represent a life not just lost, but a devastation for an entire family that will help drive our communities to help with the most crucial resource, and that is their voice, and helping us understand those responsible for this gun violence.\n\nDespite the report\u2019s good news, local residents have mixed feelings about LA safety, with one even expressing tiredness over the whole situation.\n\nShelly Fleming: I feel like walking around hasn\u2019t felt like felt safe for a while. And just knowing that information makes it a little bit more scary.\n\nShelly Fleming, who lives in Downtown LA, said she witnessed a homeless person attack someone with a pole, and the initial post-pandemic rise made her uncomfortable to be out and about.\n\nFleming: It\u2019s just disappointing because like, I live in Hollywood, and then I moved to downtown, so I\u2019ve been in LA for seven years. So both places are kind of full of crime. And just it can get tiring having to be really cautious about the areas that you go to.\n\nIn contrast to Fleming, Hollywood Hills resident Richard Kaplan feels that things are a lot safer in Downtown LA.\n\nRichard Kaplan: I\u2019ve been working down here on and off for 30 years and it\u2019s a lot safer than it\u2019s ever been by far.\u201d \n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Lawrence Sung.\n```"}

The ceremony also included speakers like USC President Carol L. Folt, L.A. Councilmember Curren Price, L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell and some of Casa de Rosas\u2019 residents. Casa de Rosas, also known as the Froebel Institute and the Sunshine Mission, is a historic building in the West Adams district and was previously the oldest women\u2019s shelter in L.A. Now, it has been transformed into a PSH development for homeless veterans and their families.\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful way to start your day: ribbon cutting at a beautiful facility,\u201d Bass said at the ceremony. \u201cNow, this is work that was done years ago. And although I served as a cheerleader, it was your hard work that got this done.\u201d\n\nCasa de Rosas, situated on the corner of South Hoover Street and West Adams Boulevard, consists of 15 single units, 19 one-bedroom units and two two-bedroom units. It houses 36 veteran families.\n\n\u201cI think the program is magnificent,\u201d said Greg Walker, who sang the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d and \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d which is often referred to as the Black national anthem, at the ceremony. \u201cThere are people that are out here that really can\u2019t be heard, can\u2019t be noticed or anything, but this program gets them heard. It gets their voice out there.\u201d\n\nWhen Casa de Rosas was built in 1893, it initially served as a private kindergarten at a time when education for younger children was a novelty. Since then, it has served as a college preparation center for women, an inn, a restaurant, military barracks during World War II and a Church of Scientology headquarters. In the 1950s, radio evangelist Essie Binkley West bought the property and turned it into a women\u2019s homeless shelter, Sunshine Mission for Women.\n\n\u201cRenovating it for [these] purposes is fantastic,\u201d said Lika Dozier, a program manager for the Leslie and William McMorrow Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI), a college access and success program that works with students from low-income households in South and East L.A. Dozier also sang the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d at the event as a representative of USC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in the neighborhood for several years since I was a college student at USC,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen this house on this corner for many years. I\u2019m so glad to see, that one, it is being used again, [and] two, that it has been renovated so beautifully. And so to be here, and hear kind of the journey of how long and how many people it took to get here is amazing.\u201d\n\nFederal and state regulations require residents of Casa de Rosas to have a household annual income that does not exceed the income limits published by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee.\n\n\u201cWe have such a big problem in our city,\u201d Bass said. \u201cSo one of the challenges that veterans face is that their benefits tend to be just too much money for them to qualify for housing. So then veterans have to choose between your [Veterans Health Administration health care] or a house.\u201d\n\nBass shared that she met with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough in Washington, D.C. to discuss the rules and regulations that veterans face when searching for housing. She also announced that Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge just awarded L.A. $157 million \u201con top of the $60 million that she awarded us just a couple of months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat this is showing is that when we show the leadership of the country, the state, the county and the city, all working together, people are willing to step up and say, \u2018We know you have a massive problem in L.A., but we see that you\u2019re doing everything possible to address that problem,\u2019\u201d Bass said. \u201cAnd then other people will come forward.\u201d\n```"}

All of these young boxers have padded records. None of the big names ever fight each other. The UFC is so much better. These are the things I\u2019ve heard over the last few years and as a longtime boxing fan, it pains me to say I\u2019ve been on this side of the fence. I\u2019ve been wrong though, boxing isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s in a hampered state, but it now has the potential to be reinvigorated, thanks to Gervonta Davis and Ryan Garcia, who are both undefeated, agreeing to take the riskiest fight of their careers when they face off in Las Vegas on April 22 at a 136-pound catchweight.\n\nI don\u2019t think boxing will ever truly be \u201cdead.\u201d Max Kellerman put it best \u2014 boxing is the best sport, because if we were walking down the street and saw two random people fighting out in the street, we\u2019d most likely stop whatever we were doing and watch. The same can\u2019t be said for many other sports. Boxing also currently has generational talent with the likes of Canelo Alvarez, Errol Spence, Terence Crawford, Oleksandr Usyk, Tyson Fury, Noya Inoue and Artur Beterbiev. With this amount of talent, one could imagine that boxing should be at its peak like the sport of mixed martial arts \u2014 specifically the UFC \u2014 and be one of the main attractions in all professional sports like it once was for most of the 20th century.\n\nHowever, for the better part of the last decade, top fighters haven\u2019t fought each other. If they did, it would be a couple of years after fans had begged. It has gotten so bad that even the younger boxers have started to speak out. The glaring issue comes at the hands of promoters like Bob Arum, Oscar De La Hoya and Eddie Hearn who deprive the public of the fights they want to see. I will give credit to De La Hoya for playing a role in getting Davis vs. Garcia done, but I\u2019ll never forget the fact that Alvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin was delivered in 2017, a couple of years after most of the boxing world had been begging for it.\n\nAdditionally, the number of belts a fighter can obtain in boxing is a problem because multiple fighters can claim they are the champion of their division. WBC, WBO, WBA and IBF champion, anyone? It\u2019s all too much. It\u2019s easier said than done, but boxing should take a page out of the UFC playbook \u2014 the best fighting the best during their primes while the fans want it. While we know the UFC has had its own issues whether it be fighter pay or the recent betting scandal involving James Krause, a former UFC fighter and former trainer of Flyweight champion Brandon Moreno, there is one thing the UFC and its fans can say \u2014 the company on fire right now and the big UFC cards tend to deliver more often than not.\n\nWe saw Jon Jones come back from a three-year layoff at UFC 285 and submit Ciryl Gane in under two minutes to win the heavyweight championship. A month prior at UFC 284 in Australia, we saw the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter Alexander Volkanovksi go against No. 2 Islam Makhachev in a highly contested match that left many UFC fans in awe of the grit and skill displayed by both fighters. Back in November at UFC 281 in Madison Square Garden, we saw Israel Adesanya\u2019s dominant middleweight title run end after a standing technical knockout coming from the fists of his rival Alex Pereira in the final minutes of the fifth round. Not to mention that same card also featured Michael Chandler vs. Dustin Poirier \u2014 a fight that would end up in the running for fight of the year amongst MMA circles.\n\nThese are special moments and fights because generational talents are going at each other with everything to lose. Anything is possible in these fights where the skill level of each fighter is so high. Simply put, UFC fans have been spoiled. Boxing fans should be spoiled too.\n\nIt feels like I\u2019ve said this for the last three years, but I hope this is the year that things start to finally change in boxing. However, this is the first year that I can say I have some glimmering hope. When Davis squares off with Garcia, it could mark the beginning of a new chapter in boxing. A blockbuster mega fight featuring two undefeated boxers from different networks, under the age of thirty, in their physical primes? Pinch me. I must be dreaming.\n\nFights like these remind me that boxing isn\u2019t dead and it\u2019s quietly coming back. We saw an exciting grudge match between two super-middleweight stars this past weekend when David Benavidez and Caleb Plant settled their differences at MGM Grand Arena. After a unanimous decision victory, Benavidez called out Canelo Alvarez, one of boxing\u2019s biggest superstars and the undisputed champion at super-middleweight.\n\nFurthermore, it was reported earlier this month by USA Today Sports that Errol Spence and Terence Crawford have agreed to a purse split. I will always hold out hope for this fight, but things got out of hand quickly the last time these two were reportedly \u201cclose\u201d to making the fight happen. Meanwhile, Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk are most likely still discussing who gets to walk out last in their bout that will probably take place in 2030 at this rate.\n\nOn a serious note, I genuinely hope Davis and Garcia making their fight happen will set an example for the rest of boxing and its sanctioning bodies. Despite the obstacles that might be in the way, it is always possible to make a mega-fight happen as long as both sides put their egos aside and make ends meet. The fans got robbed of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquaio going at it in their primes, which would have definitely been a better product than their fight in 2015.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that if Crawford or Spence were to go blow for blow in the championship rounds \u2014 or possibly be added to the other\u2019s knockout reel after going down in dramatic fashion in their fight \u2014 the internet would explode and boxing would be a trending topic for a weekend. The same can also be said for Davis and Garcia.\n\nAt the end of the day, boxing needs fights like Adesanya vs. Pereira, Usman vs. Edwards, and Volkanovski vs. Makkhachev. So, please don\u2019t do us how Floyd and Manny did us, Spence and Crawford. Be like Davis and Garcia and get the fight made. The boxing community is begging you.\n\nWhile the golden era of boxing might be over, there could be a light at the end of the tunnel. It\u2019s ultimately up to star fighters and their camps to cooperate with one another and get the big fights made. Oh, and bring back HBO Boxing and 24/7 too while you\u2019re at it.\n```"}

As the most significant set of rule changes since the adoption of the designated hitter in 1973, these rules are set to impact all aspects of the game.\n\nTo ensure that these rules were fair and playable, all rule changes were play-tested in more than 8,000 minor league games before implementation into the Major League and were enforced during spring training games to allow for an adjustment period for players before opening day.\n\nAs the average nine-inning MLB game typically lasts for around 3 hours, even reaching up to 8 hours, baseball has been criticized for being a slow-paced sport compared to other sports. This has been attributed to a downhill trend in viewership, with the World Series in 2022 receiving an average of 11.8 million viewers, 50% down from the audience in 2016.\n\nThe three biggest changes include: a pitch clock, ending the shift and limiting pick off attempts. Only time will tell if these rule changes will impact player performance.\n\nReactions from baseball fans have mixed. Jonathan Williams is a masters student at USC. He hopes the rule changes will allow more people to share his love of the sport.\n\nJonathan Williams: You have these baseball traditionalists that are just aren\u2019t... they don\u2019t like any any move, like they don\u2019t want any sort of change. They don\u2019t want any sort of change in direction or changing of the guard. I think the new rules will really just help grow the game.\n\nTaj Khan is a political science major who gravitates towards fast paced sports.\n\nTaj Khan: I like football and basketball more. Baseball is very confusing, and it\u2019s way too long... So it\u2019s going to speed up the game for sure is going to be awesome.\n\nOscar Brito is a junior journalism major that appreciates baseball in its original lengthy state.\n\nOscar Brito: it\u2019s part of the rule now. It\u2019s literally in the rulebook. So it\u2019s you can\u2019t really be mad. You have to just actually follow the rules. So it\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s part of the rule. So I understand. I\u2019d be pissed though, as a fan.\n\nHowever, the most influential change came with the new pitching rule which forces pitchers to start their motion before the expiration of a 15 to 20 second timer depending on if there\u2019s a run around base, cutting the time of a baseball game down by 20 minutes, a huge transition from the reset mechanic that pitchers often utilize to prolong their time.\n\nWith opening night baseball underway, fans have all different opinions on these new rules that will be enforced tonight. What it means for the future of the MLB will be decided...one strike at a time.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Alexis Lara.\n```"}

(Photo by Julia Zara)\n\nBy Lyla Bhalla-Ladd, Andie Kalinowski, and Safira Khan\nMarch 30, 2023 at 6:47 pm PDT\n\nUSC\u2019s acceptance rate this year is 11.5% and that\u2019s our lowest rate ever. The total number of applicants grew by 17%. So USC is looking more and more popular, but how many of these people who were accepted will actually join the 2023 freshmen class? And in terms of diversity, what will the upcoming class look like?\n\nEli Gingold: I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s gotten harder and harder to get in, which really reflects well on the school in terms of how many people want to come. That\u2019s Eli Gingold. He\u2019s a junior majoring in business, and he\u2019s right. A lower acceptance rate is impressive, and something USC can be proud of. And as another point of pride, this is one of the most diverse groups ever admitted to USC. USC\u2019s administration is trumpeting this diverse incoming class, citing acceptances of 33% historically underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, 19% international students, and only 12% legacies.\n\nPart of the reason for the increase in applicants is simply a national trend. Many colleges across the US had high numbers of applicants. And USC also debuted its early action admission option this year says a freshmen International Relations Global Business major, Leo Yang.\n\nLeo Yang: I feel like they opened the whole Early Action thingy so that more people are applying. That\u2019s part of the reason why there\u2019s so many people applying, the admission rates dropped.\n\nBut admissions rates and who actually joins the freshmen class are two different things. While it\u2019s great to have a diverse group of students accepted, will it translate to a diverse freshman student body in the fall? The financial barriers to USC remain stubbornly high and the costs continue to rise. USC\u2019s tuition today is over 60 thousand dollars. Make that over 66 thousand dollars.

Her visit to Southern California is speculated to take place on April 5 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Ventura County, though that has yet to be officially confirmed.\n\nTsai\u2019s potential trip comes less than a year after former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan last August. And as they did for Pelosi\u2019s visit, the Chinese government has reacted strongly to the idea of a meeting between current Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Tsai.\n\nSpokespeople for the Chinese government said the country will assuredly take measures to fight back and that the meeting could catalyze a \u201cserious confrontation in the China-US relationship.\u201d\n\nEric Heikkila teaches at USC\u2019s Price School of Public Policy and is a faculty member at the USC US-China Institute. He believes the mediation of this conflict lies in finding the middle-ground.\n\n\u201cOur friendships aren\u2019t just with folks in China, but the friendships are also with folks in Taiwan... With things as tense as they are, providing some kind of reassurance to the people on Taiwan that they\u2019re not alone, that the United States is there in some meaningful way, it is important.\u201d\n\nHeikkila adds that it\u2019s important to show that the attempt at resolution is genuine.\n\n\u201cIf it could be done in the way that we had been talking about before, in a way that\u2019s looking to calm things down and to resolve things rather than to sort of looking to to raise the temperature in ways that are not necessary and in fact, may be counterproductive.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s currently unclear how exactly China might respond to the meeting, should it occur, but Heikkila says it\u2019ll likely be similar to what we\u2019ve seen before.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole broad range of things that they could be doing. And I mean, one that\u2019s likely is some kind of demonstration of military show of force, as was done when Speaker Pelosi went to Taiwan last year.\u201d\n\nHeikkila also mentions that there are other ways global superpower China could respond.\n\n\u201cThere are the economic ties. There are also sort of collateral moves in other arenas. For example, I think it was today that President Xi-Jinping announced sort of further military cooperation with Russia. And one doesn\u2019t know, but that might have also been sort of in the balance. Well, if you\u2019re going to cause trouble there, we\u2019re going to cause trouble here.\u201d\n\nAside from the possible geopolitical impacts of the meeting, President Tsai\u2019s potential visit to LA also has very personal implications. Amos Pai is a member of USC\u2019s Taiwanese Student Association and is also politically active and has interned for a small political party in Taiwan.\n\nOn the topic of the meeting, he had this to say:\n\n\u201cI really appreciate this happening and people start to know about Taiwan as a whole and that is a major step than what we had before. Growing up I was taught that no one knows about Taiwan, we\u2019re such a small country and such a small island and we\u2019re accustomed to not thinking Taiwan is important.\u201d\n\nWhile leaders are still waiting with baited breath for confirmation of the meeting between Tsai and McCarthy, Heikkila says it\u2019s more than likely the two will sit down early next week.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Jonathan Martin.\n```"}

On March 31, 2020, Edward Bronstein was pulled over and taken into custody on the 5 Freeway in Burbank by two California Highway Patrol officers under suspicion of driving under the influence. A video filmed by the sergeant shows a handcuffed Bronstein being led into their Altadena station\u2019s garage, where officers informed him they had a court order to obtain a sample of his blood.\n\nOn Wednesday, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon announced the charges in Bronstein\u2019s death, which the LA County coroner said was caused by \u201cacute methamphetamine intoxication during restraint by law enforcement.\u201d The officers had obtained a warrant to draw Bronstein\u2019s blood before forcing him to the ground and piling their weight on top of him.\n\nHere is Gascon: An arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Last March, a judge hearing the family\u2019s wrongful death lawsuit ordered the release of an 18-minute video of what happened at the station. Please be advised as the following audio is disturbing. That was Bronstein crying on his knees repeatedly that he can\u2019t breathe and even screaming that he would do the blood draw willingly as the officers press his body onto the ground. But the officers respond that it\u2019s too late as Bronstein\u2019s voice gets softer and softer until eventually falling silent.\n\nWhile he is unresponsive, the nurse works to draw the blood of pinned down Bronstein. It takes over 10 minutes to pass since his last screams for officers realize he does not have a pulse and begin CPR. Bronstein never regained consciousness and was later pronounced dead.\n\nThe seven officers face one count each of involuntary manslaughter and one felony count of assault under the color of authority. The DA\u2019s office also charged the registered nurse who obtained the blood sample with involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, they could get up to four years in prison.\n\nIf this incident sounds familiar, it may be because Bronstein died less than two months before George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis as he too told police officers, repeatedly, that he couldn\u2019t breathe. Almost a year and a half later, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law that barred police from using certain face-down holds that have led to multiple unintended deaths. They include putting a suspect face down and then applying pressure on their backs with hands, elbows, or knees. The bill expanded on the state\u2019s existing ban on chokeholds in the wake of Floyd\u2019s murder.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Spencer Cline.\n```"}

They welcomed the students with open arms as their ideas of queerness and spirituality were discussed in a safe space. The meeting focused on finding and exploring the intersections of queerness and spirituality.\n\nStudents who attended the meeting got a pamphlet labeled \u201cqueerituality guide.\u201d The guide had fill-in-the blank options where attendees could write in their experiences or coping mechanisms that may have helped them. While filling in and coloring their \u201cqueerituality guide\u201d each member took a turn discussing their beliefs, on both religion and identity.\n\nAlthough the meeting started a bit quiet, as time went by, everyone opened up. Each member discussed their upbringings and spiritually with God and how that affected their sexuality.\n\nRobin Stroud, the director of student engagement programs with the University Religious Center ran the meeting. Robin, originally from Norman, Oklahoma, who comes from a religious family, struggled with religion growing up as she was forced to follow the same beliefs as her family, but often wondered what other beliefs were out there for her.\n\n\u201cI was raised in an environment where it was not okay to be queer and it was really not okay to be trans. You could come into the church if you\u2019re queer but you can not even come in if you are trans because they believe you may affect the congregation or something,\u201d Robin said. \u201cThat is not okay with me, because that is incredibly damaging to people\u2019s spiritual health and well being\u201d.\n\nRobin is a mother of two. Her eldest, August Stroud, is a 23-year-old trans male who uses he/him. August and his mother share a special bond as they have been there for each other through every hurdle of life.\n\n\u201cI am extremely grateful and proud. She and my dad have always been 100% on my side and have done their best to hear me out, even when I get really esoteric with gender stuff,\u201d August said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad she\u2019s creating spaces for people on this campus like she did informally for me and my peers back in Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nMembers of the LGBTQ+ community shared some different churches around the Los Angeles area that are welcoming to the community.\n\n\u201cI was raised in the Seventh Day Adventist Church, around the Loma Linda area and I experienced more of a conservative version of Adventism that was not affirming towards the LGBT community,\u201d said sophomore Grace Boyd. \u201cI actually found a church in Glendale called the Glendale City Church and I\u2019ve been really impressed how they\u2019re very affirming of the LGBT community. They actually had a conference recently about Adventist LGBT allies and members.\u201d\n\nEmotions bubbled in the meeting. What started with reserved introductions ended in shared hugs. With the sentiments and love that was present in the meeting, many members reached out to their friends that attend USC about attending future Queer Interfaith meetings.\n\nRobin is excited to start the group back up in her first year as a member of the USC family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything that has not been done here before,\u201d Robin said. \u201cIt just has not been done here in a minute, so we are just kind of restarting it.\u201d\n```"}

Fewer Democrats \u2014 mostly those in the ages of 18 to 44 \u2014 feel Biden should seek re-election. Just about 37% of Democrats said the President should run in 2024, down from 52% in October. USC students echo this doubt that Biden, 80, could serve a second term.\n\nJunior John Trodden feels Biden \u201cmight be too old to do the job,\u201d but isn\u2019t sure who could replace him. Trodden\u2019s thoughts are not isolated. The over-60% of poll respondents who said Biden should not run again point to his numerous gaffes, old age, worrying cough, and possibly declining mental fitness as liabilities to the job.\n\nRecently, Biden was seen tripping while boarding Air Force One, an incident quickly immortalized on Twitter. Much of Biden\u2019s original campaign platform was based on reversing Trump-era policies that did not align with the values of the Democratic base. Now, without a clear opponent for the Democratic nomination and a growing pool of conservative prospects for the election, Biden\u2019s standalone politics will be put to the test.\n\nTrojan Democrats President Sasha Hussain predicts that 2024 will look more like a \u201cparty vs. party\u201d election, similar to the 2016 and 2020 races, rather than a \u201ccandidate vs. candidate\u201d campaign.\n\nWhile a Biden-Harris re-election bid is still unconfirmed, experts suggest an official announcement should come in April. Until then, the nation sets its eyes on the race for the Republican nomination. According to political action expert Kamy Akhavan, Executive Director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future, \u201cBiden is watching [Trump and other possible Republican nominees] closely, and it may affect his decision to run or not.\u201d\n\nThere are currently four Republicans on the ticket, including Nikki Haley, Corey Stapleton, Vivek Ramaswamy, and former president Donald Trump. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is likely to announce soon, as he begins a tour this week that includes stops in Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire.\n\n\u201c[Biden] thinks he is the kryptonite to Trump,\u201d Akhavan said. \u201cBut a Trump-less Republican party means his kryptonite may not be needed or even effective against candidates like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Tim Scott, and others.\u201d\n\nIf Biden decides not to run, he is \u201cduty bound to elevate Kamala Harris as the heir apparent,\u201d Akhavan said. \u201cThe problem is that she ran a poor campaign in 2020 and has high unfavorability numbers. That means candidates like Gavin Newsom, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and several Democratic nominees will see an opening.\u201d\n\nSophomore USG Senator Maria Barun feels that Buttigieg, 41, stands a strong chance for the nomination in the absence of Biden and Harris. \u201cHe has a really interesting platform in that it is really central and takes sides from both ends of the political spectrum,\u201d Barun said. \u201cI think his age also does him a big favor, as well as his background and experience.\u201d\n\nCandidate age is an issue that transcends party lines. Sophomore Nicolas Kallins would like to see a young Republican candidate to be elected in 2024. \u201cI think that we should have a new Republican for president that is not Trump. Some new blood in the office,\u201d said Kallins. \u201cSomeone younger, someone that is pretty well spoken and can appeal to both sides of the political party.\u201d\n\nUSC has long-involved itself in the study and advancement of national politics through political organizations and activist groups. The university similarly urges students to involve themselves in politics and national campaigns. The USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy \u201cseeks to influence public policy and public debate\u201d as well as find solutions to social and political issues.\n\nThe Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics aims to bridge the divide between the academic study of politics and real-world experiences for students. Finally, the Dornsife Center for the Political Future conducts political polls and also works to further political debate.\n\nYoung people are historically underrepresented and uninvolved in federal policy, but these groups hope to bring issues facing college students to the forefront. 25-year-old Afro-Cuban Congressman Maxwell Frost\u2019s (D) recent election signals a shift in generational power on a national level.\n\nThe Democratic party hopes Frost\u2019s election, as well as Biden\u2019s plans for student debt forgiveness, can help activate an otherwise untapped voting pool. As the campaign season inches closer, more candidates will likely announce their run for the 2024 presidential election. And Annenberg Media will be keeping a close eye.\n```"}

After 64 games of non-stop college basketball, we are left with four teams hoping to bring their university a national championship. In what has been a particularly upset-filled tournament, with no one-seeds and three newcomers in the Final Four, the madness is truly alive. If the trend continues, the UConn Huskies, Miami Hurricanes, San Diego St. Aztecs and Florida Atlantic Owls will provide pure entertainment and a Final Four to remember.\n\nHere\u2019s what I think we\u2019re in store for this weekend. One quick note: according to my March Madness bracket, I have no idea about college basketball. I had two teams left by the Elite Eight and will finish ranked 14th in the Annenberg Media bracket challenge! March Madness is the most unpredictable sporting event on the planet, so take my predictions with a grain of salt.\n\nNo. 5 San Diego State will beat No. 9 FAU\n\nFAU is currently attempting to become the lowest-seeded school to ever win the NCAA tournament. However, it may be the end of the line for the Owls. When I wrote about San Diego State at the beginning of March, I said they were a \u201cteam tailor-made for March.\u201d This remains true as behind a masterful defensive performance, they were able to eliminate the No. 1 overall seed in the entire tournament, Alabama. With their defense being as strong as it is, they are able to win games by tight margins and overcome offensive droughts.\n\nThe Owls have quickly entered the conversation as one of the best Cinderella teams ever in March Madness with their attractive style of basketball. They share the basketball and have a roster full of athletes that can go toe-to-toe with any team. Ultimately, I think that SDSU will be able to disrupt this offensive style, leading to broken-down possessions that favor the Aztecs. Unfortunately for FAU, I predict the clock will strike midnight, and Cinderella\u2019s magic will wear off.\n\nNo. 5 Miami will beat No. 4 UConn\n\nUConn is currently the betting favorite to win March Madness across every reputable sportsbook. However, they\u2019ll face a Miami team with an offense that looks almost impossible to stop. Going into the tournament, there were legitimate questions about the health of Miami sophomore forward Norchad Omier after he sustained an ankle injury in the semifinals of the ACC tournament. The answer to those questions has been a resounding \u2018I\u2019m healthy\u2019 from Omier, who has started every game for the Hurricanes during the NCAA tournament.\n\nMiami\u2019s biggest strength is their guard play, which has brought them this far. Sophomore guards Wooga Poplar and Nijel Pack along with junior Jordan Miller and senior Isaiah Wong are all capable of taking over the game at a moment\u2019s notice. Miami head coach Jim Larra\u00f1aga also has Final Four experience, previously taking George Mason there in 2006.\n\nThe issue for Miami will be their ability to guard UConn\u2019s junior forward Adama Sanogo. Sanogo averages over 17 points per game, and his 6-foot-9, 240-pound frame is hard to contain. Along with Sanogo, projected NBA first-round pick and sophomore guard Jordan Hawkins can take over Saturday\u2019s game. The Huskies will try to take advantage of Miami\u2019s lackluster defense, which is ranked outside of KenPom\u2019s top 100, but the Hurricanes will ultimately prevail.\n\nNo. 5 Miami wins the national championship\n\nCongratulations to the Miami Hurricanes for winning my predicted national championship over San Diego State. Unlike FAU, Miami\u2019s prolific offense can score from anywhere on the floor with both isolations and called plays. Still, both schools have something to celebrate, with it being their first Final Four appearance in program history.\n\nA lot has been said about the failures of the NCAA tournament this year, with the lack of both elite teams and bonafide NBA talent. But, the NCAA tournament has been as entertaining as it has ever been this year with teams like Kansas State, Texas, Miami and FAU playing great basketball. If this parity combined with high-powered offenses is the future of college basketball, the sport will continue to be as healthy as ever.\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

The last season in the Pac-12 was one that no one expected. Between USC shattering expectations in year one of the Lincoln Riley era and barely missing the college football playoffs, Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and Oregon quarterback Bo Nix\u2019s out-of-nowhere career resurrections and many other crazy events, the Pac-12 season was one for the ages. It took a lot of work to predict any top storylines in the Pac-12 last season, but despite that, I will do my best to give my bold takes for next season. I would love to see these receipts in my Twitter mentions next season, but hopefully, I can handle myself. So here are my three bold takes for next season.\n\n3. Deion Sanders and Colorado finish with a winning record and play in a bowl game. When you go 1-11, you can only go up from that point. Deion Sanders will shatter expectations in his first year at Colorado. The team will be better than .500 and will make an appearance in a bowl game. Sanders was at Jackson State the previous three seasons and won his conference the past two years. He had a record of 27-6 and was also the Southwestern Athletic Conference Coach of the Year the previous two years. Coach Prime knows how to win at every level, and he will excel as a coach at Colorado. It also helps that his son Shedur Sanders is coming over from Jackson State to play quarterback and has already generated some Heisman buzz. Yes, his presence on social media, as he has a million followers on Instagram, makes him create more buzz than he probably should. However, he is an absolute stud with enough talent to succeed at Colorado. In addition to his son, Coach Prime is also getting the 2022 No. 1 overall recruit Travis Hunter to follow him from Jackson State. Hunter is a rare talent as he plays both wide receiver and cornerback. Sanders turned him into one of the best players in the FCS as a freshman, and he should soar in year two. Despite being a sophomore, Hunter may be the best cornerback in the Pac-12 next season, and a shutdown corner at the college level is a rare yet treasured piece to a winning formula. It also helps that they have the number one cornerback in the 2023 class, Cormani McClain, playing alongside Hunter this season. Colorado still has a lot of work to do, but I believe that Sanders will find a way to win and put Colorado back on the map in 2023.\n\n2. Oregon State has a disappointing season and fails to reach a bowl game. No matter what I say for the rest of this article, I know this will be the take that fans are the most upset over. Look, I get it. Oregon State had a great season last year and shocked the whole country when they ended the season 10-3 with a bowl win over Florida. However, they have transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei coming over from Clemson, and he is expected to be the starter for the beavers next year. If you watched Uiagalelei at Clemson, you witnessed his extremely inconsistent play for the past two seasons. Uiagalelei had the perfect system around him at Clemson: one of the most incredible head coaches ever alongside a great defense and solid weapons. And he couldn\u2019t find a way to keep his job. I don\u2019t see how he can rebound at Oregon State, which is coming off its first bowl win since 2013. I could be wrong; Uiagalelei could be an absolute star at Oregon State, and Clemson just wasn\u2019t the right fit. However, I don\u2019t see what Oregon State can offer that Clemson couldn\u2019t give him. If you are looking to fix a struggling quarterback, who would you instead work with? Dabo Swinney, who has produced Deshaun Watson and Trevor Lawrence, or Oregon State head coach Jonathan Smith, who doesn\u2019t have a track record of anything close to Swinney? Uiagalelei needs to gain the talent to be successful at the college level.\n\n1. USC wins the Pac-12 and wins a playoff game. As long as USC can secure a few more starters on defense, the sky is the limit for the Trojans. Heisman-winning quarterback Caleb Williams is returning, and USC has many more weapons returning. While they do lose running back Travis Dye and wide receiver Jordan Addison, they have brought in wide receiver Dorian Singer and running back Marshawn Lloyd to replace them. Singer led the Pac-12 in receiving last year with 1,105 yards for Arizona, while Lloyd had nine rushing touchdowns for South Carolina last year. Dye and Addison were critical pieces of last year\u2019s offense, but I am confident these two guys can replace their production. And for defense, while USC is losing defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu and cornerback Mehki Blackmon to the NFL draft, they have added defensive lineman Anthony Lucas from Texas A&M and defensive lineman Jack Sullivan from Purdue. I don\u2019t know if they can replicate or be anything close to Tuipulotu, who led the FBS in sacks with 13.5 sacks, but I am expecting former top-3 overall recruit Korey Foreman to make huge strides and anchor the USC defense. USC should cruise through the Pac-12, and I firmly believe they are in the top three teams that can win the next national championship next season.\n```"}

While her friends saw it as a hobby, Mendoza had bigger aspirations beyond just kicking the ball. Mendoza was determined to pursue her passion for sports despite the fact that her family thought of her passion as a phase. It was never just a phase for Mendoza.\n\nBorn and raised in Santa Ana, California, Mendoza knew from an early age that she loved soccer. Her parents mostly supported her interest in sports, although members of her family mainly considered it a \u201cphase\u201d and assumed she would eventually grow out of it. Little did they know that her passion for sports would take her places beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nMendoza graduated from USC in 2021 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in communication and a minor in photography. As a visual person, she was drawn to the art of photography and journalism. For two years, she was also an editor at D\u00edmelo, a campus publication.\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted Mendoza\u2019s plans to study abroad, causing her to miss out on an opportunity to participate in the International Communication\u2019s Studies program through USC Annenberg. However, not wanting to give up on her dreams of traveling to Europe, Gloria decided to pursue her master\u2019s degree in Spain during the 2021 fall semester.\n\nSpain provided Mendoza with opportunities that catapulted her career and, ultimately, her confidence. Being behind the camera for Real Madrid and Real MadridTV, Mendoza expanded her portfolio, shooting images for the soccer club while being able to cover stories in person. So much so that after receiving her degree, Mendoza stayed back a few months, where she emerged herself in the sport and culture of f\u00fatbol.\n\nWhen she returned home, Mendoza knew she wanted to pursue a career in sports. Being a first-generation Mexican American, pursuing a career in sports was not the traditional path her family expected. It almost felt unattainable, but Mendoza used her network to help promote herself and landed a job with the Brand and Community street team as a community relations assistant, focusing on direct marketing for LAFC.\n\nMendoza finds joy in engaging with fans during game days and boosting the atmosphere of the team\u2019s community. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re working,\u201d she said. You will never hear her complain because she\u2019s able to be behind the scenes and even behind the camera for the reigning soccer team.\n\nMendoza\u2019s love for sports and photography has taken her on an unexpected journey filled with challenges, hard work, and dedication. Yet despite her obstacles, Mendoza\u2019s determination to pursue her passions has allowed her to achieve her goals and make a mark in the industry. Her family and friends back home are amazed by her accomplishments and proud of her for going far beyond what they thought was possible.\n\nLooking back on her journey, her story shows that following your passions may be challenging but always worthwhile. \u201dIf your little self is proud of you now, then you know it was worth it,\u201d Mendoza said.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\nBy Samuel Spitz and Justin White\nMarch 29, 2023 at 7:03 pm PDT\n\nWith the Final Four and national championship coming up in less than a week, all college basketball conversations will turn into predictions for next season. For USC Trojans fans, that talk began Tuesday night. The annual McDonald\u2019s All-American Game featuring the best high school basketball players in the nation was played in Houston Tuesday night, and two players did all they could to steal the show.\n\nThe two notable All-Americans were top women\u2019s recruit Juju Watkins and Isaiah Collier, the No. 1 men\u2019s high school basketball player, according to 247 Sports \u2013 both future Trojans. Despite Collier\u2019s team failing to win, the Georgia native finished the game leading all scorers with 25 points. He also took home the co-MVP honors with Kentucky-bound guard DJ Wagner.\n\n\u201cI am psyched about him [Collier], he\u2019s awesome,\u201d student Shea O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI think this is the best recruiting class we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nUSC finished the 2022-2023 season with a record of 22-11 and earned a No. 10 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they were ultimately bounced in the first round by Michigan State. This was USC\u2019s third consecutive NCAA tournament appearance, but the Trojans have failed to make it past the first round in 2022 and 2023.\n\nDespite some recent success, a handful of students said they were disappointed with the outcome of this past basketball season.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re a big-name school,\u201d freshman Ben Gold said. \u201cAnd for a big-name school to not be able to play basketball at a high level, especially considering the amount of money we make from our football team, it\u2019s a little sad.\u201d\n\nLuckily, Collier will not be alone when he comes to L.A. in the fall. Joining him is his high school teammate, Arrinten Page, a four-star center, who will hopefully make an instant impact as well. But, the Trojans might not be done on the recruiting trail. One of the stars of last night\u2019s game was Bronny James, the son of NBA legend and international superstar Lebron James. Back in January, James announced that he had narrowed his college decision down to three schools: Ohio State, Oregon and USC.\n\nThe prospect of James being a Trojan next season is very exciting to Trojan fans.\n\n\u201cI think that a lot of people will hate on him [Bronny James] just because he is Lebron\u2019s son, but he\u2019s a really good player,\u201d freshman Bain Higgins said. \u201cHe\u2019s really smart, really poised for his age, and putting him next to Collier could make a guard duo that USC has not had in a while.\u201d\n\nThis sense of excitement for basketball is a new phenomenon at USC. With the football team resurging this past fall, Collier has the potential to lead the Trojans into a new era of basketball.\n\n\u201cI think he will help elevate not only our team and us playing-wise, but also will encourage other recruits and players to come here, which obviously I think would be pretty beneficial for everybody at the school,\u201d said freshman Eli Goldenberg.\n\nAnd Collier isn\u2019t the only top recruit heading to USC next semester. Watkins, the top recruit in high school girls\u2019 basketball, is also coming to USC. The five-star recruit scored 25 points in last night\u2019s All-American game on the women\u2019s side and won co-MVP honors for Team West in the highest-scoring game in the history of girls\u2019 McDonald\u2019s All-American games.\n\nWatkins, who attends Sierra Canyon High School with Bronny James, was also a 2021 Gatorade Player of the Year and was named MVP of the 2022 FIBA Under-17 Women\u2019s Basketball World Cup in Hungary. She was also All-CIF Open Division 1st Team in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think she can provide a lot to the team,\u201d said Paige Reynolds, a freshman international relations and global economy major. \u201cWe did make the tournament this year, but I feel like now having her on the team, and especially because a lot of seniors are graduating, she\u2019s going to be a huge part of the team.\u201d\n\nRoark Payne, a junior business major, said \u201cit\u2019s always good to have someone that is strong in your corner and your team.\u201d\n\nAnd while USC\u2019s status is mainly known as a football school, students are confident that these two recruits can change the culture of USC basketball and bring the Trojans to the top of the college basketball world.\n\n\u201cThese two freshmen coming in is just going to transform the basketball program,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe\u2019re known as a football school. But I definitely think that this is the turn... I feel like [Collier and Watkins] will also draw in a lot of others. So I feel like it\u2019s definitely a turn in the right direction.\u201d```"}

New Genesis is an audio series about the Black woman reporter and executive experience. On today\u2019s episode, we have a special guest, the Executive Vice President of Communications for Fox Sports, Terri Hines. Thank you so much, Terri, for joining me today. My first question for you is where did it all begin? When did the inspiration of becoming a sports media executive first come to light? And did you aspire to have a career in sports as a child or young athlete?\n\nHINES: Well, I always say your progression in and at least your progression in your career is not always a straight line, right? So I don\u2019t know that early in my career, I set out to say, \u201cI want to be the first Black sports executive head of communications for a sports television network.\u201d I don\u2019t know that that was my primary goal when I was younger or coming out of college. I\u2019m going to take your second question, though, to ask about being an athlete. So I was a young athlete, I ran track growing up. And in my family, I\u2019m the oldest of three, and in my family growing up as a requirement, you had to pick a sport and you had to pick an instrument. And I ran track just up until college. But my favorite brand of all time as an athlete was Nike. Having the opportunity to work for Nike after having worn their product on my feet and apparel clothing that I wore running as an athlete, it was the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of an opportunity. Being an athlete definitely gave me a passion for sports.\n\nThank you for sharing that. That\u2019s a beautiful testimony.\n\nHINES: Thank you. My next question for you is surrounding mentors and support. So mentors have a way of enhancing our perspective on life and existence. Chrysa Chin is someone whom you call a mentor. In what ways has Chrysa earned this title and empowered you in your personal and professional career?\n\nHINES: Chrysa Chin is now the Chief Player Engagement Officer for the National Basketball Players Association. I think she kind of took me under her wing as a little sister and I adopted her. I was like, you\u2019re not going to leave me, so here I am. So I kind of adopted her as a big sister. And she has given me so much wonderful advice. I consider her to be a mentor that has kept me on the path, helped me and taught me to remain steadfast in my approach and my belief in the work. Being a yes person is not being the best person for you or your organization. So I pride myself on being that type of leader that gives direct advice. I tell my organization or counsel my organization on what they need to hear, not necessarily what they want to hear. And you can take it or leave it. A lot of that thinking and confidence comes from her coaching and really giving me the confidence to sit in what I know.\n\nIn honor of Women\u2019s History Month. I want to share with you really quickly a recording from a woman who I met at an extended family\u2019s 90th birthday. And she\u2019s dear to you. I want to know what having a woman like your California mom meant to you moving from the East Coast to the West Coast to start a career in entertainment.\n\nHINES: [Laughter] Aww. She\u2019s a gift. She\u2019s definitely was God\u2019s gift to me. I think when I moved here 20 years ago for the first time, without getting too spiritual in this conversation, God knew I needed someone to fill in the gap where, I didn\u2019t have a ton of close friends and I didn\u2019t have a church home at the time. My family unit was not here. I think this was God answering my prayer to let me know that it was going to be okay.\n\nThat\u2019s a wrap for New Genesis. Thank you so much, Terri, for just taking the time to do this and to just create time for me.\n\nHINES: It\u2019s my honor. If I weren\u2019t doing this interview, I have to give back into young women, young people, but especially young women of color. It\u2019s my hope that any tidbit of my experience, maybe a nugget of what I shared, will leave a lasting impact for you and to make you the best Nia Cross ever. That\u2019s part of who I am. And then hopefully, maybe someday someone\u2019s going to want to sit in my shoes and do what I do or do what Chrysa Chin does or Pam Oliver or Joy Taylor. So many women of color whom I respect. Nicole Lynn. There\u2019s so many women of color in sports who I can\u2019t name everybody right now, but those are a sampling of women that I admire in this business of sports. And hopefully someone will aspire to walk in our shoes. I know somebody will.\n\nSo stay tuned in for more of New Genesis. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nia Cross.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Tatiana Sataua and Sana Mahmud\nMarch 29, 2023 at 6:09 pm PDT\n\nWith the continuous bouts of unlikely California weather, many USC students are facing challenges staying motivated and productive, raising concerns regarding the weather\u2019s impact on student\u2019s mental health.\n\n\u201cI definitely get less productive because I don\u2019t have the same motivation to go outside and start my day,\u201d said Peyton Lamartina, a freshman studying business and cinematic arts. \u201cI just want to stay in bed and watch TikTok all day.\u201d\n\nDr. Kelly Greco, a psychologist and clinical associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Keck School of Medicine of USC, shared her professional insight on the symptoms students may battle with and ways they can overcome the rainy days blues.\n\nSeasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that occurs in \u201careas where the weather is quite intense,\u201d Greco said. However, Greco believes residents and students in Southern California may be affected similarly by the recent rain.\n\n\u201cThis is the most rain we\u2019ve had in a long time and people aren\u2019t used to it and need to make different decisions or it could cause more stress in their daily life,\u201d Greco said.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, seasonal affective disorder can impact how someone \u201cthinks, feels, and handle daily activities.\u201d The symptoms include a loss of interest in activities, fatigue, insomnia, low energy, having difficulty concentrating and feelings of depression.\n\nMJ Wee, a freshman studying communications, said she struggles to accomplish daily tasks when it rains.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t go outside and I don\u2019t do work,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Greco recommends students focus on the things they have control over instead of focusing on circumstances like weather that are out of their hands. Looking and planning ahead, Greco added, is crucial to ensure daily tasks are not interrupted.\n\n\u201cIf someone knows it\u2019s going to rain tomorrow and they plan on a different type of transportation or how that\u2019s going to impact my day tomorrow and they make different decisions, that\u2019s going to create less stress for them,\u201d Greco said.\n\nMindset is as important as preparation. Dr. Greco shared a strategy she teaches called \u201cCatch Challenge and Change,\u201d where students \u201ccatch negative self-talk\u201d before it fosters into thoughts that lead to \u201cour feelings and behaviors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just thinking automatically: This is stressful, my life, my day is going to be difficult, then that may play a role. Because our thoughts, feelings and behaviors are all interrelated,\u201d Greco said.\n\nGreco emphasized the mental health services available on campus as the semester comes to an end and encourages students to reach out to USC Student Health.\n\n\u201cJust touching base with someone can help change how we are managing our stress and increase the quality of our life,\u201d Greco said.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of TikTok)\n\nBy Isa Johnson and Sabrina Rubio\nMarch 29, 2023 at 6:09 pm PDT\n\nLast Thursday, March 23, a congressional hearing was held due to U.S. privacy concerns over TikTok. The app\u2019s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, testified in court and notably stated that TikTok would not cut ties with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, as the Biden administration demanded, with threats of a ban if the app\u2019s owners did not comply.\n\nCongressional concerns stem from China\u2019s laws that would require ByteDance to hand over user-data to the Chinese government if requested, and allow for control over what U.S. users see on the app. However, the proposed bill could change the way we use the Internet forever; Giving the government control over more than just the social media app TikTok, the RESTRICT Act also includes technologies such as routers, home cameras, and VPNs that are produced by any foreign adversaries.\n\nAnyone who uses a VPN to access banned apps or websites could face up to $1 million in fines and/or up to 20 years in prison. During the trial, when asked about how Tiktok planned to protect American safety, Zi Chew outlined the ways that TikTok plans to move forward to create a safer environment for users and their data.\n\nZI CHEW: There are more than 150 million Americans who love our platform and we know we have a responsibility to protect them, which is why I\u2019m making the following commitments to you and to all our users. Number one, we will keep safety, particularly for teenagers, as a top priority for us. Number two, we will firewall protect the U.S. data from unwanted foreign access. Number three, TikTok will remain a place for free expression and will not be manipulated by any government.\n\nThe ADA is not here in American soil. He has made it abundantly clear that TikTok is a space created for people to share their passions on a public platform. TikTok also has aided in the growth and success of small businesses.\n\nWhen asked about Byte Dance, Zi Chew ensured Byte Dance was a private company and not controlled by the Chinese government. He also stated that the TikTok headquarters are based in the United States. He also explains that TikTok has strong security credentials necessary for all users in order to keep American data from foreign lands.\n\nOther nations, like India have already banned the platform around the middle of 2020 when the government investigated fifty-nine Chinese-owned apps, resulting in data leaks to servers outside of the nation\n\nThe bill which would grant the president power to ban TikTok was voted to move forward and now the conversation heads to House Republicans. For many, TikTok is a space where people have the freedom to express themselves in a new, creative fashion. It has become a space for influencers, companies, brands, activists, and many others to find a community.\n\nThe Deterring America\u2019s Technological Adversaries, or DATA, Act, would no longer grant protections for such creative content, specifically targeting platforms such as TikTok.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Isa Johnson.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/29/population-bomb-could-be-less-damaging-then-predicted-new-study-suggest/", "response": "```\nThe \u201cPopulation Bomb\u201d could be less damaging than predicted, a new study suggests\n\nA new study done by the Earth4All collective and commissioned by the Club of Rome projects that the \u201cpopulation bomb\u201d our world was projected to face will not be as harmful as experts originally thought.\n\nBy Lorenzo Arce, Chris Bibona, and Ethan Galbraith\nMarch 29, 2023 at 6:04 pm PDT\n\nA recent study estimates the global population will hit a peak of 8.8 billion around the middle of this century, before rapidly declining soon after. Prior studies predicted the \u201cpopulation bomb\u201d to go off later with a higher worldwide population, coupled with more catastrophic results. Despite the optimistic outcome of this study, it is only feasible if global societal changes are made soon.\n\nProfessor Dowell Myers of the Price School of Public Policy agrees with much of the study except for one part: \u201cThe bomb did go off. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not going to go off. It did go off.\u201d He, however, believes this is a good thing. \u201cI think it\u2019s a positive trend finding that the population trajectory is starting to level off. Is is good news, even though it does give us extra social problems.\u201d\n\nThe study conducted by the intellectual non-profit, Club of Rome, found raising average education and income levels globally have the potential to keep the population bomb\u2019s fallout at a minimum. Higher education levels of a society, especially of women, are often correlated with lower birth rates due to more employed women in the workforce. However, this can prove to be an issue with aging societies such as those of China and Japan and can lead to shortages of able-bodied people to repopulate society.\n\n\u201cThe economy can survive with fewer workers now because of automation. So that the population growth is slowing, that won\u2019t hurt the economy as much. The thing is, in a capitalist system, it all works on consumption and the economy is driven by people at the base of the pyramid consuming a lot of goods and they consume. That goes into profits. And businesses and businesses then hire more workers. But it all works off of consumption. If you don\u2019t have as many people, you\u2019ve got less consumption.\u201d\n\nAlso: \u201cThe big thing is we have a generational mismatch. We have an older generation that expects to be supported and we don\u2019t have as many younger people.\u201d\n\nEven though the issue seems to be working itself out, our planet\u2019s health is still in jeopardy. \u201cThe climate change issue is still very much alive. It doesn\u2019t change that in the prospects of that in the next three decades. That\u2019s still with us.\u201d\n\nTo insure a less than dramatic population drop in the following decades, all hands must be willing to be on deck. \u201cThe environmental problems are not contained within any country\u2019s borders. That\u2019s the problem with you can\u2019t get agreement across borders and it\u2019s a global atmosphere. We have to get everybody on board. We can\u2019t have a, you know, Brazil chopping down the rainforest, for example. It\u2019s inside their borders and it affects their economy. But the atmospheric changes, the climate changes are totally interconnected around the globe. That\u2019s the challenge for us.\u201d\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Lorenzo Arce.\n```"}

The new policy guarantees admission to one of three UC colleges, if they are not accepted. These universities include UC Merced, UC Riverside, and UC Santa Cruz. In order to qualify Applicants must complete specific coursework and maintain a certain GPA.\n\nMichele Siqueiros, the president of The Campaign for College Opportunity, was critical of the changes on behalf of the University of Southern California. She believes that the UC System has much work to do to change how transfer students are admitted into the network of universities.\n\nSiqueiros:  Well, I think it\u2019s important that the University of California is figuring out a better way to improve the transfer pathway for students. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s being demanded by the governor and the legislature. Unfortunately, I think that it is not enough.\n\nShe went on to explain how the new policy impacts students. Her main concern is that applicants will have too many choices to choose from. It may have the tendency to further complicate the college application process; even though it\u2019s intention was to simplify it.\n\nSiqueiros:  And I think our concern is that if you layer on another pathway, right, that essentially you\u2019re providing a long list of menu options for community college students to try and figure out. We should make it as simple as possible.\n\nLater, Siqueiros argued for a different policy. Her policy simplified the terms and conditions for guaranteed transfer admissions, and also wants to extend it to beyond three individual campuses. She believes that streamlining the process will be better not just for the universities, but for students as well.\n\nSiqueiros:  Hey, you need to do A, B, and C, and if you do those things and get these particular grades, you will have a spot at the University of California. So that\u2019s important. I think that that guaranteed needs to extend across the University of California, not just to three particular campuses\n\nThe new proposal would not require campuses to accept students that they do not have room for, but nonetheless, schools like UCLA and UC San Diego may experience a new influx of applications now that this policy is enacted.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Zain Khan.\n```"}

In the college application process, Rios knew USC had everything she was looking for.\n\n\u201cEven a couple days later, I cannot believe that I got in, I\u2019ve been smiling the whole time every time somebody brings it up,\u201d Rios said. \u201cWe have USC stuff all over our house, so whenever I see it \u2014 I just think \u2014 that\u2019s going to be my next four years.\u201d\n\nOn March 24, admission letters went out to the record-high 80,790 applications. USC sent acceptance letters to 9,277 students, yielding a record low 9.9% fall admission rate.\n\nTimothy Brunold, USC dean of admissions, told Annenberg Media the unprecedented applicant pool was reviewed \u201cholistically,\u201d weighing both academic and personal qualities.\n\n\u201cIt tells us that USC is popular. Students and families are interested in what we have to offer,\u201d Brunold said. \u201cWhen we see a lot of applications, we\u2019re excited for the university. But also we know that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d\n\nThe new Trojans come from around the world, representing diverse backgrounds, pristine academic records and compelling personal qualities. Of those admitted, 23% will be the first in their family to attend college \u2014 the highest rate ever recorded at USC. Legacy students make up 12% of the admitted class. A third of students identify with a historically underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Californians make up 38% of the new class, followed by New York, Texas, Illinois, Washington and New Jersey as the most represented states. 19% are international students from 87 different countries.\n\n\u201cWe see so many students with great ideas and students who are really motivated to solve the world\u2019s problems, to make the world a better place, and they bring a lot of that optimism into our university,\u201d Brunold said.\n\nWaverly Bagley, 18, from Scottsdale, Arizona was \u201cshocked\u201d to see her acceptance into the USC Iovine and Young Academy. Her brother goes to Notre Dame, but Bagley fell in line with her grandfather, a proud USC graduate.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even read it out loud. I will be very blatantly honest \u2014 I was crying all day,\u201d Bagley said. \u201cI drove to my grandpa\u2019s house because he actually lives like a half mile away from me, and I let him know and he was really excited. There\u2019s only one thing holding Bagley back from coming to USC \u2014 money.\n\n\u201cWe have done a lot of emailing and phone calls with people at USC to try to figure something out. But we\u2019re kind of being ignored and pushed to the side right now,\u201d Bagley said. Right now, Bagley is scrambling to find scholarships to make the numbers work. Still, a chance remains that she won\u2019t be able to attend her \u201cdream school.\u201d\n\nUSC has hiked tuition by 10% in the past two years, racking up a yearly price tag of $90,921. Financial aid is keeping up with high prices, Brunold said, but acknowledged the cost is a \u201cchallenge\u201d for some prospective students.\n\n\u201cWe will admit students regardless of whether they need financial aid or not,\u201d Brunold said. \u201cThe sticker price is quite high, it is certainly not the highest [compared] to competitor institutions, but it\u2019s something that we talk to prospective students a great deal about and I do know it\u2019s often the deciding factor.\u201d\n\n3.9 was the average GPA for the class of 2027. 41% of students earned perfect grades in high school. Good grades though weren\u2019t enough to stand out, more than 71,000 students opened up rejection letters, including Chloe Webber, 17, from Sherwood, Oregon.\n\n\u201cI had been wearing my USC shirt all day because I was just waiting,\u201d Weber said. \u201cI opened it and I was like \u2014 oh \u2014 and I went downstairs, told my mom, \u2018I\u2019m gonna have to leave for work, but I got rejected.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs Weber waits to hear from other colleges, she said rejection means redirection.\n\nI learned [to not] put all your eggs in one basket, explore your options even before it\u2019s too late and don\u2019t only look forward to one outcome,\u201d Webber said.\n\nThis admission cycle was the first year with early action admission, a program that Brunold said the university will continue to offer.\n\n\u201cMore students have committed to enroll at USC at this point in time than at this point in time last year,\u201d Brunold said.\n\nThe class of 2027 stands out as \u201cimpressive and diverse,\u201d Brunold said, and feels hopeful about what the newest Trojans will accomplish.\n\n\u201cAs the University continues to rise in popularity, we continue to attract the best and the brightest students by any measure,\u201d Brunold said. \u201cThey worked through this the best that they could, so we really do feel they are the best prepared and the most impressive class we\u2019ve seen yet.\u201d```"}

Between March 7-11, the Anaheim Convention Center was abuzz with tens of thousands of attendees from all sides of the natural product world. Industry giants to brand new startups clamor to exhibit their latest and most popular products to retailers, distributors, manufacturers and the press. As a vegan content creator, I attended the event searching for the most exciting plant-based products. This meant trying many free samples and talking with natural product industry leaders. Here is a list of the top five vegan products at Expo West 2023.\n\n1. Konscious Foods Sushi\nThis Canada-based company dished out plant-based onigiri and California rolls filled with both faux fish and veggies. The sushi company has yet to launch in the United States, but keep your eyes peeled for these vacuum-sealed sushi rolls.\n\n2. Canned Chamberlain Coffee\nSocial media star Emma Chamberlain\u2019s coffee company has already captured the hearts of caffeine-obsessed Gen Z, but these new canned lattes will bring the obsession to the next level. Can we request they carry these in Seeds next year?\n\n3. Oatly Oat Whip\nWhen Oatly launched in the U.S. in 2016, no one had ever heard of oat milk, but eight years later, their products dominated the plant milk category. The company has since expanded into yogurt, ice cream and whipped cream. There is no sign of when this product is coming to market, but I am hoping it catches on in Los Angeles coffee shops so I can level up my hot chocolate order.\n\n4. Avafina\u2019s Chiaviar\nChia pudding, step aside; Avafina Organic\u2019s Chiaviar is here! This chia, seaweed and lemon blend makes a spread reminiscent of caviar. This product has not hit most store shelves, but the ingredients are straightforward, so this may be an excellent DIY in your kitchen.\n\n5. Elmhurst Sour Cream\nElmhurst is a dairy-turned-plant milk company known for its no-nonsense range of shelf-stable gum-free milk. They debuted their latest product: a shelf-stable vegan sour cream. Several other vegan sour creams are on the market, but the squeezy packaging sets Elmhurst apart.\n\nThe constraints of veganism demand innovation, and these companies are doing the work. Though my day-to-day diet consists mostly of veggies, grains and beans, these alternative products can mix things up for longtime vegans and entice those who are curious about the plant-based lifestyle.\n```"}

Expand USC Chess Club Media Chair Brandon Ho, rated in the mid-1900s by the US Chess Federation, poses in front of a chess board. (Photo courtesy of Brandon Ho)  By   Chris Bibona March 29, 2023 at  3:50 pm PDT \n \n \nHis opening moves might make you think twice, but as the game progresses and his tactics turn into a winning position, you will learn to never second guess Brandon Ho. His style is bold and borderline cocky, but he\u2019s good enough to get away with it. Ranked in the 95th percentile of chess players nationally, Ho is in elite company \u2014 especially for his age. He has garnered respect from just about all those around him, and the consensus is that the junior neuroscience major can take chess as far as he pleases. \n\n\u201cIf he wanted to devote himself to chess, and if he wanted to become a professional chess player, the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d USC professor and chess International Master Jack Peters said. \u201cHe\u2019s got whatever talent you\u2019d need to make it.\u201d \n\nLong before he battled against some of the most distinguished talent in collegiate chess, Ho traced his roots to the sport back to his early childhood. Ho recalled a time when he, his younger brother Stephen and his father Michael participated in chess tournaments together. The trio even got to meet Grandmaster and World Champion Magnus Carlsen along the way. \n\n\u201cThat was really a family bonding experience where all three of us would just go and play in the same chess tournaments,\u201d Ho said. \u201cWe would be able to see how each other did and it was a way of bouncing ideas off of one another.\u201d \n\n(Left to right) Brandon Ho, his younger brother Stephen and their dad Michael pose with Grandmaster and World Champion Magnus Carlsen at a chess tournament in 2012. (Photo courtesy of Brandon Ho)  \n\nHo continued to play chess competitively throughout middle school and high school, eventually leading him to the collegiate chess scene. Like all USC students in fall of 2020, Ho was forced to work remotely his freshman year due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 but little did he know that media buzz surrounding chess would explode during and after the events of the quarantine. \n\n\u201cWhen I first went to Chess Club, it was a lot more packed than I expected it to be after shows like \u2018The Queen\u2019s Gambit\u2019 came out,\u201d Ho said. \u201cI think there was a lot more interest in chess during quarantine. So our first meeting, I think we had like 70 to 80 people. We filled up three classrooms.\u201d \n\nAccording to the  Michigan Journal of Economics , the world\u2019s most popular chess server  Chess.com  saw a monthly increase of 2.8 million members following the release of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit.\u201d Additionally, the sale of chess sets increased as much as 1100% among the most notable retailers in the two months following the release of the show. \n\nBut as many who rode the chess wave know, becoming a chess prodigy like the show\u2019s protagonist is not easy by any stretch of the imagination. That is what makes the skill of a player like Ho so impressive, being able to labor through hours of studying and practice, then combining that with the critical thinking skills required to reach an  Elo rating  in the mid-1900s. \n\n\u201cA lot of [my practice] has been mostly just playing online, playing a lot of blitz games,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIn the past, I used to do puzzles, learn different chess tactics and memorize openings. But I guess nowadays, I rely more on my experience.\u201d \n\nA game of chess can be broken into three parts, the beginning, middle and endgame. At the start, opening moves are usually played \u201cby the book,\u201d where players memorize the specific moves that fulfill the targeted opening concept. \n\n\u201cA lot of moves become second nature,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt\u2019s just automatic, especially during blitz games where you have to move almost immediately. In a lot of our games at higher levels, it\u2019s a lot of positional play. The tactics involved in order to win actual material may involve four to five moves in advance.\u201d \n\nHo\u2019s play is distinguished in a special way, both by his unique play style and obscure choice in openings. His audacious maneuvers have made Ho somewhat of a legend around his peers. \n\n\u201cHe has this opening, B4, or pawn to B4,\u201d USC Chess Club president Quenton Blache said. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Polish opening, also known as the Orangutan. What\u2019s great about it is that, weirdly, it\u2019s supposed to be bad, but usually there\u2019s no clear way of combating it. I think it\u2019s a really genius way of playing.\u201d \n\nRated in the 1700s himself, Blache spoke highly of Ho, even to the point of saying he might eventually succeed him as Chess Club president. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about the way he plays that\u2019s very slick,\u201d Blache said. \u201cWe always have a really good game when we play. I\u2019m happy to have him as the media chair, and I could definitely see him being president in the future.\u201d \n\nAs much of a positive reputation he has in his inner circle, Ho\u2019s abilities are recognized well beyond Chess Club. USC professor and chess International Master Jack Peters detailed a time when Ho\u2019s signature opening got the best of the veteran not once, but twice. \n\n\u201cHe was in my class, and they play a game against me for the midterm and final exam,\u201d Peters said. \u201cHe won both games. It doesn\u2019t happen too often. I don\u2019t really mind losing to my students, but I\u2019d have to say I was annoyed by both these games because he played an opening which I think is very bad. I was not annoyed with him as much as I was annoyed with myself.\u201d \n\nWith all of the high praise Ho receives, he remains driven with a specific goal in mind. \n\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019ve always wanted to become a title player. So like a national master, which requires a 2200 USCF rating. So at the moment, I\u2019m around like 1950. But although I\u2019m not able to play in as many tournaments as I used to, I hope I can do that,\u201d Ho said.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Wendi Lu March 29, 2023 at 3:46 pm PDT\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s football practice, the team has started to come together with an impressive recruiting class of 11 transfers and 10 early-enrollee freshmen joining the team. Ten more freshmen will round out the roster in the summer to complete USC\u2019s 2023 signing class. USC will welcome back the entire coaching staff for 2023. As a 15-year NFL coaching veteran, Greg Brown is joining the staff as a senior defensive analyst.\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley talked about Brown\u2019s value to him and the team. \u201cAll coaches, it\u2019s just like we are with our kids, like the linebacker coach is always going to see it through the eyes of a linebacker,\u201d Riley said. \u201cSo, to have a guy that\u2019s not tied to any of those that can just really sit there day-to-day, they can just look at the overall perspective of it and offer up great ideas. It\u2019s been valuable.\u201d\n\nLast season, Trojan tight ends combined to catch 17 passes in 14 games. As usual, USC has a smaller group in the tight-end room. The tight end depth in practice is not looking brighter than last year, especially with redshirt senior Jude Wolfe out with an injury. Freshman tight end Kade Eldridge, who made the 2023 PrepStar All-Western Region, has yet to make an appearance in practice and will be joining later this spring.\n\n\u201cRight now? Today? Not good,\u201d Riley laughed when asked about the tight end depth at practice. \u201cObviously, not having Jude right now, it\u2019s tough for us. We\u2019ll be excited to get him back in the fold and we\u2019ll get Kade over here as well. So it\u2019s going to be good. It\u2019s just currently not very good.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Riley is impressed by USC\u2019s running backs so far. Sophomore running back Raleek Brown should be a key contributor this season after Travis Dye moved on to the pros. Coaches have been moving him to different positions to see how much more he can put on his plate. Junior quarterback Caleb Williams also sees how talented Brown is as a player.\n\n\u201cHe played running back for a year and a lot of times in high school he wasn\u2019t running the routes he runs now,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo we\u2019re working on it. But he has a natural talent for it. And like I said, it\u2019s just a lot of small things, certain steps, when to lean, when to not lead, when to break down.\u201d\n\nHaving seen action across the entire offensive line, redshirt senior Justin Dedich is returning as a tenured veteran. He has seen many players come and go including offensive linemen Andrew Vorhees and Brett Neilon, who are off to the NFL and will need to have their shoes filled by younger and less experienced players. Spring practice is offering the unit an opportunity to gel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we have spring ball getting to know each other, getting to know how each other works. Little minor details that we\u2019re working on right now.\u201d Dedich said, responding to how the offensive lines were reshaped from last year.\n\nDedich also believes Arizona transfer Kyon Barrs, who will be joining the defensive line as a redshirt senior with one year of eligibility remaining, can help the unit with the experience he brings to the table.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an elite player, and it\u2019s definitely making me a lot better as a player every day,\u201d Dedich said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool because we grew up in the same valley. He\u2019s from Murrieta, I\u2019m from Temecula, so I played him when he was a young buck and so that\u2019s kind of a cool little transition.\u201d\n\nChampionships are won at practice \u2014 Riley is dedicated to make sure everything runs smoothly to reverse last year\u2019s mistakes. Riley is personally invested in the team and spoke on his Trojan pride.\n\n\u201cWhen you come and get really invested in a place, you\u2019re a part of all of it. And so you take it personally when it hasn\u2019t gone right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a part of our history. We are all Trojans; this is where we want to be,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we want to own all parts of it, the good and the bad. We want to make sure this part that we\u2019re here for hopefully is as good as it possibly can be.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans are at their halfway point at the seventh practice. At the spring game on April 15, the team will look to bring its A-game and show the fans its potential.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Cierra Morgan, Chuck White, Jinge Li, Maddy Brown and Nicole Bednar\nMarch 28, 2023 at 8:29 pm PDT\n\nThe Service Employees International Union (SEIU) reached a tentative labor contract on Friday, March 24, with the Los Angeles Unified School District following the district\u2019s employee and supportive staff three-day strike over compensation rates with the school board. Approximately 30,000 SEIU Local 99 members will vote April 3-7 on the proposed labor contract, which included a 30% wage increase demanded by the union for its workers, retroactive payments, bonus payments and increased health benefits.\n\nThe 30% wage increase will bring the LAUSD minimum wage to $22.52 an hour, increasing the average salary of union members from $25,000 a year to $33,000 a year according to SEIU. The strike is the first major labor disruption for the district since 2019.\n\nThe strike began on Tuesday morning, after LAUSD broke the confidentiality code by sharing part of negotiations agreement with L.A. Times, according to City News Service. With hundreds of campuses closed, over 400,000 students were left without classes.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another example of the school district\u2019s continued disrespect of school workers,\u201d said Max Arias, the executive director of SEIU Local 99. \u201cWe are ready to strike.\u201d\n\nService employees and teachers began picketing at 4:30 a.m. at the Van Nuys Bus Yard until 1 p.m. at the LAUSD headquarters in L.A. The strike continued on Wednesday at 4:30 a.m. at the Gardena Bus Yard, followed by another rally at 11 a.m. at the LAUSD Local District offices in Los Angeles. On Thursday, the strike concluded with another 11 a.m. rally at a LAUSD Local District office.\n\nAlthough the strike had been planned by the union for weeks, its arrival still surprised and greatly affected many parents and district employees. Jennie Martinez is both a parent of an LAUSD student and a specialized education assistant in the district. She participated in the strike last week, and says despite the struggle she faces as a parent she still has faith in the school.\n\n\u201cI have to rearrange all my life, somebody to see who [is] willing to take care of my child [and] pay for childcare for those three days,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHopefully in the long run it will get better. I want to keep furthering my career in LAUSD. I want to become a teacher eventually.\u201d\n\nAnother LAUSD parent, Joyce Brown, agreed with the rest of the parents and workers. \u201cIt affected my family because unfortunately I didn\u2019t have anyone to watch my children while the school was on strike,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHowever, at the same time, due to the reason that they\u2019re on strike, I was supporting their cause.\u201d\n\nMayor Karen Bass\u2019s office released a statement after the tentative labor contract: \u201cI want to thank SEIU Local 99 Executive Director Max Arias and Superintendent Alberto Carvalho for working together with me to put our families first,\u201d Bass said. \u201cAs mayor, I have no formal authority over our schools, but that will never stop me when it comes to fighting for our children and their families.\u201d\n\nThe tentative labor contract resolves long standing issues of the LAUSD workers. United Teachers Los Angeles, which represents another 30,000 LAUSD educators, wants to use the recent SEIU contract as precedent in hopes to provide a 20% increase in wages for its members, City News Service reported.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/28/sos-szas-album-and-its-connections-to-princess-diana/", "response": "```\n\u2018SOS\u2019: SZA\u2019s album and its connections to Princess Diana\n\nBy Sana Mahmud March 28, 2023 at 8:05 pm PDT\n\nR&B artist SZA closed her \u201cSOS\u201d tour in Los Angeles last week, celebrating her sophomore album of the same name. In an unshielded and raw portrayal of her soul, SZA seems to tell the story of the late Princess Diana through more than simply the cover art.\n\nOnce the album was released in December, fans quickly found similarities between the cover and the infamous photo taken of Princess Diana during her Italian trip in 1997. The photograph portrays Princess Diana at the edge of a diving board, alone, suspended above the depths of the vast ocean. It has come to symbolize the loneliness, pain and tragedy that surrounded the end of the princess\u2019s life.\n\nSZA on Princess Diana inspiring her \u2018SOS\u2019 album cover: \u201cI just loved how isolated she felt and that\u2019s what I wanted to convey the most.\u201d (via Hot 97)\n\nSZA later confirmed in an interview with Hot 97 that for the cover\u2019s original concept, she referenced the photo and in the end, chose to completely copy it. \u201cI just loved how isolated she felt, and that was what I wanted to convey the most,\u201d she said.\n\nThe cover art is not where the similarities to Princess Diana end. The somber paparazzi picture could have been the cover of any single or album SZA released, but its usage for \u201cSOS\u201d is incredibly thoughtful and purposeful. The cry for help associated with Save Our Souls ties many of Princess Diana\u2019s struggles to the album title, the stories each song tells, and the project\u2019s overall meaning and theme.\n\n\u201cI feel like the general theme is I am pissed,\u201d SZA shared with Hot 97. Every song within \u201cSOS\u201d is raw and unapologetically emotional. She opens herself to the world more than ever before. Compared to her debut album, \u201cCtrl,\u201d SZA now is reflecting on her pain and allowing herself to feel her hurt more deeply and honestly.\n\nLike Princess Diana, SZA has been subjected to feeling her love and heartbreak under the eyes of the world. This sadness and heartbreak that SZA expresses in songs like \u201cNotice Me\u201d is accompanied by her admission to insecurities, body image issues, being cheated on and the struggle of seeing a past partner move on.\n\nPrincess Diana was no stranger to these trials. As a member of the royal family, the extremely public breakdown of her marriage and the cheating scandals that surrounded her relationship left Diana exposed to an incomprehensible amount of ruthless scrutiny, humiliation and pain, which was all captured by the lenses of paparazzi and shared with the world.\n\nIn \u201cSpecial,\u201d SZA shares insecurities and pains similar to Diana\u2019s: \u201cI got pimples where my beauty marks should be / I got dry skin on my elbow and knees.\u201d In several songs, SZA vulnerably shares how a negative relationship impacted the person she became. In \u201cFar,\u201d she says she doesn\u2019t \u201crecognize\u201d herself due to allowing someone else to drastically change who she was.\n\nPrincess Diana shared her own feelings of suffocation and assimilation she was forced to endure when she married into the royal family. In \u201cUsed,\u201d SZA says she is \u201cused to being used like this.\u201d This overwhelming feeling of being exploited for someone else\u2019s gain, losing yourself and your sanity is something that both women have shared that they have experienced.\n\n\u201cSOS\u201d depicts every stage of grief one feels after a bad breakup or being cheated on. SZA portrays the extent of female rage directly in \u201cKill Bill,\u201d feelings Princess Diana could have very likely felt after being cheated on. In \u201cForgiveless,\u201d she says \u201cI might forgive it, I won\u2019t forget it.\u201d\n\nSZA then goes on to reclaim her power in songs such as \u201cConceited\u201d and \u201cSOS.\u201d In almost a scream, SZA says \u201cI just want what\u2019s mine\u201d at the end of \u201cSOS,\u201d a song that can be seen as a shift one has when the anger and pain subside and they are ready to take back their life.\n\nIn moments like when she wore her iconic \u201crevenge dress,\u201d it was clear that despite the pain she was feeling, Princess Diana was gaining back her sense of self and happiness after the divorce.

(Creative Commons license via Flickr/Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine)\n\nBy Kaitlin Becenti, Weiwei Huang, and Melisa Cabello Cuahutle\nMarch 28, 2023 at 7:22 pm PDT\n\nSingle-rider Lyfts will not be returning to USC students\u2019 phones anytime soon, USC President Carol Folt said in an interview. The free Lyft program, known to students as \u201cfryft,\u201d started in 2016 as a way to provide students with free Lyft rides in the nearby areas to the USC campus. Originally, those free rides were provided via Lyft\u2019s shared-ride program, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, USC started providing free single rides. This program provided users with the opportunity to use Lyft to get rides around campus for free between 6 p.m. and 2 p.m. most nights and students became accustomed to the program.\n\nHowever, in January 2023, USC announced the decision of reversing the program to a shared-ride mode. USC students have expressed concerns as the switch to shared rides brought long waits for a Lyft, with some students saying the shared-Lyft model also brought safety concerns, such as women having to ride cars with strangers or students having to walk home or to class at night. Other students have also proposed solutions, but the administration has been determined to not restore the single-ride mode.\n\nStudents\u2019 fume reached a peak after seeing the raise in the tuition, which is 5% for the 2023-24 school year. \u201cIt\u2019s a really complicated situation right now because inflation is almost double the rate that we even added in tuition,\u201d Folt said. She said that the financial increases are necessary, \u201cbut they don\u2019t even begin to cover the costs that we have.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nico Andrade, a senior majoring in civil engineering, didn\u2019t find the reason acceptable. \u201cThe whole point of Fryft is for the safety of students and it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have kids be put in random situations with people they don\u2019t know just for the sake of saving money,\u201d Andrade said.\n\nFolt mentioned in the interview that USC is constantly looking for other ways to get revenue to be aggressively added to the financial pool, \u201cbut right now, that\u2019s how we mostly deal with it, which is that we continue to make our financial aid cover additional costs.\u201d\n\nEver since the university switched back to a shared-ride model, Fryft has been a big topic at USC. USG president-elect and vice president-elect Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu have commented on President Folt\u2019s statement and said they will continue to advocate for a safer model of Fryft, even if it does not look exactly like the version prior to this shared model. Jakatdar and Lu originally ran their campaign with the promise to expand the Lyft service, including a return to a single-ride model.\n\nNikhita Rao, a sophomore majoring in media arts and practice, said that she understood the financial burdens, but with USC\u2019s rising tuition, the educational resources should have been improved. Another sophomore, Amia Roach-Valandra, expressed a similar concern. \u201cI hope they were able to put the saved money into other expenses, for instance, the Native American program, and put that saved money into the different cultural programs here at USC.\u201d\n\nRao and Andrade have both mentioned USC\u2019s football coach Lincoln Riley, who is the second highest-paid college football coach for the 2022 season and bought a mansion for $17 million last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit hypocritical,\u201d Andrade said. Rao agreed. \u201cThe administration is not taking into account our safety. There are things that you can buy that would help a lot of students feel better and safer.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media, Folt mentioned the possibility of assessing the issue going forward, but that they have no current plan to do so for now. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we started. I think we\u2019re sticking with the new model,\u201d Folt said.\n\nUSC also announced a $93 fee per semester for transportation, which is \u201cbeing assessed to offset the rising costs of providing transportation services to the USC community and to provide new benefits,\u201d which USC says it\u2019s meant to \u201coffset the rising costs\u201d related to the Lyft program, as well as a Metro pass for students and a shuttle to LAX, which USC has previously offered, complimentary with tuition.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Annie Bang March 28, 2023 at 6:31 pm PDT\n\nA petition aiming to stop the euthanasia of all USC campus squirrels have recently dominated the social media spheres of students. Garnering over 500 signatures, the petition is a response to a supposed lawsuit after an anonymous student was bitten by a squirrel and sought to have USC euthanize all squirrels to prevent future incidents. An Instagram account posted images of squirrels advocating against the lawsuit\u2019s attempts at euthanasia. However, with squirrels being a known part of campus life, many believe the situation to be an elaborate prank as April Fools\u2019 Day approaches.\n\nCommunication student Tierney Kellish believes the whole thing to be a comical prank but also stated she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were genuine. \u201cI think it could be real because people are just so crazy these days,\u201d Kellish said. \u201cI believe people will do anything to get attention, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were a prank; it could go both ways.\u201d\n\nWhen searched on the Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles\u2019 database, the case number of the lawsuit listed on the Instagram post did not match the database\u2019s information. The case number \u201cBC684392\u2032\u2032 refers to a 2017 trial regarding professional healthcare malpractice.\n\nFilm production major Jackson Van Horn believes the lawsuit and petition are a ruse. \u201cI\u2019m going to say it\u2019s a ploy,\u201d Horn said. \u201cI feel like a lot of the kids here want attention and are willing to put (in) a lot of money and do anything to cause a stir.\u201d\n\nDespite suspecting the incident a hoax, Horn believes many students are negative about the squirrels on campus. \u201cI will say I think the squirrels get a very bad rap at the school,\u201d Horn said. \u201cI recently saw a short documentary made by one of my colleagues about it, and it\u2019s quite interesting the ecosystem they have and how the students interact with them. I think they are an integral part of this campus, and I would hate to see anyone try and get rid of that.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit files posted on the Instagram account state that the plaintiff, a John Doe, is bringing complaints against the university for injuries and damages, including but not limited to \u201cphysical pain and suffering, emotional distress, medical expenses, lost wages and other damages to be proven at trial.\u201d According to the lawsuit, the anonymous plaintiff has requested compensation from USC, but USC has refused this request.\n\nBesides squirrels, other rodents have previously faced scrutiny for their invasive personalities. Most notably, New York\u2019s constant battle to exterminate the city\u2019s rats has resulted in online memes and virality. New York\u2019s Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated in a news conference in October of 2022, \u201cand I want to be clear: The rats are absolutely going to hate this announcement.\u201d \u201cBut the rats don\u2019t run the city. We do.\u201d\n\nAccording to L.A. County\u2019s Department of Public Health, squirrel bites are considered \u201cnot reportable\u201d because they do not spread rabies and are considered the lowest-level threat amongst other animals like bats, raccoons, skunks, local dogs and cats.\n\nFor sophomore Darian Ahmadi, the lawsuit can result from individuals seeking attention in the social climate of virality. \u201cI mean, I support the squirrels. I think they have rights just as any other animal and people think they can be valued as maybe, like, it could be therapeutic for whatever reason,\u201d Ahmadi said. \u201cI just think people are such clout chasers these days, and they\u2019ll do anything for [the] press, and it\u2019s not fair to the squirrels, and I don\u2019t fight for that.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Veronique Louis-Jacques and Jack Waterman\nMarch 28, 2023 at 6:17 pm PDT\n\nA lot has changed since USC President Carol Folt delivered her 2022 State of the University address almost a year ago. We took a look back at what was discussed and the goals set in the 2022 address to see how USC compares today.\n\nFolt spent much of the beginning of her 2022 speech praising the university for the work that was done to better support and represent minorities at USC, coming in the form of two separate initiatives. First was the renaming of the now-known Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs. Formerly known as the Von KleinSmid Center, after known eugenicist and fifth University President Rufus Von KleinSmid, the building was renamed with the goal of \u201chonoring a proud Trojan \u2014 leader and member of the Crow Nation, historian, humanist, musician, war hero and educator \u2014 whose life and name provides a meaningful symbol of USC\u2019s aspirational and life-affirming mission,\u201d Folt said.\n\nWith that being said, the Native American and Indigenous population at USC is small at best. In a report released by the university in 2020, only 25 of the nearly 20,000 undergraduate students identified with one of these groups.\n\nSecond was the addition of the Nisei Rock Garden, a type of dry garden known as kare san sui in Japan, dating back to the 11th century. Following World War II, many Japanese-Americans were placed in internment camps. At USC, Von KleinSmid also had a big role in this chapter of the university by preventing Japanese students from returning to USC after the war ended and also refusing to send their transcripts when the students then tried to transfer their credits. In an effort to \u201cacknowledge this great injustice,\u201d Folt said, they created the garden and awarded \u201cposthumous degrees to all the remaining Nisei Trojans we could locate,\u201d referring to the children of Japanese immigrants.\n\nSwitching gears, Folt focused on mask mandates, hybrid learning and other restrictions, as COVID-19 was more present on campus. Folt boasted about the university\u2019s progress in returning to fully in-person learning as USC was just in the beginning stages of loosening COVID-19 requirements, removing the mask mandate nearly a month before the address. \u201cOf course, the pandemic isn\u2019t over yet, and we must continue to be vigilant and maintain our adherence to the protocols that are helping to keep us safe,\u201d Folt said.\n\nHowever, a year later, COVID-19 does not remain at the forefront of the university\u2019s mind. With Gov. Gavin Newsom ending the COVID-19 state of emergency, most precautionary measures from the year prior \u2014 Trojan Check, the mask mandate and required weekly testing \u2014 have become a thing of the past. COVID-19 positivity rates have remained low, with a current rate of 3.9% for students. Starting in Fall 2023, USC will no longer require the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nMoving away from current students at USC, Folt shifted her address toward incoming Trojans, highlighting the record-breaking admissions cycle. USC has seen a \u201c350% increase in undergraduate applications since 2001,\u201d Folt acknowledged. \u201cWe continue to break records relating to our incoming classes: the highest enrollment in USC history, highest average GPA, [the] highest number of first-gen[eration] students \u2014 to name just a few.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, the university continued on its upward trajectory when it came to admissions. This year\u2019s admission cycle was even more competitive, shattering the records broken in the year prior. The university received 80,790 applications, a 17% increase from last year and breaking the record for the highest volume of first-year applicants made in 2021. In 2023, only 11.5% were accepted, lowering the acceptance rate by 0.5%. This comes up at the same time as USC\u2019s newly-implemented \u201cEarly Action\u201d option for applicants in which students can apply and receive decisions earlier.\n\nIn 2023, the university also accepted the highest percentage of first-generation college students, making up 23% of admitted applicants.\n\nOne of Folt\u2019s main talking points in 2022 was sustainability. \u201cAs an environmental scientist \u2014 I know how interconnected our environment is, and that we must take a comprehensive and integrated approach if we are going to find lasting, scalable solutions,\u201d Folt said. She especially focused on the student\u2019s work in this issue with the \u201c17,000 students enrolled in sustainability-related courses.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and be a waste-free campus by 2028, USC took a big step on July 1, 2022 when it stopped using single-use plastics on campus and at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where USC plays its home football games. This has helped stop millions of plastic bottles and plenty of plastic waste from going into landfills.\n\nTowards the end of her 2022 address, Folt pointed to an \u201coverarching goal\u201d of increasing the \u201cstature and impact of USC.\u201d She emphasizes two main tasks to achieve this goal: \u201cMaking USC the international standard-bearer and innovator for collaborative learning and discovery\u201d and \u201cmaking USC the top choice for students, faculty and staff who seek purpose-driven work and lives.\u201d\n\nWith the opening of a new campus in Washington D.C., the university\u2019s efforts to reach a broader range of students are evident. In a world so recently removed from the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, diversity and inclusivity being more important than ever, and a university at the forefront of higher education, Folt\u2019s 2023 address reinforced many of the same themes addressed in 2022, while also setting new goals for the university\u2019s future.

Folt would repeat throughout the State of University address on March 28. Beyond Folt\u2019s reference to USC alum Ke Huy Quan, Folt used the phrase to talk about the work of Trojans in various university departments, as well as the several plans for the coming 2023-2024.\n\nOne of Folt\u2019s main topics during the address was affordability. In an interview with Annenberg Media following her address, Folt acknowledged the 5% rising tuition costs but said that financial aid adjusts with the rise as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a really complicated situation right now because inflation is almost double the rate that we even added in tuition. So we\u2019re adding services, adding programs, trying to increase it, and yet the value of our own dollar is lower,\u201d Folt said.\n\nFolt also expressed her hopes for increasing financial aid to graduate students and for expanding the affordability initiative, which eliminates tuition for families making less than $80,000 a year. The initiative, which started in 2020, includes incoming first-year students, but it does not include transfer students, despite that most transfer students come from a California community college. Folt said to be looking to include transfer students in the initiative but provided no timeline of when this will happen.\n\nTwo topics that Folt did not discuss in her address were the state of the Lyft program and the relationship between the university and unaffiliated Greek organizations. In an interview with Annenberg Media, Folt said these topics were not at the forefront. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re planning to bring the single-ride back. That\u2019s not how we started. I think we\u2019re sticking with the new model,\u201d Folt said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely expensive.\u201d\n\nThe free Lyft program in surrounding university areas continues to face controversy among the student body since the return to the shared ride model. As for Greek life disaffiliation, Folt gave an analogy to the apartment system. \u201cIn a way, they function like an apartment building now, you know, and so we have restricted access to that apartment building. So in that sense, we need to depend more on students who go to those places to report to us,\u201d Folt said, although she did say the university is still in communication with the groups.\n\nDespite the graduate students and shuttle bus drivers\u2019 recent efforts to unionize, Folt did not detail these events or future engagements in her address, instead saying in an interview, \u201cI believe in people\u2019s choice and we will work with them. These are still our students. They\u2019re still our employees. You know, and I think we have to make this work in a way that is positive,\u201d Folt said. \u201cBut in the end, we want to continue to make sure that we have as few middle people between us, our students and our faculty and our staff as possible.\u201d\n\nSeparately, an important topic in the address was technological innovation, with the university\u2019s continued involvement in the development of AI. On March 9, the university announced a new research center for generative AI and Society to explore the impact of AI on culture, education, media and society, which received $10 million in funding. \u201cThat center came about was to deal sort of in the rapid generative AI. Every single profession, every single school is affected,\u201d Folt said, adding that although $10 million is a lot of money, \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny fraction of what\u2019s going to be affected by it today. But for us, this is the first leap forward and it\u2019ll probably be mostly bringing people together to talk about these issues.\u201d\n\nFolt also emphasized throughout the address the importance of embracing and accommodating students by increasing mental health support and working with students within the next year to craft a plan for a new advising program, although the details of that are yet to be seen.\n```"}

Irene Kim has more on this strange story.\n\nAn Instagram account under the username @savethesquirrelsusc has gained the attention of students claiming that a \u201chighly connected, wealthy student\u201d was allegedly bit by a squirrel two weeks ago, launching a lawsuit that threatens to euthanize all squirrels on USC\u2019s campus. Nuts, right? The account which launched its first post on Sunday gained over a hundred followers in the past few days, sparking controversy on community forums like Reddit and Sidechat.\n\nUSC student CJ Hunter, a junior studying business administration, heard about the incident and was concerned by the extent of the alleged lawsuit.\n\nHUNTER: I think it\u2019s an ineffective solution to an isolated incident. I don\u2019t think that happens to a lot of people. And if you\u2019re approaching a squirrel, you shouldn\u2019t pet them or anything like that. I think they kind of maintain the ecosystem here and like, they\u2019re cute. Like, why would you want to kill all of them?\n\nTo combat the alleged euthanization, the Instagram account started a change.org petition. The petition titled \u201cDon\u2019t Euthanize USC Squirrels\u201d has gained over 350 signatures as of this reporting. The petition\u2019s description states \u201cwe firmly believe that this extreme and cruel action is not justified and must be opposed to protect the innocent animals that call our campus home.\u201d\n\nThe Instagram page now has five posts, all of which urge viewers to \u201csign and share\u201d their petition. The most recent post which was posted earlier today, shares pictures of the apparent documents of the lawsuit, the caption of the post claims \u201cThis morning, we received our request for the lawsuit. We understand the skepticism around such an absurdly cruel act, so we decided it would be best to post it publicly.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is no evidence driving the controversy, in fact when you search the court case number, you\u2019ll find a 2017 mal-practiced court case not at all related to squirrels. However, this story is driving everyone nuts.\n\nKaeley Cooper, a USC freshman studying law, history and culture shares her thoughts on the attacks.\n\nCOOPER: I think it\u2019s a bit excessive. I don\u2019t think we should euthanize all of the squirrels. I feel like they\u2019re fine with us and we\u2019re fine with them. So I feel like we should just like, leave them alone and let them be in their natural habitat.\n\nAnnenberg media has been unable to confirm any of the claims that the Instagram account and change.org petition have made. The petition claims that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of the alleged squirrel attack nor the severity of it. But, there is evidence for another squirrel phenomenon on campus - you\u2019ll hear more about that next.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Irene Kim.\n```"}

Tears were shed. Here are my thoughts on some memorable moments from the Worlds last week and a few possibilities heading into the next season.\n\nIlia Malinin of the U.S. performs during the men's short program in the World Figure Skating Championships in Saitama, north of Tokyo, Thursday, March 23, 2023. (AP Photo/Hiro Komae)\n\nBy Valerie Fang March 28, 2023 at 4:58 pm PDT\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. Last week, the ISU World Figure Skating Championships, the second to last major international competition of this season, took place in Saitama, Japan. Most skaters have polished their programs with all the previous competitions and performed best on the Worlds\u2019 ice. To be honest, there were simply too many memorable moments. But these skates, in particular, stuck out to me, and their scoring and receptions may shed light on where the skaters are headed.\n\nFirst, 4A landed at Worlds  \u2014 Ilia Malinin, the rising figure skating star from the United States, became the first person ever to land a quad axel at the Worlds with an amazing height of 0.84 meters. This jump has a base value of 12.5 and scored a grade of execution (GOE) of 0.36. Although the 4A is recognized as a quad, it is significantly more difficult than all the other jumps in the same category. So I think it is somewhat unfair that it does not have a higher base value. For example, the base value of a quad Lutz is 11.5, which is only one point lower than the quad axel. In the case of Ilia Malinin, his combined score can be surpassed by a triple axle with a nice enough GOE (provided that it is put in the program\u2019s second half and has an increased base value of 8.8 under the 10% bonus rule). Having enough rotations is always the foundation and first step to everything. Still, I hope in the next season, Malinin can refine the execution of this jump (and please fix that landing position) and his artistic expressiveness. Nonetheless, we can let it go for a few days and congratulate the 18-year-old on making this achievement. At least on the technical side, it seems like how far Ilia Malinin pushes himself equals how much the sport of figure skating can evolve.\n\nBut quads are not everything  \u2014 While some figure skaters might not have six different quads under their belt, they can still triumph with their artistry and stability of other jumps. My favorite program from the Worlds is Gladiator, skated by Kevin Aymoz. Aymoz had only one quad-toe loop in the opening of his program, but just as the soundtrack\u2019s title suggested, I think he most vividly embodied the strength and spirit of a fighter. The commentator at CBC Sports and an international caller for multiple Olympic Games, Belinda Noonan, said this program was more like \u201cwhen art and sport collide.\u201d Aymoz could weave his sensibility into his movements and then express it through clean and stable execution. It echoed Hanyu Yuzuru\u2019s famous statement that \u201cartistry is founded upon absolute technical prowess,\u201d at least in figure skating. And more importantly, Aymoz\u2019s performance was able to stir up something in our hearts by the end. During those four minutes, his figure on the rink almost overlapped with the gladiator from the movie \u2014 both facing a fateful fight in their lives while the world is spectating. 168.42 had been his season\u2019s best coming into the free skate, and he needed to beat 184.49 to come on top. He eventually scored a new season-best of 187.41. What could be more touching than witnessing an athlete push their limits and go beyond? This is, for sure, a masterpiece I will go back to from time to time.\n\nWill this be Kaori Sakamoto\u2019s last World title?  \u2014 In a time when most skaters, including the junior women, are pushing for more quad jumps, Sakamoto\u2019s second World title seems to be sending the message that being well-rounded is what eventually carries you to the mountaintop. But we live in turbulent times and more changes are coming to women\u2019s figure skating. This morning, I woke up to the news that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has issued official recommendations that would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions again. A whole other article is required to dissect the total mess, IOC\u2019s hypocrisy and what it means specifically for figure skating, but it is basically set in stone that the Russian girls are coming back, along with their high level of technicality and artistic representation (I, in fact, think Alexandra Trusova is racing Ilia Melinin to become the first skater to land a quintuple jump.). Just thinking back to when the Russian skaters dominated the podium before the ban, I think Sakamoto needs to watch out and make necessary adjustments to her program layout and general scoring strategy. And let\u2019s not rule out the possibility of her joining the quads club since she once stated that she felt the pressure to do quad jumps to keep up with the Russians. The takeaway from the Worlds this year for both the audience and certain skaters is that it is not wise to pile all the chips on the (quad) jumps. Again, we are reminded of the nature of figure skating, which always requires athletes to find the right balance between athleticism and artistry with their limited stamina. \u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Sebastian Lletget is under fire for allegedly cheating on Becky G. This comes just a mere few months after their engagement. And what does Sebastian use to scapegoat his \u201cbad decisions\u201d instead of taking responsibility? Mental health.\n\nMental illness is something that many can relate to. More than one in five adults in the U.S. live with mental illness. And as someone who struggles to come to terms with a number of diagnoses myself, I see people like Sebastian as a setback rather than a stride in normalizing mental health, especially amongst Latine people.\n\nThe work I, along with so many others, do is to start conversations about mental health in the Latine community. In an episode of La Lucha, we discussed how often this topic is taboo and seen as something you deal with rather than receiving treatment. On the podcast, we shared our stories about how we came to terms with asking for help as Latines from traditional families as well as professional treatment.\n\nThis was specifically the sentiment of male guests on the episode as they recounted how Latine men struggle, on top of mental illness, with machismo and the internalized idea that men do not show emotion. The rationale for this generalization of men is to make the male population the \u201ccaretakers\u201d and stronger opposition to the historically harmful image of women who are seen as weak and emotional.\n\nIn Latine communities, this stereotype becomes heightened as men are assigned to labor and women stay home to cook, clean and watch the kids. And although these black-and-white examples of machismo may not be as relevant today, the sentiment of machismo has been passed down through generations all the way down to Sebastian today.\n\nBecause don\u2019t think for a second that Sebastian\u2019s claim to mental health helps destigmatize the issue; more so, it helps maintain the machista stronghold on the relationship he has with Becky G. As someone who struggles with mental illness that inhibits bad decision-making, it\u2019s hard to see a part of my identity being skewed and misconstrued into a tool for men to excuse bad behavior.\n\nSebastian is creating a blueprint, a blueprint for using mental health as a weapon to excuse bad behavior. It will become as used as \u201cshe was asking for it\u201d to turn the blame somewhere other than the person looking back in the mirror.\n\nCaring about mental health is important, but that\u2019s not what Sebastian is doing though he is using it to justify or get out of being reprimanded. Someone who truly struggles with mental illness knows when one of these bad decisions causes a spiral of self-blame in a way where we feel guilty for saying it was your mental illness that triggered the bad decision, but that\u2019s not you. That\u2019s a years-long battle, not a spur-of-the-moment rationalization for bad decisions.\n\nIt will become normal if we don\u2019t begin to call out this behavior. Normal for people in historical positions of power, like Sebastian, to use mental health as a scapegoat not only for bad decisions like cheating but maybe even for worse, like harming women and other marginalized people.\n\nYes, care about mental health, but be very cognizant of the context being used and listen to fellow Latine people talking about it in a positive, affirming and complex way because it is an important conversation... not a weapon.\n```"}

Welcome to Week 4 of \u201cThe Strikeout.\u201d This week, I\u2019ll be previewing second base and shortstop for 2023.\n\nWhen it comes to second base, I see Altuve as being the surefire first choice. He went back to stealing bases last year, and although his sprint speed has decreased in the past couple of years, I still see him being a monster in the other four categories. Especially with the bigger bases this year, I could see him stealing over 12 bases.\n\nI\u2019m a little wary of Jazz Chisholm, as his low batting average and high strikeout rate will come with some up-and-down stretches. At his NFC ADP of 43, I would much rather wait for Andres Gimenez and Tommy Edman 30-40 picks later.\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve\nMarcus Semien\nJazz Chisholm\nOzzie Albies\nAndr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez\nJorge Polanco\nTommy Edman\nKetel Marte\nLuiz Arr\u00e1ez\nJonathan India\n\nWhile I don\u2019t think this player will break out, I see Kolten Wong as an excellent late-round pick that can provide steady production. Wong has been a solid player for years. With the Cardinals and Brewers, he\u2019s provided steady production and decent stolen base numbers. While his sprint speed was the lowest of his career last year, he still managed to steal 17 bases.\n\nWith the new rule change, as well as his historical propensity to run, I see him as a surefire lock for 12 steals with the potential for 20 or more. He also hit a career-high 15 homers last year, which makes sense as his launch angle was the highest of his career. It looks like he\u2019s making a concerted effort to elevate the ball.\n\nThat approach will be needed in his new home park in Seattle, which, according to Baseball Savant, suppresses homers the most of any ballpark in baseball. Even if he\u2019s only giving you 10-to-12 homers, he will bat in one of the more talented lineups in baseball, with ample opportunities for counting stats.\n\nAt his NFC ADP of 270 over the past two weeks, I see him as someone I\u2019m targeting in drafts this week and next.\n\nShortstop is deep, as it has been the past few years. Turner is the consensus No. 1 choice, as he\u2019s become arguably the most reliable player for speed and has developed into quite the power hitter. He will bat lead-off for one of the best lineups in baseball, and I would debate taking him or Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez with the first pick.\n\nTatis is also an interesting case, as he\u2019s projected to be the top shortstop from THE BAT X. He\u2019s only projected to play in 115 games because of his suspension, and I\u2019m wary of his ability to perform at a high level again. I\u2019d rather wait until next year and pay the full price rather than take him at his discounted price of the late first or early second round when I can get full production from someone else, such as Freddie Freeman, Corbin Burnes or Gerrit Cole.\n\nTrea Turner\nCorey Seager\nFernando Tatis Jr.\nBo Bichette\nBobby Witt Jr.\nTim Anderson\nFrancisco Lindor\nXander Bogaerts\nWander Franco\nCarlos Correa\n\nI want to dive into CJ Abrams, who has an ADP of 250 in the NFC over the past two weeks. Abrams is a former top prospect for the Padres, who was traded to the Nationals in the Juan Soto deal. Abrams is a shoo-in to be the Nats starting shortstop and should be able to amass upwards of 500 at-bats.\n\nBecause the Nats severely lack talent, Abrams will have difficulty piling up counting stats. However, he could be a great late pickup for steals. He was in the top 9% in MLB last year in sprint speed. His speed is his best weapon, as told by THE BAT X, who has him projected for 20 steals.\n\nHe\u2019s never going to be above average in power, but his hit tool was always projected to be better than he showed last year during the season. I could see him batting over .265 with 16 steals and 10 home runs. The steals alone make him worth the shot at his ADP, with his prospect pedigree offering some upside down the line.\n\nWith a more solidified starting role, he\u2019s someone I could see returning decent value at a very low cost.\n\nSeeing as Opening Day is Thursday, \u201cThe Strikeout\u201d will now shift to a column focused on waiver-wire pickups, streamer discussions, as well as general updates on how various players are doing. I encourage you to tune in sometime this weekend to see your favorite teams and players in action!\n\nThis is a long time coming for a fantasy baseball nerd like me, who has been preparing for drafts since the last out of the World Series in 2022. \u201cThe Strikeout\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

Coming off a second-place finish at the Juli Inkster at Meadow Club Invitational, the Trojans were hungry for gold and had high hopes going into the PING/ASU Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona. With competition like No. 5 Oregon, No. 6 Mississippi State and No. 8 Texas, it set up to be a difficult three days on the links. But if No. 13 USC could put everything together, then it could finally achieve victory.\n\nUnfortunately for the Trojans, they only placed 10th out of 17, with a total of 883. With 11 top-50 teams in the country at the invitational, USC had a long weekend ahead of them, but after a lot of success in the last three tournaments, this is a disappointment for the Trojans.\n\nThe competition was very even for much of the tournament with each of the teams scoring close to each other. It was so close that USC only made the top 10 by five strokes and was behind the teams tied for eighth \u2014 Michigan State and Oregon State \u2014 by one stroke. It was clear the competitors were all struggling on this course, which will also host the Pac-12 Championship. Only two teams were able to go under par: Northwestern and Arizona State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deceptively tight,\u201d assistant coach Tiffany Joh said. \u201cIt is really well bunkered on this course. We are normally a very good driving team, and that\u2019s what got us this week.\u201d\n\nNo. 11 ASU was one of the favorites on its home course, but the unlikely winner, No. 24 Northwestern, was able to pull off the upset by shooting 18 under par. Wildcat graduate student Kelly Sim also tied for first with a total score of 206.\n\nUSC\u2019s crucial error came in the first round of the tournament. The Trojans started off slow, with their first round being the worst of the three. This round ended with all five women shooting over par for a total of 301. USC was able to catch steam in the later rounds, improving in each of the next two rounds. The second round saw junior Christine Wang shoot even par and three other Trojans shoot one under par. USC finished the second round in 11th place with a score of 292 for the round. It was able to ride its momentum into the third round to overtake Cal and Washington for 10th place, shooting a squad total of 290, the Trojans\u2019 best score of the event.\n\nWhile the outcome was not what the Trojans were wishing for, there were positives to come out of it. All five women shot close to each other, closing within four strokes. Freshman Catherine Park continued to impress, leading the squad for the entirety of the tournament.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s only a freshman, but she\u2019s already putting up really solid results, and I don\u2019t think we have even scratched the surface with her,\u201d Joh said.\n\nWang also had a great showing, especially in the third round, which allowed her to tie Park as the team\u2019s top scorer. In the last tournament, her totals were sporadic and very inconsistent. Wang did not let history repeat itself and kept all her scores within three strokes of each other.\n\nOn the other hand, the usual top players underperformed. Sophomore Cindy Kou, recently coming off the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship, shot seven over in the first round, was only one under par in the third round and finished as the third-highest scorer for the team. Junior Brianna Navarrosa played similarly to Kou. Both shot one under par in the third round and six under par in the second round. Usual top placer sophomore Amari Avery recorded the worst score for USC, never shooting under or equal to par.\n\n\u201cDisappointed in the result, but we learned a lot as a team,\u201d Joh said. \u201cThe takeaway is there are some things we need to tighten up on in the next couple weeks before we play the conference championship there.\u201d\n\nThe quest for a tournament win continues for the Trojans on April 4-6 at the Silverado Showdown, USC\u2019s last invitational of the year, in Napa, California.\n```"}

This year's ceremony was held online and celebrated the work of four journalists from Reuters for \u2018Nightmare in Nigeria.\u2019\n\nBy Brooklyn Blasscyk, Ethan Huang, and Joseph Hyslop March 27, 2023 at 7:04 pm PDT\n\nOn Monday, USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism awarded the Selden Ring Award for Investigative Journalism to the Reuters team behind an explosive four-part series about atrocities committed by the Nigerian military. Published in December last year by the international news agency, the Reuters series titled \u201cNightmare in Nigeria\u201d unveiled the alleged war crimes by the Nigerian military in their conflict with the Islamic insurgent group Boko Haram. These included secret, forced mass abortions, sexual violence, and the killing of children.\n\nThis is Reuters\u2019 first Selden Ring Award. The award itself, which is a partnership with the Ring Foundation, began in 1989 and awards $50,000 to its winning journalists. The award was presented during a webinar hosted by Annenberg this week.\n\nJournalists Paul Carsten, Libby George, Reade Levinson, and David Lewis found documentation that revealed that over 10,000 women and girls had had their pregnancies \u2014 which were often the result of abductions and rape from Boko Haram militants \u2014 forcibly terminated by the Nigerian government without their knowledge or consent following the women\u2019s rescue. Meanwhile, the journalists spoke with more than 40 soldiers and civilians who revealed that they witnessed corpses and the deaths of Nigerian children at the hands of the military.\n\nBoko Haram is an Islamist militant organization based in Nigeria, categorized as a terrorist group by the United States Embassy. The organization has been active in Nigeria and neighboring countries since the early 2000s and was deemed the world\u2019s deadliest terror group during part of the mid-2010s by the Global Terrorism Index.\n\nJulie Marquis, the series\u2019 co-editor, accepted the award on behalf of their team. In an interview with Annenberg Media, she detailed the explosiveness of the story and the ambitions behind their work. \u201cWe wanted everyone to know what was going on in Nigeria, and we didn\u2019t pull any punches on that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sit around thinking, \u2018Oh, we shouldn\u2019t include this because it\u2019s going to repulse or frighten people. We thought the world needed to know precisely what was going on.\u201d\n\nThe story sparked a strong reaction to the piece from the Nigerian government. \u201cWe were accused of trying to undermine the fight against terrorists, of having an agenda that was contrary to that of the Nigerian government. We were accused of bullying and imperialist behavior,\u201d Marquis said.\n\nBut according to Marquis, the obstacles they faced were minor to those of the witnesses who spoke to them. \u201cThe main [obstacle was] the trauma that was suffered by the victims of these atrocities,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir fear, their emotional vulnerability, their physical vulnerability. And I guess my greatest observation ... was my tremendous awe at their bravery, the bravery of the people who came forward.\u201d\n\nMarquis spoke on the importance of speaking with the individuals committing these injustices. \u201cWe needed to make these stores complete, and we needed to make them unassailable, and what better way to do that than to speak with the people who are actually perpetrating the alleged war crimes,\u201d Marquis said during the webinar. \u201cTo illustrate their viewpoints is not to try to justify what they did or explain it, it is just to try to understand, provide context for why atrocities might occur.\u201d\n\nAccording to Marquis, none of the reporters suffered violence, and all their sources are currently safe.\n\nGordon Stables, USC Annenberg\u2019s director of journalism, said in the webinar that \u201c[Marquis] and the Reuters team made a significant impact by creating a public record of atrocities that might otherwise have gone unacknowledged.\u201d\n\nWith all the risks the team took to cover this story, some feel that the award is more than appropriate for their endeavors. Mark Schoofs, a visiting professor of journalism at USC and a moderator of the webinar, commented on this. \u201cReporting this in an area that is under constant government surveillance, the difficulty of getting this story and the stakes of getting this story were just so high that I do think that it deserved to win this year\u2019s award,\u201d he said.\n\nSelden Ring Investigative Journalism Fellowship awardee Grace Murray, a master\u2019s student studying journalism at USC, helped to moderate the event alongside Schoofs. She spoke to Annenberg about the groundbreaking investigative work accomplished throughout the piece. Investigative journalism \u201cis one of the foundations of journalism,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThrough investigative journalism, you\u2019re finding out where there\u2019s wrongdoing and addressing it, which is so important.\u201d\n\nMurray spoke on the importance of using a journalistic platform to shed light on marginalized communities. \u201cIn the story in particular, you have subjects that are actively at risk and actively in danger ... and the reporters ... gave these women voices and allowed them to share their stories while also protecting them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Nigerian Government has denied the validity of the claims made in the Reuters Article. \u201cThe Federal Government hereby categorically states that there is no \u2018secret, systematic and illegal abortion programme\u2019 being run by our military in the northeast or anywhere across the country,\u201d Lai Mohammed, the Nigerian Information Minister said in a statement.\n\nTo Nigerian students at USC, the Reuter\u2019s story serves as a reminder of the corruption and danger Nigerian citizens are all too used to. \u201cNigeria is a very corrupt country,\u201d Burabari Yorka said, the Co-Event Coordinator for USC\u2019s Nigerian Student Association. Yorka touched on a long history of violence and corruption within Nigeria pre-dating the actions of Boko Haram, which forced her parents to emigrate to the United States as refugees. However, Yorka believes that positive change is on the horizon, with Peter Obi\u2019s 2022 presidential campaign \u2014 which was supported by many young Nigerians across the country.\n```"}

Upon joining, Emmy soon learns that identifying as asexual is not the same as choosing to be celibate, or abstaining from having sex.\n\nAccording to the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that\u2019s dedicated to suicide prevention and crisis intervention among LGBTQ+ youth, asexuality is a gender identity that exists on a spectrum, one where asexual people \u2014 or \u201cace\u201d for short \u2014 \u201cmay have little interest in having sex, even though they desire emotionally intimate relationships.\u201d\n\nAs the film progresses, Emmy is surprised to find that the school\u2019s celibacy club is not full of asexual students, but rather \u201cthe horniest of the horny.\u201d As Emmy grapples with the \u201c\u2018Virginity Rocks\u2019 shirt wearing church boys\u2019 in the club,\u201d she learns to embrace rather than conceal her asexual identity, fighting for her community in the process.\n\nAbitha Nunis, a sophomore majoring in theater, plays Emmy. They said that through the film, they hope audiences can understand the difference between celibacy and asexuality. \u201cThere\u2019s never one way to be queer, so don\u2019t rush it,\u201d Nunis said. \u201cHave fun trying to figure out who you are, but also acknowledge that there\u2019s people around you to support you.\u201d\n\nNunis, who identifies as demisexual \u2014 or \u201csomeone who only experiences sexual attraction once they form a strong emotional connection with another person,\u201d according to the Trevor Project \u2014 said they strongly resonated with Emmy. Particularly because the film\u2019s cast and crew was entirely staffed by those from underrepresented groups, Nunis said that each team member shared a piece of the character, shaping Emmy into someone audiences can find comfort in.\n\nThis includes the film\u2019s co-producer, Gina Phu, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies. As someone who identifies as ace, she said that growing up she struggled to see herself represented in the media: \u201cAsexual and aromantic media is severely lacking in proper representation, causing a lot of adolescents and even young adults to feel lost, secluded, and distraught over their identity. I know I was.\u201d\n\nHence, she strove to support media that did, working with co-producer Amanda Chen \u2014 a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies major and minoring in entertainment industry \u2014 through Chen\u2019s student-led production company, Yu Productions. Together, they made the film that Phu\u2019s younger self would\u2019ve appreciated.\n\nWhen \u201cWelcome to Celibacy Club\u201d was chosen to premiere at the Outfest Fusion Festival, Chen said she was ecstatic. \u201cThere\u2019s so many diverse films that don\u2019t get put out on mainstream media because our world is just so for silencing queer voices,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to put [queer people] on a stage and play a part in helping them get to this film festival.\u201d\n\nFor Nunis, they said that the festival\u2019s diverse agenda brought tears to their eyes. \u201cI saw a sea of brown queer people. I\u2019d never been around so many queer POC and people who I felt safe around,\u201d Nunis said. For them, Outfest showed them a community of queer artists who were unapologetically sharing their stories.\n\nAs the largest festival of its kind, the Outfest Fusion Festival is a program developed by the organization Outfest, which is the largest LGBTQIA+ film and media organization in the world. Dedicated to creating visibility for queer filmmakers, Outfest celebrated its 40th anniversary last July.\n\nPatrick Ryan, the festival\u2019s chief of staff and special projects manager, told Annenberg Media that Outfest aims to increase opportunities for queer BIPOC filmmakers, including the aspiring students behind \u201cWelcome to Celibacy Club.\u201d \u201cCollege age students figuratively and literally are the next generation of leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to be able to bring their perspective and energy to the world. We highly encourage students to participate and look for more opportunities to increase engagement and create a pipeline for students to be able to share their work.\u201d\n\nBecause the selection process is highly selective, Ryan added that having one\u2019s film featured in the festival holds heavy weight. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of meaning behind that. So it\u2019s really about just continuing to grow our programs and spread the word and showcase more films so that our fans can continue to create space to share these stories.\u201d\n\nOutfest isn\u2019t the only organization taking notice of \u201cWelcome to Celibacy Club.\u201d USC\u2019s Women of Cinematic Arts club, a pre-professional organization for USC\u2019s female and non-binary film students, screened the film for its Feminist Media Festival in early March.\n\nThe club\u2019s co-chair of events, Olivia McBride \u2014 a communication major with minors in theater and musical theatre \u2014 said that as an organization that serves the female and non-binary student community, WCA saw the film\u2019s potential to give voice to the asexual community. Particularly when female and LGBTQ+ characters are still lacking in the industry \u2014 with the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative reporting that across 13 companies (including Universal Pictures and Warner Brothers), there were 0% LGBTQ leads and co-leads in 2019 films \u2014 McBride said that it\u2019s necessary for LGBTQ+ characters to be both present and nuanced.\n\n\u201cFor a very long time, any character that was characterized as LGBTQ was always viewed as sort of a caricature and completely stereotyped to be the like, silly, stupid, gay best friend,\u201d McBride said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s so incredible about the new generation of filmmakers that are in school right now is they\u2019re trying to share what it\u2019s really like to be in the LGBTQ community and creating much more multi-dimensional characters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey created this character that has struggles, had a sense of humor, and they did all of that in just a few minutes,\u201d McBride added.\n\nThe cast and crew behind \u201cWelcome to Celibacy Club\u201d ultimately hopes to use the power of film to uplift queer stories in a space that often doesn\u2019t make way for them. \u201cWorking on a project that was centered on the part of my identity I hid away healed a lot of inner turmoil I didn\u2019t even know I was having,\u201d Phu said. \u201cI had pushed away and rejected the idea of being ace for so long that seeing it celebrated on screen felt like a dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy high school self, who hated how she felt and thought she was a monster because she couldn\u2019t \u2018feel,\u2019 started healing from how much love we were receiving. WTCC also showed me that I am capable,\u201d Phu continued. \u201cMy participation in this project showed me that I have the strength to create media around my experiences and my identity and people will listen, people will relate, and people will love it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to Celibacy Club\u201d can be streamed on Outfest\u2019s website on Wednesday, as the festival continues online until April 2.\n```"}

Netanyahu has delayed his contentious judicial overhaul plan after a wave of mass protests.\n\nBy Vincent Demonte and Ben Cohen\nMarch 27, 2023 at 6:40 pm PDT\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced today that he would suspend proposed changes to the country\u2019s judicial system... Netanyahu\u2019s plans had thrown Israel into turmoil and civil unrest. Opponents say it would weaken the Supreme Court\u2019s ability to rule against the legislative and executive branches and thus weaken Israeli democracy.\n\nAcross Israel demonstrators took to the streets in huge numbers to protest. Workers at universities...in transportation...and in restaurants...went on strike and called for more before Netanyahu announcing he was temporarily freezing the bill. He told the nation: \"When there is the possibility of preventing a civil war through dialogue I, as the Prime Minister take a time out for dialogue.\u201d\n\nHundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets this weekend, protesting Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s suggested judiciary reform. According to Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has unchecked power, but others contend the changes would give Netanyahu even more control in his third stint as Israel\u2019s longest serving Prime Minister...\n\nIsrael\u2019s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, publicly opposed Netanyahu\u2019s reform and was subsequently fired. Barak Ziv-El, USC Hillel\u2019s Israel Fellow, noted the country\u2019s political uncertainty.\n\nZIV-EL:\u201cIsrael has gone through four elections, actually five elections in less than four years. So the political system in Israel is really, really not stable in the last few years.\u201d\n\nToday, announcing the delay of his proposed reforms, Netanyahu said: \"When there is the possibility of preventing a civil war through dialogue... I, as the Prime Minister... take a time out for dialogue....\"\n\nNetanyahu was re-elected as Prime Minister of Israel in 2022, and the new government that he leads operates on a right-wing and religious platform. J.J. Goldberg has reported on Israel and the Middle East since the 1970s. He isn\u2019t surprised that Israelis have come out in droves to oppose the proposed legislation.\n\nGOLDBERG: \u201cIt\u2019s simple patriotism. They want to preserve the Israel that they love. This is not fighting against Israel for them, it\u2019s fighting against a government that is tearing Israel apart.\u201d\n\nAt Hillel\u2019s USC outpost, an iced coffee machine hums over the sound of hurried preparations. Tomorrow, Hillel will host a Shouk [Sh oo k] - or farmer\u2019s market - on campus to distribute Israeli food and jewelry, and spread Israeli culture in advance of the Jewish holiday of Passover.\n\nFreshman Carmel Schwartz\u2019s thoughts, though, are elsewhere. Before Israel announced the delay, Schwartz said the country was almost tearing itself apart.\n\nSCHWARTZ: \u201cMy family group chats have turned from my aunt, posting selfies of her running on the beach and my uncle sharing cute photos of his dog to warnings of where to and not to go out of fear of protests turning violent and terrorist attacks occurring. There was even discussion today about Jewish people attacking Jewish people, which is practically unheard of.\u201d\n\nAnd, Schwartz says, the problem with this issue from an American perspective, SCHWARTZ: \u201cIt\u2019s bringing even more bad press towards Israel. Americans who are already on edge of supporting Israel and believing in the importance of the state of Israel are now even further opposed, because one of the biggest things that ties America to Israel is democracy.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s democracy is no doubt facing a steep challenge. But the mass protests, which have succeeded in at least delaying new legislation, have proven a dedication to preserving a democratic Israel.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Ben Cohen.\n```"}

This year 86 investigative journalism entries came in from across the country. Chosen by a team of judges, the Selden ring was awarded to Reuters for their work \u201cNightmare in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Selden Ring award was created by businessman and philanthropist Selden Ring. He believed, in the aftermath of Watergate, that investigative journalism would save the United States. 34 years into the future, it is lauded as a spotlight that highlights investigative journalism\u2019s impact locally, nationally and globally.\n\nThis year, Annenberg gave the $50,000 prize to Reuters\u2019 reporters: Paul Carsten, David Lewis, Reade Levinson and Libby George for their filmed and written work \u201cNightmare in Nigeria.\u201d This report described the Nigerian military\u2019s secret abortion program that forcefully terminated the fetuses of women impregnated by the Islamist insurgency group Boko Haram. This forceful program resulted in the death of thousands of children of which the team covered.\n\nBut the real story is how the Reuters\u2019 investigative team\u2019s found the story. The idea of women caught in the crossfire of a violent political power struggle started with a reporter who was originally on a different story and a source whose information led to something more.\n\nReuters editor Julie Marquis received the award on behalf of the Reuters team. She talked about this coincidental discovery.\n\nMARQUIS: The reporter who found out about this story was actually working on something else related to the military. He was having a conversation with the contact and he a half facetiously, but half because he really understood the subject, asked, you know, what what is the army army doing, aborting children? This led the team to dig deeper.\n\nWith the reporters knowing that the Nigerian military wanted to root out Boko Haram, reporters started to discover exactly how: by terminating pregnancies and young children born from insurgents. Marquis highlighted how even if they were not expecting a response, they looked into it regardless.\n\nMARQUIS: And how do we know we wanted to pursue it fully? We had to. You know, obviously, this was a jolting lead. And so we switched gears immediately.\n\nThe team\u2019s determination to deliver the stories of women who were enslaved by Boko Haram and whose children were killed by the Nigerian military, was a driving force from start to finish. Reporters Carsten, Lewis, Levinson and George wrote for the women fighting a battle that was forced upon them.\n\nBut with such a delicate story the team had to approach it with care. Despite protecting their sources being primary concern, they didn\u2019t let the themes of the story hinder their coverage.\n\nMARQUIS: We wanted everyone to know what was going on in Nigeria and we didn\u2019t pull any punches with that. We weren\u2019t going to we didn\u2019t sit around thinking, oh, we shouldn\u2019t include this because it\u2019s going to repulse or frighten people. I mean, we thought the world needed to know precisely what was going on. What we what we were most concerned about was the safety of our sources. And we were afraid that there might be backlash on that...Obviously, these these stories were, you know, more harrowing than most of us had ever worked on before. But but that in no way kept us from pursuing the story.\n\nFor their bravery and even more so, the sources\u2019, Reuters received the 2023 Selden Ring. The reporters continue to cover the unfolding story of the Nigerian military\u2019s brutal treatment of women and the global response to the conflict.\n```"}

And today, a small crowd rallied in Santa Monica to protest in front of the Blackstone Group\u2019s offices, the largest landlord in the United States. Kimberly Aguirre reports.\n\n300,000. This is how many rental units Blackstone owns and manages over the country. And after buying large amounts of rental properties, especially in San Diego, the corporate group raised the rent of some units up to 43-64%. The group also proceeded to over one thousand evictions in 2022, in some of which tenants only owed one month of rent according to a report from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project and Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment.\n\nFor Kelli Lloyd, who came to protest in front of the company offices, the corporate landlords use the laws such as AB 1482 for their advantage.\n\nLLOYD: They\u2019ve been able to exploit the law to get tenants out with using no fault evictions, something like, you know, substantial renovation. In many cases, these renovations don\u2019t take place or they\u2019re not substantial. Armed with vast legal resources, companies then raise rent by almost half with few challenges. A practice that sometimes forces community members to leave neighborhoods they have spent generations in.\n\nAbdullah Muhammad, a longtime resident of South Central, believes that California Senate Bill 567 can protect tenants.\n\nMUHAMMAD: What we\u2019re trying to do with SB 567 is put a cap on how high they can raise the rent. SB 567 tailors rent increases to max out at 5% per year. So, the bill aims to sew up the loophole in AB 1482, hemming corporation\u2019s pockets so they don\u2019t get even deeper.\n\nMore rent control may also let the pressure out of LA\u2019s burgeoning housing crisis.\n\nLLOYD: 70% of Los Angeles housing is owned by corporate landlords. This is contributing to the homelessness crisis in ways that are unimaginable. Increased rent has been linked to increased homelessness. A 2020 study by the Government Accountability Office showed that increasing median rent by $100 was associated with about a 10% increase in homelessness. This stark statistic highlights the precariousness of many American\u2019s housing insecurity, not just Californians.\n\nHowever, these protests represent an important first stitch in weaving a more affordable housing market.\n\nBlackstone sees the situation very differently. A Blackstone spokesperson sent Annenberg Media the following: \u201cThe report and statements are riddled with inaccuracies and mischaracterizations. We believe we have the most favorable resident policies among any large landlord in the U.S., including not making a single non-payment eviction for over two years during COVID. We operate in accordance with California\u2019s rent stabilization laws and are investing $100 million to make these communities better places to live.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Will Camardella March 26, 2023 at 9:42 pm PDT\n\nThe Andy Stankiewicz era in Southern California is still just getting started, but this weekend\u2019s three-game sweep of Washington State is another indicator of a USC baseball program on the rise. The Trojans took all three from the Cougars by multiple runs at Dedeaux Field over the weekend for their first Pac-12 sweep since March 2021. In 2022, the team only won two series in their conference schedule all season but has won its first three sets against conference opponents so far this season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go, we know that,\u201d USC head coach Stankiewicz said about the promising start to the season. \u201cThe past is the past, all we\u2019ve got right now is what we have in front of us, and we want to play good baseball that day. I think that\u2019s one of the things that they\u2019ve bought into.\u201d\n\nOn Friday night, junior starting pitcher Tyler Stromsborg gave USC his best start of the season thus far. His evening got off to a rocky start, when WSU junior first baseman Sam Brown hit a laser over the right-field wall for a two-run home run in the top of the first. In the top of the third, Washington State threatened again with runners on the corners, but Stromsborg got out of the jam by striking out sophomore second baseman Elijah Hainline to retire the side. Starting with the strikeout of Hainline, Stromsborg retired the final 13 batters he faced. He pitched a full seven innings for the first time in his career and allowed a season-low two runs for his second straight start. He also set a new career high in strikeouts with 10, while walking just one batter.\n\n\u201cOur starters understand trusting the pitches, trusting the bullpen, trusting the training, and taking it into a game,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe can\u2019t always rely on the bullpen every night. We always talk about how if we can get our starters to give us five, six or seven innings, we\u2019re gonna be in a much better spot.\u201d\n\nAfter scratching runs across in the third and fourth innings, USC broke the game open by putting up two crooked numbers in the following frames. A pair of two-out hits from senior designated hitter Nick Lopez and freshman first baseman Ethan Hedges combined to drive in four USC runs in the fifth. One inning later, with runners on first and second, junior shortstop Ryan Jackson layed down a bunt to the third-base side. Cougar sophomore third baseman Cam Magee threw the ball past first base, allowing one run to score, then Brown made an error trying to return the ball to the infield, giving the Trojans a second run. USC scored three more unearned runs in the inning, with RBI hits from senior right fielder Cole Gabrielson, Lopez and Hedges. Overall, the Trojans hit .444 on the night, and .500 with two outs to lead the team to a 13-3 win. The trio of Gabrielson, Lopez and Hedges were particularly deadly in the heart of the batting order, combining to hit 9-for-12 with three doubles and eight RBIs.\n\nOn Saturday night, USC gave the ball to sophomore right hander Caden Aoki, making his second start of the season. Aoki pitched a strong game, spending most of the night getting into and out of trouble. He stranded five Washington State runners in his four innings of work. In the fourth inning, Aoki gave up a leadoff double and a walk, bringing junior designated hitter Brandham Ponce to the plate in an RBI situation. Pitching from the stretch again, Aoki gave the Trojans exactly what they needed, as Ponce grounded into a 4-6-3 double play. He then struck out junior shortstop Kyle Russell looking to get out of a first-and-third jam, retiring the side. Aoki pitched a season-high four innings of shutout ball, after allowing three runs in as many innings in his only other start this year. The Trojan bullpen allowed a combined three hits and one run in five innings of relief, shutting the door on any Cougar comeback attempt.\n\nOffensively, USC continued to put pressure on Washington State\u2019s defense by recording 11 hits and striking out just six times. \u201cPart of our game plan was to sometimes take a little bit off our swings and put the ball in play,\u201d Stankiewitz said. \u201cWhen you strike out, you don\u2019t put pressure on anybody. Our ability to put the ball in play with two strikes put us at an advantage.\u201d\n\nIn the fourth, redshirt freshman second baseman Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek hit a two-out double down the first base line, bringing the top of the Trojan order back to the plate. One at-bat later, freshman center fielder Austin Overn hit a laser to deep right field that bounced off the top of the wall and left the ballpark for his first home run of the season. Martin-Grudzielanek drove in a run of his own on a night where he hit 3-for-4 in the nine hole. Overn also crossed home plate once more in the eighth on a passed ball, putting the icing on the cake of a 6-1 win.\n\nGoing for the series sweep on Sunday afternoon, USC got another unexpectedly effective outing from its starting pitcher. Redshirt freshman Eric Hammond entered the game with a 6.65 ERA and was only averaging three innings per start. In this game, however, he worked efficiently, only needing 64 pitches to get through a season-high five innings while allowing two runs. \u201cWe need innings out of [Hammond] badly,\u201d Stankiewitz said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of his effort, he found a way to get us back in the dugout numerous times. He didn\u2019t give up a big inning, which is a big part of our success here.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Cougars scratched runs across in the second and fifth innings, the Trojans stayed ahead of pace throughout the day. Senior catcher Connor Clift knocked an RBI single into right to bring in one of USC\u2019s three runs in the first two innings. Russell got Washington State back within a run in the fifth, but the Trojans responded immediately. With runners on first and second, Martin-Grudzielanek, who was moved up to second in the lineup, hit a double all the way to the wall in right center, bringing both home and giving the Trojans a 5-2 lead. Martin-Grudzielanek made the absolute most of his opportunity at the top of the order, going 2-for-4 with two extra-base hits.\n\n\u201c[Martin-Grudzielanek has] done a great job,\u201d Stankiewitz said. \u201cHe was a nice shot in the arm in the two hole. He just jumped in, and his good at-bats last night carried over into today with some nice AB\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAfter USC sophomore reliever Fisher Johnson allowed a run in two innings after Hammond\u2019s exit, senior Kyle Wisch and redshirt senior Garrett Clarke shut the door at the end of the game. Wisch and Clarke each pitched a 1-2-3 inning in the eighth and ninth, respectively, to clinch the 6-3 victory.\n\nThe three wins boost the Trojans\u2019 record to 14-8-1, and 7-2 in the Pac-12. USC will look to avenge its first loss of the season on Tuesday night against UC Irvine in the first of a four-game road trip.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/26/gamebreaking-faith/", "response": "```\nDOWNEY, Calif. \u2014 On a damp, rainy and brisk Friday night, under the bright lights of the Kretzschmar Stadium, the young men of Warren High School audition before scouts to inch, perhaps, towards their dream of playing professional football. It\u2019s Warren against Gardena\u2019s Serra High \u2014 a classic South Bay rivalry game. Kevin Nickerson looks on as the teams plod and slosh around the field. He rocks back and forth under a translucent poncho like a caged tiger waiting to be unleashed. He bobs his head to the familiar soundtrack of rain, cheers and grunts. And, too, the thunderous thudding of shoulder pads and the muted crack of helmets crashing together seem to invigorate him. Then, to add to the symphony, as if from Zeus on high, he ferociously claps his hands in mittens, and himself begins to shout, \u201cThis is what football is all about! This is football!\u201d It is evident \u2014 he still loves the game. And as the young chaplain of the Los Angeles Rams looks on and encourages the young men who rotate in and out, it\u2019s apparent that he\u2019s offering them more than encouragement. He is, as ever, preparing them for life.\n\nNickerson could have succumbed to the tropes that typified his childhood in Kansas City, Missouri \u2014 gangs, drugs and crime. Instead, as a tender adolescent, he became a man. Nickerson and his sister went back and forth between his parents\u2019 homes until an experience that remains too painful for him to discuss forced him to choose \u2014 live with his mother or father. \u201cMy father did something to my sister that I couldn\u2019t get past. My family came together, and I was forced to choose \u2014 my father or sister. I\u2019m always going to choose my sister,\u201d Nickerson said.\n\nNickerson recalls looking into his father\u2019s eyes and seeing anger and disappointment. \u201cWhen I made that decision,\u201d Nickerson said, \u201cI saw him look at me with disappointment and disgust.\u201d Nickerson moved with his mother and sister. The cost: the loss of his primary male influence. In an attempt to get him around positive men, Nickerson\u2019s mother signed him up for youth football. Quickly, Nickerson made a reputation around his Kansas City community for being a stellar athlete. At his first practice, he received oversized shoulder pads, a helmet with a booty cage and a too-big jersey. As the first-team prepared for special teams kickoff coverage, Nickerson, an afterthought, was placed on the scout return team. The kick sailed through the air under a cloudless blue sky. Nickerson tracked the ball\u2019s trajectory and centered himself underneath; he caught the ball, and as he turned his eyes up the field, his brain calculated a path for him to run through \u2014 he took it. \u201cI remember the coaches yelling and cheering when I took it to the house. My coach came and slapped my helmet and told me to do it again.\u201d So, he did.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Nickerson\u2019s tenacity that stood out. Or his speed. What caught the eye of head coach Tim O\u2019Neal? Nickerson seemed to be fueled by unbridled rage. O\u2019Neal stepped in and, for Kevin Nickerson, played the role of father. \u201cCoach Tim was everything. That was a good man. Anything I needed \u2014 a ride, cleats, school supplies, Coach Tim had me. He treated me like his son.\u201d Nickerson would rely deeply on O\u2019Neal, even more so on January 24, 2003 \u2014 the day the matriarch of his family, his grandmother, passed away. \u201cCoach Tim just hugged me. He listened to me. He told me that he would always be there,\u201d Nickerson said. He was, indeed. Nothing would prepare him for what would occur at his grandmother\u2019s funeral services. As he stood at the head of his grandmother\u2019s casket, teeming with grief and tears, he gripped the polished wooden box \u2014 refusing to let go. Amid his wailing, the cries and songs of everyone in the church went silent. Then, he heard a voice that provided him with a peace that surpassed all he could comprehend. The voice said, \u201cGive me your pain. Let it all go. I love you \u2014 trust me.\u201d \u201cIt was in that moment,\u201d Nickerson said, \u201cI gave my life to the Lord.\u201d He recalls the relief of having his burdens lifted. It was a freedom he had never known.\n\nIn the immediacy of his salvation, Nickerson knew he had changed. He knew he would now replace his anger with joy. Faith would fuel his football journey. He matriculated through high school as a standout on the gridiron, earning a scholarship to Central Missouri State University, where he set and held the NCAA record for kick return touchdowns from 1998 to 2001. Yet, despite the success and acclaim that came as a standout, Nickerson refused to allow the trappings of alcohol and women to distract him. Instead, he firmly cleaved to his faith. Football and faith increasingly became more salient in his life.\n\nNickerson, who always dreamed of sitting in an NFL locker room, had his dreams deferred. Instead, he found himself standing out and making rosters in the Canadian and Arena Football Leagues. As football\u2019s importance began to wane, his calling to ministry increased. At 25 years old, playing in Canada, he began serving as a youth minister during the offseason. \u201cThe Lord told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to be a nobody, but you\u2019re going to reach somebody,\u2019\u201d Nickerson recalled.\n\nLos Angeles Rams' chaplin Kevin Nickerson and wide receiver Cooper Kupp pray after a game. (Photo by Eric Lambkins II)  Kevin Nickerson leads players in prayer at midfield after a game. (Photo by Eric Lambkins II)  His vast reach now touches the lives of players of the L.A. Rams. He organizes and leads Bible studies centered around relationships for coaches, players and their partners. Nickerson\u2019s goal is helping members of the Rams\u2019 organization build healthy and Godly relationships. \u201cI don\u2019t care what someone believes or doesn\u2019t believe,\u201d Nickerson said. \u201cI\u2019m here to serve.\u201d\n\nWhen he isn\u2019t in pro locker rooms, you can find Nickerson exhibiting the same passion for Gamebreakers, an organization he founded where he fuses faith and football. At Gamebreakers, \u201cWe ensure that our young men are ready to build lives that defy expectations. We mentor, we disciple, we provide tutoring, we provide athletic training and we provide opportunities to learn for these young men. I am pouring into these young people in the same way Coach Tim poured into me,\u201d Nickerson said. Nickerson measures success not by wins and losses but by the number of lives touched. This rainy Friday evening, it\u2019s easy to see just how and why Nickerson\u2019s faith is game breaking \u2014 as he places an arm around a lineman who missed a block that forced Warren to punt the ball away \u2014 a life touched.\n```"}

This offensive outburst has been typical for USC, as it has averaged more than seven runs scored per game through its first 20 contests.\n\nUSC welcomed Seattle to a murky and wet Dedeaux Field for a midweek baseball clash. Senior pitcher Blake Sodersten took the bump for the Trojans as they looked to stay hot before their weekend series against Pac-12 opponent Washington State.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s typical Southern California weather,\u201d USC head coach Andy Stankiewicz said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the mentality of baseball, when the umpire says \u2018play ball\u2019, you just have to go.\u201d\n\nUSC utilized the slick field conditions immediately, as two Trojans reached base via bunt in the first due to some miscues by Seattle. Senior right fielder Cole Gabrielson made the Redhawks pay for their mistakes, driving a two-run double to give USC the early 2-0 lead.\n\n\u201cThe guys had seen that we\u2019ve got a wet surface tonight, and we\u2019ve got some speed, so that was part of our game,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWhen we see opportunities to put bunts down ... it\u2019s about executing and putting pressure on the defense.\u201d\n\nAfter Sodersten pitched three scoreless innings of one-hit baseball, Seattle jumped on the Trojans\u2019 bullpen, tying the game at two in the fourth. The Trojans\u2019 bats grew quiet after the first, as they entered the bottom half of the sixth trailing 3-2.\n\n\u201cWe scored two right out the gate, and everyone\u2019s feeling good,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThen all of a sudden, we put a bunch of zeros up there, so we\u2019ve got to be better ... we can\u2019t give at-bats away, especially in those middle innings.\u201d\n\nTying the game at three in the sixth, USC knocked on the door in the seventh, loading the bases to start the inning with no one out. Senior third baseman Johnny Olmstead approached the dish and delivered for the Trojans with two strikes, roping a bases-clearing triple to the right-center gap. A sac fly from senior designated hitter Adrian Colon-Rosado drove in Olmstead and made it a four-run inning.\n\nFreshman outfielder Austin Overn cranked his NCAA-leading ninth triple in the bottom of the eighth to spark two more runs for the Trojans, lengthening their lead to six runs.\n\n\u201c[Overn\u2019s] speed is elite,\u201d Stankiewicz said postgame. \u201cIf he can get on top of the ball and hit line drives into the gaps, the balls gonna skip and give him some good bounces to allow him to get more triples.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans held on to win by a final score of 9-4. This marked USC\u2019s sixth win in seven games, including key victories over Stanford, Cal Poly, and Cal Berkeley over that span.\n\n\u201cThat was a good team win,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged by guys understanding their roles and understanding what they are supposed to do in that role and buying into it.\u201d\n\nUSC will host conference opponent Washington State for a three-game series this weekend. The Trojans will look to improve upon their 4-2 record in Pac-12 play.\n\n\u201cI think the guys are starting to gain confidence in these moments and understanding it\u2019s not about the opponent, it\u2019s about playing good baseball,\u201d Stankiewicz said.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Jesse Saler).\n\nBy Viktoria Capek March 24, 2023 at 8:26 am PDT\n\nWhen Lilly Brown visited The Ruby Fruit, it was her first time getting a drink in Los Angeles without a second thought. Brown, a lesbian, cycled through the same questions \u2014 Where will I be welcomed? Where will I be safe? Where will there be people like me? \u2014 almost every weekend since moving from Syracuse, New York to L.A. in 2014. That is until The Ruby Fruit, L.A.\u2019s newest lesbian wine bar, opened its doors in February, a welcomed but overdue venture since the county\u2019s last permanent lesbian bar (a relatively unknown, 45-year-old business that catered to an older crowd) \u2014 Oxwood Inn \u2014 closed its doors in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe saw a lot of people we knew and people we didn\u2019t know, and we got to meet new people,\u201d Brown said during a phone call, referring to she and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s first trip to The Ruby Fruit. \u201cThe coolest part was knowing that it\u2019s always going to be there.\u201d\n\nTwo former workers at the now-closed natural-wine bar, Eszett, opened The Ruby Fruit in its place at a Silver Lake strip mall. Following Eszett\u2019s closure in January, Emily Bielagus and Mara Herbkersman turned the space around with the intention of creating a hangout spot for lesbian, bisexual and other queer women, trans and non-binary individuals \u2014 a direct response to the dozens of gay bars catering to queer men lining the streets of L.A. County neighborhoods such as West Hollywood.\n\nIn a serendipitous window for the L.A. queer community, another bar opened its doors the following weekend, just a few miles away in East Hollywood. Honey\u2019s at Star Love was co-founded by Charlotte Gordon, Mo Faulk and Kate Greenberg, a trio who, like Bielagus and Herbkersman, recognized the need for a nightlife space that catered to more than just the gay-male community in L.A.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is really different than what\u2019s happening in [West Hollywood] right now,\u201d Gordon shared in an interview at Honey\u2019s. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is great, but there are a lot of folks who wouldn\u2019t enjoy going out in the kind of brick-and-mortar bars that already exist.\u201d\n\nInside Honey\u2019s at Star Love, an LGBTQ+ inclusive watering hole in East Hollywood. (Photo courtesy of Ben Bassu).\n\nHoney\u2019s and The Ruby Fruit offer a more stable contrast to the pop-up parties in various bars and clubs that have become the normal nightlife scene for queer non-men in L.A. Pop-up parties organized by Whitney Mixter from Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe Real L Word\u201d and other queer female big names were the only places Brown was able to connect with gay women in the area when she first moved to L.A.\n\n\u201cI was following certain people on Instagram, and that\u2019s how I found the parties,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI would go to those with one of my straight friends because I didn\u2019t know any queer people here yet. It was a bit hard to meet people at the beginning.\u201d\n\nOnce Brown learned how to navigate the flash-party scene, she co-organized her own activity-focused social event, Queer Field Day, for LGBTQ+ women and trans individuals. But the pop-up system never felt reliable, a fear that manifested with the broken promise of creating a permanent bar made by Hot Donna\u2019s Clubhouse.\n\nLilly Brown is the co-founder of Queer Field Day, a pop-up event for queer women and transgender individuals in Los Angeles. (Photo courtesy of Abby Mahler)\n\nHot Donna\u2019s parties were the face of queer women and trans pop-up events coming out of early lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizer Lauren Richer hosted Hot Donna\u2019s Clubhouse touring events to finance the opening of a permanent lesbian bar of the same name. According to Brown, who once organized a pop-up party with Richer, these events were well attended. Richer, in 2021, even told the L.A. Times she had already raised more than $20,000 to open the bar.\n\nUnexpectedly in June 2022, Hot Donna\u2019s announced on Instagram it would be taking a hiatus from hosting pop-up events, and the organization deactivated its social media accounts. More than six silent months later, Brown says she reached out to Richer about what progress she had made toward opening the bar and was met with no response. Less than a day after Brown posted a TikTok video explaining what had happened when she reached out, Hot Donna\u2019s Clubhouse reactivated its Instagram account, and posted an apology message regarding its silence, stating, in part: \u201cThe truth is simply that the business model we built around the brick-and-mortar bar proved itself to not be viable.\u201d The message continued, \u201cWe are here to cheer on anyone who pursues the great task of creating queer safe spaces in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been very ephemeral until now,\u201d said Lily Bellinghausen, a queer woman who\u2019s lived in L.A. for five years. Bellinghausen, on a busy Tuesday night at The Ruby Fruit, said she\u2019d eagerly visited the new lesbian bar two other times already, including on opening night. \u201cThe place was packed,\u201d Bellinghausen said. \u201cWe were overflowing into the parking lot.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic was an isolating experience for Bellinghausen. Finding a community was difficult for her without a constant place to build connections with other queer women and gender-nonconforming people of varying ages.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I love about [The Ruby Fruit],\u201d Bellinghausen said. \u201cIt\u2019s bridging gaps between generations.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Lesbian Bar Project, a campaign launched in October 2020 to raise awareness about the disappearance of lesbian bars across the country, only 27 lesbian bars remain open in the United States. That number is down from roughly 200 bars in 1980, likely due to demographic changes, the wage gap and other city-specific reasons, among other factors.\n\nBrown believes that fighting this decline by opening modern queer-inclusive spaces such as Honey\u2019s and lesbian bars such as The Ruby Fruit is essential to building confidence in L.A.\u2019s queer-woman, transgender and non-binary community.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people might wonder why lesbians only hang out with lesbians,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging out with lesbians because they relate to us in ways that straight people don\u2019t. That gay men don\u2019t. We get each other\u2019s \u2018L-Word\u2019 references, and we make each other feel safe. Things like that matter.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino\nMarch 23, 2023 at 10:54 pm PDT\n\nThe Trojans returned to the practice field Thursday on a warm and sunny afternoon after a wet and rainy day on Tuesday. This is the type of weather that new faces from the transfer portal were expecting.\n\nOne of USC\u2019s most notable pick-ups from the transfer portal was redshirt senior edge rusher Jamil Muhammad. The former quarterback turned edge rusher out of Georgia State has already made his presence known at practice. So far he has been enjoying his time in L.A. and has embraced every challenge practice has thrown at him.\n\n\u201cFirst couple months have been great, just getting here and adjusting to a brand new way of life as far as football and expectations,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty strenuous, but I am up for the challenge.\u201d\n\nAlthough Muhammad has taken advantage of his short time with USC so far, he wasn\u2019t certain USC was his next stop.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Muhammad said, responding to a question about if he knew he would eventually end up at USC. \u201cI knew it would be something big. I had faith in myself, in my game, and what I did at George State. I knew something was in the writings and I was just excited to see what it was ... Never in a million years did I think I would be standing in Los Angeles, but everything works out.\u201d\n\nOne key factor in Muhammad\u2019s game that gives him a competitive edge is his time playing quarterback. He believes his quarterback knowledge translates well to playing with junior quarterback Caleb Williams because he can see what Williams is doing and why he is doing it, which helps during the team drills at practice.\n\n\u201cHe makes a lot of ridiculous decisions at the line and for me to still process that and still understand what\u2019s coming, I think that comes a lot from my former quarterback intellect,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing I\u2019m grateful for because it is another thing that lets me play faster.\u201d\n\nMuhammad\u2019s work has not gone unnoticed as outside linebackers coach Roy Manning has been very pleased with his practice performance.\n\n\u201cThis kid is all business, very serious, no messing around. Now that he is here, he is exactly what we expected out of him,\u201d Manning said. \u201cGetting to the quarterback is a big focus this year and you can see it easily on film that he can bend and turn tight corners.\u201d\n\nManning also noted that he has seen a lot of improvement already with the defense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really refreshing,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThese guys are taking a big step and having more bodies. You can never have enough pass rushers. That\u2019s what separates a lot of teams. We do a lot of cross training to get edge guys ready.\u201d\n\nManning and the rest of the coaching staff are highly aware of what they want to fix from last year.\n\n\u201cI think we had a bunch of missed opportunities when we got to the quarterback,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIf you go back and watch the film, it\u2019s not exactly getting there but finishing. One of the big things we saw on film was not getting under control. We are focusing on attacking the quarterback.\u201d\n\nWhile the new stars look promising, returning players such as redshirt freshman defensive lineman Devan Thompkins and redshirt freshman defensive back Zion Branch can also see their play improving.\n\nThompkins has been putting in a lot of extra work to up his game whether that is through watching film or hitting the weight room. His strides in the weight room have been enormous as he put on thirty pounds since last season.\n\n\u201cI have a lot more strength,\u201d Thompkins said. \u201cMy speed went down a little bit, but I got it back to where it should be. In the beginning, they told me I need to develop a lot more, and it was tough at first, but I just listen to everything they tell me to do and trust them.\u201d\n\nBranch was hurt last season and did not get to see the field at all. He has been working hard ever since to be back and has learned a lot while getting to know each of the secondary positions in depth.\n\n\u201cI feel like I can just help all around,\u201d Branch said. \u201cBeing able to watch the defense really just helped me see a vision of where I can contribute. Really wherever the coaches need me I feel like I can fill their spots.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what the coaches expect of the defenders, Branch listed a few key areas the coaches are focusing on shoring up this offseason.\n\n\u201cBonding together, playing together as a unit, improving on something every day,\u201d Branch said. \u201cThe coaches have really taught us a lot this offseason. I feel like there should be a big difference from last season to this season.\u201d\n\nFans of the Trojans have been clambering for an improved defense and with the new players and emphasis on defensive improvement, it seems like there\u2019s a strong possibility fans will get their wish next season.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Wade Payne)\n\nBy Adam Bradford March 23, 2023 at 9:38 pm PDT\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d is a column by Adam Bradford discussing college football developments during the winter and spring months. For 11 months of the year, the world of college sports is dominated by football. For a few weeks each March, however, football takes a backseat to basketball as the NCAA tournament moves to the forefront of the action. We are currently in the midst of yet another exciting March Madness, with the Sweet 16 underway tonight. But this is a college football column, so in honor of March Madness, here is a fun hypothetical: What if the remainder of the tournament was played out on the football field instead of on the basketball court? Let\u2019s go down that rabbit hole and pick the remainder of the NCAA tournament based on football teams. (Note: These projections are based on each team\u2019s performance during the 2022 season.)\n\nSweet 16: No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 5 San Diego State\n2022 was a \u201cdown\u201d year for Alabama, with the Crimson Tide having to \u201csettle\u201d for an 11-2 campaign and a Sugar Bowl win. That being said, they were still head and shoulders above San Diego State, who had a mediocre 7-6 season in the Mountain West. The Tide roll in this one.\n\nSweet 16: No. 6 Creighton vs. No. 15 Princeton\nIt was an unfortunate end to the 2022 season for Princeton. After starting the year 8-0, the Tigers dropped their final two contests versus. Yale and Penn to miss out on the Ivy League title. Creighton, however, has not fielded a football team since 1942. So the Tigers take this one by default.\n\nSweet 16: No. 9 Florida Atlantic vs. No. 4 Tennessee\nWe have another not particularly close Sweet 16 matchup. While Tennessee went 11-2 and won the Orange Bowl, Florida Atlantic went 5-7 and fired head coach Willie Taggart. The Vols might put up 70 points in this one.\n\nSweet 16: No. 3 Kansas State vs. No. 7 Michigan State\nA year ago, Michigan State would have been an easy pick in this matchup. After a 2022 season that saw the Spartans finish an incredibly disappointing 5-7 while the Wildcats won the Big 12, however, fortunes have reversed. Kansas State prevails.\n\nSweet 16: No. 1 Houston vs. No. 5 Miami\nMiami lost 45-31 to Middle Tennessee at home. That should tell you everything you need about the Hurricanes\u2019 2022 season. Houston moves on.\n\nSweet 16: No. 3 Xavier vs. No. 2 Texas\nXavier has not fielded a football team since 1973. And while Texas had its share of problems in 2022, losing to people that do not exist was not one of them (that honor was reserved for 2012 Notre Dame). The Longhorns advance.\n\nSweet 16: No. 8 Arkansas vs. No. 4 UConn\nUConn had a remarkable season under first-year head coach Jim Mora, making a bowl game for the first time since 2015. Arkansas, meanwhile, had a somewhat disappointing 7-6 campaign. However, even in one of their best seasons in a long time, the Huskies still do not have what it takes to knock off a mediocre SEC team. Arkansas survives the upset bid.\n\nSweet 16: No. 3 Gonzaga vs. No. 2 UCLA\nMuch like Creighton, Gonzaga has not fielded a football team since World War II. UCLA advances by default.\n\nElite Eight: No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 15 Princeton\nI don\u2019t think we need to go into much detail about this matchup. With all due respect to Princeton, this one will likely get ugly.\n\nElite Eight: No. 4 Tennessee vs. No. 3 Kansas State\nOne of the best matchups of the entire tournament. Two teams that both won double-digit games and made New Year\u2019s Six bowl games in 2022 square off with a trip to the Final Four on the line. The teams battle back and forth for four quarters, but ultimately, senior quarterback Hendon Hooker and the Tennessee offense prove too much for Kansas State to handle. The Vols advance to the Final Four.\n\nElite Eight: No. 1 Houston vs. No. 2 Texas\nIn another tightly-contested matchup, two schools from the state of Texas that had mediocre 2022 campaigns square off. And while Houston has the edge at quarterback thanks to senior Clayton Tune, the Cougars cannot stop the Longhorns\u2019 star running back junior Bijan Robinson. Texas wins in a close one.\n\nElite Eight: No. 8 Arkansas vs. No. 2 UCLA\nWhile Arkansas regressed from its nine-win campaign in 2021, UCLA\u2019s 2022 season was the program\u2019s best in nearly a decade. And while the Bruins could not knock off USC and advance to the Pac-12 Championship Game, they still have more than enough firepower to take down the Razorbacks. UCLA prevails.\n\nFinal Four: No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 4 Tennessee\nFor the first time in this column, we get a matchup that we actually saw on the football field in 2022. Tennessee\u2019s thrilling 52-49 victory over Alabama back in October was arguably the game of the year in college football. And in April, we get the same result. For the second time in less than six months, the Vols spoil the Tide\u2019s national championship hopes.\n\nFinal Four: No. 2 Texas vs. No. 2 UCLA\nBoth teams could be classified as \u201cgood, but not great\u201d in 2022. However, while Texas lacked any true quality wins, UCLA\u2019s upset of eventual Pac-12 champion Utah stands out on its resume. In a tight contest, the Bruins knock off the Longhorns.\n\nNational Championship: No. 4 Tennessee vs. No. 2 UCLA\nWe nearly got this matchup in the 1998 BCS Championship Game before UCLA suffered a late-season loss to Miami that knocked the Bruins out of national championship contention. Nearly a quarter century later, two teams with high-powered offenses square off for the hypothetical title. Ultimately, UCLA\u2019s weak secondary cannot contain senior Cedric Tillman, junior Jalin Hyatt and Tennessee\u2019s talented wide receiver room. Cue Rocky Top because the Tennessee Volunteers are your national champions.\n\nNational Champions: Tennessee Volunteers\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}

The event will center on the Black and Queer community, and specifically the ways in which Ballroom has shaped Black and queer communities in the United States and Internationally.\n\nI spoke to juniors Alan Enriquez and Caleb Flenoury who will be walking the runway this weekend.\n\nFLENOURY: So what\u2019s happening on Friday, March 24th from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. is the USC Renaissance Ball. It\u2019s the first of all the USC has ever hosted. And pretty much it is going to be a celebration of the authenticity of Black and brown queer [excellence]. Balls were started in Harlem, New York in the 1900s and that\u2019s where we came together to express ourselves as queer individuals in spaces that were safe in a society at large that made us feel like outcasts.\n\nENRIQUEZ: There\u2019s always been ballroom scenes, as Caleb has told me before, around the country. But this is like the first time at a school and they\u2019re very clear that this is not like the real ball. This is a taste of a ball, which I think is very respectful as well, because ballroom culture is its own culture. And I think that the cool thing about it is that it\u2019s meant to be shared and celebrated. But like, you know, as with all cultures should not be appropriated. So it\u2019s happening this Friday and there are different types of categories. And there\u2019s five I believe and I\u2019ll be walking three of them. Executive, School Boy, and Runway. I\u2019ll be doing those three.\n\nFLENOURY: I will be doing four: schoolboy, rudeness, face, runway, and probably all-American, which is the more masculine style.\n\nENRIQUEZ: I\u2019m honestly very excited to see everyone\u2019s fits. There\u2019s a lot of my friends who are going, some of them who are not necessarily queer, but are people of color. And regardless, it\u2019s just going to be a big celebration.\n\nFLENOURY: I\u2019m looking forward to one the competition to see who all is walking. It\u2019s OTA which stands for Open to All. Meaning anyone can come through and you have to RSVP first, but you can walk and show off your your talent, your skill, or just your energy, which is what ballroom is all about. And I\u2019m excited to compete in that regard, and I\u2019m excited mainly to feel the energy. It\u2019s a very open and welcoming space and I\u2019m excited to know that everyone who is there will be contributing to the energy.\n\nSo the tickets are going to be on the USC LGBTQ plus center page. They have about three or four post with it now. They\u2019ve been posting a lot of promo for it. So you can go on there and click their link tree in the bio and find their RSVP links. You can RSVP to go or just to you can RSVP to walk a category or just to show up. And again, the time is from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. on Friday, March 24th in Tommy\u2019s place.\n\nI\u2019ll just reiterate what Alan said in saying that this is a taste of Ball Room and it\u2019s important to understand the culture that it comes from. Black and brown people of queer identity face a lot of trials and tribulations every day. Right now, the drag scene is going through something which has a lot to do with Ballroom as well. There are categories and main balls where you do drag performances and other things like that, so it\u2019s important to realize, Oh yeah, we like to Kiki and have fun and show off, and we can seem like spectacles at times. We still are people and we have rights that need to be protected as well. So come through and support.\n\nJOHNSON: You still have time to RSVP to the event and you can find more information through the usclqbtqplus Instagram page. The show will feature four categories for participants including Runway, Face, Performance, and Realness. The Renaissance Ball is open for all to compete-- for a grand prize of $200 in each category.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Isa Johnson.\n```"}

How did you get interested in this work?\n\nI\u2019ve been working at L.A. Times since 2016 as a national correspondent covering a variety of subjects. I came in with a beat where I was the national race and justice correspondent covering issues on diversity, police shootings, protests, and other topics for the L.A. Times. After the presidential election, when President Trump was elected, I was doing a lot on COVID-19, the racial justice issues in the country, and the 2020 election. Last year I was based in London for the L.A. Times as a foreign correspondent, covering news around Europe and enterprise feature articles on issues connecting California to broader issues in Europe. Prior to that, I was a reporter at Huffington Post for about four years based in New York and I wrote about religion. Prior to that, I was working at the Miami Herald in Florida and serving mainly as a religion reporter as well as covering all kinds of local news.\n\nWhat is a typical day like at your job?\n\nThere\u2019s not much of a typical day so I\u2019ll give you a sense of today. It was a good day to speak to you because I have an article that I have been working on that I filed with my editors. In the meantime, I have time to start working on other articles. It is the time of year when all the journalism contests open for submissions. I\u2019m working with our team to figure out what to apply to and what articles or projects of mine could be submitted. A typical day could also be some breaking news happening and I have to write about it from L.A. or fly to where it\u2019s happening and cover it from there. That\u2019s not unusual. It\u2019s happened many times over the years.\n\nI really loved your story, \u201cPunjabi American Highway,\u201d the article you wrote about the refugees in Sioux Falls, and how you tell stories of underrepresented communities that are not normally highlighted by mainstream media. What story that you\u2019ve written has been the most impactful to you?\n\nThe ones you just mentioned are really important to me. I traveled to Sioux Falls several times over a period of eight months to visit factory workers who were initially some of the worst hit by COVID. These are the stories that it\u2019s hard to forget as a reporter. It is the people I have met and kept in touch with. There are stories that people ask me about years later that I still get questions about today. I think that\u2019s a good sign that it\u2019s either the topic itself, the way it was covered, and that I really resonated with people. Those two stories are ones where I had to go out into the field and into a community to spend a lot of time with people. It was not just a quick phone or in-person interview. I spent days, hours, and weeks. That can take a lot of time and a lot of energy. It can also produce some of the best reporting for me and many other journalists, so I like that.\n\nCan you describe someone who had an influence on you professionally?\n\nThere are so many people. The current team of editors I work with on our Foreign and Nation desk are great. I have worked with them on hundreds of stories over the years and each has really guided me. The editors that you work with are really important. They not just help guide you from the inception of stories, but even can redirect you if you\u2019re lost in your writing process. They can be great supporters even after publication. What I\u2019ve learned from all of them are ways to think in bigger terms: to think of how the stories that I cover relate to the people who are in them as well as the nation or world, and to speak to issues that are more important than just one person or place. That\u2019s a great way to approach journalism. It means you are covering significant issues that really affect people and that people care about.\n\nCan you describe a time when you or another journalist faced a challenge separating personal morals from work?\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to pull out an instance because it\u2019s a constant discussion you have with yourself on where that line is and where the line is moving. I think one example is I often meet people in my reporting that I want to be friends with, but that\u2019s not something that I should be doing as a reporter with people I\u2019m writing about. When you\u2019re a journalist, you gain a lot of trust from people. If you do your job right, they\u2019re comfortable around you, want to talk to you, and show you their worlds. You have to make sure people are aware that you\u2019re always there as a reporter, you\u2019re not there to become their friend or their advocate.\n\nYou mentioned that you were a foreign correspondent in London and now you are a national correspondent. Is there one you like more than the other or felt like you were making more of an impact?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I like one more than the other or is more important. They\u2019re both similar kinds of reporting. The difference with foreign reporting is that you might be in a country where you may not speak a language that is native, so you need to get a basic education for yourself and for your audience. This changes the way you report and what kind of stories you select. But I think they\u2019re both really important. They\u2019re both pretty big in scope, and you\u2019re trying to distill major world issues or movements in ways that people can understand and grapple with through the lens of their everyday lives.\n\nMore about these From the Classroom submissions: Students in an intro to reporting and writing course interviewed working journalists and asked their career advice and how they got their start. It\u2019s a rare assignment where they were allowed to have just one source in the story or Q&A. Read more work \u201cFrom the Classroom\u201d here.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Will Camardella\nMarch 22, 2023 at 6:42 pm PDT\n\nLike the rest of the student body, the USC football team enjoyed spring break last week. But with the final break of the spring semester in the rearview mirror, the Trojans returned to the field on Tuesday afternoon to kick off the remainder of spring practices.\n\nThe circumstances of Tuesday\u2019s practice were highly unusual, and not just because of the weeklong intermission from practices or the Pro Day that took place a few hours before. In a rare instance for the Los Angeles-based program, the Trojans\u2019 practice took place in the middle of a rainstorm, which began to get heavy right around the time the players began stretching.\n\nAs a result, head coach Lincoln Riley elected to hold the start of practice on the turf field inside the track and field stadium instead of the muddied grass field at Howard Jones Field.\n\n\u201cWhen you have the best weather in college football, you don\u2019t get many of these days,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell [athletic director] Mike [Bohn] and President [Carol] Folt, \u2018You told me the weather was gonna be a hell of a lot better than this\u2019 ... The game is a little bit different when you get in those conditions, and having to adjust is good for every position on the field.\u201d\n\nDespite working with a wet football, this practice gave junior quarterback Caleb Williams the opportunity to recapture his rapport with the returning members of the wide receiver room. More importantly, the reigning Heisman trophy winner will try to develop chemistry with USC\u2019s new arrivals.\n\nOne of the Trojans\u2019 offseason pickups was junior wide receiver Dorian Singer, who transferred from Arizona this offseason. Singer was the Wildcats\u2019 leading pass catcher in 2022 with over 1,100 receiving yards. He showed out in particular in a Week 9 matchup against USC when he recorded over 140 yards and caught three touchdown passes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge difference from the place I came,\u201d Singer said, regarding the quality of the receiving corps. \u201cJust seeing the competition level, it\u2019s like, every day you really have to compete, because the man next to you, if he\u2019s not better than you it\u2019s the same.\u201d\n\nSpring practices are opportunities for new team members to learn a brand new system, and, like Singer, redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd is working to get acclimated. Lloyd, who transferred from South Carolina, joins a crowded running back room that includes redshirt senior Austin Jones and sophomore Raleek Brown. Lloyd will fight for playing time after leading the Gamecocks in rushing in 2022 with 573 yards in nine games. He averaged over five yards per carry and scored 11 total touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI just felt like the offense is unique in every way,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cA lot of people, when they look at the Trojans, they look at them being a pass-first team, but if you look at the numbers from the running back, the running back is getting 20 carries a game as well. I just like the way they execute on all levels ... I just feel like it would be a great fit to add to the great running backs here already. I think it would be best for me to compete, have fun, and win a national championship.\u201d\n\nWhile the offense tries to incorporate its new additions into its already explosive unit, the defense expects to take significant strides from its 2022 season. After an 11-1 start to the season, the defense allowed 93 points in the Trojans\u2019 final two games, both losses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very pleased with the progress defensively this offseason,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI think they really sense, after going through what we\u2019d put these guys through in the offseason and early in spring ball, that this has got a chance to be a really strong group and a really strong part of this football team ... I can tell you the practices up to this point have been completely back and forth, probably won a little bit more overall by the defense.\u201d\n\nEntering his second season at USC, defensive coordinator Alex Grinch is the one leading the effort to improve the defense. Grinch continued to reinforce forcing turnovers in practice, which was a major staple of the unit a year ago. However, for the Trojans to take the step they so desperately need to, Grinch emphasized that the team needs to build off of 2022, as opposed to starting over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve challenged the guys, you can\u2019t just say that it\u2019s year two, so all things are going to be better,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cWe described it to the guys, it can\u2019t be year one 2.0 where we\u2019re saying the exact same things ... They got to have responsibility on their part to act like they played 14 games last year. Those guys that were eight or nine-game starters, they have to bring those experiences with them.\u201d\n\nThere is a great deal of work to be done for USC football to reach its championship standard in 2023. Those high expectations put an extra emphasis on each individual practice, which the Trojans intend to take advantage of, rain or shine.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/22/unpack-the-pac-offseason-edition-the-curious-case-of-duce-robinson-and-what-it-means-for-the-pac-12/", "response": "```\n\u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d is a column by Jacob Hare that discusses offseason football news in the Pac-12 conference. At this point in the year, most high school prospects are committed to college and have signed their national letter of intent for their future universities. Everyone\u2019s college process is different, but it\u2019s very surprising that the number one tight end prospect in the 2023 high school class, Duce Robinson, has not committed anywhere. However, 247Sports\u2019 national analyst Blair Angulo reported that Robinson will decide by April 1. This is major news for the Pac-12 because, at the moment, USC is the current favorite to land Robinson. Surprisingly, the Trojans are the only main suitors for Robinson in the conference despite him being from Phoenix, Arizona \u2014 a testament to the lack of Pac-12 recruiting for major stars except for at the quarterback position. At each position, the top guys to come out of the west tend to bolt for the SEC and Big Ten. It\u2019s rare for a star non-quarterback to join the Pac-12. And by the way the conference is trending, I do not see that changing. For more context, if you are not aware, USC and UCLA will be leaving for the Big Ten after this upcoming season. The two biggest names in the conference leaving obviously will take a major toll on the rest of the conference, especially with recruiting. But the Hail Mary hire of Colorado naming Deion Sanders their head coach was the only move the conference could stay in national relevance. He hasn\u2019t even coached a regular season game yet, and ESPN is playing their game on cable television. Not even Alabama has that luxury this year, but you know Nick Saban doesn\u2019t care who watches because he knows he will win. Anyways, that\u2019s my little rant about recruiting in the Pac-12 since Duce Robinson is between Georgia and USC despite being offered by Washington and UCLA. It\u2019s sad to see the Pac-12 not stand a chance anymore with these higher-power conferences. Duce Robinson has the potential to be one of the great players to come out of the Pac-12, as his numbers are off the chart. He has a 6-foot-10-inch wingspan, and he still has room to grow his weight and strength. Robinson is also the modern day tight end prototype of a pass catcher and a blocker rather than just a blocker. He reminds me of now-New York Giant Darren Waller. Imagine Caleb Williams with Waller\u2019s clone? Yeah, there could be records broken this season at the Coliseum. But let\u2019s not jump the gun just yet. Another cool note about Duce is that he is also a two sport star as he has baseball offers from elite schools such as Oregon, Stanford, Alabama, Georgia Tech and Arizona. It will be very interesting to see where Robinson picks to attend college. I do feel that USC has a slight edge since he is a west coast kid, but Georgia did just win back-to-back national titles, so how do you compete with that? Robinson\u2019s decision will have a major impact on the college football world. \u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/22/one-year-later-elden-rings-continued-success-is-a-triumph-of-the-video-game-industry/", "response": "```\nOne year later, Elden Ring\u2019s continued success is a triumph of the video game industry\n\nThe latest FromSoftware release revolutionized open-world games and remains relevant a year after its release.\n\nBy Aditya Thiyag March 22, 2023 at 11:47 am PDT\n\nWith the one year anniversary of \u201cElden Ring\u201d behind us, it\u2019s impossible to quantify how impressive the success of FromSoftware\u2019s magnum opus really is. Sure, the 20 million units sold worldwide and the horde of \u201cGame of the Year\u201d wins are impressive, but there have been plenty of titles in the past to rack up such accolades and sales. So what separates \u201cElden Ring\u201d from the pack? It starts with the game developers.\n\nJapanese developer Hidetaka Miyazaki and studio FromSoftware rose to fame in the early 2010\u2032s with \u201cDark Souls,\u201d a fantasy adventure game notorious for its crushing difficulty and fragmented storytelling structure that spawned its own subgenre of games aptly titled \u201csouls-likes.\u201d The difficulty was not only present in the boss fights and complex level design, but it extended into the story and individual side quests. Players had to decipher item descriptions and the non-player characters\u2019 (NPCs\u2019) cryptic dialogue to piece together the story themselves. This atypical approach to game design simultaneously popularized the game franchise and demoralized the casual audience from approaching FromSoftware titles, which makes \u201cElden Ring\u2019s\u201d success all the more impressive.\n\n\u201cElden Ring\u201d maintains Miyazaki\u2019s signature brand of punishing enemies, eccentric character interactions, and nonlinear storytelling while revitalizing the oversaturated open-world subgenre. Instead of having a list of tasks to check off around the map, FromSoftware gives the player free reign to explore any part of the game world, The Lands Between, with no restrictions in sight. Exploration is key to both \u201cElden Ring\u2019s\u201d design and success. Minimizing the information presented on the player\u2019s heads-up display (HUD) and having every area of the world available for exploration immediately might seem inaccessible at first glance, but by doing so, FromSoftware gave players full reign to explore to their heart\u2019s content without the added pressure of a traditional quest screen.\n\nThis approach to exploration is not unique to \u201cElden Ring\u201d; Nintendo\u2019s 2017 \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u201d was critically acclaimed for this very reason. However, the harsh difficulty of the souls-like titles being applied to \u201cElden Ring\u2019s\u201d massive open world is what makes this game remarkable. FromSoftware circumvents the criticisms of their lack of difficulty settings by encouraging players to find weapons, armor, and items in the world to aid them on their quest to become Elden Lord while picking up the story along the way. If a boss or region is too difficult, the player can leave to level up, discover new bits of lore or grit their teeth and continue to push through in the face of adversity.\n\nThe plethora of options at the player\u2019s disposal, both in terms of playstyle variety and progression order, is revolutionary for the gaming industry. There are hundreds of weapons, magic spells, and special attacks for players to experiment with, and every playstyle is viable. Giving players flexibility to approach every area incentivizes the casual audience to stick with the game during its more punishing moments, and the multiple gameplay styles allow for several playthroughs worth of content.\n\nThe obscurity of the game\u2019s story and boss difficulty also led to thousands of gameplay discussions and lore theories being posted online, uniting both new and veteran players. Instead of requiring online access to experience the game, FromSoftware\u2019s game design philosophy gave players a chance to organically come together and discuss the game\u2019s hidden secrets and unique experiences they had exploring The Lands Between.\n\nWhat stands out more than the game\u2019s accessibility is FromSoftware\u2019s dedication to packing in as many unique enemy encounters as possible without artificially inflating the game\u2019s already lengthy playtime. \u201cElden Ring\u201d has a diverse set of regions for the player to traverse, and each area acts as a mini-world populated by enemy campsites, varied ecosystems, and intricate castle-like structures capped off by demanding boss battles. Every area is filled to the brim with information about the game\u2019s in-world history and is aesthetically distinct from every region preceding and succeeding it, a stark contrast to the unstimulating monotony and abysmal repetition of many open-world games released today.\n\nIn an era when big-budget, highly anticipated games are cash grabs being released in an unfinished state, \u201cElden Ring\u201d is a diamond in the rough. It is both a culmination of FromSoftware\u2019s previous work and an innovative step forward in the gaming industry. The game\u2019s success is a testament to the unparalleled passion put into it and the genius of the entire FromSoftware team. \u201cElden Ring\u201d catapulted FromSoftware into the public eye in an unprecedented manner and is a gleaming example of what AAA titles should aspire to be, and with a DLC in development, the game\u2019s mountainous success over the past year does not seem to be slowing down any time soon.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nBy Cl\u00e9mence-Maureen Feniou March 21, 2023 at 7:37 pm PDT\n\nTuesday morning looked nothing like Southern California. Pouring rain drenched Allyson Felix Field, resulting in the Trojans taking multiple drills inside. But with the conditions being insufficient for the 40-yard dash for nearly the first two hours, the players finally made it outside around 10 a.m. The on-field workouts were finally able to start and included the 40-yard dash, shuttle and route runs. Thirteen current Trojans participated under the watchful eyes of each of the 32 NFL teams.\n\nUSC\u2019s Pro Day also marked running back Travis Dye\u2019s return to the field after his season and career-ending injury against Colorado on November 11. Dye recorded 16 reps on the 225-pound bench press and, off a severe ankle injury, ran for 4.75 on the 40-yard dash.\n\n\u201cI wish I had better 40-yard dash weather conditions,\u201d Dye said. \u201cEvery time I sucked my foot up, it felt like I was running in the mud.\u201d\n\nBut after breaking his left ankle fibula back in November, Dye was excited to finally be back on the field.\n\n\u201cIt was tough, it was heartbreaking [the injury],\u201d Dye said. \u201cI had the people behind me ... everybody behind me really uplifted my spirits.\u201d\n\nDye said he recovered from the injury pretty quickly and even considered pushing it if the Trojans made it to the College Football Playoff. But now, back at 100%, the Trojan is ready for the next step.\n\n\u201cI feel like my whole college career has been preparing me for this, this moment right there,\u201d Dye said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll always be grateful for that. I\u2019ll always be a Trojan, I\u2019ll always be a Duck.\u201d\n\nConditions could not have been worse, and no one had an exceptional performance in the 40-yard dash. Out of the 15 Trojan prospects, only six decided to run. Wide receiver Tyrell Bynum had the best performance of the day, with a 4.5. Other notable times included a 4.62 from running back Brandon Outlaw and 4.65 from defensive back Micah Croom.\n\nFollowing the 40, defensive linemen Brandon Pili and Tuli Tuipulotu displayed their defensive skills and agility with a range of exercises, working on their bends and hands in various drills on the field \u2014 an occasion for NFL scouts to test the players after USC\u2019s poor defensive performance during the games late in the season.\n\n\u201cI got a couple hard comments about how we ended the season, so they really caught me off guard with that one,\u201d Tuipulotu said. \u201cI mean they\u2019re trying to get you out of your comfort zone, try to see what type of person you are, how you respond to that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nDue to the difficult weather conditions, star prospect Jordan Addison opted out of running. The wide receiver chose to focus on running a few routes on the field instead.\n\n\u201cWhen the rain came down, I was like, \u2018Okay, now I\u2019m really going to show them what I\u2019m about,\u2019\u201d Addison said. \u201cOn any surface, I\u2019m going to get to it. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s snowing or anything. I\u2019m going to show them that I\u2019m willing to come out here and do whatever they want me to do.\u201d\n\nEven with the rain and the waterlogged field, Addison showcased some runs, confident that his skills might help him get drafted in the right team.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m the best wide receiver in this draft,\u201d Addison said. \u201cI can come into a new set, perform really well early, I can play any position on the field ... run any route, intermediate, shallow, deep.\u201d\n\nAddison also scored the best time on the shuttle run clocking in at 4.15 seconds, ahead of Bynum with 4.19. The roles were reversed with the 3-cone with Bynum taking the best at 6.97 seconds, over Addison\u2019s 7.05.\n\nEven after a difficult session due to the weather, a lot of the USC coaches were seen congratulating their players and hoping they\u2019ll see them in the NFL.\n\n\u201cThey prepared me very well. Shout out to Coach Helton and Coach Lincoln for all the ways they\u2019ve helped us,\u201d Tuipulotu said. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to get to the next level.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/21/defying-all-odds-saneel-sharma-shines-a-light-during-dark-times-for-the-queer-community/", "response": "```\nDefying all odds: Saneel Sharma shines a light during dark times for the queer community\n\nEven as Republicans across the country attempt to restrict drag, the show goes on for Ra Oblivion.\n\nBy Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan March 21, 2023 at 6:12 pm PDT\n\nEvery individual holds within them a significant moment that leaves a lasting impression. For Saneel Sharma, that moment occurred during his sophomore year of high school when he was performing drag in his room, feeling his best. It also turned out to be one of the worst moments in his life, when his mother walked in on him mid-transformation.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty traumatic for everybody. For a while, some of us thought that we would probably have to take Saneel in,\u201d said Carrie King, Sharma\u2019s high school art teacher.\n\nAfter that incident, the aspiring performer led a double life \u2014 one as Saneel Sharma, a gay man whose parents were still struggling to accept him, and another as Ra Oblivion, a drag queen who could only come to life while away from home. Drag became Sharma\u2019s refuge as his family failed to provide him with the freedom he needed.\n\nThe performer describes his drag as \u201cspicy.\u201d A fusion of his Indian background and \u201csex appeal\u201d from western cultures, Sharma\u2019s identity exudes through their alter ego.\n\n\u201cDrag for me feels less of a persona. It\u2019s more of an extension of my identity,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, his way of expression is now a target of right-wing legislation attempting to restrict safe spaces for the queer youth, specifically, drag queens. While laws such as the Tennessee bill do not directly affect Sharma, a California native, they force others among the LGBTQ+ community to either go back into the closet, or in some instances, end their life.\n\nAccording to a survey from the Trevor Project, nearly half of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year \u2014 at least one queer child attempts suicide every 45 seconds.\n\nNow, as Sharma recalls his own battle of coming out to his parents five years ago and dealing with the intersectionality of being queer and Indian, he finds these laws as an abrupt wake-up call in a \u201cprogressive times\u201d like 2023.\n\nGrowing up in Hayward, California, Sharma had a hard time fitting in. He was raised in what he described as a \u201cliberal leftie\u201d family \u2014 they agreed with all political views except those regarding gender identity. Despite being known as the heart of America\u2019s first annual gay prom, Hayward only had two openly gay men, according to Sharma.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to get bullied for it, you were just going to get shit-talked,\u201d he said.\n\nEven in an environment this tense, Sharma found \u201chis person.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a friend, a family member or even a romantic partner, it was his high school art teacher, Carrie King.\n\n\u201cA gay mom,\u201d he called her. \u201cShe gave me a space in that classroom to express myself.\u201d\n\nSharma had been performing drag for a long time before he found King, at least in secret. Whether it was in his bathroom right before showering or in his art teacher\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI wanted to give her a safe space, but I also wanted to make sure that she was safe,\u201d King said.\n\nSharma recalled Halloween of 2019 with a mix of pride and disappointment. It was the first time he decided to dress as a drag queen. Fearing his parents finding out, Sharma turned the most unconventional of places into his dressing room \u2014 a computer lab.\n\nWith black pants, a sheer black top, \u201cfeminine\u201d makeup, black stilettos and a blonde beehive wig, Ra Oblivion made her first public appearance, even if it was just for a night.\n\n\u201cI felt power in what I was wearing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re in your own element and nothing can destroy you.\u201d\n\nDrag is a safe space for Sharma and others like him. However, their safety and freedom are threatened in several states throughout the U.S. Bills in at least eight states seek to restrict drag performances as part of a broader right-wing attack against LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n\u201cIt gets to you, he said. \u201cIt makes me sad to think that some other Indian kid in Tennessee doesn\u2019t have the same resources as me.\u201d\n\nKing, a drag performer and mother of a queer child herself, shares the same view as Sharma.\n\n\u201cFear and misunderstanding about drag, transness and femininity is a contributor to the hate,\u201d King said.\n\nThis wave of drag show restrictions comes as Republican-led statehouses push other legislation targeting the transgender community. In fact, such laws lead to an increase in violence against the queer community.\n\nLGBT individuals are nearly four times more likely to be victims of violent victimization, such as rape, sexual assault, aggravated or simple assault, compared to non-LGBT individuals, according to a study by the UCLA Williams Institute.\n\nFurthermore, LGBT individuals are more likely to experience violence from both acquaintances and strangers.\n\n\u201cDrag show access is crucial for young trans kids and other gender queer kids to feel seen,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWe need an outlet.\u201d\n\nAs someone who grew up in a space with no drag shows, Sharma\u2019s journey in finding Ra Oblivion was filled with challenges \u2014 \u201cI had no reference point.\u201d\n\nAs a queer Indian American, his sole exposure to drag came from a popular Indian comedy show called Comedy Nights with Kapil. However, this show perpetuated the ridicule of its only queer character, Guthi, leaving him with limited options for representation.\n\nThis negative portrayal in combination with conservative politics surrounding LGBTQ+ rights has made it hard for individuals like Sharma as well as those who are considering drag as a form of self-expression.\n\nAngel Ocamposa, a close friend of Sharma, was introduced to drag through the performance of Ra Oblivion. Although Ocamposa was still grappling with his gay identity, he discovered a drag sister in Sharma.\n\n\u201cHe helped me develop the skills to drag by myself,\u201d Ocamposa said, about to cry. \u201cIt just really helped me be more comfortable with who I was not comfortable with before, specifically with my femininity.\u201d\n\nAside from drag, the duo grew a deeper bond \u2014 now they confide with each other with problems both personal and professional.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like annoying siblings,\u201d he said, with a smile from ear to ear.\n\nSharma feels happiest when performing in drag and helping others like Ocamposa come to terms with their form of expression, but he still lives a double life. Sharma\u2019s parents are oblivious to Ra Oblivion.\n\nHe believes the intersectionality of being Indian and queer makes it twice as hard for both his parents to fully accept him, and for him to be able to express himself to them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been the cultural backlash of being queer in the Indian community,\u201d he added.\n\nIn what one could describe as a tear-jerker, Sharma relived the moment he came out to his parents as a gay, in his sophomore year of high school.\n\n\u201cIt led to so many questions being asked and being invalidated immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was nerve-racking.\u201d\n\nThese experiences, among others, have shaped Sharma\u2019s life and are reflected in the way his well-wishers describe him: \u201cBold, unapologetic and real.\u201d\n\nSharma is still in touch with King, his high school teacher, crediting her for much of his early queer experience. King has reciprocated the same love for Sharma and hangs much of his art work in her classes to date.\n\n\u201cI have hope for the future because of people like Saneel,\u201d King said. \u201cTheir willingness to stand up for what you believe in and just be fabulous.\u201d\n\nAs a resident of California, Sharma seeks to leverage the state\u2019s freedoms to create a safe space and raise awareness through his drag performances. He aims to do so by combining his study of design and passion for drag.\n\nRa Oblivion and Saneel Sharma continue their journey despite having to perform drag in secrecy from his family and experiencing hostility as members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe question that arises is, what motivates him to keep going?\n\n\u201cSeeing how happy the kid [Saneel] was in drag reminds me of why I started,\u201d he said.\n```"}

The colors and textures of her exterior hinted at a creative interior. The crocheted items were even made by her own artistic hands.\n\nKolachana is set to have their first group exhibition this month at the IFT Roski Studios Building, titled \u201cMeet Me Where the Sun Sets East.\u201d The opening ceremony will take place Thursday evening and will be open to the public for the following two weeks.\n\nTheir passion for the arts dates back to her early childhood, according to Kolachana\u2019s mother, Sujatha Kolachana. She recalls asking Sarvani\u2019s preschool teacher their best subject in school to which the teacher replied Sarvani was a great artist. The teacher shared that Sarvani could draw perfect circles and shapes, which her mother passed as something humorous and endearing. \u201cI was laughing at that then, but now if I look back, I was like oh she\u2019s right,\u201d Mrs. Kolachana said.\n\nKolachana\u2019s parents are supportive of her artistic career which allowed her to explore their creativity freely. Her parents view education as an opportunity to study a passion rather than for its financial benefits. However, Kolachana attended a STEM-oriented high school where she felt many people didn\u2019t appreciate art and had closed-minded views on it, which drove them to go against the norm of her environment and pursue art as a career.\n\nToday she spends most of their time working in a studio surrounded by easels and painting supplies. Her paintings hang on the white studio walls, and one of them displays a woman standing in a kitchen, staring at a child with fabric across her face. The painting reimagines the scene of Kolachana\u2019s mother and grandmother in Mrs. Kolachana\u2019s childhood, where the grandma would often await her return from the bus stop. At the time, the grandmother was frail and could only watch from her kitchen window. In this interpretation, the grandmother\u2019s role is replaced by the present version of Kolachana\u2019s mother who is watching the younger version of herself come home.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s kind of a gaze of love. Right now I\u2019m trying to synthesize through these layers of memory and family,\u201d Kolachana explained.\n\nThe finished paintings will display images of influential feminine figures in Kolachana\u2019s life whose work is often overlooked by society. Kolachana also explores their Indian heritage and elements of Hinduism through their art. Kolachana says that, conceptually, she wants to explore her mother\u2019s side of the family in her work. However, rather than convey them in their darker moments, she desires to shift the narrative to \u201c...move them from the shadows into the light in some way.\u201d\n\nThe artist shares their experience as an Indian American through art, combining the memories and stories of growing up in an Indian household. For example, their painting includes a kitchen table, designs on the walls and blue curtains, providing images of her environment growing up.\n\nThe artist\u2019s blue crocheted gloves represent much more than they appear. Each thread represents tradition and the generations of women in the Kolachana family who taught each other how to crochet. Kolachana physically includes kalamkari fabric in their art, which acts as a metaphor for the textile performing as a vivid part of the Indian cultural fabric. Kalamkari fabric adorns the bottom of the mother\u2019s dress meanwhile pieces of the textile spread across the child\u2019s face in the painting.\n\nStepping into art spaces as a person of color, Kolachana didn\u2019t see themself in the art displayed in many art exhibitions. The lack of representation acted as a driving factor to paint images of her own culture and experience. \u201c[I\u2019m] trying to get my foot through that door and widening the crack a bit...[By] having that imagery that I saw growing up kind of flow into my images and inundate the worlds that I\u2019m creating, that was a big thing for me,\u201d Kolachana said.\n\nKolachana\u2019s mother shares similar sentiments that art spaces don\u2019t typically highlight Indian culture, therefore hopes Sarvani will be the change to inspire others. \u201cI want people to know different cultures have different ways of expressing their art and that art can be expressed in many ways,\u201d said Kolachana\u2019s mother.\n\nBrett Park double majors in art and communications at USC and will be sharing the art exhibition space with Kolachana. There are themes of culture and identity playing a pivotal role in his art, where he will explore sexual and gender identity as it interacts with and contradicts his Korean-American background. \u201cI find that the masculine ideals that were imposed on me when I was younger \u2014 were very constraining,\u201d Park explained. \u201cThis particular exhibition is about how I handled that growing up and what that meant for me also expressing my culture at the same time.\u201d\n\nHis paintings display nudity and striking art such as a tiger with a penis. Park hopes people understand the deeper meaning of conformity and being forced to follow oppressive ideals behind his art, rather than be distracted by the shocking images and dismiss its significance.\n\nJayna Dias, a Roski art student and peer mentor of Kolachana, showcased their exhibition in February titled, \u201cThe Black Experience,\u201d where she created a safe space for people to experience Black art created by Black artists. \u201cThe fact that I did get an opportunity to showcase my artwork, it felt like really vital to make it something that is important to me, that\u2019s something that I stand for and something that I don\u2019t see in the community very often,\u201d Dias said.\n\nThe limited opportunities for exposure push students such as Kolachana, Park and Dias to highlight their identities and backgrounds through their art at the Roski exhibitions. As the showcase quickly approaches, Kolachana will finally share her culturally rich and feminist art with the rest of the world, one brush stroke at a time.\n\n\u201cI just think she is so talented. She\u2019s so creative when it comes to just her brushwork, her choices in palettes, her subject matter. There\u2019s always something so stably Sarvani about what she does,\u201d Dias said.\n```"}

A group of USC Thornton students originally organized The Sunset Show as a requirement for their live production and promotion class. Students were instructed to form groups and put together a live event all on their own.\n\nLizzie Marcou, a music industry sophomore student, is the lead vocalist and main songwriter for the band Dear Elise. Her band will take the stage alongside two other indie rock bands at USC, My Betsy and Jack Romero, on Thursday at the Sunset Show to raise money for the Trevor Project, which is an organization that seeks to prevent suicide between LGBTQ young people by providing professional counseling.\n\n\u201cSupport [for] this specific event is really important to me because multiple members of the band come from the LGBTQ+ community,\u201d Marcou said. \u201cBeing able to support other artists that come from that community is just a really important thing to us.\u201d\n\nMia Corona, Dear Elise bassist and a film major student from Pasadena City College, said that she is very excited to be part of this event that benefits the Trevor Project because she is part of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool to be involved in a scene that feels really accepting, especially with how things are going right now in our country with LGBTQ communities,\u201d Corona said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to feel welcome sometimes, and I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just really exciting to know that there is a place for musicians that are not straight.\u201d\n\nIn addition to raising money for this cause, the band said they are hoping to get a lively response from the audience to make a name for themselves.\n\n\u201c[This event] is great because it\u2019s opening the door to a crowd that is really suited for us, with a much younger and energetic audience,\u201d said Luca Risucci, the band\u2019s guitarist and a business administration student from California State University San Marcos.\n\nFor them, it is also important to collaborate with other bands and be able to play together, sharing a broader audience and getting to know other indie rock rising artists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be great to get our music out there and also collaborate with other bands. I know My Betsy is playing and they\u2019re great. We saw them a couple of weeks ago,\u201d Henry Eisenstein, the band\u2019s drummer and an art media design student from California State University San Marcos said. \u201cGetting out there a little more [and] just playing shows in general is fun, but it\u2019s especially going to be cool to play at one of these USC [events].\u201d\n\nDear Elise is a band that aims to portray the \u201cmessed up emotions\u201d that people experience in real life. Marcou talked about her songwriting process. and \u201cmaking music is the way [they] cope in the way that [they] get through it,\u201d Marcou said.\n\nThe band started in early 2019 when Marcou, who said loves singing since she was three years old, asked Risucci, who she met through the Paramount Academy of Music years before, to accompany her on guitar on some of her original songs. After that, they started making new songs and recruited the other members for the band. The four of them have been playing together ever since.\n\n\u201c[I joined the band] about March or April of 2019 and then [Marcou] and I started writing more songs over that summer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recruited the rest of the band from there.\u201d\n\nThey have played at different venues in L.A. such as the Troubadour, The Mint and The Echo and have a \u201cBlack Sheep\u201d by Metric cover that reached over 74,000 reproductions on YouTube.\n\nThe band is preparing to release new singles in April for their new EP called \u201cThe World Wasn\u2019t Big Enough,\u201d which has the members of the band very excited, but they hope to bring new songs and covers for the Sunset Show.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to be playing a couple of new songs and a couple of new covers that we haven\u2019t played before, so that should be a lot of fun,\u201d Eisenstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re just excited for the 23rd.\u201d\n\nThe Sunset Show will be held this Thursday, March 23, and you can purchase pre-sale tickets on their website.\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBy Ethan Huang March 21, 2023 at 12:37 pm PDT\n\nIn 1991, Akira Hirose worked as a chef at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. While he was trained in French cooking, his boss asked him, \u201cChef Akira, can you do something to add in an Asian twist?\u201d The restaurant had a Hong Kong background, but Akira was not too familiar with Chinese cuisine. Instead, he decided to pick ingredients from his home country: Japan. \u201cI started using wasabi. I started using miso,\u201d he said. Thus, his signature miso-marinated Chilean sea bass was born, as was his unique duality of Japanese and French cuisine.\n\nTwo years later, he joined the Transamerica Building\u2019s Tower Restaurant, where he served an unexpected guest. \u201cI was very happy to receive the Japanese Emperor and the Empress to the Tower Restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cI served to them that miso-marinated Chilean sea bass. One time lunch. But if my grandfather was alive, he [would have been] so happy.\u201d\n\nBorn in Kyoto, Japan, Hirose\u2019s life and career was a global one, as he bounced between countries to pursue a career he had in mind since he was eight years old. \u201cYou know, sometimes the elementary school teacher asks you, \u2018what do you want to be in the future?\u2019 recalls Hirose. \u201cSome students said, \u2018I want to be a nurse,\u2019 \u2018I want to be a policeman,\u2019 \u2018I want to be a baseball player...\u2019 but I wrote, \u2018I want to be a chef.\u2019\u201d\n\nA painting of Ch\u00e2teau d'Azay-le-Rideau, the castle in the French commune where Hirose once worked. It is also his current restaurant Azay's namesake. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nHe began by studying in France for eight years before he arrived in Los Angeles for the first time in 1981, taking a job at a restaurant named L\u2019Orangerie, where he met his future wife. He worked several jobs, opened a restaurant in Kyoto, and eventually settled in Pasadena in 1998, running a fine dining restaurant named Maison Akira that served French and Japanese cuisine. But after 20 years there, he closed its doors and returned to his roots in L.A.\u2019s Little Tokyo in 2019 with a casual eatery named Azay, after the French commune where he once worked.\n\n\u201cNow I help the Japanese American community most of the time with a small restaurant, three times smaller than before... no white tablecloths... but now it\u2019s an open kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see people enjoy, laughing, and when I see people having a good time with a good meal, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nOn a usual day, the restaurant is buzzing with life, as Hirose and his team work to cook, plate and serve food to customers. People even make reservations just to have lunch at the restaurant.\n\nCustomers eat inside Azay. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBeyond cultural influence, each dish on Hirose\u2019s menu has an aspect of his life and family woven into it. \u201cBarbecue eel. It\u2019s called hitsumabushi... you eat it two ways: straight like this with rice and another you put in broth,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo that\u2019s Nagoya style. Why do [I] have it? Because my mom went to high school [there]. Every dish has a connection.\u201d\n\nBut creating a unique menu isn\u2019t Hirose\u2019s only responsibility and as a business owner, the post-pandemic world has brought on new challenges. \u201cI think the pandemic changed especially young people\u2019s minds... the government started giving away money to the employees,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now, they want to make money without working, so it\u2019s a hard time to find [staff].\u201d\n\nHe is not alone, as Azay is a family endeavor with his wife and son helping to run the restaurant beside their usual jobs. His wife, Jo Ann Hirose, helps manage Azay outside of her career as a dental hygienist and even contributes to finding healthier options for the menu.\n\n\u201cThis restaurant is truly a family business. Although he, Akira, is the only one fully vested in the business,\u201d she said. She said that her husband\u2019s gastronomic intrigue continues at home. \u201cOnce we get home, he is not cooking but he is watching YouTube videos, studying what\u2019s current in the culinary field... he tries to keep up to date on especially the French and the Japanese culinary scene.\u201d\n\nStill, a family-run restaurant is not without its disagreements according to Akira Hirose. \u201cWe fight, of course, families fight... but we fight for a good reason because we care about this business,\u201d he chuckled.\n\nAzay opened just a few months before the pandemic started, but Hirose adapted to their situation. Offering to-go options, he said that during holidays, they received three times the amount of business than he did when running Maison Akira.\n\nHirose's restaurant Azay located in L.A.'s Little Tokyo. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nMariko Lochridge, a small business consultant at the Little Tokyo Service Center, worked with Hirose during the pandemic to provide meals to low-income families in Little Tokyo. Now, the LTSC is one of the organizations that reaches out to Hirose to cater at their local community events.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always thinking about how the menu can best serve the guests at the event,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference for him if he\u2019s serving an 80-year-old senior who lives in affordable housing or if he\u2019s making a meal for the imperial family of Japan.\u201d\n\nMichael Murata, a local musician and a friend of the Hirose family, echoes these sentiments. He was previously invited to perform at Azay.\n\n\u201c[Hirose] has great presence because he goes so far out of his way to make sure that everyone that he meets is well fed,\u201d Murata said. \u201cHe\u2019s making sure that the community events have what they need, and he offers what he can.\u201d\n\nRecently, Hirose catered for a youth leadership event and the LTSC\u2019s New Years Party for local seniors. To him, Azay\u2019s relationship to the community is crucial to his restaurant\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cSeller happy, buyer happy, and the community happy. If [these] three things should be happy, then I think business can continue for long time,\u201d he said.\n\nHirose adds sauce to a dish of pork belly omelette. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nThis heart for community is also the root of his aspirations after Azay, as he looks to pass on his cooking. \u201cAfter I retire, I want to maybe teach, giving the class at a temple or church,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that this is my goal to give my knowledge to the next generation.\u201d\n\nThrough it, Hirose hopes to share more than his recipes and his dishes, but inspire people to pursue their ambitions, even those that seem distant.\n\n\u201cEverybody should have a type of dream, big dream,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we climb up Mount Fuji, even the highest mountain in California. You have to do that one by one, one step by step. If you don\u2019t stop, you can make it.\u201d\n```"}

They call this lifestyle the \u201cit girl,\u201d like it\u2019s kind of a big deal, right? I try to be. I enjoyed this aesthetic throughout the last semester in my undergraduate year. I chose to spend it in the Syracuse University New York City campus, \u201cthe Big Apple,\u201d the melting pot, the place that hosts millions of American dreams. Or at least, that\u2019s what I thought.\n\nIt was March 11, 2021, five days before the Atlanta spa shootings when a man brutally took the lives of eight people, including six Asian women. Two years later, I\u2019m still reflecting on that day.\n\nA man prays for the Atlanta spa shooting victims in front of the Washington Square Arch in New York City on March 21, 2021. (Photo by Aorui Pi)\n\nSyracuse, a small college town in upstate New York, where my undergraduate school was located, was still covered by inches of snow during March. Multiple flyers with anti-Chinese statements were found in three buildings on campus. The message implied that Chinese students are government agents and \u201cwarned\u201d the campus to be alert \u2013 to be alert about me, I thought, I\u2019m Chinese. I was upset and frustrated. It happened again. Why Chinese? Why me? Did I do something wrong?\n\nWorking in student media, I witnessed several racially-motivated hate crimes on campus over the years, and I remained silent for not \u201cbeing so sensitive.\u201d I questioned the source of my anger and got the answer from a psychology counselor in a Stop Asian Hate open forum, which I initiated. She said the social anxiety comes from my intersectional identities and the long-term suppression of family culture, one that taught me that Asian girls should remain silent and invisible. My upbringing constantly challenged my worldview and the value of life. My multiple identities should be my strength; instead, they marginalize my existence.\n\nTo some extent, I try to blend in at any given social context. In the classroom\u2013a classroom full of white students \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be the person who always raises a question, even if it is my duty as a student. I\u2019m too obvious as an Asian-looking girl and too sensitive as a Chinese student. I\u2019m afraid to dive into many topics: politics, religion, and humanitarian issues. Whenever I stand in my opinion as someone of a Chinese background, there will be counterarguments that I was brainwashed and, even worse, that I\u2019m a \u201cgovernment agent,\u201d as the flyers on campus claimed. My voice wasn\u2019t being valued, I realized.\n\nTen days later, on March 21, I attended a rally supporting Stop Asian Hate in New York City, home to more than one million Asian Americans. Little did my friends and family know, I cried out of anxiety for two days before I finally went to the protest. The pandemic was still a thing in the metropolitan area. I can\u2019t hide the fact that I have monolid, the \u201cAsian eyes.\u201d Shoot, I\u2019m too obvious as an Asian-looking girl. What if somebody hit me around the block? What if somebody pushed me onto the R-train? What if somebody shot me? Did I do anything wrong?\n\nFrom March 2020 to March 2021, more than 6,500 hate crimes against Asian Americans were reported. Asian American women report 2-3 times more incidents of discrimination than men. But I went there, alone. \u201cI had to,\u201d I told myself. \u201cI want to be seen.\u201d\n\nA protester holds a sign saying, \"(we are not) silent Asians,\" during a march for anti-Asian hate in New York City. (Photo by Aorui Pi)\n\nA girl walking next to me shouted for hours during the protest: \u201cAsian lives matter! Stop Asian hate!\u201d While I remained silent the whole time, again, because my culture told me not to bother other people\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d I wanted to blend into this illusion of harmony. If I don\u2019t speak up, then there\u2019s no problem. If we ignore the voices, then everything looks perfect. I was too afraid to express my emotions.\n\nThe girl later complained that the crowd around her was frustrating because they were too quiet. I don\u2019t know if I will ever be like her. I validated myself as a journalist. Even though I was not a journalism student and didn\u2019t have a press pass, I still brought my camera as a prop to look professional. I disguised myself as an observer, not a participant. I don\u2019t want to get engaged in the racial issue, I thought. But I am the issue, right? Am I being too sensitive? How hilarious that I couldn\u2019t even be honest with myself. I even archived every social media post of the protest to hide from my parents and friends.\n\nIn the two hours of walking, an increasing number of people joined in, and cars honked in appreciation for the crowds. Beyond my imagination, I saw some children holding signs even more so than some adults; drivers and pedestrians cheered alongside the rally; I saw love and support instead of anger and frustration. It wasn\u2019t just the people, but also the city showing support. I wouldn\u2019t have felt that power if I\u2019d never witnessed it with my own eyes. It\u2019s a parade.\n\nWhat was happening?\n\nA girl holds a handwritten sign to protest against Asian hate. (Photo for Aorui Pi)\n\nConfronting myself to racism was a powerful lesson I learned in the United States. Since I was protected well with a single narrative and lived under one cultural umbrella that rarely had racial conflicts. The danger of this is that it has downplayed our voices, concealed our rich history, and disregarded our diverse backgrounds. For so long, I\u2019ve tried to blend in this harmony and mask all my differences until someone told me, \u201cyou will never be American enough, no matter how good your English is.\u201d I\u2019ve been so ashamed of my identity that I had ignored the problem of the illusory American dream until now.\n\nI had this pressure to live up to being a \u201cgood Asian\u201d \u2014 If I didn\u2019t reach the standard, there must be something wrong with me. Attending this protest confirmed my dream of becoming a journalist. Bringing more diverse representation on screen is not a politically correct strategy. It\u2019s how journalism should be: a factual story of real people. I spent a long time deciding to write down my own story, and here I am, daring to speak up about it despite wondering if the newsworthiness of it has \u201cexpired.\u201d I want to support my peers or whoever has the same struggle.\n```"}

Their style guide recommends being sensitive when \u201cusing words like \u2018disorder,\u2019 \u2018impairment,\u2019 \u2018abnormality\u2019 and \u2018special\u2019 to describe the nature of a disability.\u201d However, the NCDJ notes, \u201cthere is no universal agreement on the use of these terms \u2014 not even close.\u201d In the context of this article, the word \u201cspecial\u201d is never intended to degrade or to make fun of people with disabilities. It puts the word special as a positive when describing people with disabilities. For Disability Awareness Month, we chose to hear from a variety of voices on disability \u2014 even those that argue for the use of words such as \u201cspecial.\u201d\n\nMarch is Disability Awareness Month \u2014 when we honor the contributions of differently abled individuals in American society. Former president Ronald Reagan recognized Disability Awareness Month in 1987, despite the Americans with Disabilities Act being signed into law on July 26, 1990, which allowed people with disabilities full access to American society. However, in terms of physical access, we still have a long way to go in dealing with the societal misunderstandings and the stigma that comes along when you are a person with a disability.\n\nI want to address one critical issue in the struggle to recognize individuals with disabilities as full members of society, where the research in disability studies must go to enhance the participation of people with disabilities in a global society. Instead, I argue that we need a better way to frame the words used by able-bodied individuals to describe their disabled counterparts. During this Disability Awareness Month, I hope and pray that my words affect the conversations around this campus and disability studies in general. Happy Disability Awareness Month.\n\nWhen thinking about the phrase that I coined, \u201cwe are not disabled but living in a disabling world,\u201d you have to think about how the word disability has a negative connotation and the mere fact that disability is just a label and a societal construct. That is the basis for this conversation. Looking at the phrase \u201cdifferently abled,\u201d a common term used in academia and other spaces, even that word has a negative connotation. \u201cDiff\u201d implies different and differently-abled. It is equivalent to disabled because they both have a negative connotation. We should use \u201cspecially-abled\u201d because that has no negative connotation. Words can make such a big difference in how people perceive specially-abled individuals. If we use the word \u201cspecially-abled,\u201d it implies that yes, these individuals have special needs, but they also have special gifts as well. For example, see Kodi Lee, the first contestant to win America\u2019s Got Talent with a disability. He has severe blindness and severe autism. He also has savant syndrome, which allows him to play the piano exceptionally well. Despite his challenges, he has a special ability. So, the phrase \u201cspecially-abled\u201d applies to him and can be used to describe anyone because all these individuals are unique, even in the most severe cases of disability.\n\nSpecially-abled individuals are significant to their families and can have a meaningful impact, no matter the severity of one\u2019s special needs. This phrase would encompass all people with disabilities, from the neurodivergent to physical disabilities, learning disabilities and multi-disabled, to the blind and visually impaired, to the deaf and hard of hearing communities. This phrase is a positive spin on their different disorders and challenges. From a practical matter, it would make it easier for parents with non-disabled children to explain what is special about their siblings, friends or family members. Framing it this way does not imply that people with disabilities are not different; instead, it shifts the focus to something positive.\n\nWhen I first began to research ableism as a construct and from a social model framework, I slowly began to understand that there is no way to eliminate the stigmas inherent when you come across somebody who looks different than the norm. Although other types of biases and stigmas are different in these marginalized groups, the experience of being \u201cothered\u201d is the same. There is a psychological component here that I found when taking Professor Roberto Suro\u2019s Advocacy and Communications course. In this class, we discussed Daniel Kahneman\u2019s \u201cThinking Fast and Slow.\u201d In it, he discusses an experiment by himself and his colleagues called the \u201cbat-and-ball\u201d experiment. This is the experiment and the analysis. \u201c...A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? A number came to your mind. The number, of course, is 10: 10\u00a2. The distinctive mark of this easy puzzle is that it evokes an answer that is intuitive, appealing, and wrong. Do the math, and you will see. If the ball costs 10\u00a2, then the total cost will be $1.20 (10\u00a2 for the ball and $1.10 for the bat), not $1.10. The correct answer is 5\u00a2. It is safe to assume that the intuitive answer also came to the mind of those who ended up with the correct number\u2013they somehow managed to resist the intuition...More than 50% of students at Harvard, MIT, and Princeton gave the intuitive\u2013incorrect\u2013answer. At less selective universities, the rate of demonstrable failure to check was in excess of 80%. The bat-and-ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible...\u201d (Kahneman 2011) \u2014 Daniel Kahneman, \u201cThinking Fast and Slow\u201d\n\nHis findings fascinate me because it shows that people are very gullible and very susceptible to their pattern of thinking. They don\u2019t want to spend time thinking. Thus, this is why stigmas are so rampant in our global society because people have fixed ideologies about each other, especially about specially-abled individuals. In this framework of thinking, Kahneman proves that there isn\u2019t a way to fix people\u2019s ideologies or stigmas because they are hardwired into somebody\u2019s brain, such as something as simple as language, just as an example. Even if we were to teach our children about specially-abled individuals, the social cues the youngsters receive from the adults around them might negatively influence them and expose them to unforeseen biases.\n\nWhen talking about people\u2019s stigma and the statement that I coined, \u201cWe are not disabled but living in a disabling world,\u201d there is no way to fix that in a legal sense or from a political sense because specially-abled people cannot change the cards that they were dealt. Yet, non-disabled people cannot change how they think. That\u2019s what Kahneman\u2019s experiment proves: it\u2019s human instincts, not a human desire. They don\u2019t mean to stigmatize specially-abled individuals, but it\u2019s human nature or, in other words, the cost of being human.\n\nIn the field of disability studies, a fundamental question has not been answered, which is: how do we frame disability as not necessarily a medical issue but as a societal construct? Currently, in the field of disability studies, they often look at disability from rehabilitation or an integration framework, as we see in Torn Shakespeare and Nicholas Watson\u2019s \u201cThe Social Model of Disability: An Outdated Ideology?\u201d This pair of academics argue for integration principles, such as finding appropriate housing and suitable jobs, which allows disabled people to be integrated into society. But the issue with integration principles is that we are trying to fit them into societal norms, and specially-abled people will not be able to fit into societal norms. But there becomes a more significant issue, as we see in Kahneman, that has to do with the rewiring of able-bodied individuals and their willingness to learn new thinking methodologies. It all comes down to the desire to learn and compassion, which is a conversation that is not happening in the world of disability studies at present. If abled-bodied people want to achieve this utopian dream in which specially-abled people are integrated fully into society, reframing the terminology from \u201cdifferently-abled\u201d to \u201cspecially-abled\u201d might bring us one step closer.\n```"}

She has worked her way from interning with a U.S. Representative during undergrad to covering the George W. Bush campaign, and finally making her way to working at the White House. While at the White House, her primary responsibility is ABC Radio, where she not only covers Washington politics but hopes to cover different perspectives across the country. Although she was certain she would go into politics, she ended up catching the \u201cjournalism bug,\u201d as labeled by colleagues from her previous internship, resulting in her launch into a remarkable career in journalism and reporting.\n\nTell me about yourself outside of work.\n\nI have three kids. I have a 9-year-old, almost turning 10. She\u2019s in fourth grade. Then I have 7-year-old twins, who are fun and energetic. They\u2019re very geeky kids. They know a lot about politics. They pay attention to things and they\u2019re interested in the stuff that I do at my job, which is really cool. I met my husband here in D.C. and he works at the World Bank. He\u2019s a policy person who understands what\u2019s happening at my job and he\u2019s really interested in that. I find it funny I\u2019m talking to you on the Super Bowl day because we met while watching football. We met talking about watching football because he was with all his friends who are Washington Football fans and I\u2019m an Eagles fan, and that\u2019s how we first met. Football [has] always been a big part of all of us and going to games.\n\nWhat led you to pursue journalism? How did you gain interest in it?\n\nSo, I went to Georgetown. I grew up in Philadelphia, and I came to Georgetown for college and was a government major and thought I wanted to go into politics. I interned on Capitol Hill starting my second semester [of] sophomore year. I was working for a congressman [Rep. Michael Castle (R-Del.)]. I interned for the same congressman for five semesters and two full-time summers. So that\u2019s what I thought I was going to do. I\u2019ll graduate and I\u2019ll work on the Hill. If I ever wanted to consider TV journalism and politics. I probably should consider an internship while I\u2019m still in college. [In] my second-semester senior year, I applied for an internship at ABC \u201cThis Week,\u201d which is the Sunday morning show. I got the internship. I\u2019m doing that like five days a week, kind of still working for the congressman, which they [ABC News] knew. And after like a week I was like, \u201cOh wait this is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing, I get it. This is a better fit. I am better at this. I am better at writing the questions for the journalists. Not writing the answers for the congressman.\u201d I applied for some journalism jobs and ABC hired me right after my internship ended, after graduation. That was the summer of 2000. I have not left. I have been at ABC since then.\n\nWhat does your typical day look like?\n\nI get up. I start getting my notes ready around 6. I start filing pieces in that 6 o\u2019clock hour. Then I start the two-way [radio interviews] around 7, and then I do that for about three hours. I\u2019m usually so busy in those three hours of talking to [ABC] Radio stations that that\u2019s the priority at that point. So much of our schedule, too, is dictated by the president\u2019s schedule. You know, today, right now, it\u2019s almost 5 o\u2019clock, and we don\u2019t know what tomorrow\u2019s schedule is. Your schedule is just so driven by the president\u2019s schedule, the legislative schedule, and that\u2019s just kind of how Washington works. So we\u2019ll find out at some point tonight what time the briefing is, what time he\u2019s speaking, and then we plan everything around that.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned that you\u2019ve covered a variety of topics, including COVID-19 and its effects on families, but also covering politics in the White House. How do you manage to stay educated on these beats?\n\nYou have to focus on the stuff that you\u2019re being asked to report on. For months and months we had to know so much on infrastructure cause that was the main focus of the White House. Ukraine ... came out of nowhere and became a story that we had to really heavily focus on and still do. Even now, infrastructure we still have to focus on so heavily because [President Biden] is doing so many events on the implementation of the infrastructure law. It\u2019s just a lot of reading and if tomorrow, for example, does become a day where there isn\u2019t a big event with the president, but we\u2019ve got just the briefing and then [we] try to use that as a day to catch-up and work on some pitches for other topics. We\u2019ve got to take advantage of those days where [there is] only one event going on at the White House. Okay, let\u2019s try to use those days to work on another story [about] something else. Because Friday, when I was at the White House, it was so busy, we were just running back to back to back events from morning till 6 o\u2019clock. You know, you can\u2019t do anything else except just cover what\u2019s in front of you.\n\nFrom what you told me and what I\u2019ve gathered, you\u2019re very passionate about what you do and your job. Is there somebody who had an influence on you professionally or has inspired you?\n\nYeah, I think several people. One, Martha Raddatz, who\u2019s still currently working at ABC. She was somebody that always encouraged the young producers to be able to do more. Back when I [worried] I was not qualified to be doing some of these things. She\u2019s like, \u201cYes, you are and you\u2019re not going to learn unless you do it. That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to learn, by being on the road, by being out here and coming with me to Iraq and Bahrain. Coming with me on these big trips and doing big work. That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to get better at it.\u201d [Martha] is also a mom. She was so wonderful about teaching me at a young age before I was married, before I had kids and how you can do this business and have kids and be present with your kids, but also still be able to travel and do high-level journalism. [She] explain[s] in a very candid way about how it\u2019s hard and you can\u2019t have it all.\n\nHow do you balance your personal morals or set your own biases aside when pursuing a story?\n\nThat\u2019s a tough one. I mean, you know, especially covering politics and, you know, it\u2019s hard when you\u2019re covering campaigns. I think it\u2019s just trying to ask the question in as straightforward a way as possible. Remember that you\u2019re asking for not yourself. You have to take a step back and think about the policy impact of it and think about why that person made the decision that they did or why they\u2019re about to do it the way they\u2019re about to do it. And think of what the other side of it or the multiple sides of it and try [to] not think of it just from your own perspective.\n\nHow do you manage to get over your nervousness, anxiousness or uncertainty before reporting, especially with the White House?\n\nI think the big thing to help with the nervousness is preparation. Any time we go into a briefing or walk into the Oval Office, I was in there on Friday when he was meeting with the president of Brazil. I\u2019m not going to speak for other teams, but my team, we don\u2019t wing it. I went in there with seven questions to be ready to shout at the president. I think feeling confident that you\u2019re ready to go and knowledgeable on your subject and have your questions ready can ease that as much as possible. It won\u2019t make it go away entirely [but] can ease that and make you feel a little bit better.\n\nIs there anything I\u2019m not asking you that you would like to add?\n\nGreat question. One thing I get asked and I\u2019m amazed because it\u2019s not something I thought of when I was your age. But I often get asked about how I think about work-life balance issues. So, you know, as you are thinking of jobs, I will say that it is not the greatest of industries to go into [for work life balance]. You\u2019re going to work crappy shifts and get called because something weird just happened and you got to go cover it. But that\u2019s exciting. It\u2019ll be worth it. If you are expecting to be normal, what maybe your friends are doing right away in their twenties, it\u2019s not like that right away. We are trying to be more focused on that, where if you are not working then you can be off. Whereas for a long time, if people weren\u2019t working, they felt like they had to still be working. We\u2019re trying to get a little better about maintaining some boundaries.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Matt Gentry)\n\nBy Will Simonds March 17, 2023 at 8:38 pm PDT\n\nUSC got a fantastic performance by sophomore forward Rayah Marshall and a clutch, game-tying three by graduate guard Destiny Littleton at the end of regulation. It wasn\u2019t enough against redshirt senior forward Myah Selland and No. 9 seed South Dakota State, as the No. 8 seed Trojans fell 62-57 in overtime in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of our team and I\u2019m proud of the people in the locker room. The journey we went on was an exceptional one,\u201d USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cWe wish it were longer. We wanted to keep playing. I\u2019m really disappointed but the predominant feeling is pride in this group and what they have done for our program.\u201d\n\nThe first half was more or less the epitome of USC women\u2019s basketball this season: an ugly slugfest. The record-setting defense that carried the Trojans to this position remained dominant in the opening minutes. And as usual, sophomore forward Rayah Marshall was at the forefront of that effort. She had three blocks in the first 4:10, as SDSU made just one of its first 10 shots. Marshall would finish with seven rejections, breaking Lisa Leslie\u2019s single-season program record for blocks with 98.\n\n\u201cFor me, I just like to come and compete. I feel like when I\u2019m blocking shots on the defensive end, I\u2019m sparking my team full of energy,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cDefinitely going to have to brag to Lisa a little bit about that. But I\u2019m grateful to have done that and completed that with Coach G and this team this season.\u201d\n\nStill, giveaways plagued the USC offense, preventing it from getting early separation. The Trojans\u2019 entry passes to their forwards were often inaccurate, leading to extra opportunities for the Jackrabbits. After a 12-2 start favoring USC, it went the next six and a half minutes without a point and almost nine minutes without a field goal, bridging into the second quarter.\n\nIn general, USC slowed the game\u2019s pace in its favor, countering the Jackrabbits\u2019 typically quick tempo. The Trojans were able to set their stifling half-court defense more often than not, which inhibited the potent SDSU offense. However, a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the second quarter by Selland, a two-time Summit League Player of the Year, put the Jackrabbits ahead 23-20 at the break.\n\nOffensive issues continued for USC into the third quarter. Though they improved at taking care of the ball after a 12-turnover first half, the Trojans weren\u2019t finding quality shots against an aggressive Jackrabbit defense. Even when USC got open looks in the paint, nothing seemed to fall, like when Marshall got a steal only to narrowly miss a finger-roll layup as the third quarter expired. USC was lucky to still be down just three entering the final period, shooting just 27% from the field up until that point.\n\nBut, as has been the case all season, the Trojans\u2019 defense kept them in it, turning SDSU over 20 times and holding the Jackrabbits to 35% shooting for the contest. Despite an inefficient night from the field, Marshall started to get things going in the fourth. A layup plus the foul put USC ahead for the first time in the second half at 35-34, and she followed it up with a jumper from the foul line.\n\nOn the other side, though, Selland matched Marshall\u2019s efforts. The Jackrabbits\u2019 leading scorer, who finished with 29 points on 10-for-18 shooting, found a pair of buckets to give her team the lead back temporarily. Later, Selland extended the margin to three with another layup at the 1:28 mark.\n\nThe Trojans have been able to guard seemingly anyone this season but couldn\u2019t seem to figure out the 6-foot-1 veteran. \u201cTo me she\u2019s a pro. She scores at all three levels,\u201d Gottlieb said of Selland. \u201cTheir system and their offense makes it really hard. You can\u2019t really double her right because they will kick out for threes.\u201d\n\nThe deficit remained the same for USC when it got the ball back with 33 seconds left, needing just a quick two to stay in it. But the Trojans wanted to tie it now, getting graduate guard Okako Adika open for a three on the right wing. It missed short. However, Marshall made an incredible effort to get the offensive rebound and kicked it back out to the perimeter. Graduate guard Destiny Littleton then drained the second-chance opportunity, almost to her own surprise, leveling the score at 45 with seven seconds left.\n\nUSC still needed a stop to force overtime. And, you guessed it, Marshall was there to disrupt the jumper and record her seventh block of the game as regulation expired.\n\nSelland would answer Marshall again in the extra period, when she completely took over the game. She recorded ten points in overtime, including six free throws and a tough layup around Marshall that put SDSU up seven. The Trojans cut the lead to three with under 30 seconds left and forced a turnover, but Littleton\u2019s 3-point effort this time wouldn\u2019t fall to seal the Trojans\u2019 fate.\n\nThe Jackrabbits\u2019 free-throw shooting was vital in overtime, going 13-for-15 at the charity stripe to maintain their lead. In her final college game, Littleton scored a game-high 18 points but shot just 6-of-19 from the field with five turnovers. Though her defensive effort and 13 rebounds were terrific, Marshall was also inefficient offensively with 17 points on 7-for-20 shooting and 2-for-7 at the line, as USC shot just 31% for the game.\n\n\u201c[SDSU is] a seasoned team,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cThey just took away what we wanted to do. They pressured us. They forced us to take shots that we normally wouldn\u2019t take. And so they kind of just got us out of our rhythm a little bit, and we couldn\u2019t really find the open person.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans finish the season with a 21-10 record, the program\u2019s best mark since 1996-97.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/17/usc-mens-basketball-eliminated-from-ncaa-tournament-in-a-10-point-loss-to-michigan-state/", "response": "```\nUSC men\u2019s basketball eliminated from NCAA tournament in a 10-point loss to Michigan State\n\nBy Will Camardella March 17, 2023 at 2:54 pm PDT\n\nFacing a win-or-go-home situation on Friday afternoon, No. 10 seed USC men\u2019s basketball did not have the offensive performance it needed to keep its season alive. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Trojans scored just 28 points in the second half, as the No. 7 seed Michigan State Spartans pulled away for a 72-62 win in Columbus.\n\nUSC looked outstanding at the end of the first half, battling back from an early 11-point deficit to enter halftime tied at 34. The Trojans made 10 of their final 14 field goals before the break after starting 3-of-12. Despite their slow start, the team was shooting 50% from the floor, and outscored Michigan State 21-10 in the final nine minutes.\n\nHowever, whatever positive momentum USC had built up quickly evaporated once the second half began. The Trojans had two extended scoring droughts in the second half, one keeping them off the scoreboard for three and a half minutes, while the other saw USC score just two points in over seven minutes.\n\n\u201cI thought in the second half there were a couple of possessions where we went one-on-one too much instead of playing basketball the way we\u2019re capable of,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said after the game. \u201cAnd then we missed some wide-open, timely shots. It\u2019s hard to not make timely shots and turn the ball over, and some of those turnovers were just self-inflicted with our guys losing the ball.\u201d\n\nThe Spartans made life very difficult for the Trojan guards, playing very physically and forcing them into contested jump shots. In the rare instances that they did get a good offensive look, they could not make Michigan State pay nearly often enough. In the second half, USC shot 34% from the floor, and missed six of its first seven 3-point attempts.\n\nSelf-inflicted wounds also plagued the Trojans late. While USC only turned the ball over three times in the first half, it had eight giveaways in the second, leading to 14 points for its opponent.\n\n\u201cI know that there was a lot of pressure on these guys in the second half when we got down,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt is frustrating at times throughout the season, but for the most part our guys played the right way. [Senior guard Boogie Ellis\u2019] assist to turnover ratio was two and a half or three to one in the last 10 or 12 games. Unfortunately today, it caught up to us in the first half and just wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trojans were failing to score, the Spartans ripped off 11-2 and 13-2 runs. The latter run, coming in the final 10 minutes of the game, turned a four-point contest into one that was completely out of hand. The run culminated with back-to-back 3-pointers by graduate forward Joey Hauser and sophomore guard Jaden Akins, ballooning the Michigan State lead to 15 points and sending the heavily pro-Spartan crowd into an absolute frenzy.\n\nHauser was particularly deadly for Michigan State, finishing with a game-high 17 points and shooting 4-for-6 from beyond the arc. Akins, senior guard Tyson Walker and junior guard A.J. Hoggard also finished in double-figures for the Spartans.\n\nEllis had his worst game in months. He had the highest scoring average of either team, averaging over 18 points per contest, but only scored six on Friday afternoon \u2014 his lowest point total since December 7. Ellis shot 3-for-12 from the field, and missed all three of his 3-point attempts.\n\n\u201c[The Spartans] did a great job,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI let my team down today. I didn\u2019t change my pace all year. All year I felt like I played with a great pace, but today I played too fast, so that\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nEllis\u2019 first basket of the game came with 3:12 remaining in the first half, as he seemed hesitant to shoot the basketball after a few early misses. He came out of the locker room much more aggressive to start the second, making the first two field goals for USC by driving to the rim for tough layups, with a potential third make being called back for an offensive foul.\n\nHowever, Ellis had a much tougher time penetrating the paint after those two shots, as the Spartans held him off the scoreboard for the final 16:52.\n\nFifth-year guard Drew Peterson and sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters both struggled as well in the last 20 minutes. The two shot a combined 3-for-12 from the field and 1-for-4 from three, after shooting 5-for-9 in the first half and accounting for two of USC\u2019s three 3-point makes.\n\nNot ready to pack it in just yet, sophomore guard Kobe Johnson, who finished with 13 points, hit two triples of his own after the four-minute mark, bringing the Trojan deficit back down to single-digits.\n\nSeeing that Michigan State was going to run out the clock as much as possible, USC began fouling intentionally. In the next two minutes, the Spartans missed four of their next five attempts at the line, including the front ends of three one-and-ones, giving the Trojans a golden opportunity to continue to eat into the MSU lead.\n\nWith the chance to pull off a miracle, the USC offense went ice cold one final time. On the five possessions following Johnson\u2019s second three, the team shot 0-for-3 from the floor and turned the ball over twice, all while Michigan State could not knock down a free throw.\n\nUSC did not score again until 47 seconds were left in the game, and by that time, it was already too late.\n\n\u201cWe tried to find the best shot possible,\u201d Peterson said about that final sequence. \u201cWe missed some timely shots, they hit their timely shots ... I trust Boogie to take all those shots. Sometimes that\u2019s the way the ball rolls, there\u2019s no blame to go around.\u201d\n\nThe unlikely offensive leader for the Trojans was redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan. Morgan, who had scored eight points in his last four games combined, finished with a game-high 14 for USC. He was the beneficiary of some great ball movement in the first half, where he scored 10 of his points and shot a perfect 5-for-5 from the field.\n\nThis loss marks USC\u2019s second consecutive first round exit from the NCAA tournament after falling to the Miami Hurricanes a year ago. The Trojans finish 2022-23 with a 22-11 record but will see a very resilient season come to an unsatisfying conclusion.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Will Simonds March 17, 2023 at 12:54 pm PDT\n\nAfter her first year in charge, USC women\u2019s basketball head coach Lindsay Gottlieb was left with just six returning players heading into the 2022-23 season. The program had to replace all five starters and two-thirds of the team\u2019s minutes from the previous season. How in the world do you rebuild from that? Thanks to recent tweaks made to NCAA rules, Gottlieb had a pretty easy fix. Enter the transfer portal.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t really be a surprise that there was one specific thing that brought all seven transfers to USC women\u2019s basketball this past offseason. \u201cThese players that came have a lot of faith in me and us that we were going to win,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said, \u201cbecause they all wanted to win.\u201d But this program hasn\u2019t exactly been synonymous with winning as of late. The Trojans hadn\u2019t made the NCAA tournament since 2014 and hadn\u2019t been relevant on the national landscape this century. So, in her second season with USC, Gottlieb had to build the foundation of a winning program.\n\nShe has a proven track record of success across different programs, leading UC Santa Barbara to multiple Big West titles and Cal to the Final Four in 2013. She\u2019s also coached at the highest level, spending multiple years as an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Whatever the inspiration, it is clear that Gottlieb had a specific blueprint for restoring USC to national prominence.\n\n\u201cLindsay is really focused on culture and the rebuilding of the future for USC, not just this year,\u201d junior forward Koi Love, a transfer from Vanderbilt and Arizona, said. \u201cLindsay made it clear that she wanted to create something special,\u201d graduate guard Rokia Doumbia, a transfer via Arkansas and Purdue, said. \u201cHere, we have a bigger purpose,\u201d graduate guard Okako Adika added. She\u2019s played at Odessa College, Butler and TCU en route to USC.\n\nThe theme of changing the program\u2019s culture \u2014 and being the start of something special \u2014 came up often among these transfers, as well as Gottlieb. \u201cWe were really intentional at the end of last year that we had a vision for the direction of the program,\u201d she said. \u201cThe conversations we had with potential transfers were very specific about what they wanted and what we were looking for. ... We really were able to hit the jackpot and bring in seven players who have helped us develop this culture.\u201d\n\nGottlieb knows that broader, substantive relationships are important in not only recruiting transfers \u2014 as opposed to 16 and 17-year-old high schoolers \u2014 but also building that driven, bright culture she repeatedly stresses. After all, many of the transfers cited their prior connection to their new head coach, who previously recruited them while at Cal, as another major reason for coming to USC.\n\nNot only was Gottlieb\u2019s pitch about the program itself attractive, but there\u2019s a larger phenomenon that contributed to the team\u2019s allure to transfers. There\u2019s an interesting parallel that can be made to another group across campus. Gottlieb and USC football head coach Lincoln Riley have both had rather similar experiences over the past year: using the transfer portal early in their coaching tenure to quickly retool a talent-deficient roster of a program that\u2019s had national success in past years.\n\nGottlieb argues that USC has been an optimal platform to bring in transfers in this evolving era of college sports. \u201cThe USC brand name has name recognition across the country. I think we had instant credibility with calling players in the portal that they would pick up the phone and listen, because it\u2019s USC,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo, we have so many incredible graduate school opportunities that makes this a really desirable place.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Gottlieb was able to find an eclectic group of newcomers to begin that something special. But even then, how would it all fit together? It\u2019s hard to blame the media and coaches for picking this unknown squad to finish ninth in a deep Conference of Champions in preseason polls. However, if you ask this group, that unfamiliarity has actually been a bit of a blessing in disguise.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t really know what to expect,\u201d Oregon transfer and redshirt freshman guard Taylor Bigby said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go look at film of us all playing together, unless it\u2019s from this season, which still isn\u2019t technically a lot to look at.\u201d\n\nThe underlying benefits of having so many transfers are even more pertinent off the court. The seven players arrived by way of many different backgrounds, from Mali to Paris to Denmark, from the Big West to the Big Ten to Pac-12 rivals, from junior college to former national champions. Nevertheless, the group has quickly created a strong bond: relating to each other\u2019s struggles and shared experiences.\n\n\u201cIt does [help] because you\u2019re not the only one in your position,\u201d junior guard Kayla Williams, a UC Irvine transfer, said. \u201cThere\u2019s other people that know what you\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great having other people go through the process with you,\u201d Love said. \u201cMost of us are just figuring it out, just like the coaches are. So it\u2019s been us bonding through that and being able to understand each other through that.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing the whole time, of course; it takes time for so many new pieces to adapt. USC lost three of its first four games in conference play, and its offense has been inconsistent at best during portions of the season.\n\n\u201cWe have our ups and downs, and it\u2019s difficult trying to put together a team that hasn\u2019t played together at all,\u201d graduate guard Destiny Littleton said; she\u2019s another two-time transfer from Texas and South Carolina that originally committed to USC out of high school. \u201cI think we know each other now, but there\u2019s still moments when we don\u2019t really know each other. This comes with time we didn\u2019t have, but I think we definitely made the most out of everything that was presented to us. ... At the end of the day, we\u2019ve had way more ups in playing with each other than downs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re going to play with,\u201d Syracuse and Minnesota transfer graduate forward Kadi Sissoko said. \u201cOften it can be hard to build chemistry over the months. So, it\u2019s very challenging, but I like it.\u201d\n\nSissoko welcomes that test particularly because she knows that it will be valuable experience at the next level. As the Trojans\u2019 leading scorer this season averaging 15.6 points per game, the versatile big has professional aspirations after she graduates this year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to come to a new team, be signed and make money,\u201d Sissoko said. \u201cBut you won\u2019t know who your teammates are, you will have a new coach and you need to adapt and be ready to play and win, because that\u2019s what it takes. You\u2019re not always going to have time to adjust, but that\u2019s part of playing professionally.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve probably sensed a trend by now within these transfers: four are graduates playing their last season of college basketball, and five have transferred at least twice. That veteran knowledge, as seen in Sissoko\u2019s mentality, is arguably the biggest key to the Trojans\u2019 instant success this season.\n\nIn particular, Gottlieb says the team really hit its stride in mid-January, when USC won six of its next seven games after that slow start in Pac-12 play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of work and time, because when you have someone who\u2019s been in another program or multiple programs, they\u2019re not coming in with zero knowledge,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming in with what they\u2019ve learned from other places. ... So, I think what we\u2019ve done is continually [help the transfers] find their own identity.\u201d\n\nNot only has specific basketball insight been important, but also the different kinds of leadership among the team. This group of transfers features many unique types of leaders, ranging from Littleton\u2019s loud voice and national championship involvement to the quieter maturity of international players like Sissoko, Doumbia and Adika.\n\nCombined with the familiarity of program veterans like four-year Trojan senior guard Alyson Miura, Gottlieb has enjoyed how this diverse group blends together. In turn, that sets a precedent for the future of the program as well, inspiring younger players like Bigby to carry on that something special.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned patience for sure, because they\u2019ve all been in college for five or six years,\u201d Bigby said. \u201cAnd then leadership ... I want to follow in their footsteps.\u201d\n\nThis quick closeness that\u2019s developed off the court also perhaps relates to the Trojans\u2019 main strength on the hardwood: its tenacious team defense. Though sophomore big Rayah Marshall, who is second in the nation in blocks per game, leads the defensive effort as a holdover from last season, these transfers have made a massive impact especially on that end of the floor.\n\nAdika and Williams were both named Pac-12 All-Defensive Honorable Mentions. Williams in particular was a defensive rock due to her intensity on the perimeter, finishing top 10 in the conference in steals per game. Sissoko also contributed important production on the boards alongside Marshall.\n\nBut the Trojans\u2019 cohesive nature as a group is really what steered them to lead the conference in points allowed and defensive efficiency \u2014 both by significant margins.\n\n\u201cYou always have your goals coming into the season,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAll of us know that we each can play defense and get to a spot when we need to. So, just to see that come together multiple times is amazing.\u201d\n\nAfter such a chaotic and challenging offseason, Gottlieb acknowledges the satisfaction that comes from the program immediately accomplishing its NCAA tournament goal. But she still isn\u2019t too surprised to be here.\n\n\u201c[The offseason] was hectic but fun, and it was a building experience,\u201d she said. \u201cWe brought people here to win and to win quickly ... It\u2019s almost surreal, seeing that vision come to fruition is something I am really proud of.\u201d\n\nThe job isn\u2019t done, though. These transfers, especially the outgoing graduates playing in their final college games, still have work to do. It relates back to the main reason for why they came to USC in the first place.\n\n\u201cWin,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSurvive and advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different when you have nothing left after the NCAA tournament,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cJust being a senior, I\u2019m taking it way more to heart than in years before. ... There are Cinderella teams, and we could very well be one of those teams.\u201d\n\nSo, the only thing left now is to find out if the shoe fits.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Nolan Ezzet March 16, 2023 at 10:13 pm PDT\n\nAfter a bubble-ridden ending to the regular season and a disappointing loss to Arizona State in the Pac-12 Tournament, USC enters the NCAA tournament as a No. 10 seed. The Trojans are set to play No. 7 seed Michigan State on Friday. The Trojans and Spartans present fairly similar teams, but Michigan State tends to have the edge in most categories.\n\nIt all starts with coaching. USC head coach Andy Enfield\u2019s track record, while limited in longevity, displays great success. He has now brought the Trojans to the NCAA tournament in three consecutive seasons and took them to the Elite Eight two seasons ago. Before he came to USC, he took No. 15 seed Florida Gulf Coast to the Sweet Sixteen.\n\nMSU head coach Tom Izzo now has 25 straight NCAA tournament appearances. He boasts eight Final Four appearances and one championship-winning season. Izzo is well-regarded as one of the best coaches of the 21st century and has the experience needed to move on to the round of 32.\n\nThe Spartans\u2019 roster, too, is more experienced than the Trojans\u2019. USC is led by senior guard Boogie Ellis and fifth-year guard Drew Peterson, but most remaining players have little to no collegiate experience prior to this season. MSU is led by senior guard Tyson Walker and graduate forward Joey Hauser, but its roster features numerous other juniors and seniors who were key players for their tournament team last year.\n\nBoth teams have a similar strategy: defend well and score inside the 3-point line. Both the Trojans and Spartans rank inside Kenpom\u2019s top 50 adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency rankings, although MSU ranks slightly higher in both. USC ranks 299th in percent of its shots taken from 3-point range, while MSU ranks 296th. Both teams prefer higher-percentage shots.\n\nHowever, this presents an issue to the Spartans, who rank third in 3-point percentage (39.5%) but 298th in 2-point percentage (47.7%). Additionally, USC boasts a stout interior defense, allowing just 42.4% of 2-point shots to fall in, which ranks second in the nation. Michigan State must shoot its best shot to win: the 3-pointer, which USC struggles to defend.\n\nUSC\u2019s offense has been reliant on mid-range jumpers and free throws. The Spartans rank 14th in mid-range defense, so the Trojans may need to find a rhythm from behind the arc when they aren\u2019t attacking the basket and getting to the foul line.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 biggest threat may be themselves. They have struggled to take care of the ball and average 12.5 turnovers compared to the Spartans\u2019 10.9. USC\u2019s 1.08 assist-to-turnover ratio ranks 137th in the nation, while MSU\u2019s 1.37 ranks 31st.\n\nBoth teams have similar records in quad 1 and 2 games. USC is 3-6 in Quad 1 games and 7-2 in Quad 2 games, while MSU has performed slightly better, going 5-9 in Quad 1 games and 8-2 in Quad 2 games.\n\nThe location presents a challenge to the Trojans, as they have to travel over 2,000 miles to Columbus, Ohio. The Spartans have the luxury of being a four-hour drive away.\n\nThe age-old Trojan War featuring the Trojans and Spartans will enter the realm of basketball Friday at 9:15 a.m. Both teams have similar resumes and play-styles. MSU tends to fare slightly better, so the Trojans must find a way to force the Spartans to play their game; not vice versa.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade March 16, 2023 at 4:47 pm PDT\n\nAlyson Miura can trace her inspiration back to something that happened over a decade ago. When Alyson Miura was around the age of 10, Miura woke up in a panic at 3 in the morning. Her stomach was in pain, and Miura\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong. They drove to the hospital to meet Miura\u2019s pediatrician, who instantly made everything better the moment he came into the room.\n\n\u201cHe walked in, and I just kind of lit up as if I had to pretend I was okay in front of him, even though he\u2019s my doctor,\u201d Miura said. \u201cHe helped me, and it was just so early in the morning. And I just always remember that as a thing of he really made an impact on my life.\u201d\n\nJust as her doctor was to her, Miura wants to be someone that makes others light up the moment they see her. She\u2019s done that plenty during her college career. As players cycle in and out, she\u2019s been consistent in sacrificing her time to help others feel like they\u2019re part of the team.\n\n\u201cFrom a very young age, I always knew and I still know today that I want to help people in whatever way that looks like,\u201d Miura said.\n\nAlyson Miura has been with USC since her freshman year. She\u2019s just one of three players on the current women\u2019s basketball roster who can claim that feat. And through her four years growing into who she is today, one thing has been central to who she is on and off the court: her dedication to helping others.\n\nAt the start of this season, Miura took it upon herself to help junior guard Kayla Williams get acclimated to playing at USC after transferring from UC Irvine, where she had been for the past three years. Some players might be reluctant to help an incoming transfer who plays their same position and is vying to take minutes away from them. But that\u2019s not Miura.\n\n\u201c[Williams is] just learning the ropes of being in this Pac-12 program and competing every day,\u201d senior guard India Otto said. \u201c[Miura is] really helping her try to get her command and own her voice.\u201d\n\nMiura has extended the same kindness to Otto. The two are best friends and have been since their freshman year at USC. Back in 2020, Otto was dealing with a personal matter, and even though the two had only known each other for around a year at the time, Miura was there to pick Otto up.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for her, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get out of that dark place,\u201d Otto said. \u201cAnd her presence during that time was something that I\u2019m forever grateful for.\u201d\n\nWith her seniority, Miura has become a vocal leader on the team. It\u2019s a team dominated by newcomers and athletes who have been with the program for less than a year or two, but Miura has found her place helping everyone else fit in. Her effort to help new members find their place on the team isn\u2019t limited to just the players \u2014 Miura has the same impact with coaches as well.\n\nAfter former head coach Mark Trakh left the program less than two years ago, Lindsay Gottlieb came in to take the reins of the program. She brought with her an entirely new coaching staff, which is thankful Miura was there to help get the program on the right track.\n\n\u201cShe is a bridge from our coaching staff to the players,\u201d assistant coach Wendale Farrow said. \u201cShe asked questions for both sides \u2014 for what the players need from us and what we need from them. She connects us both. She has done a really good job of seeking out information and coaching from the coaching staff and deliberately bringing it back to our players in a way that they can understand it. She has been one of the first people to come in the office, ask us what our standards are, what our goals are and help us try to set those as we move forward.\u201d\n\nOff the court, Miura also has the same drive to help others. She came to USC thinking she might want to be a doctor, similar to the pediatrician that initially inspired her. After some time, Miura decided she\u2019d rather make a difference in the business world, so she\u2019s pursuing a progressive master\u2019s degree in entrepreneurship and a minor in sports business and management.\n\nMiura isn\u2019t exactly sure what kind of business she wants to start, but she\u2019s considering creating a business centered around helping athletes with mental health and injury recovery. Miura has suffered a couple of leg injuries during her college career, making her feel as if she wasn\u2019t \u201cwhole.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want anyone else to have to experience that same feeling.\n\n\u201cI really felt like I just lost a huge part of my identity because for so long. \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019m Alyson Miura. I\u2019m a student-athlete on women\u2019s basketball.\u2019 That\u2019s how you introduce yourself. That\u2019s always the first thing that comes to mind ... So I just felt like I had lost so much of me.\u201d\n\nWhile she finds out how she wants to help others in the future, Miura is helping and leading others right now. She\u2019s a member of the Trojan Athletic Senate and part of the community service subcommittee. She also interned with Special Olympics in June at Cal State Long Beach.\n\nMiura was \u201cmoved\u201d by the Special Olympians she met during her time at the event.\n\n\u201cI got to help out at the events and see how everything works behind the scenes and interact with the Special Olympics athletes,\u201d Miura said. \u201cIt was just so much fun. It was a really great time, and I have great connections with those people now, so I\u2019ll definitely be volunteering when I can.\u201d\n\nWhile Miura is well on her way to fulfilling her goal of helping others, her team is helping her to fulfill her other set of goals \u2014 those pertaining to the hardwood. Back in October, Miura laid out what she wanted her team and herself to accomplish by the end of her senior season.\n\n\u201cOur main goal right now is to just figure out who we are and what we\u2019re going to be good at,\u201d Miura said. \u201cBut our ultimate goal is obviously to go to the tournament, go all the way if we can and win as many games as we possibly can.\u201d\n\nSince October, the Trojans have figured out exactly who they are. They\u2019re a gritty, lockdown defensive team that prides itself on going toe-to-toe with the top programs in the nation. On Friday, USC will accomplish what Miura considers to be the team\u2019s \u201cultimate goal\u201d of making its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2014.\n\nAlthough Miura didn\u2019t play much during the season, her compassion and leadership during the program\u2019s low points helped the Trojans get to where they are today. As her time at USC wraps up, Miura will be remembered fondly by members of the program \u2014 for being someone who stayed and for offering her time to make the lives of those around her better.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Will Simonds March 15, 2023 at 3:48 pm PDT\n\nUSC women\u2019s basketball hasn\u2019t been to the NCAA tournament since 2014 and hasn\u2019t advanced past the first round since 2006. Despite the program\u2019s history \u2014 which includes back-to-back national championships in the 1980s, the Trojans haven\u2019t been nationally relevant in a long time.\n\nBut things are a little different this season, as head coach Lindsay Gottlieb has led the team to its best record since 1994, the last time USC reached the Elite Eight. The Trojans now have their best chance in years to make a serious run in the NCAA tournament, something Gottlieb is no stranger to herself. During her eight-year tenure as head coach at Cal, she took the Golden Bears to the Final Four as a No. 2 seed in 2013.\n\nUSC also has serious postseason experience on its roster, as graduate guard Destiny Littleton came off the bench for last season\u2019s national title-winning South Carolina team.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at what stands between the Trojans and a deep run in March Madness.\n\nFirst, No. 8 seed USC opens with a first-round matchup in the Seattle 3 Region with No. 9 seed South Dakota State on Friday at 5 p.m. SDSU went a perfect 18-0 in the Summit League, which admittedly is not the most daunting conference schedule. But the Jackrabbits have a rather remarkable non-conference resume despite going just 10-5.\n\nThey beat a pair of NCAA tournament squads, No. 5 seed Louisville and No. 11 seed Mississippi State, back in November. SDSU also had fairly close losses to two more tourney teams, a nine-point loss to No. 6 seed Creighton \u2014 a game the Jackrabbits were winning at halftime \u2014 and a seven-point loss to No. 4 seed UCLA.\n\nAll things considered, losing by 18 points to undefeated top overall seed South Carolina in December is actually a pretty impressive performance given the Gamecocks\u2019 dominance. Furthermore, there\u2019s something to be said about a team that hasn\u2019t lost since that South Carolina matchup three months ago.\n\nFriday\u2019s contest between USC and SDSU should be an entertaining clash between elite defense and elite offense. The Jackrabbits rank No. 5 nationally in field goal percentage at 48% and No. 12 in scoring offense at 79.4 points per game. Meanwhile, the Trojans\u2019 defense is No. 11 in the country in field goal percentage allowed at 35.4%, No. 17 in scoring defense at just 54.8 points allowed per game and No. 5 in blocks at 5.7 per game.\n\nSomething will have to give in this very intriguing opening-round matchup.\n\nIf USC can advance, it will almost certainly draw No. 1 seed Virginia Tech in the second round, which would be held on Sunday at the Hokies\u2019 home court in Blacksburg. Virginia Tech, now 27-4, just won its first-ever ACC tournament title amid the program\u2019s best season this century.\n\nThe Hokies boast plenty of ranked victories over North Carolina, NC State, Duke and Florida State, all coming during their own active 11-game winning streak. That\u2019s a combined 32 consecutive wins currently separating USC from the Sweet Sixteen, a daunting task ahead.\n\nSenior center Elizabeth Kitley recently won her second consecutive ACC Player of the Year award, after averaging 18.6 points per game and 10.6 rebounds per game this season.\n\nA potential matchup between the 6-foot-6 Kitley and USC\u2019s 6-foot-4 sophomore forward Rayah Marshall \u2014 who both rank in the top 15 nationally in both blocks and rebounds per game \u2014 would be an absolute show to watch.\n\nVirginia Tech junior guard Georgia Amoore also hits over three 3-pointers per game, good for ninth-most in the country, a test for the Trojans\u2019 exceptional defense from behind the arc.\n\nIf USC were to pull off a massive upset over the Hokies, a date with either No. 4 seed Tennessee or No. 5 seed Iowa State would likely lie ahead in Seattle for the regional semifinals. The Lady Volunteers went 13-3 in SEC play but struggled against quality competition at just 1-8 versus ranked opponents.\n\nThe Cyclones have a pretty similar resume to USC, but they do have two wins over a Texas team that beat the Trojans by 14 points in December.\n\nFinally, No. 2 seed UConn would be the most probable opponent for USC in the Elite Eight. Head coach Geno Auriemma and the Huskies aren\u2019t quite as dominant as they once were, but junior forward Aaliyah Edwards and a solid supporting cast give UConn a solid chance at making it to Dallas for the Final Four at the end of March.\n\nBut let\u2019s not get too ahead of ourselves \u2014 the Trojans have a long way to go just to make it to the second weekend in Seattle, let alone the third in Dallas.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\nBy Cl\u00e9mence-Maureen Feniou March 13, 2023 at 4:42 pm PDT\n\nINDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 Applause, cheers and songs of encouragement rolled down from the crowd onto Stadium 3. And there, in the middle of all of it, was a former USC Trojan at his first Indian Wells tournament, Brandon Holt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been surreal ... to be here playing in the main draw, it felt a little bit like a dream come true,\u201d Holt said. \u201cI almost thought it would be crazy if, one day, I could play at one of these two places [US Open and Indian Wells]. I got to play the US Open and then now to play here, I feel like I checked two boxes that I didn\u2019t know if they would ever be checked.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old from Rolling Hills, California, is taking significant steps on the professional tour. Winning seven ITF Futures in 2022, he qualified in the US Open, defeating fellow American No. 10 seed Taylor Fritz, winning his first-ever slam and ATP career match. Early this year, Holt qualified at his second Grand Slam, the Australian Open, and won his first main draw round against Aleksandar Vukic.\n\nBut the road was not always easy for Holt. COVID canceled his senior season at USC, and only a few professional tournaments took place in 2020. When everything returned to normal, Holt suffered a hand injury, requiring surgery.\n\n\u201cI had surgery on my hand. I actually watched this tournament two tournaments ago, and I was sitting there watching and didn\u2019t know if I would ever even play again,\u201d Holt said.\n\nIn tennis, a hand injury could terminate a career. But the former Trojan never gave up and sat away from the courts for an entire season before recovering from the injury.\n\n\u201cI came back and didn\u2019t know what to expect. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know if everyone had passed my level up,\u201d Holt said. \u201cI won the first three tournaments back, which was really crazy and a good test on my hand.\u201d\n\nNow ranked No. 193 and fully healthy for over a year, Holt finally had time to adjust from college tennis to the tour. Ranked as the No. 1 recruit in the nation out of Palos Verdes High School, Holt had a successful college career and reached a career-high ranking of No. 4 in the country in singles.\n\nBut the professional tour is another world. Still, there are some aspects of college competition that Holt wishes he could have back.\n\n\u201cCollege tennis has a whole different energy to it than matches. There\u2019s a very different feeling when you\u2019re playing because you\u2019re playing for a team,\u201d Holt said. \u201cYour team that you love and are really close to, they\u2019re running at you and jumping on you ... That\u2019s a feeling that I think is something that I\u2019ll miss forever.\u201d\n\nHolt lost in the first round at Indian Wells against Aussie Thanasi Kokkinakis, 4-6, 1-6. But the BNP Paribas Open is only one tournament out of the entire season. Holt\u2019s looking to play in Miami, then head on to the clay at the French Open, a surface he has not played on for years \u2014 since even before college.\n\nBut if there\u2019s one thing he\u2019s looking to accomplish, it\u2019s getting his spot in the Top 100 before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThat would be great,\u201d Holt said. \u201cFight on!\u201d\n\nAnd for the Trojan legacy on the ATP Tour, senior Stefan Dostanic should join his former teammate soon this summer.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/13/unpack-the-pac-offseason-edition-top-pac-12-prospects-in-the-2023-nfl-draft/", "response": "```\n\u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d is a column by Jacob Hare that discusses offseason football news in the Pac-12 conference. With the combine wrapping up this past weekend, it\u2019s NFL draft season. And there is nothing I love more than the NFL draft. Okay, maybe that\u2019s too far. But seriously, ask anyone who knows me: I live for this event because it is the most incredible reality show in the world. Between the excitement of trades, tear-jerking player stories, rage at your team picking the last guy you wanted or the anxiety of not knowing who your team will select, the emotion is the best part of the event. It\u2019s a rollercoaster, and it\u2019s beyond unpredictable. Except there are the things that will happen every year: A trade is bound to happen, a player from Alabama, Ohio State, Georgia and the other few top chip programs will have a player selected no matter the season. A kicker will never go before the second round (wait, I lied, Tampa Bay drafted that guy from Florida State who was out of the league in one year). But you get the point, and this year will be no different. I can guarantee the Pac-12 will have players drafted, but can I guarantee they will be very good? Let\u2019s dive deeper as I break down the Pac-12\u2032s top five draft prospects.\n\n5. Clark Phillps III, cornerback, Utah, 5\u20329\u2032\u2032, 183 lbs, redshirt sophomore Clark may not be the biggest or tallest cornerback, but he\u2019s a complete ballhawk. He had six interceptions, tied for third in the entire country. He was also the Pac-12 defensive player of the year and a unanimous All-American. I can confidently say he was one of the best cornerbacks in the nation last season, if not the best. What amazed me was that he excelled in both the slot and outside. When you have a 5-foot-9 corner, it\u2019s a concern if he will only be a slot corner, but his performance in college should shut down any noise about that. The most important thing to note about his talent is that he uses his speed to get ahead of bigger receivers, so they have issues with disengaging from him during the route. But that will be much more complicated when he moves to the pro level. Phillps also does a tremendous job making the receiver anxious by nudging or giving him a little push before the ball comes down. He is also a brilliant player, as his ability to read the quarterback is excellent. I expect him to be a late second to early third-rounder in the NFL. His size will likely cause him to tumble on draft boards. I am also nervous that his aggression will draw many flags at the NFL level. He will excel as a slot cornerback, but how highly do teams want to pick a nickel corner?\n\n4. Tuli Tuipulotu, defensive line, USC, 6\u20323\u2032\u2032, 266 lbs, junior After a fantastic junior season, Tuipulotu opted not to return to USC for his senior year and instead entered the 2023 NFL Draft. Tuipulotu led the nation with 13.5 sacks last season and had 37 quarterback hurries last year, and he did indeed have an impressive combination in doing the drills. However, I want to talk about his surprise at the draft. USC listed him as 290, but he weighed in at 266. Tuipulotu may play a different position than a defensive lineman in the NFL. But when asked at the combine about playing multiple roles, he said, \u201cI feel like I can play whatever position.\u201d Nowadays, in the NFL, everybody is looking for versatility. So Tuipulotu opposes himself as an exciting prospect for teams, and I am interested to see his newly displayed versatility\u2019s impact on his stock.\n\n3. Dalton Kincaid, tight end, Utah, 6\u20324\u2032\u2032, 246 lbs, senior In a loaded tight end class, Kincaid has a case to make that he is the best in this year\u2019s draft. After a promising junior year at Utah, he broke out in 2023, leading Utah to a Pac-12 championship. His most notable performance this year was against USC, as he had 244 yards and caught 16 passes, including a touchdown. I remember watching him in that game and believing he would excel at the NFL level. He makes an excellent case as a pass catcher between his route running and athleticism, but his inability to block indicates a problem for me. If he can improve as a blocker, especially as a run blocker, I see him becoming one of the more talented tight ends to be drafted in the last couple of years, especially with the lackluster 2022 tight end class.\n\n2. Jordan Addison, wide receiver, USC, 5\u203211\u2032\u2032, 173 lbs, junior The 2021 Biletnikoff award winner had another fabulous season when he transferred to USC. After two years with two unbelievable quarterbacks, Addison still showed his talent. Let\u2019s talk about what he did with Kenny Pickett at Pitt in the 2021 season. Addison helped Pickett establish himself as a first-round NFL draft pick after he wasn\u2019t even supposed to get drafted a year before. Addison contributed by having 1,593 yards and nine receiving touchdowns. hen, in 2022, he transferred to USC to team up with first-year Trojans head coach Lincoln Riley and sophomore transfer quarterback Caleb Williams. Addison played a pivotal role in helping Williams win the Heisman in 2022. Addison had 875 yards and caught eight touchdown passes. His numbers went down from 2021 because he dealt with injuries for most of the year. However, he showed he could be a true alpha as a wide receiver at the next level. Some may call his 40-yard dash concerning since he posted a 4.49, but he will be able to find ways to create separation and is tough as they come. His on-field combine results should put his 40-yard dash results to rest, as he was a complete stud in mostly every drill besides the 40. However, Addison did suffer a back injury at the combine, but his status is unknown at the moment, so keep an eye on that injury update over the next few weeks. I think Addison has a legitimate shot to be an excellent wide receiver at the next level. He reminds me of Calvin Ridley, so that would be a good player for him to live up to (don\u2019t place bets on the NFL like Ridley did, and you\u2019ll be in good shape).\n\n1. Christian Gonzalez, cornerback, Oregon, 6\u20321\u2032\u2032, 197 lbs, junior The Colorado transfer became a superstar in his junior and only season at Oregon. He has cornerback 1 potential in the NFL because of his fantastic mixture of athletic and physical abilities. Gonzalez tested through the roof at the NFL combine this weekend, which could volt him into the top 7. He has the tools to be a pro bowl cornerback if he can play to his maximum potential displayed at Oregon. \u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

Fury of the Gods,\u201d a Warner Bros. Pictures release. (Photo courtesy of Warner Bros.)\n\nBy Benti Kaur\nMarch 12, 2023 at 10:19 am PDT\n\nSix college journalists had the opportunity to sit down at a virtual roundtable with \u201cShazam: Fury of the Gods\u201d star Zachary Levi Friday morning. Levi cracked jokes whilst also sharing intimate feelings and moments from the production of his upcoming film.\n\n\u201cFury of the Gods\u201d is the sequel to \u201cShazam!,\u201d the 2019 superhero movie that had many interested in when the second film would be released. The film ended on the protagonist, Billy Batson\u2019s foster siblings gaining the same powers he had been granted to turn into an adult superhero when yelling out the word \u201cShazam.\u201d The sequel picks up a few years after the last left off, with this new gang of superheroes doing their best to fight crime in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, in this film they encounter new foes in the form of Greek goddesses ready to reclaim their world and powers which they feel has been taken from them.\n\nIn exploring the plot line for the sequel film, Levi, who plays the lead role of Shazam, says that he had something to do with the involvement of Greek Mythology in the film. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give myself a little pat on the back,\u201d Levi said. \u201dI went to some of the bosses after the first movie because I was already thinking. They were discussing what the sequel could be, or whatever ... So I thought that would be a great place to go. They had an entirely different idea, from what the boss told me then, they had a different way they were thinking about going. Next thing I know they were pitching me an idea and it was all about this Greek mythology, and these daughters of Atlas.\u201d\n\nLevi said that filming this sequel didn\u2019t come without challenges, though. \u201cHonestly, the most challenging thing about filming this movie is as a superhero, or at least the type of superhero that I am, I get to fly, which is awesome,\u201d Levi said. \u201cExcept in order to make that actually happen on screen, that requires us doing a lot of wire work, and in order to do the wire work, you have to wear these harnesses that may as well be diapers of death. Just torture devices that you have to crank down on your whole nether regions, and they chafe and cut and bruise, and they are just not enjoyable ... It\u2019s the small prices to play to get to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cShazam!\u201d franchise has thus far been a standalone film within the DC Universe, and has not yet seen any crossover or connection with the other DC characters. Levi was questioned on whether there would be future crossovers for Billy Batson and what that would look like. \u201cWhat\u2019s really fun about this franchise, not too dissimilar to \u2018Deadpool,\u2019 though we are dissimilar, there is some DNA that we share, but also a lot that we don\u2019t,\u201d Levi said. \u201cWe both get to be the \u2018outside looking in and commenting on\u2019 for our respective universe. And so we are not entirely disconnected from the universe because we get to talk about all of these characters.\u201d\n\nLevi also says that he would \u201clike to work with all of them, any of them. I just want to keep playing this role as long as they\u2019ll let me play it. As we say, that\u2019s all kind of above my paygrade, but I would say Green Lantern would be pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career, Levi has played roles in television, film, theater and voice acting, which each required unique preparation. Levi was asked about the similarities and differences between these roles, especially within his preparation to play a role like Shazam. \u201cWell, I would say probably the biggest difference is this is the only time in my career I\u2019ve gotten paid to be a child,\u201d Levi said. \u201cI can definitely connect with fearing like I might lose connection with a group of people, like a chosen family. I think we can all deal with that feeling that we might be left out or not a part of whatever that is, and I try to tap into that.\u201d\n\nLevi\u2019s previous leading role in \u201cChuck,\u201d the action-comedy television series that ran from 2007 to 2012, shares many similarities and differences to the current role he holds as Shazam. \u201cThey\u2019re both unwitting heroes, so there is some shared DNA in that,\u201d Levi said. \u201cThey both have really great hearts, I think. Both of them really want to do the right thing, they really want to protect their families, they really want to be good leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cShazam: Fury of the Gods\u201d is another cherry on the sundae of Levi\u2019s career. This fun action-comedy is perfect for all ages to enjoy. The movie will hit theaters Friday, March 17.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/03/12/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-drama-with-selena-gomez-and-hailey-bieber/", "response": "```\nA complete breakdown of the drama with Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber\n\nCelebrity-enthusiasts on TikTok can attest to their For You Pages being filled with the drama between pop-star Selena Gomez and her ex-boyfriend\u2019s wife Hailey Bieber. Fans have been dissecting this topic for the past two weeks, but many people are still out of the know. For more on this Hollywood drama, here is an entire breakdown of the issue from start to finish.\n\nThis all began when pop singer and actress Selena Gomez walked the Golden Globes red carpet in January of this year. Many people took to social media to fat-shame and body-shame the artist\u2019s look. Later that same evening, Hailey Bieber posted a TikTok to her page with the sound \u201cI\u2019m not saying she deserves it, but God\u2019s timing is always right.\u201d Fans immediately connected the two events, and speculated that Bieber was fat-shaming Gomez.\n\nBieber took down the post and commented on a fan\u2019s video of the events, which has since been taken down, saying, \u201cI never comment on this type of thing but we were just having a girls night and did a random tik tok sounds for fun. It\u2019s not directed at anyone.\u201d Gomez also took to a fan\u2019s TikTok to respond to the allegations of her being fat-shamed by Bieber by saying, \u201c It\u2019s ok!  I don\u2019t let these things get me down! Be nice to everyone! x.\u201d\n\nGomez went to Instagram Live to discuss this and said that it was more important to her that she is healthy and on her medications than to fit the skinny beauty standard. It is public knowledge that Gomez has been suffering with lupus, an autoimmune disease that attacks the organs, tissues and joints. In 2017, Gomez underwent a life-saving kidney transplant because her organs had been compromised by her advanced lupus.\n\nFollowing her recovery, she has been very public about her health issues, and the medications she is required to take to stay healthy. She has said the various medications she is on cause weight fluctuation in the body, resulting in many insulting Gomez\u2019s weight gain on social media throughout the years.\n\nBack to February 22, soon after this drama died down, Gomez posted a video on her TikTok stories showing how she had messed up her eyebrows whilst doing her makeup. That same evening, Kylie Jenner, who is a good friend of Bieber\u2019s, posted a selfie to her Instagram stories with the text \u201cThis was an accident??\u201d placed directly over her eyebrow. Following that post, she posted a screenshot of a FaceTime call with Bieber of both of their eyebrows in the picture, and tagged Bieber in the story.\n\nWhen TikTok\u2019s drama-lovers began connecting Gomez\u2019s posts with Jenner\u2019s, Jenner was quick to comment on a video explaining the drama saying, \u201cthis is reaching. no shade towards selena ever and i didn\u2019t see her eyebrow posts! u guys are making something out of nothing. this is silly.\u201d Gomez responded with, \u201cAgreed @kyliejenner It\u2019s all unnecessary. I\u2019m a fan of Kylie!\u201d\n\nFans of Gomez took to the internet claiming that there was no way the two events were disconnected, and that Selena is far too nice to the \u201cmean girls\u201d of the industry. This was until shots were fired back. In response to the drama, a video resurfaced that shows Bieber shading Taylor Swift by making a face when her name and music had been mentioned.\n\nThe supposedly \u201cdrama-withdrawn\u201d Selena commented on the video saying \u201cSo sorry, my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game.\u201d This was a surprising twist in the story, as Gomez had never publicly called out Bieber before. Gomez also commented \u201cI love you\u201d on a post where one fan claimed that the \u201cmean girls\u201d and \u201cnepo babies\u201d were treating Gomez terribly and that we were all on her side.\n\nShortly after these comments were posted, Gomez went live on social media, saying that she was going to be taking a break from social media because she\u2019s \u201c30 and too old for this.\u201d In the aftermath of these events, it seemed like the entire world sided with pop-star Gomez by joining #teamselena.\n\nFans have begun to dissect the history between the two celebrities, finding an apparent correlation between them, claiming that Bieber has been \u201ccopying\u201d Gomez for years. The most convincing piece of evidence proposed by fans would be the tattoo that Gomez got below her ear of the lowercase, cursive letter \u2018g\u2019 in honor of her younger sister, Gracie. Not too long after, Bieber got the exact same tattoo with the exact same placement (with no justification as to why).\n\nHer mannerisms and slang have seemingly copied Gomez on multiple occasions throughout the years. I personally believed these to be coincidences, until the number of coincidences began to add up and make me think otherwise. Bieber was a fan of Gomez first, as she was spotted holding a magazine with a spread about Jelena, Gomez and Justin\u2019s infamous couple name, from many years ago.\n\nSome fans even theorize that she orchestrated a breakup between Justin Bieber and Gomez so she could slide in and spend time with him prior to their quick engagement and marriage. The treatment of Gomez from the Bieber and Jenner clan rubs me the wrong way. Although there is no direct evidence of mistreatment, the impression I get from the situation is reminiscent of high school mean girls.\n\nIn terms of the accusation that Bieber has been copying Gomez throughout her career, I\u2019m left with one realization: If Hailey can steal Selena\u2019s man, can she steal her persona too? Before concluding that Hailey is the villain of this story, however, should we instead remember that the media has an affinity for pitting women against each other? Making one seem like the villain the other the hero accepts the misogynistic ways that the industry functions, and the reality that fans of Hollywood feed off of.\n\nIs there the possibility of also accepting the story where Justin Bieber took two women he loved and allowed public opinion to pit them as sworn enemies in the media, humiliating both figures? While this holds true, fat-shaming and bullying is simply not tolerated. I\u2019m not sure about you, but I will be swapping out any Rhode products for Rare Beauty now.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nMarch 11, 2023 at 11:12 pm PST\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good ol\u2019-fashioned best of three? Not only was a season series victory on the line in Saturday\u2019s matchup between No. 1 seed UCLA and No. 2 seed Arizona, but also possible redemption from last season, a potential top seed in the NCAA tournament and, of course, some hardware.\n\nIn the end, Arizona successfully defended its Pac-12 Tournament championship, as fifth-year guard Courtney Ramey\u2019s late three lifted the Wildcats to a 61-59 win in an extremely entertaining contest start to finish.\n\n\u201cI kept telling myself the next shot was going in,\u201d Ramey said. \u201cMy job was to make a play, so I was grateful for the shot to go in.\u201d\n\nIn a matchup between the Pac-12 Player of the Year and the conference\u2019s leading scorer and rebounder, Arizona junior forward Azuolas Tubelis held the advantage early on. He frequently found himself at the line or with an easy layup for the Wildcats, compared to a 1-for-7 start from the field by UCLA senior guard Jaime Jaquez Jr.\n\nWith the Bruins missing their starting forward \u2014 freshman Adem Bona, who sustained a shoulder injury Friday against Oregon \u2014 Tubelis feasted on his matchup against redshirt senior forward Kenneth Nwuba, who made just his third start of the season.\n\nMeanwhile, UCLA relied on its other stellar guards to stay right in the game. Freshman guards Amari Bailey and Dylan Andrews made their first five shots combined, while redshirt senior guard Tyger Campbell converted a layup plus the foul to give the Bruins a 21-20 lead.\n\nJaquez eventually got things going too, with an and-one of his own to put UCLA in front again a few minutes later.\n\nArizona\u2019s frontcourt tandem of Tubelis and redshirt junior center Oumar Ballo were both in foul trouble late in the first half, obtaining two fouls each. That helped soften the loss of Bona for UCLA, allowing it to play with a small-ball lineup while Tubelis and Ballo both sat.\n\nA tightly contested and endlessly exciting first half ended with a narrow 34-33 Bruin advantage. Tubelis starred with 16 points, including 6-for-7 shooting from the line, plus six rebounds in the opening 20 minutes. However, UCLA limited the rest of the Wildcats\u2019 starters to just two points.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re built to play a lot of styles,\u201d Arizona head coach Tommy Lloyd said. \u201c[UCLA is] perfectly comfortable ... dictating the tempo, and then they\u2019re just so good defensively. It\u2019s hard to score on them quickly.\u201d\n\nThe Bruins came out of the break strong, with a 9-2 run to start a second half that was just as intense and entertaining as the first. Arizona was creating open threes and getting second chances on offensive rebounds, but it simply couldn\u2019t cash anything in.\n\nTubelis was held silent in the latter period, with just three points on 0-for-7 shooting, but he was still named the tournament\u2019s Most Outstanding Player.\n\nBut, the Wildcats turned around the foul-trouble tables in the second half. Both Nwuba and redshirt freshman forward Mac Etienne picked up their fourth fouls with over 12 minutes remaining, as Arizona constantly fed its dominant big men on offense.\n\nSo even though UCLA led by five points, the game\u2019s momentum seemed to favor the defending Pac-12 Tournament champions.\n\nEtienne fouled out two minutes later, leaving the Bruins dangerously thin in the frontcourt for the remainder of the game.\n\nMeanwhile, the atmosphere in Las Vegas began to get loud in support of the Wildcats. As has been the case all week in Las Vegas, Arizona fans showed up in full force Saturday night and easily made up a majority of the T-Mobile Arena crowd.\n\nEndless \u201cU of A\u201d chants started to rain down, quickly strengthened by a go-ahead three from junior guard Pelle Larsson.\n\nAs Arizona\u2019s starting guards struggled, Larsson provided a vital 11 points off the bench as well as some lockdown defense of Jaquez.\n\n\u201cPelle might have played his best game at Arizona,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cI think that helped Oumar get going a little bit and helped them get in massive foul trouble with [UCLA\u2019s] bigs.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Bailey and Campbell kept UCLA afloat, even when Nwuba also fouled out with 4:27 remaining.\n\nNow in a tie game, the Bruins had to go back to their small-ball lineup out of necessity for the remainder of the night.\n\nA Bailey jumper with under three minutes left put UCLA back ahead 58-56, giving the star freshman 19 points for the game.\n\nIn the first instance that two teams have played in the Pac-12 Tournament final in consecutive years, UCLA and Arizona demonstrated exactly why they are currently the two premier programs in the conference.\n\nEven with the Wildcats\u2019 massive frontcourt advantage on paper, the Bruins continued to battle and keep the lead.\n\nJaquez forced a steal with just over a minute to go to keep his team up a point, as Arizona still couldn\u2019t penetrate the UCLA defense.\n\nBut it was just a matter of time before the Wildcats broke through.\n\nDespite having not made a shot all night, Ramey drilled a three after an offensive rebound by Larsson, sending T-Mobile Arena into a frenzy with 18 seconds left.\n\nWhen Campbell went to the line with six seconds to go, the place only got louder, prompting a miss on the latter free throw that would have tied it.\n\nUCLA had one more shot to win it \u2014 an open look for three from the left wing by Andrews \u2014 but the attempt missed long to give Arizona a wild win and the Pac-12 Tournament title in an absolute classic.\n\nBoth teams will find out where they fit into the NCAA tournament bracket on Sunday, as each projects to be a high seed with a chance to advance deep into March Madness.\n\n\u201cWe have a group that\u2019s built to play in this tournament we\u2019re about to start,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantees and you can\u2019t make any assumptions, but I like our ability to win game-to-game.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Taylor Marie Contarino March 11, 2023 at 12:34 pm PST\n\nTwin sisters DJ Big Tootz and DJ Little Tootz braved the stage at Rolling Loud on Saturday, March 4, and when they climbed onto the Culture Kings Stage at the festival, they smiled at each other. Their electric energy sparked excitement from crowds of rap music fans. In a field that is often male-dominated, Big Tootz and Lil Tootz were some of the few female performers at Rolling Loud this year. In a lineup of more than 110 acts, there were only 20 female acts.\n\nAs DJs, \u201cThe Tootz\u201d may not always be in the spotlight, but their behind-the-scenes work plays a major role in igniting the powerful performances that their performance partner, Duke Deuce, a legendary Memphis-born rap artist, gives his audiences. \u201cWe\u2019ll be setting up ... and they\u2019ll look right past us. We got these big GoGo Gadget backpacks with our computers and stuff. People will go, \u2018Where\u2019s the DJ?\u2019 We\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re right here!\u2019 and they still don\u2019t hear us sometimes,\u201d Big Tootz said.\n\nThey are the official DJs who travel alongside Duke Deuce, who gained fame in the Memphis Jookin dance scene, alongside The Tootz, as an early pioneer of the dance trend. This March, the duo took on their fifth Rolling Loud set alongside Duke Deuce, and gave a memorable performance filled with creative three-dimensional visuals.\n\n\u201cPeople [will] look past you ... whatever it is you\u2019re doing, stand on it, and let them know \u201cI\u2019m the DJ, hey I\u2019m the emcee, hey I\u2019m the artist, I\u2019m the producer, I\u2019m the engineer,\u201d Lil Tootz said.\n\nIn an industry where women have been historically underrepresented, \u201cThe Tootz\u201d are a force of nature and a driving force behind rap music shows. \u201cWomen rule the world ... we rule the world anyway, so they\u2019re gonna respect it,\u201d Lil Tootz said.\n\nThe ladies have been traveling alongside Duke Deuce for more than three years, bringing with them a divine sense of femininity. They met the renowned rapper before he was even a rapper, and they\u2019ve been his official DJs since they DJed his birthday party in 2020.\n\nWhen it comes to advice, the seasoned veteran DJs have a lot to share with the next generation of female power players in the music business. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna forever be a woman. You\u2019re gonna forever have to prove that you\u2019re a woman and that you can do this \u2014 and that\u2019s okay ... you know in your mind and your heart \u2014 this is what you love to do, this is what you want to do. Keep pushing,\u201d Lil Tootz said.\n\nWhen it comes to the hip-hop space, women are not to be left behind in the dust. The successful most recent example of a kickstarter in the drill music genre is Ice Spice, who took the Rolling Loud stage for the first time ever at this year\u2019s 3-day festival, alongside star-studded female performers such as Saweetie, Coi Leray, City Girls, Tay Money and more.\n\nAt Rolling Loud, she debuted her hit song \u201cBoy\u2019s a Liar Pt. 2\u2032\u2032 which features her female counterpart and friend, PinkPantheress. Rolling Loud has a history of a lack of female artists on their impressive lineups. The festival\u2019s first-ever female headliner, Cardi B, graced the stage at Rolling Loud in 2018. Nicki Minaj soon followed, dominating the stage at New York\u2019s Citi Field venue in 2022, and she returned this year as a surprise guest.\n\nShyla Silva, a nanny from Los Angeles, attended the festival and was able to catch the performances of Ice Spice, Shenseea, City Girls and Saweetie. She felt inspired by seeing fellow women of color in the spotlight. \u201cIt was nice to see Black women and women of color in general have that stage, especially not just a little stage, it was the main stage,\u201d Silva said.\n\n\u201cAs a woman seeing female rappers perform at Rolling Loud, I felt super empowered to just be me, as a woman, and embrace that, and not feel like I should make myself smaller in spaces for men to feel better about themselves,\u201d said Soley Liati, a USC student studying business administration who attended the festival.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of the female artists who took over at Rolling Loud this year.\n\nCam & China\nCam & China are identical twin sister rap artists from Inglewood. Their celebrated hits include songs like \u201cOFFBRAND,\u201d \u201cRun Up\u201d and \u201cKEEP IT PUSHIN,\u201d and their music has been featured in season two of the hit TV show, \u201cInsecure.\u201d The West Coast girls brought a unique local flair to the show, shedding light on Inglewood\u2019s historical musical roots.\n\nSaweetie\nSaweetie, a USC alum, performed at Rolling Loud on March 3.

Performing hit songs from her past paired with newer songs like those from her recent \u201cTHE SINGLE LIFE\u201d EP, Saweetie drew the crowd in with her unique feminine flair and sassy performances of hits like \u201cDON\u2019T SAY NOTHIN\u2019.\u201d\n\nCity Girls\nThe City Girls performed at Rolling Loud on March 4. (Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\nThe City Girls, a duo of best friends Yung Miami and JT, brought out swarms of excited fans as they took over the stage with beloved, empowering viral hits including \u201cAct Up.\u201d\n\nShenseea\nShenseea, a Jamaican dancehall-pop artist, has a stage presence that is hard to beat. Fans showcased their joy at how engaging she was with her audience, as she brought multiple fans up to the stage to compete in a dance-off where winners were determined by the cheers of the audience.\n\nCoi Leray\nCoi Leray is known for her lyrical rap and hip-hop skills, including her hit song \u201cNo More Parties\u201d featuring Lil Durk. Her performance on the GoPuff Stage on Sunday, March 5 was intense, exciting, and included pop hits like \u201cTWINNEM.\u201d\n\nTay Money\nTay Money performed at Rolling Loud on March 3.

Intuit Area is set to be operational by fall of 2024.\n\nSteve Ballmer, longtime Microsoft CEO and current Clipper owner, said that overseeing the construction of the arena was more mentally draining than anything he did previously with Microsoft. Ballmer\u2019s excitement radiated describing the unique features the arena will have to offer.\n\nThe Intuit Dome will offer a 51-row student section-like area called \u201cThe Wall\u201d reserved for \u201creal Clipper fans only,\u201d with a verification process to prove your loyalty to the franchise.

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nMarch 10, 2023 at 11:51 pm PST\n\nJust over 400 miles \u2014 about a six-hour drive \u2014 separate Tucson, Arizona, from Las Vegas. But Friday night\u2019s Pac-12 tournament semifinal game felt like a home game for Arizona against its rival Arizona State. Deafening \u201cU Of A\u201d chants rang through T-Mobile Arena all night long, and, to put it lightly, the crowd was made up of a lot more red and navy than maroon and gold.\n\nPerhaps it was the Wildcats\u2019 heartbreaking loss on a deep buzzer-beater by Arizona State fifth-year guard Desmond Cambridge Jr. when these teams last played on February 25 that prompted the increased enthusiasm from Arizona fans. Regardless, the Wildcat faithful wouldn\u2019t be silenced this time, as Arizona pulled away late to take down the Sun Devils 78-59 to advance to the Pac-12 tournament finals.\n\n\u201cWhen you play Arizona State, you know what you\u2019re in for,\u201d Arizona head coach Tommy Lloyd said. \u201cI thought our guys did a really good job stepping up to the challenge ... Today I thought we were even-keeled and it really worked out well for us.\u201d\n\nJunior forward Azuolas Tubelis, who led the Pac-12 in both scoring and rebounding this season, continued to impose his will on the conference. He had a game-high 17 points on 8-for-11 shooting to go with nine rebounds to guide Arizona to its second straight appearance in the conference tournament\u2019s championship game.\n\nSurprisingly, it was the Sun Devils\u2019 offense that kept them in it early, as opposed to their elite defense. After hitting 14 threes the previous night against USC, Arizona State hit four more threes to start the game and lead 16-15. However, the Sun Devils cooled off for the rest of the night, making just two of their next 15 attempts from deep.\n\nBut the Wildcats needed just one run to really get the crowd rolling, and they got it quickly after via a three, then a transition dunk by junior guard Pelle Larsson. Back-to-back threes by fifth-year guard Courtney Ramey and freshman guard Kylan Boswell soon followed to make it a 13-3 run for Arizona and a 10-point lead.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of times our momentum accumulates a little bit,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIt leads to these moments in games when we can get out to these little spurts.\u201d\n\nBoth offenses slowed to a halt for the remainder of the first half, though Arizona kept a 35-28 advantage heading into the break. If anything, the Sun Devils were somewhat lucky to be trailing by just seven points, having taken eight more shots in the first half. Arizona gave away some extra chances via turnovers and offensive boards, but ASU wasn\u2019t converting those additional opportunities, shooting just 29% in the first half against a less-than-stellar Wildcat defense.\n\nArizona continued to shoot the lights out in the second half, making nine of its first 13 shots. However, turnovers \u2014 and missed free throws \u2014 continued to prevent the Wildcats from separating themselves, despite plenty of success shooting both from behind the arc and in the paint. Arizona finished with 15 turnovers against a feisty Sun Devil defense but also missed plenty of freebies, converting just six of 14 attempts at the line.\n\nArizona State still wouldn\u2019t quite go away, though, keeping the deficit to six with under seven minutes to go. That\u2019s when the home-like crowd factored in again to the benefit of the Wildcats, particularly on defense. The Sun Devils didn\u2019t make a field goal for the rest of the night. Meanwhile, on offense, consecutive baskets by redshirt junior center Oumar Ballo, complemented by another Larsson three, put Arizona back up double digits.\n\nMoments later, junior guard Kerr Kriisa, who entered the game banged up with a shoulder injury, effectively sealed it with a triple from the top of the key. That gave Arizona a 14-point cushion with about four minutes to go and generated perhaps the loudest roar of the night from Wildcat fans.\n\n\u201cThey show up, U of A people love this tournament,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThey love our program. It makes it a special atmosphere, and we love being a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe only thing missing? Another thundering \u201cU of A\u201d chant in the final seconds, as Arizona comfortably closed out its semifinal win.\n\nNow, for the second year in a row, the Wildcats will play UCLA in the title game of the Pac-12 tournament. Arizona won that matchup in 2022 and will look to win its second straight conference tournament championship on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Meanwhile, Arizona State will have to patiently wait until Sunday\u2019s selection show to find out on which side of the NCAA tournament bubble it will fall.\n```"}

He chipped in 28 points for the Bruins in their semifinal win. (Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Alexis Lara March 10, 2023 at 10:51 pm PST\n\nUCLA delivered an emphatic 75-56 defeat to Oregon and secured their spot in the final round of the Pac-12 Tournament Saturday night. The No. 4 seed Ducks and the No. 1 seed Bruins battled on the court Friday evening at T-Mobile arena chasing that elusive semi-final victory. An explosive offensive performance by senior guard Tyger Campbell propelled UCLA to the tournament championship for a second consecutive year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not how big you are, it\u2019s how tough you are. It\u2019s not how tall you are, it\u2019s how big you play,\u201d UCLA head coach Mick Cronin. \u201cWe worry about defense, we worry about playing smart. The ball is eventually going to go in.\u201d\n\nThe first half opened with an Oregon basket from sophomore center Nate Bittle. Although the Ducks were first on the board, fifth-year guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. followed closely with a shot of his own to tie the game. Jaquez Jr. averages 18.5 points when playing against Oregon and contributed 18 points and 10 rebounds on the night.\n\nA relentless first half fight came from both teams as they matched each other shot for shot and steal for steal. The largest lead of the half came from a three-pointer by Campbell, which extended the Bruin lead to 21-16.\n\n\u201cI was just more worried about winning,\u201d Campbell said.\u201dI was really just trying to make anything happen. I believe in myself as a player, any shot I take I think it\u2019s going to go in.\u201d\n\nA race to the rim by freshman guard Amari Bailey with 35 seconds left in the half was answered by senior guard Will Richardson to close out the half 32-30 in favor of UCLA.\n\nThe Bruins began pulling ahead four minutes into the second half thanks to a set of 3-pointers from senior guard David Singleton and Jaquez Jr. The Bruins lead reached 44-36 when freshman forward Adem Bona injured his left shoulder diving for a ball. He left the game with 16 minutes left in the second half after contributing four points, four rebounds and two blocks.\n\nOregon battled back to close the gap to 44-41, but with five minutes remaining in the half, UCLA ran away with the lead. Campbell, who averaged 18 points with two rebounds and three steals in the regular season earned the roar of the crowd after scoring a career high 28 points and adding six assists.\n\n\u201cWe made some mistakes in the first half but we were able to cover them up a little bit better. Second half we just didn\u2019t cover up any mistakes. We lost our energy when we missed some shots,\u201d Oregon head coach Dana Altman said. \u201cWe had a little spurt and we finally hit some shots and that was when our energy was the best but we didn\u2019t respond very well when we missed shots. Our energy level just wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\nThe Bruins, who have gone 29-4 overall with an 18-2 conference record, are familiar with the feeling of a Pac-12 semifinal win after beating USC 69-59 last season. Today\u2019s game extended UCLA\u2019s winning streak to 12 games. Their last loss was to the Trojans Jan. 26 at Galen Center.\n\nBy making it to the semifinals, the Ducks on the other hand have already surpassed their 2022 Pac-12 tournament run. While T-Mobile arena is an iconic venue for the Pac-12 tournament, playing outside of Matthew Knight Arena usually does not work out in favor of the Ducks, as they had a 4-6 away record during the regular season.\n\nOregon ultimately could not regain their lead in the second half despite a final push. The win for UCLA sets the stage for the team to address their unfinished business of last year\u2019s tournament after losing the 2022 Pac-12 tournament final to Arizona. Now, the Bruins are making a run for the 2023 Pac-12 Championship and will play Saturday March 11 at 7:30 pm.\n\n\u201cIt would mean that all this hard work paid off,\u201d Jaquez Jr. said. \u201cWe worked so hard this year. Even the years in the past, we fell short last year. It would be great just to overcome that and bring home the Pac-12 Tournament Championship.\u201d\n```"}

Little Lamb, a grab-and-go mobile coffee and ceramics shop, boasts a menu of classics and innovative beverages along with hand-made ceramics for purchase.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to push myself and try something new,\u201d said Ryan Lagassee, the founder and operator of the shop. Lagassee had this thought and did just that. The 33-year-old Rhode Island native was working in photo production and when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, all of her work was shut down. She said she was struggling in the industry and felt it wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t cut out for it, and I was struggling with my happiness,\u201d Lagassee said. She said she wanted to do something that she could see herself happily sustaining for a lifetime.\n\n\u201cI worked in a cafe while attending college at the Fashion Institute of Technology, in New York City, and ceramics have always brought me so much joy. So I combined the two and put it on wheels,\u201d she said.\n\nLagassee also said she can see herself doing this forever. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s the most me I\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d She loves learning to make new artisanal drinks and providing a little break from one\u2019s day with a beverage. Ever since opening Little Lamb, the once coffee-lover switched her drink to matcha, a change she was not expecting.\n\n\u201cThe bus is meant to spread joy. It\u2019s meant to just take a person out of their life, their daily routine, and just give them something to feel different and feel better,\u201d Lagassee said.\n\nThat is what she hopes to accomplish with Little Lamb. The coffee shop on wheels is filled with flowers, handmade ceramics, poetry books, art and everything is color coordinated in soft pastels. With a warm California breeze, ambient instrumental coffee shop jazz music playing overhead, customers browsing mugs and poetry books, sipping on lavender iced lattes and nibbling on pastries, the bus truly is a sweet escape.\n\nCustomers can experience this sweet escape in the form of life\u2019s simple pleasures such as coffee and a scone. Customer Daniella Echeverria said that just walking by Little Lamb, seeing the flowers and ceramics, and hearing the music instantly put her in a good mood and put a smile on her face.\n\nLagassee prides herself on being woman-owned. It was a top priority of hers to get the official Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) certification. Having the certification has a special place in her heart. She says that people see the sign and are eager and happy to support a woman-owned business. Having the official certification has also been helpful for her sales.\n\n\u201cI just feel like male energy dominates so many industries, and certainly in food trucks that\u2019s true,\u201d Lagassee said. It wasn\u2019t easy for her when it came to communicating with men as a female business owner; she said, \u201cThey communicate very differently than I do as a soft, feminine woman.\u201d\n\nBecause of this challenge, she is very supportive and proud of women who take that step to \u201creally push boundaries and own their own business and do something hard.\u201d\n\nLittle Lamb\u2019s wheels were officially off the ground starting on September 18, 2022. \u201cI had no idea what I was doing and I still don\u2019t,\u201d Lagassee said. Her advice for anyone who wants to start a business and be their own boss? \u201cJust think of it as one step at a time and you will figure it out. You break it down and before you know it, your whole life is changed and you\u2019re running your own business and you feel very gratified,\u201d Lagassee said.\n\nLagassee and her bus travel Los Angeles and recently began to stop shop near the USC Village in early February. She visits the Village at least once a week to serve students some sips and sweets. Customer and USC student Kelly Ash who ordered an iced mocha cacao described her coffee as \u201ca hug in a cup.\u201d\n\nThrough her drinks, Lagassee is accomplishing her goal of taking customers out of their day and giving them a little bit of joy.\n```"}

Prior to social media, he wrote songs for international acts such as K-pop boy group EXO and singer Jason Derulo, but it was his initial virality on TikTok that gave him the confidence to fully pursue his individual artist journey.\n\nPart of JVKE\u2019s appeal lies in his down-to-earth, relatable persona as a young adult trying to work through his first experiences with love. He makes videos and beats with his mom, plays his melodies for his old piano teacher, and produces music in his childhood bedroom. He isn\u2019t afraid to be vulnerable with his audience, singing with confusion and frustration as much as he recounts moments of outright joy.\n\nIn his first album \u201cthis is what ____ feels like (Vol. 1-4),\u201d JVKE documents his first relationship, from the bliss of the initial honeymoon stage to the denial and frustration of heartbreak, ending with the process of healing and moving on from his lover. Although his lyrics are relatively simple and occasionally err on the side of cliche, he elevates them with empathetic delivery and sweeping instrumentals. Each song on the album rises and falls with a liveliness that takes the listener to the moments that JVKE describes, creating an auditory experience beyond the \u201csad boy in love\u201d trope that the tracks might have otherwise fallen into.\n\nAbove all, what sets JVKE apart from the ever-growing category of young, romance-fueled and predominantly white musicians on social media is his ability to connect with his fans in real life through songs that spark a unique reaction in each listener. He stated previously in an interview with VMan that he does not \u201cconnect very well\u201d to the numbers fueling his rise in popularity, and that he is wary of the difference between millions of monthly listeners and real-life crowds. JVKE prefers to use his viral presence to evaluate what his fans want, teasing future songs with short snippets on TikTok and asking for feedback. In this way, he takes the storytelling behind his tracks to a more interpersonal level.\n\nJVKE emphasized that connection with fans in his first ever headlining show at the end of January. He mentioned that the concert sold out within 5 minutes of being announced and specifically thanked fans who drove several hours or flew to see him perform. The setlist covered JVKE\u2019s top hits. He began with the song \u201cthis is what falling in love feels like,\u201d starting the show off with a more laid back vibe. JVKE sang live and although he didn\u2019t quite reach the vocal climaxes of his studio tracks, his unaltered voice brought a refreshing dimension to his most popular songs. It was clear that JVKE had not let his rapid success interfere with his passion.\n\nHe performed top-streamed tracks such as \u201cghost town\u201d with the fire of an artist who had just begun their career. Although over 1000 people attended the show, JVKE maintained an intimate feel throughout the night, particularly during a cover of \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d by Juice WRLD. During the middle of the concert, JVKE mentioned both the process of dealing with heartbreak from his first relationship and developing a deeper relationship with God.\n\nJVKE also incorporated aspects of the videos that helped propel him to fame in his live performance. The concert stage was set up to resemble his childhood bedroom, and he wore an oversized sweatshirt and plaid pajama pants that emulated the relaxed demeanor of his social media presence. Throughout the show, he utilized a beat making machine to demonstrate how he made music at home.\n\nJVKE ended the show with a passionate rendition of \u201cgolden hour.\u201d As he performed the song, animations created from AI generated art pieces played in the background, adding a unique digital element to the concert. For the encore, he performed \u201cUpside Down,\u201d as the crowd jumped up and down, bringing the show back to the dance-pop roots that helped him blow up.\n\nAs JVKE said goodbye, the smiles on their faces mirrored his own. As JVKE continues to release new music and prepares for his first North American tour in August, all eyes will be on the strategies the artist uses to experiment with his sound and channel the stories behind his digital content in real-life performances. The tour announcement was widely anticipated, with all 23 stops selling out in several minutes. Regardless, there is no doubt that JVKE will combine his social media savvy and straightforward approach to music to create an experience that makes fans feel as if they are in their own \u201cgolden hour.\u201d```"}

The last few weeks have put USC students through colder than normal temperatures and an unusual amount of rain. With midterm exams on top of the weather, students are ready for some rest and relaxation.\n\n\u201cIt gets overwhelming sometimes with work,\u201d said Priscila Villegas, a freshman majoring in computational mathematics. \u201cSo these breaks are really valuable to me.\u201d\n\nMany students are also planning to go back home, recalling stories of spring breaks of the past. \u201cI\u2019m from Philly. I\u2019m going back, but I\u2019m taking three of my friends with me who\u2019ve never been,\u201d said Abigail Rowley, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering. \u201c[Last year] my friends and I went to a new cheesesteak place [every day].\u201d\n\nDespite all the student excitement for their spring break travels, students are advised to proceed with caution no matter their final destination. Whether students plan to venture home to Philadelphia like Rowley, take a seven hour flight to Tijuana or simply stay in Los Angeles over break, dangerous situations can present themselves anywhere.\n\nRecent events may further evoke wariness from students looking to travel during spring break, especially for those planning to make a trip down south to Mexico. Last week, four Americans were kidnapped in the border city of Matamoros by armed gunmen. Two of the Americans were found dead on Tuesday, according to CNN.\n\nThe United States Department of State has since issued an explicit travel advisory for Mexico, a popular spring break destination for students at many universities across the U.S., including USC. The advisory urged travelers to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d while traveling to Canc\u00fan, Tulum and Cabo San Lucas, all popular travel destinations for spring breakers.\n\nBut while the department has advised against traveling to the country, many are still planning to make the trek. \u201cI\u2019d say if you\u2019re trying to travel there, definitely bring someone who knows their way around the city,\u201d said Ian Santillan, a junior majoring in environmental engineering who plans to make the trip to Tijuana to visit family.\n\nDespite the advisory, Santillan said he isn\u2019t too worried. \u201cTo be honest, I know the area pretty decently, and my family has been there for so long that we know where not to go and how to keep each other safe,\u201d Santillan said. \u201cSo it really just comes down to being able to know the area or being with people who do.\u201d\n\nCurrently, six states in Mexico are marked with a \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d advisory. Baja California, a popular tourism destination for Southern Californians, is marked with a \u201cReconsider Travel\u201d advisory.\n\nOne fact to take into account before dubbing Mexico \u201cunsafe\u201d is that many of the popular tourist destinations in Mexico are located far away from Matamoros. In an interview with CNN, founder and CEO of travel company Journey Mexico Zachary Rabinor put the distance into perspective.\n\n\u201cMatamoros is about 1,360 miles away from Cancun \u2014 that\u2019s about the equivalent distance from the Texas side of the border to Chicago, Illinois,\u201d Rabinor said.\n\nAnother factor to consider is how many other popular vacation destinations also have travel warnings. France and the Bahamas are also marked with \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d due to civil unrest, terrorism and crime respectively. Several countries in the Middle East popular with spring break goers also received an \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d travel warning.\n\nJason Marino, a freshman majoring in business administration, is planning on traveling to Dubai \u2014 the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 as a part of a USC-sponsored trip for his spring break. Despite the warning, Marino remains mostly unconcerned.\n\n\u201cI spoke to my friend who\u2019s from Abu Dhabi and he told me that the UAE\u2019s one of the safest countries to be in, so I actually thought the opposite [about the warning],\u201d Marino said.\n\nAn increasingly popular destination for spring break is Miami Beach, Florida, but in the time post-COVID-19 lockdown stretch it has become a beacon for chaos. Since then, Miami has seen shootings, street brawls, crowd stampedes and public indecency, officials and locals say.\n\nJust last year, spring break antics became so dangerous that Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber issued a city wide curfew in an attempt to tame the masses of college students. This curfew was put into action largely due to two separate shootings that injured several people, according to the New York Post.\n\nAlthough these recent events should be taken seriously to encourage all students to be aware of their surroundings wherever their spring break takes them, Trojans still plan on enjoying their deserved time off.\n\n\u201cHell yes, [I\u2019m excited],\u201d Santillan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for a break.\u201d\n\nHere are some general safety tips, provided by USC Student Affairs, for students everywhere to ensure a fun, yet safe spring break:\n\n* Be sure to lock up your apartment, house or dorm if you are leaving and never leave valuable items visible in your home or car.\n* Always remember your photo ID, passport or any other important identification documents if you are leaving L.A.\n* Make sure you\u2019re aware of any travel advisories or warnings about your destination prior to departure.\n* If students are experiencing an emergency in the U.S. Port of Entry, they can call the USC Department of Public Safety (DPS) at (213) 740-6000 for assistance.\n```"}

(Photo provided by Ramon Prater)\n\nBy Marco Ramirez, Siara Carpenter, and Sullivan Barthel\nMarch 10, 2023 at 3:47 pm PST\n\nThe transitional housing group Los Angeles Room and Board, or LARNB, opened its third location on March 4 \u2014 the Dunamis House in Boyle Heights. LARNB aims to provide affordable housing to community college students that are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. The home has 100 bed spaces and has already begun to house students in the city.\n\nThe housing crisis in L.A. has been a persistent issue for many years with students and residents alike struggling to cope with high rent prices. Community college students in particular have been facing the brunt of skyrocketing housing costs as many of their schools do not provide housing. This forces some community college students to commute long distances every day.\n\nThe high cost of living in L.A., especially in areas like Santa Monica, has only made matters worse for students like Yousef Khafaja. \u201cI am currently paying an arm and a leg right now for rent at an apartment far away from my school. I don\u2019t know if I can honestly keep paying these high prices,\u201d said Khafaja, a Santa Monica Community College student. \u201cSome of my buddies told me about the program, so I am definitely thinking about trying it out when my lease is up.\u201d\n\nKhafaja hopes that his community college will someday offer housing to their students, as it would provide much-needed relief from high rent prices and long commute times. He currently lives in South L.A. due to the high cost of living in Santa Monica, spending nearly two hours daily on his commute.\n\nAccording to data analytics site Bestplaces, rent in Santa Monica is 54.3% more expensive than the rest of L.A. \u201cI really wish they did [transitional housing] because it would help me out a lot,\u201d Khafaja said.\n\nThe opening of the Dunamis House provides a glimmer of hope for students like Khafaja. The transitional housing group not only provides a place for students to live but offers access to a variety of amenities to help students succeed. Romona Prater, the community outreach and marketing manager for LARNB, lists a podcast studio, barista station, common areas for studying, a theater and more among the amenities. \u201cEverything you can think of to ensure success is there at that house,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the LARNB website, one in five community or trade school students in L.A. face housing insecurity. This means that a significant number of students are unable to find or afford stable housing while pursuing their education. According to a study by Glantsman et al., difficulty with basic needs has been shown to have a detrimental impact on college students\u2019 academic success, mental health and overall well-being.\n\nTo address this issue, LARNB has developed a comprehensive approach to support students in need. The organization uses a one-on-one case management system to understand each student\u2019s unique situation and develop a personalized plan to help them secure housing. This approach recognizes that every student\u2019s needs are different, and that a tailored plan is essential to provide effective support.\n\nLARNB work has received recognition from various celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to the former team captain of the L.A. Rams, Andrew Whitworth. Mayor Karen Bass attended the opening ceremony for the Dunamis House. \u201cWith the state of emergency that was declared around homelessness, Mayor Bass\u2019 efforts have really helped us streamline and expedite the opening of our projects,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Cantero, co-founder of LARNB and professor at the USC Gould School of Law. \u201cIn about less than a year, we\u2019ve been able to open up these two facilities. And anyone will tell you [that] acquiring, developing and opening a project in less than a year \u2014 it\u2019s record speed.\u201d\n\nCantero also stressed the importance of making sure students are aware of housing resources. He said, even at USC, many students who face housing insecurity aren\u2019t aware of opportunities and resources available. \u201cA bigger issue is also just the lack of knowledge of the resources that are available. For example, [at] USC, it\u2019s shocking that students are still continuing to experience homelessness when there\u2019s the Trojan Shelter,\u201d Cantero said. \u201cBut the best way to counteract that is by being much more public and open about the resources and supporting one another to amplify that message.\u201d\n\nVisit larnb.org for more information on affordable housing, or seip.usc.edu if you are experiencing food or housing insecurity and need support.\n```"}

Actor Ke Huy Quan, who graduated from the USC School of Cinematic Arts in 1999, is up for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his character Waymond Wang in \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once.\u201d The film is up for 11 Oscars, and Huy Quan is considered one of many who brought the film to critical acclaim. Huy Quan is no stranger to the industry, as he is also known for his roles in \u201cThe Goonies\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\u201d\n\nComposer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, who graduated from the USC Thornton School of Music\u2019s screen scoring program in 2008, is up for Best Original Song with \u201cLift Me Up\u201d from \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever.\u201d This is G\u00f6ransson\u2019s second Oscar nomination since his Best Original Score win in 2019 for \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Ryan Coogler, director and co-writer of both \u201cBlack Panther\u201d films, is also a former Trojan; he and G\u00f6ransson met and began working together while at USC.\n\nThe founder and CEO of Skydance Media, SCA alum David Ellison, is up for Best Picture for producing \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d Ellison is a veteran in the industry as he has produced several blockbuster movies such as \u201cAnnihilation,\u201d \u201cStar Trek Into Darkness,\u201d \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d \u201cSplit\u201d and \u201cBaywatch\u201d among many others. However, if \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d takes home the Academy Award, this would be Ellison\u2019s first Oscars triumph.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Director Rian Johnson, who graduated from SCA in 1996, is up for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) for \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.\u201d Johnson\u2019s extensive catalog includes: \u201cKnives Out,\u201d \u201cStar Wars the Last Jedi,\u201d \u201cLooper\u201d and other upcoming projects that will be hitting screens in the next year. He has a record of 105 award nominations and 49 award wins; this Sunday, he may make that 50.\n\nUSC alumni have a long history with the Oscars. Trojans have been nominated for over 200 awards in the past and have won over 80 times. In 2022, Doug Hemphill, Ben Proudfoot and Aneil Karia made USC proud by taking home their acclaimed Academy awards. The long list of award-winning former Trojans speaks for itself to USC\u2019s record of hosting talented artists who get recognized for their work every year. Some other notable Oscar-winner alumni include Robert Zemeckis for Best Director on \u201cForest Gump\u201d in 1995, Forest Whitaker for Best Actor in his role on \u201cThe Last King of Scotland\u201d in 2007 and John Wayne for Best Actor in his role on \u201cTrue Grit\u201d in 1970.\n\nTune in this Sunday on ABC to see which Trojans will add to their award collection during the 95th Academy Award Ceremony 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PST.\n```"}

I cannot tell you how excited I am that this day has arrived. Because of another Canadian living rent-free in your head, I now have the honor and the privilege to expose you to the masses.\n\nNow usually, trying to go after the Golden State Warriors with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, at one point Kevin Durant and a plethora of all-time great role players would be a tall task. But, you \u2014 Mr. Green \u2014 are as easy of a target as there is in sports.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t think I have a clue about what I\u2019m talking about and claim I will never understand the intrinsic value of a player like Draymond, you need to pipe down, too. Ever since this undersized, offensively challenged character started appearing on Warriors broadcasts, I started to pay close attention to someone who was about to become one of the biggest frontrunners in professional sports.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a day that goes by where you don\u2019t fill the airwaves about how you are a four-time champion. Let me be very clear, Mr. Draymond Green. You better wake up every day smiling from ear to ear that the Warriors decided to draft you when they did, because Lord knows what would have happened if your hometown Detroit Pistons grabbed hold of you. You probably passed up a chance at winning G League MVP.\n\nBut honestly, Draymond, I cannot express how easy it must be to have the equivalent of three nuclear weapons in their prime, a roster filled with the perfect balance of veteran leadership and young sparks, one of the best manager of egos and what I believe to be the best player development staff in the history of organized ball all at your disposal. Do you see how easy it is to have three generational talents back up your trash talk when all you have to do is set screens and run a bunch of dribble handoffs?\n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m a broken record, but your lack of self-awareness is potentially worse than that cheese head who went to the bathroom in the dark for four days straight. What\u2019s even worse, Draymond, is that with these championships in your back pocket, you feel like you have the license to go after anyone, even if their career dwarfs yours.\n\nCharles Barkley could never make it past the first round of the playoffs for his entire career, and he\u2019d still be better than you by a country mile. In sports, there are a handful of the worst types of fan bases that are universally agreed upon that drain the life out of you. The most notorious bunch being Dallas Cowboys fans, followed by the entire city of Boston and rounding it off with anyone who supports that school in Westwood. Wow, I think I accidentally stumbled upon my next column.\n\nBut something that\u2019s escaped me for the past five NBA seasons, Draymond, is why your fanbase is not awarded this honor as well. Throughout my life, a pivotal part of sports analysis and measuring competition was done through this worldwide phenomenon, otherwise referred to as stats. Stats were something that people could measure and see with their own eyes how specific teams and players separated themselves from the rest.\n\nEveryone and their moms love to spit out players\u2019 box scores and whoever leads the league in PER (whatever the heck that means). Everyone seems to be falling in love with analytics, except when it applies to you, Draymond. With you, it\u2019s all about the leadership you bring to the team or the intangibles that contribute to the \u201cchampionship DNA.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an idea \u2014 how about instead of constantly coming up with arbitrary nonsense to value you, let\u2019s go by real things that people can actually quantify. For seven out of 11 seasons in your career, you have averaged the infamous triple-single. Throughout your career, you have scored 20 or more points in a game 38 times. THAT\u2019S ALMOST 100 LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF TECHNICAL FOULS YOU\u2019VE COMMITTED.\n\nYou have scored 30 points once in your entire career, which is less than Terrence Ross, Vlade Divac, Pooh Richardson, Mario Chalmers and Glen \u2018Big Baby\u2019 Davis. When Curry and Thompson were sidelined with injuries, you helped the Warriors win 15 out of a possible 65 games. You have a coin purse for a bag when it comes to your ability to handle the basketball, and your jumper would be better served to build brick houses.\n\nDillon Brooks was right, stick to podcasting and punching teammates. Respectfully, you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Instead, the Tigers got the jump on the Trojans, defeating them 11-8. It\u2019s just the second time this season USC has scored in single digits.\n\nA major reason for the Trojans\u2019 offensive struggles was Princeton\u2019s freshman goalie Amelia Hughes who blocked 14 shots. \u201cWe have to be ready to put shots away,\u201d head coach Lindsey Munday said. \u201cWe need to be better and we need to be more deceptive on our shots and really put them away.\u201d\n\nOn offense, sophomore attacker Maddie Dora, junior attacker Maggie Brown and junior attacker Claudia Shevitz scored two goals each. After today\u2019s performance, Brown has scored six goals in a two-game stretch and leads the team with 11 on the season. \u201c[Brown] is super versatile and can play anywhere on the field,\u201d Munday said. \u201cThat\u2019s helpful in terms of her production. I mean, she can play in the crease, she can play inside, and she can play up top.\u201d\n\nOn defense, the Trojans pressured the Tigers for a season-high 22 turnovers, 16 of which were forced. Senior defender Olivia Dooley led all players with five forced turnovers. Sophomore defender Alexis Niblock collected four ground balls, while three other Trojans collected three each. In the cage, junior goalie Kait Devir played the entire match. She earned seven saves but took the loss.\n\n\u201cOur defense is one of the best in the country, if not the best in the country, and has been super consistent,\u201d Munday said. However, the Trojans\u2019 aggressive efforts also earned them seven yellow cards. Senior defender Danielle Carson and sophomore midfielder Catherine Lord earned two yellow cards each, leading to their disqualifications. Meanwhile, the Tigers had no yellow cards.\n\nSeven Trojan fouls led to free position shots, three of which found the net. USC went 0-for-1 from the free-position arc. \u201cThe yellow cards today didn\u2019t put us in a position to be successful when you\u2019re playing a man down, even if you are making stops,\u201d Munday said.\n\nIn the main circle, the Tigers claimed 16 of 23 draw controls, despite USC averaging 15 victories per game prior to this match. Tiger junior attacker Ellie Mueller led everyone with nine victories and also scored a goal. Aside from Mueller, four Tigers players scored two goals each.\n\nThe Tigers won despite having fewer assists, shots and shots on goal than the Trojans. The Tigers\u2019 versatile offense kept them close to the Trojans throughout the first half. In the third quarter, Princeton pulled away with a 3-0 scoring run. Four Trojan yellow cards in four minutes in the fourth quarter stifled any chance of a USC comeback.\n\nThe Trojans will be back in action this Sunday when they play Hofstra at James M. Shuart Stadium. Coming off a 15-2 victory against Wagner, the Pride are 3-4 and 1-3 at home.\n```"}

Should it win, India\u2019s documentary submission would put Delhilites and the ongoing turmoil within the ecosystem they inhabit center stage at one of the most publicized events of the year.\n\nFor the past 20 years, India has been particularly vulnerable to air pollution due to an overwhelming combination of factors such as a rise in population, vehicular exhaust fumes, inefficient transportation systems and regulations, industrialization, annual crop burning \u2014 the list goes on. Twenty-one out of 30 cities with the worst air pollution in the world are in India. New Delhi, however, is the most polluted capital city in the world for the fourth year in a row. Fall and winter are the worst times of year. The states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and the Himalayas mountain range landlock New Delhi, leaving the city with insufficient channels to flush the toxic air.\n\nAir pollution has been linked to more than a million deaths each year for the past 10 years in India. Tiny particulate matter infiltrates the lungs and bloodstream and increases the risk of lung cancer, and induces decreased lung function, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease. Wealthier families with air-purifiers, well-sealed rooms and transportation are not much better off than those less fortunate in New Delhi, New York Times reporters found in December 2020. Rich or poor, fine particulate matter exposure is inescapable.\n\nBefore Mohammad Saud and Nadeem Shehzad began nursing Black Kites and other birds, they were teenage bodybuilders. (Photo courtesy of HBO Max)\n\nSen\u2019s documentary is a poetic commemoration of many things, such as brotherhood, national identity, fortitude and the intricate biological community in New Delhi. Given that animals tend to have more sensitive sensory systems than humans, they\u2019re equally, if not more, susceptible to the morbidity that humans face in New Delhi, forcing animals to migrate elsewhere. Stray animals suffer from repetitive vomiting and delayed reactions to their surroundings, while domesticated animals are lethargic and uneasy. Birdwatchers have taken notice for years now, attributing a correlation between pollutants \u2014 rapid urbanization not excluded \u2014 and the decline in migratory birds. The fine particulate matter is also known to reduce visibility. Just take a look at any number of photos of the New Delhi skyline. Bigger birds are then more likely to collide with buildings or entangle themselves in wires and sharpened competitive kite strings before meeting their untimely demise with the ground below.\n\nIncentivising clean air shouldn\u2019t be as difficult as it has been. Based on Dalberg Advisors\u2019 report from 2021, air pollution cost India $95 billion, or 3% of its GDP, in 2019. Plenty has been initiated to curb toxicity in Delhi over the past decade and \u201cvisible strides\u201d have been made, but a slow response to a silent killer continues to fall short of clean air standards and cost Delhi at an unreasonable rate. CBS News in November 2022 called the state of New Delhi \u201ca gas chamber.\u201d As of this month, Delhi\u2019s Air Quality Index is \u201cpoor,\u201d and regularly remains several times above the limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe Black Kite led Sen to Saud and Shehzad, specifically the bird that dive-bombed into the ground in front of the director in 2018. The unvalued and carnivorous raptor is often depicted in the documentary with as much personality as dignity. Its role in the city\u2019s metabolism, the director says, is invaluable, scavenging through mounds of waste and meats discarded in the capital and nearby landfills. It isn\u2019t an endangered bird (nor is it black). The raptor, blanketed with hues of brown and plumage speckled with white, is as \u201cunloved as the pigeon,\u201d New York Times reporter Oliver Whang learned. \u201dIf not us, then nobody\u2019s going to take care of them,\u201d Nadeem told Whang. Animal hospitals even send their wounded Black Kites to Saud and Shehzad\u2019s cramped facility. Nadeem posits that they\u2019ve saved 26,000 kites since establishing Wildlife Rescue in 2010, costing them personal funds and precious moments with their families as they continue a prolonged fight for proper funding. Blue paint peels from the walls of the facility and the space is prone to power outages and floods. But Wildlife Rescue\u2019s work has only been a bandaid for a gaping wound, Sen said during a Q&A at USC\u2019s Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre.\n\nEqually an achievement of genre, \u201cAll That Breathes\u201d underscores a pervasive and man-made environmental crisis, with political unrest in New Delhi as the backdrop. The film, with its painstaking and often coincidental composition, admires what coexistence has to offer more than it leans on the plight of the city\u2019s ecosystem. Despair is plentiful in this courtside seat to the apocalypse, but \u201cAll That Breathes\u201d and Wildlife Rescue accept the challenge of finding the unsuspecting beauty in the dusk of it all. \u201cI think the world needs more of these Don Quixotes to do these kinds of micro acts and micro gestures,\u201d Sen told the National Audubon Society. \u201cAnd these become the life rafts for hope.\u201d\n```"}

All of his answers came without much hesitation. Jogo, as he\u2019s commonly called, knows who he is, and he knows what he wants. One particular question, though, did catch him by surprise. \u201cWhat is your greatest achievement as a soccer player so far?\u201d I asked. He stared towards the wall and, for several seconds, remained silent. To represent two different national teams at a senior level is not something many players have done, which must have definitely crossed Jogo\u2019s mind. Still, he was not convinced that it was his greatest achievement and continued to think. To play for a top team in Europe is the dream of any player on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. At just 19 years old, G\u00f3mez has already achieved that goal. Nonetheless, that wasn\u2019t good enough for an answer either. I allowed the silence to carry on, while Jogo\u2019s facial expression showed a measure of discomfort with the responses that wandered through his mind. Finally, an idea was deemed good enough to be let out. His final answer, trying not to undervalue anything he\u2019s done so far in his career: his greatest achievement is yet to come.\n\nWhile keeping his feet on the ground, G\u00f3mez will not conform with little, and has his mind set to excellence. Success at his club, Olympic Games appearances, senior national team continuity \u2014 he plans to fulfill all of his objectives. One thing is clear: he sees himself playing in the 2026 World Cup, a tournament that will take place for him at home. \u201cTo see him playing (in the World Cup) would not surprise me at all,\u201d says Danny Cruz, head coach of Louisville City FC. \u201cI absolutely think he has the quality to be able to put himself in that position.\u201d\n\nThe 2026 edition of the most important tournament in soccer will be hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada. Growing up in Texas with a father from Mexico City, Jogo\u2019s \u201chome\u201d is in two different countries. \u201cI feel both Mexican and American, and I feel like I fit in both places,\u201d he said Watching his father Germ\u00e1n and his older brother Johan play soccer since he was a kid, Jogo has always been close to the game. At 12, Jogo joined the academy of FC Dallas and played through the ranks until reaching the team\u2019s reserves squad, called North Texas SC, where he won the USL League One Championship in 2019. The next season, the left back signed his first professional contract, with Louisville City. It was there Cruz saw him develop. \u201cWhen he first got here,\u201d Cruz said, \u201che wanted to constantly go and join the attack. Maybe not always thinking about the defensive responsibility.\u201d But Jogo put in the work, and improved significantly. \u201cHe likes to joke around when he\u2019s in the locker room, but when he\u2019s on the field, he\u2019s all business,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cMy belief is that\u2019s why he\u2019s going to continue to have a successful career.\u201d\n\nFollowing his brother\u2019s footsteps, Jogo moved to Europe in 2021 to continue his development as a young professional. Jogo now lives in San Sebasti\u00e1n, playing for the second team of Real Sociedad, while Johan develops in Germany\u2019s third division. The two brothers, two years apart in age, are as close as ever. They\u2019ve both experienced moving to Europe at an early age, they both know what it is to live alone in a new country, they share the same time zone away from the rest of their family. \u201cHe\u2019s my go to person right now,\u201d Jogo said. Something the G\u00f3mez brothers also share with one another: the tough task of deciding whether they will represent Mexico or the United States for the rest of their professional careers. \u201cWe talk about it sometimes,\u201d shared Johan in 2020 in the Keeping it simple podcast. \u201cHe\u2019s very hot and cold,\u201d he said then about his brother. According to Johan, one day Jogo thinks that he will represent one country, and the next day he changes his mind. It\u2019s a big decision. It\u2019s something that could define success or failure in the future. They do know, though, that their faith is tied to each other. \u201cIf my brother went one way,\u201d Johan said, \u201cI\u2019d probably go that way too, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nJogo is one of very few players who can brag about having played for two senior national teams. In December 2021, he wore the Stars and Stripes during a game against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Just four months later, he dressed in green, white and red playing for Mexico against Guatemala. Since all matches were friendly, according to FIFA\u2019s rules, he\u2019s still not tied to any country. At an under-16 level he played for both national teams; with the under-20\u2032s he also wore both shirts; the same goes with the senior teams. That\u2019s as informed as a decision can be. And both federations are very interested in the player as well. According to coach Danny Cruz, during Jogo\u2019s time in Louisville, U.S. head coach Gregg Berhalter was in constant contact with him, as were representatives from the Mexican national team. \u201cBoth federations spoke very highly of Jogo,\u201d Cruz says. From Jogo\u2019s point of view, the future is now: if he doesn\u2019t play well for Real Sociedad, then he won\u2019t even be called to represent a national team. Therefore, as a professional player \u201cfirst comes your club,\u201d he said. And that\u2019s another reason he chose to move to San Sebasti\u00e1n. While he\u2019s still waiting for his debut with Real Sociedad\u2019s first team, he trusts them with his development. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Chances will come at both club and country level if he continues to put on the work. Chances such as participating in the U-20 World Cup and in the Olympic Games. Both are tournaments Jogo has very much in mind. The thing is: Mexico didn\u2019t qualify for either of them. \u201cI only have one opportunity to play in the under-20 World Cup,\u201d he said, \u201cand probably also in the Olympics,\u201d which is a dream that only the United States can offer. Although those competitions are still underage and not considered cap-tying by FIFA, the USMNT can take them as a huge opportunity to entice Jogo to play for them for good. For him, a big factor to consider when choosing a national team is being able to fit in. How well can the player fit within the system of play and how well can the person fit among teammates and coaches, is the first thing to take into account. Nonetheless, he thinks that if the shirt of one national team just \u201cfeels right\u201d, then that ends up being more important than the rest. \u201cUltimately that overrides the other stuff,\u201d he said. Jonathan G\u00f3mez doesn\u2019t feel like his time to decide between Mexico and the United States has come yet. \u201cA lot of things can happen,\u201d especially in 2026. The shirt that Jogo will be wearing then is still a mystery. \u201cBut I do expect to have a decision made by that time,\u201d he said."}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Alexis Lara March 10, 2023 at 9:00 am PST\n\nUSC lost Thursday night in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 Tournament 77-72 after the team failed to match the early attack of Arizona State. USC had not lost to ASU since February of 2020, even winning their last matchup only six days ago. Despite entering into the game as the No. 3 seed with a 14-6 conference record, the Trojans failed to overtake the No. 6 seed Sun Devils and will not move on in the tournament.\n\n\u201cWe got off to a slow start, tough week at practice, a lot of guys injured and sick this week, so we look like a team that didn\u2019t practice for four days,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cWe played hard the second half, came back late in the game and fell short. Our guys have had a great season so far. It\u2019s disappointing losing our conference tournament.\u201d\n\nThe game began with three unanswered baskets by ASU. T-Mobile Arena was filled with the chants of battling student sections. Fifth-year guard Desmond Cambridge Jr. was the first on the board with two baskets to his name. Junior guard DJ Horne followed his teammate\u2019s lead with his own 3-pointer to extend their lead 8-0 at the beginning of the first half.\n\n\u201cWe got sped up, we tried to force a lot of stuff,\u201d USC sophomore guard Kobe Johnson said. \u201cIt cost us a lot of possessions in the first half, which led to them coming out and hitting shots.\u201d\n\nA foul by sophomore guard Frankie Collins gave USC the ball, and the first Trojan to score was Freshman guard Tre White. After four minutes of play, White was the only player on the board. With little urgency to match the relentless scoring of the Sun Devils, the Trojans played the entire game two steps behind ASU.\n\n\u201cIn the first half, they wanted it more than us. We came out flat. They got a lot of offensive rebounds. They just wanted it more than us tonight. That\u2019s my job as a leader to get the guys going, and I didn\u2019t do a great job of that,\u201d said USC senior guard Boogie Ellis. \u201cWe fought better in the second half, but in the first half, we can\u2019t play like that and expect to win.\u201d\n\nFifth-year guard Drew Peterson had been battling back issues and did not score until only nine minutes remained in the first half. Peterson, who averages 14.1 points and 6.3 rebounds for the season, only had nine points with two assists against ASU.\n\n\u201cWe have had a lot of injuries this year,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe have had a lot of adversity this year with our roster, that\u2019s why I am so proud. This has been the most improved team we have had in a long time, maybe ever in the ten years I\u2019ve been here as head coach. To see where they\u2019ve come from the beginning of the year to the end, it\u2019s really impressive.\u201d\n\nA pair of four-minute scoreless droughts frustrated the Trojans, but the fight was far from over. A 3-pointer from Ellis ended one of the droughts. The few and far between responses from USC were no match for the Sun Devils. ASU controlled the game, extending their lead to 17 points during the second half.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t take care of the ball. We got to do a better job of taking care of the ball as a team,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIn March, every possession counts. We tried to chop that tree down, but we just kept turning over the ball.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s leading scorers were no match for Cambridge Jr., who dominated the court with 27 points. Whenever the Trojans inched closer to the lead, Cambridge Jr.\u2019s 3-point daggers maintained the upper hand. Having lost both games against USC this season by the skin of its teeth, ASU refused to surrender the lead the entire game. Ellis, who averaged 18.1 points this season, only scored 15 points for the Trojans. Sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters led the team with 16 points.\n\nThe pace and accuracy USC played with in the last few minutes of the game closed the gap to only four points, but ultimately USC found their rhythm too late. Both Ellis and Johnson fouled out in the last minute of the game.\n\n\u201cTo have six players recognized in all-conference voting, it\u2019s a credit to them because they deserve it, they went out and earned it and improved as a team,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cSo where that puts us on Sunday, that\u2019s not my decision, but I\u2019m very proud as a head coach of what these guys have accomplished.\u201d\n\nAfter beating USC for the first time this season, ASU moves on to face rival Arizona in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals. The Trojans will wait until Sunday to learn their NCAA tournament fate.\n```"}

Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which make up your gut microbiota. Additionally, the gut has an entire nervous system called the enteric nervous system (ENS). These elements work together, meaning our gut and brain are extremely interconnected and in constant communication. Phrases like \u201cgo with your gut\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve got a gut feeling\u201d are common for a reason; the gut is often referred to as \u201cthe second brain.\u201d The nervous system in our guts developed millions of years before our brain, which is why the gut is such a critical component of our overall well being. Our gut is the largest part of our hormonal and immune systems and it is responsible for regulating countless functions in the body.\n\nResearch has found a link between gut health and mental health. The gut produces neurotransmitters such as serotonin, that can affect mood and behavior. Imbalances in the gut microbiome have been linked to mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Additionally, the gut produces hormones such as cortisol, which impact stress levels. Chronic stress can lead to inflammation and imbalances in the gut microbiome, which can further exacerbate stress levels, creating an unbreakable cycle. Irritation in the gastrointestinal system can send signals to the brain that trigger mood changes. These findings emphasize the importance of maintaining good gut health for overall well-being, both physically and mentally.\n\nWhat does this mean for college students? Well, college students tend to be under extreme stress, deal with high rates of anxiety and depression, and often have lifestyle habits that aren\u2019t conducive to a healthy gut microbiome. However, improving your gut health could make a significant difference if you are suffering from physical or mental health issues.\n\nBelow are some strategies you can incorporate into your life to improve your gut health, and consequently your overall wellbeing!\n\nEat a Diverse Diet\nInclude a range of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and lean proteins in your diet. Fiber comes from fruits and vegetables and is extremely important in providing nutrients that beneficial bacteria in the gut need to thrive. Fiber also helps to diversify the bacteria that is found in your microbiome. Healthy fiber rich options for whole grains include oats, quinoa and brown rice. Foods such as avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil are high in healthy fats and can help reduce inflammation in the gut. For proteins, choose lean options such as chicken, fish and legumes to provide the nutrients needed to support the growth of beneficial bacteria. Lastly, try to avoid processed foods and foods high in sugar as they can promote the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut.\n\nConsume Pre and Probiotics\nProbiotics are live bacteria that are beneficial for gut health. You can get probiotics from fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and tempeh or you can choose to take probiotic supplements. Prebiotics are fibers that can promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. You can find prebiotics in foods such as onions, garlic, bananas, asparagus and artichokes, as well as in supplement form.\n\nHelpful Lifestyle Habits\nChronic stress can harm your gut microbiome, and exacerbate mental health issues. Incorporating stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, deep breathing or yoga can limit stress and help rebuild your gut. Exercise has been shown to promote a healthy gut microbiome through many pathways, such as reducing inflammation, strengthening your immune system and promoting healthy digestion. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week, as it can also help you reduce stress. Get enough sleep: Sleep is important for overall health, including gut health. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Limit alcohol consumption as much as possible. Alcohol causes inflammation and can irritate and damage the lining of the gut, making it more permeable to toxins and harmful substances. This condition, known as leaky gut syndrome, leads to inflammation and increases the risk of developing autoimmune diseases.\n```"}

Photo by Nicole Santos.\n\nBy Nicole Santos\nMarch 09, 2023 at 7:33 pm PST\n\nBrandy Hernandez is a 20-year-old Mexican American screenwriting junior at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. This year, she was able to make real one of her favorite memories with her grandfather Severino Casarrubias, who died about a year ago, through her film \u201dTortillas.\u201d\n\nA memory from thirteen years ago: When Hernandez was about 7 or 8 years old, she traveled to Mexico with her family to visit her grandparents. \u201cWe were making tortillas for dinner and I was trying to make them but they were turning out super small, and I was mad because they didn\u2019t come out good,\u201d she said.\n\nHernandez said what stood out for her younger self at the time was that despite the tortillas\u2019 small size, her grandfather would try them and say, \u2018\u2019O-M-G they are so good mija, they\u2019re really good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to write a short film about my grandfather,\u201d said Hernandez, who is the screenwriter for the film. \u201cSo that\u2019s a memory that I would think [about] a lot and I just wrote it down.\u201d\n\nEven though Hernandez was born in the United States, she was able to visit and take part in her family\u2019s culture in Mexico. There, she would cook and eat delicious food like tortillas, chiles rellenos, and quesadillas. Sometimes she would travel there once a year because her parents are both from there.\n\nIn fall 2022, she took advantage of the SCA\u2019s Latinx Film and Media Association (LatiFam) script casting call to make this memory alive again. \u201cTortillas\u201d is LatiFam\u2019s first-ever production, featuring a crew that\u2019s predominantly from the Latinx community, which Hernandez said is uncommon on campus.\n\n\u201cThere was only one non-Latinx person,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very unique experience cause usually all of the student sets I\u2019ve been on at SCA or USC it\u2019s mostly white people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like being at home or being with my family.\u201d\n\nHector Martinez, the film producer of \u201cTortillas,\u201d said they ran into some obstacles in the production process that he hopes will be easier in the future for others at LatiFam. He said he feels a lot of responsibility to make \u201cTortillas\u201d the best he can, because it is the first film for the association.\n\n\u201cWe would be the first, and we had some struggles that hopefully in the future other productions won\u2019t have to go through,\u201d he said. \u201cI took a big responsibility in everything we did.\u201d\n\nLatiFam was founded in 2019 as a USC Latinx student organization for those interested in the film industry. Sophia Ruiz, first assistant director and co-president of LatiFam, explained that the association was growing pretty well until the COVID-19 pandemic. That made it difficult to have events on campus and projects like this because they were online.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit hard to get a lot of people involved since it took off in 2019 and then in 2020 we were on Zoom,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now we\u2019re back on campus and we are really excited about all of the events we\u2019re going to make.\u201d\n\nThrough the experiences of those who surround her and her own, Hernandez gives life to characters that express vivid memories and are relatable to other people\u2019s experiences.\n\n\u201cI like telling stories of real people and people that I know,\u201d she said. \u201cMy friends or my family inspire me a lot.\u201d\n\nHernandez strives to become a successful screenwriter. What success means to her is being able to create and direct her own films in the future, and have people \u201cresonate\u201d with them.\n\n\u201cJust hearing people say that they can relate to my stuff... it\u2019s just a good feeling. I feel like I\u2019m doing something good,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\n\u201cTortillas\u201d is not the first story Hernandez molded into a film. She said she has written scripts for other people to use for film contests. She has also written and directed her own short films for USC\u2019s screenwriting program. But she said that \u201cTortillas\u201d has a special place in her heart, and that she hopes there would be more films with a bigger Latinx crew.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that in the future there would be more Latinx productions and I\u2019m hoping that maybe the next one can be all Latines,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this opens more opportunities for other people, specifically the Latinx students at USC.\u201d\n\nRuiz said that even though representation on-screen is very important, filmmakers also need to consider the representation off-screen. \u201cTortillas\u201d is an example of this.\n\n\u201cWe always talk in classes about the importance of representation on-screen and I think it is very important, but we also need to consider the representation off-screen of all the people who work behind the scenes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was really exciting about \u2018Tortillas\u2019 is that we were able to have a majority Latine casting crew.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought I would get this experience, not just on-set but as someone who shares the same culture as a Latine experience,\u201d she said.\n\nHernandez, Ruiz and Martinez all expressed how much they enjoyed working with other Latinx people on set for the film.\n\n\u201cI feel like [my favorite moment] was just hanging out with people afterwards,\u201d said Hernandez, who hopes she could produce a film with an all-Latinx crew in the future.\n\n\u201c[My favorite moment] was stepping back and just watching all the Latinx crew do their thing and see how some of the shots came out already,\u201d said Martinez.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of set experience and I know for a lot of people on the crew it was their first time,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cIt was really great to see that environment where everyone was able to work with each other and make new memories and friendships.\u201d\n\nDespite Hernandez\u2019s ability to portray people\u2019s experiences in feature stories, in real life she considers herself \u201cintroverted, a little awkward.\u201d She also said she feels she is \u201cnice.\u201d\n\nFor Martinez, Hernandez is \u201cfunny, chaotic in a good way, and unique.\u201d He said that before meeting her, he was not expecting her to be like that, but he is glad she is because they were able to connect a lot more.\n\nRuiz said that Hernandez\u2019s creativity \u201cblew [her] out of the water\u201d from the first time she step into the set. She described Hernandez as someone \u201cpassionate, sincere and creative\u201d that \u201cnot only can write but also production design which she thinks it\u2019s really amazing.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cTortillas\u201d film is already in its post-production stage. Ruiz said the film will be premiered at the 3rd Annual LatiFam Film Festival from March 31 to April 2.\n```"}

As funding increases for dozens of transit projects, L.A. residents, city leaders and political organizers disagree about how these infrastructure changes will affect local communities.\n\nIn 1984, L.A. hosted the most profitable Olympic Games in history, earning $223 million, due in large part to its existing stadium infrastructure. In 2028, the city government hopes to set the stage for another lucrative Olympic Games.\n\n\u201cThe secret sauce to making the Olympics work in Los Angeles is you don\u2019t have to build anything,\u201d said Alan Abrahamson, a member of the International Olympic Committee\u2019s press committee and journalism professor at USC Annenberg. Many symbolic buildings in L.A. such as The Forum, Dodger Stadium and Rose Bowl were used for the 1984 Summer Olympics and are still a part L.A.\u2019s rich music and sports culture. The L.A. Memorial Coliseum and the Uytengsu Aquatics Center even hosted the 1932 Summer Olympics in the Trojans\u2019 own backyard.\n\n\u201cLos Angeles is the only place, and I mean only place, where the Olympic Games are part of the fabric of city life,\u201d Abrahamson said.\n\nHistorically, the Olympics have been a huge economic burden for host cities. The Games in the 1970s \u2014 particularly the 1976 Montreal Games \u2014 suffered a series of overrun costs and accumulated debts. According to a report by the Council on Foreign Relations, every Olympics since 1960 has gone over budget. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics exceeded $15 billion when the initial budget for the event was roughly $8 billion. LA28, the private committee setting up the games, has budgeted for $6.9 billion, excluding any infrastructure improvements.\n\nAccording to the committee, the Games will be funded by private investors, philanthropy and the IOC. However, in the past, overrun costs were placed on host cities to cover \u2014 meaning L.A. taxpayers may feel the weight of exceeding the budget.\n\nWhile venues like the L.A. Coliseum are secured for sporting events, the city lacks one crucial aspect to Olympics infrastructure: transportation. City leaders are eager to take advantage of the Games as an opportunity to bolster public transit funding.\n\nIn 2017, then-L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, in conjunction with the L.A. Metro, proposed 28 public transportation projects to finish in time for the 2028 Olympic Games. Mayor Karen Bass reaffirmed the commitment to expanding public transportation in time for the Olympics.\n\nThe \u201cTwenty-eight by \u201828\u2032\u2032 plan includes improvements to bus, rail, highway and bike systems. The Metro Purple Line that cuts through Downtown L.A. into Koreatown will extend into Westwood. In 2019, the Blue Line that transverses through South L.A. along highway I-110 to reach Downtown Long Beach underwent major improvements and will see further upgrades. Interstate 105, which runs east to west between Norwalk and El Segundo, will receive several new ExpressLanes, as will the I-10 freeway. New bike paths will be created along the L.A. River, and new transit corridors will be constructed along Vermont and Sepulveda, with one connecting the South L.A. K Line to the LAX airport.\n\nA full list of projects can be found here. Seventeen projects were already set to finish before 2028, with funding secured under Measure M, which created a half-cent county sales tax meant to fund transportation upgrades in 2016. The other 11 projects require accelerated funding to complete before the 2028 deadline.\n\nAccording to the project list, some projects had initial completion dates in the 2030s. Others had to reduce their deadlines by over 15 years. The plan is estimated to cost $42.9 billion, according to The Pacific Research Institute.\n\nInglewood was recently awarded for $407 million from Gov. Gavin Newsom through the state Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program to expand the city\u2019s transportation system. Added to the previous award, Inglewood now has over $1.5 billion in transit budget.\n\nInglewood Mayor James T. Butts, an advocate for expanding Inglewood\u2019s transit infrastructure, believes in using funding opportunities to alleviate the city\u2019s long standing traffic problem.\n\n\u201cWhen the Lakers and the Kings are here, the city suffer[s] through that traffic.\u201d Butts said. \u201c[The new transit plans] will provide a conveyance that will move 11 to 12,000 people an hour above the streets, so the streets won\u2019t be impacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe this will be a game changer as it relates to mass transit,\u201d Butts added.\n\nHowever, a local community organization aimed at advocating for equitable infrastructure development, tenant rights and housing accessibility, Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE), expressed concerns that the accelerated plans may not ensure an equitable expansion for local residents. They are one of many community organizations that have aligned themselves with the NOlympicsLA coalition, an organization that opposes hosting the Olympics due to its socioeconomic impact on local communities.\n\nThe Director of Building Equity and Transit of SAJE, Oscar Zarate, is concerned about Metro\u2019s undertaking of expensive projects in light of the \u201828 Olympic Games, saying that he fears they may cater to tourists instead of local residents.\n\n\u201c[City government leaders] were divesting from policing contracts, improving the service, making the system fair,\u201d Zarate said in reference to local city politics before Olympic-related expansions. \u201cThose are going to take a backseat as we continue ... to push capital projects.\u201d\n\nL.A. has gone back and forth on its policies regarding accessible transit. In September 2020, Metro launched its Fareless System Initiative Task Force. Metro wrote the company had \u201cembarked on an intensive process of studying and identifying facts, challenges and opportunities related to eliminating fares on Metro buses and trains.\u201d\n\nJust two years later in September 2022, Newsom vetoed the AB 1919 bill that would launch a program allowing students and children to ride on public transit fareless called the \u201cYouth Transit Pass Pilot Program.\u201d Newsom cited costs and budget as the main reasoning behind his veto.\n\nThough Zarate is a proponent of expanding public transportation for more South L.A. communities, he said the new and accelerated developments could drive up housing costs for current residents.\n\n\u201cWhile someone sees a new transit station as a way to get to their jobs better, landlords see that as a way of justifying a $500 dollars rent increase or pushing a family of four out so they can increase the rent,\u201d Zarate said.\n\nIn response to the Crenshaw/LAX Line Transit Project, or the K-Line, the first listed project within the \u201cTwenty-eight for \u201828\u2032\u2032 plan, South L.A. residents expressed fears of housing prices soaring and businesses being bought out by larger companies hoping to capitalize on new transportation developments, specifically the K-Line, according to reporting by LAist.\n\nIn the article, small business owner Jackie Ryan of Baldwin Hills said the building where her store Zambezi Bazaar was located had been bought by a new company and she was subsequently pushed out.\n\n\u201cThere is a link between public investment in transit and gentrification and displacement,\u201d Paul Ong, a professor of urban planning at UCLA, wrote in the article.\n\nSome residents believe the expansive budget for the project could have been redirected towards more pressing community concerns.\n\n\u201cMaybe for schools, especially in the Black community,\u201d Inglewood resident Joethlyn Diaz said. \u201cI feel like they could do more scholarships, [more] spending money on the children.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report by The Urban Displacement Project, several L.A. small business owners connected new transit with local businesses being pushed out of their neighborhoods due to rising rent.\n\nL.A. Metro has made efforts to combat the potential displacement resulting from new transit development. The Metro Board of Directors has adopted a \u201cTransit Oriented Communities\u201d policy and an \u201cEquity Platform,\u201d writing that their equity platform is \u201cgrounded in planning for equity from the start of all Metro efforts, with deep community engagement.\u201d\n\nBell Gardens City Council Member Jorgel Chavez said the city must prioritize community input in new developments. Chavez said location, language and outreach barriers must be addressed when planning public meetings for residents\u2019 input.\n\n\u201cWe have to adapt. If we want to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure we get community response and community input,\u201d Chavez said.\n\nButts said the local community has been involved with new transit plans.\n\n\u201cThere have been public notifications. You can go to our website and see anything you want about the transit connector,\u201d Butts said. \u201cThere have been so many public meetings.\u201d\n\nL.A. Metro also has a history of over-policing Black and brown riders. Despite only making up 19% of Metro riders, Black Angelenos received over 50% of MTA citations and arrests over the past four years, according to a report from the Bus Riders Union.\n\nJoanna Mu\u00f1oz is a Metro Street Teams member, which are Metro ambassadors tasked with facilitating rider experience, and resident of South L.A. She believes transit safety should be prioritized before expansion.\n\n\u201cWe can have many buses, but they\u2019ve got to make sure it\u2019s a safe place for everybody,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\nCost is another barrier for many riders. The National League of Cities (NLC) reports that nearly 70% of Metro\u2019s customers are low-income, having a median household income of just over $19,000 a year.\n\nCommunity organizations like SAJE advocate for fareless transit as a means to make the Metro more equitable for the communities they serve. Other community organizations such as Crenshaw Subway Coalition, Alliance for Community Transit (actLA) and SAJE have been calling for more work to address these barriers that may make it more difficult for everyday residents to use transit.\n\nZarate said the influence of the Olympics makes it harder to push for improvements in public transit when L.A. Metro and the city are focused on expanding by the 2028 deadline.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do the things we want to do with operations and improving services and going fareless, because we\u2019re wasting money, ballooning policing contracts and expensive capital projects that go over budget all the time,\u201d Zarate said.\n\n\u201cHow do we make sure we are investing in this vital infrastructure for people?\u201d\n```"}

After an incredibly entertaining season, we move into the best tournament American sports has to offer.\n\nRoughly 25 teams in college basketball should feel comfortable that they\u2019ll receive an at-large bid and hear Greg Gumbel calmly list off their name come Sunday. For fans of teams on the \u2018bubble,\u2019 it\u2019s a different story.\n\nObviously, doing well in a competitive conference should be a sure-fire way for a team on the bubble to clinch their spot in the NCAA tournament. Enter bid-stealers.\n\nThere are 36 teams who will receive at-large bids into the NCAA tournament, the first of which will go to teams locked in the tournament. The rest will go to teams on the bubble. But what happens when a team not close to the tournament wins their conference and goes to the NCAA tournament? They steal a bid from a \u2018bubble\u2019 team and only add to the stress everyone feels come Selection Sunday.\n\nHere are some teams that can steal a bid and create further anxiety on the bubble this year.\n\nVillanova Wildcats (17-15)\nSaying Villanova basketball is a potential bid-stealer to someone who\u2019s intently paid attention to college basketball this year is one of the more obvious statements I can make. Villanova is +850 to win the whole tournament, according to FanDuel.\n\nThe Wildcats have had what can only be described as a weird season in their first year post-Jay Wright. Coaching inconsistencies and injuries to senior guard Justin Moore and freshman forward Cam Whitmore have caused a team projected to finish third in Big East to finish sixth.\n\nHowever, since getting Moore back in the lineup, the Wildcats are 7-5, including wins at home against No. 24 Creighton and on the road against No. 15 Xavier. Added to this is the fact that since 2014 Villanova is 27-3 at Madison Square Garden, where the Big East tournament will take place.\n\nExpect a strong run for the Wildcats as they attempt to keep their streak of making nine consecutive tournaments alive.\n\nFordham Rams (24-7)\nDespite losing their head coach to Villanova in the offseason, Fordham is currently undergoing one of the best seasons in program history. The Rams are led by head coach Keith Urgo, the Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year.\n\nKey to their success this year has been their home dominance; the Rams are 18-2 at home. The tournament will be played at Barclays Center, 20 miles from Fordham\u2019s home gym, meaning fans can travel in droves to the A-10 tournament.\n\nThe Rams are currently the No. 3 seed in the tournament, meaning they\u2019ll avoid VCU, the conference leader, and likely have a favorable road to the finals. If the dynamic duo of graduate students, forward Khalid Moore and guard Darius Quisenberry, can play at their peak, the Rams can win the entire tournament.\n\nTemple Owls (16-15)\nThe No. 1 Houston Cougars have only lost to two teams this season: No. 4 Alabama and the Temple Owls. Surprisingly, Temple has many good wins this year for a team not close to NCAA tournament contention.\n\nThey have beaten Villanova, Rutgers, VCU and, of course, Houston \u2014 all on the road. If they can beat No. 4 seed Cincinnati in the first round of the tournament, they\u2019ll face Houston again, where they could hand the Cougars their third loss.\n\nThe program is full of scorers, but redshirt sophomore guards Khalif Battle and Damian Dunn lead the line. It might be a stretch, but if there was a team to be able to beat Houston and steal a bid from a bubble team in the American Athletic Conference, it\u2019s the Temple Owls.\n\nColorado Buffaloes (17-15)\nThe Buffaloes are in a similar situation to the Temple Owls. They\u2019ve had some horrible losses, including ones to Massachusetts and Grambling State. Still, they\u2019ve beat No. 17 Tennessee and No. 18 Texas A&M.\n\nLooking at teams I\u2019ve written about thus far, Colorado is probably the least likely team to steal a bid from an at-large team. However, Colorado has proven they have the upside that can upset the best the Pac-12 has to offer.\n\nThe Buffaloes play UCLA in the second round of the Pac-12 tournament, and while they\u2019re a great team, the Bruins just lost their best defender, junior guard Jaylen Clark. Junior forward Tristan da Silva will need some help from his supporting cast following the loss of sophomore guard KJ Simpson, but they can definitely make a run in this tournament.\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Photo by Daphne Yaman.\n\nBy Daphne Yaman and Monica Esquivel\nMarch 09, 2023 at 1:25 pm PST\n\nBrothers Eric and Brian Nam discussed normalizing the conversation around mental health and creating a safe space for users of their app Mindset during a USC speaker event on Tuesday. The lack of mental health conversations spurred the two to create a social media platform that openly discusses mental health problems and promotes mental wellness.\n\nMindset inspires its users by sharing the lives and stories of influential artists through visual and audio storytelling. Users are able to keep up with artists by listening to them retell their journeys and words of advice.\n\n\u201cTo talk about something that is as personal, as sensitive as mental health, we thought it\u2019s important for it to come from the artist themselves,\u201d said Brian Nam, CEO and co-founder of Mindset, and younger brother of K-pop star and TV personality Eric Nam.\n\nWhile the app shares artist stories, it also features daily five-minute check-ins for everyday users to reflect on themselves, creating a self-care routine in a quick and easy way. This feature allows users to share their own feelings and experiences in a supportive community. You can also receive notifications that display words of encouragement and daily quotes on your phone screen as a member of Mindset.\n\nSome other features include expert advice from mental health professionals and professors, accessible through their exclusive library. Through the mental health wellness app, users have exclusive access to over 25 artists from different walks of life including actor Paul Wesley from \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d Korean rapper Mingyu and singer Tori Kelly.\n\nThe app currently boasts 3 million subscribers and over 4 million social media followers, according to their website. Accessibility was a top priority for both creators when making the app to best spread mental health awareness to the vast majority.\n\n\u201cA lot of the content on there is actually free, and we make it as accessible as possible,\u201d Brian Nam said. \u201cIt\u2019s to support our communities in ways that haven\u2019t been done before.\u201d\n\nUSC students at the event felt represented during the speaker discussions on mental health and were grateful to the creators for coming to speak on campus.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, it means a lot because I really like K-pop and him,\u201d said Christine Chen, a junior majoring in global geodesign and economics. \u201cFor him to actually come to our school [is] really special.\u201d\n\nGilbert Portillo, a second-year health behavior research Ph.D. student, shares that he initially attended the event to accompany a friend without much knowledge of the event itself, but was grateful for the experience.\n\n\u201cI appreciated having the space and being able to have this conversation in general with fellow people of color and also any allies,\u201d Portillo said.\n\nUSC\u2019s own Dr. Quade French, senior director of consultation and training for Campus Wellbeing and Education (CWE), joined the pair on stage to provide a professional opinion during the event. He discussed the importance of community as an option for mental health support compared to the standard notion of individual therapy.\n\n\u201cIndividual therapy is conceptualized in America as a really white and a really privileged way of getting support, [which] it is. And so I think it\u2019s important to really explore the other ways in which support can be found,\u201d Dr. French said. \u201cThere are diagnosed mental health disorders that could benefit from psychotherapy or from psychiatry, but there\u2019s a lot of things that can really be supported through community.\u201d\n\nMindset hones in on the importance of cultivating a supportive community to safely discuss topics of mental health, themes reciprocated by Dr. French.\n\nMichelle Chang, a USC dental student, shared her thoughts in response to Dr. French\u2019s remarks on mental health.\n\n\u201cIt really is nice to see people who look similar to me, who have [a] similar culture to me, talk about it [mental health] like it\u2019s normal,\u201d Chang said.\n```"}

However, coaches have worked on sharpening these new Trojans\u2019 skills and have high hopes for their performances. New Trojans have enjoyed their time at USC and have set high expectations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great atmosphere to get better and compete, so I\u2019m loving it so far,\u201d redshirt senior defensive lineman Jack Sullivan, who transferred from Purdue, said.\n\n247 Sports ranks USC\u2019s transfer portal haul as the fifth best in the nation. They acquired seven four-star and four three-star players.\n\n\u201cAny time we\u2019re going to the portal, we\u2019re looking for guys who can come in who we feel like can help us right away,\u201d offensive coordinator Josh Henson said. \u201cWe felt like all those guys can give us immediate help.\u201d\n\nAlthough these transfers may not yet have developed chemistry with seasoned Trojans, they have vast amounts of experience playing football, which the coaches admire.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was able to come in here and be the vet I need to be and help the younger guys and learn the playbook and be a leader out here,\u201d redshirt senior defensive lineman Kyon Barrs, who transferred from Arizona, said.\n\nTransfers have overwhelmingly positive feedback about their new teammates and their attitudes.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s had open arms,\u201d Michael Tarquin, a redshirt senior offensive lineman who transferred from Florida, said. \u201cGuys like Jonah, Justin Dedich, Cooper, everyone on the whole line.\u201d\n\nWith such a talented roster, coaches have set high standards for this season.\n\n\u201cCoach Riley\u2019s message has just been we did a lot of good things last year, but really we did that just to win games.

Winning habits,\u201d redshirt junior offensive lineman Jonah Monheim said. \u201cWe now have to build championship mentality, championship habits.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s offense drastically outperformed its defense last season.

That\u2019s coach Grinch\u2019s main thing,\u201d Barrs said. \u201cStraining to the ball and giving it your all every play.\u201d\n\nUSC was undefeated through the first six weeks last season but ended the season with consecutive losses to Utah in the Pac-12 Championship and Tulane in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nThe Trojans hope to maintain their momentum this season.\n\n\u201cJust finishing every period, finishing every practice better than we began,\u201d outside linebackers coach Roy Manning said. \u201cYou go back and look at our season last year, none of us were excited about the way it ended. We had an explosive start, but we didn\u2019t finish the way we wanted to.\u201d\n\nOne reason why the Trojans fell short in the end was because of poor habits they hadn\u2019t broken all season.

However, we are five months away from football season, and coaches have already reported great things from these new Trojans.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryson Nihipali)\n\nBy Logan Drone March 08, 2023 at 9:27 pm PST\n\nUSC baseball\u2019s offense exploded for 21 runs over Friday and Saturday\u2019s victories but could only score three in its weekend finale against rival UCLA.\n\nUSC opened up its weekend slate of games against Sacramento State on Friday night at Dedeaux Field as part of the Southern California College Baseball Classic. The Trojans aimed to get back on track against the 6-1 Sacramento State Hornets, as they were winless in their last five contests.\n\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t been able to put it together here lately,\u201d head coach Andy Stankiewicz said. \u201cI want to see a consistent approach offensively, I want to see strikes on the mound and I want to play good defense, and we haven\u2019t been able to combine those three.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans looked to get back on track behind Opening Day starter Tyler Stromsborg. Freshman center fielder Austin Overn wasted no time getting the game started, ripping a leadoff triple in the right-center gap. Senior right fielder Cole Gabrielson drove him in with a sacrifice fly, giving the Trojans an early 1-0 lead.\n\nUSC found adversity in the third after allowing a leadoff homerun and the first five runners of the inning to reach base. Sacramento State was looking to break the game open with the bases loaded, no outs, and a 2-1 lead. The Trojans had other plans.\n\nAfter eliminating a potential run on a fielder\u2019s choice, Gabrielson came up huge for USC, throwing a runner out at home from deep right field. This marked an inning-ending double play and the end of Sacramento State\u2019s scoring threat.\n\nThe Trojans kept this momentum and responded in the bottom frame, as senior infielder Johnny Olmstead roped a two-out RBI single. Gabrielson followed up with a two-run blast, giving USC a 4-2 lead. After tallying another run the next inning, the Trojans took a commanding 5-2 lead into the fifth.\n\nFollowing a leadoff strikeout, Stromsburg found himself in trouble in the fifth, allowing five runs on four hits in the inning. After gaining runners on third with less than two outs in the fifth and sixth, the Trojans came up empty-handed both times, still trailing 7-5 going into the seventh.\n\nSenior designated hitter Nick Lopez came up clutch once again this season for the Trojans, driving a game-tying two-run home run to right field. Just three batters later, freshman first baseman Ethan Hedges drove an RBI triple with two outs to give USC an 8-7 lead heading into the eight.\n\nSophomore reliever Caden Connolly entered the game for USC as it looked to win for the first time in six games. In the top of the ninth, junior left fielder Carson Wells made a spectacular catch to rob a home run and maintain the Trojans\u2019 lead. Connolly struck out the next batter and secured the six-out save for USC, allowing just one runner to reach base over the two innings.\n\nUSC relievers Connolly and sophomore Josh Blum combined for 4.2 innings pitched, allowing just one hit and striking out six in the process.\n\n\u201cBlum did a nice job coming in and giving us a shot, keeping us in it, and Connolly, who\u2019s been very, very good all year long,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe felt like, hey, leave him in the game, let him try to get that big save for us, and he did.\u201d\n\nUSC looked to replicate Friday night\u2019s well-rounded success against a gritty Tulane team on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe come out against a very aggressive Tulane team, where they like to run, they\u2019ve got a ton of stolen bases already, so we\u2019ve got to be able to slow down the running game when runners get on base,\u201d Stankiewicz said.\n\nThe Trojans opened up Saturday\u2019s game against Tulane flat, falling behind 4-1 heading into the bottom of the third. Gabrielson then smashed a three-run home run, marking his team-leading fifth home run of the season to tie the game. Olmstead followed up with an RBI triple just two batters later.\n\nIn the same inning, Overn came up to the dish with two runners on and slugged a two-out triple to lengthen the Trojans\u2019 lead to 8-4. Tulane hung around, however, slashing two home runs in the top of the fifth to cut the lead to 8-7.\n\nJust like USC has done several times before, it immediately answered in the bottom frame. Junior shortstop Ryan Jackson ripped a two-out, two-run double, and Gabrielson followed up by driving him in with an RBI single, his seventh RBI in just two games.\n\nAfter scoring again in the seventh inning, USC and Tulane exchanged runs in the eighth thanks to another RBI triple by Overn, his third three-bagger in two games. The Trojans held a commanding 13-8 lead heading into the ninth when they closed the door.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing crazy,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about getting good at-bats together, and we did a good job with that today.\u201d\n\nUSC held Tulane\u2019s runners to zero stolen bases, executing their game plan to a tee and coming out victorious in the process.\n\nThe Trojans traveled to Jackie Robinson Stadium on Sunday to face off against cross-town rival and No. 17-ranked UCLA. USC handed the ball over to redshirt freshman Eric Hammond, who was looking to bounce back after getting knocked out early against Auburn last week.\n\nOvern led off the game staying red hot, ripping a triple in the right-center gap. This marked his seventh triple on the season, three more than anyone else in all of college baseball. USC left Overn stranded at third, coming away empty-handed in the first.\n\nThe Bruins offense quickly timed up Hammond, launching a two-run home run in the second to take a 2-0 lead. UCLA added onto its lead in the third with an RBI double by sophomore designated hitter Jack Holman.\n\nAfter retiring the next two batters and getting through the potential threat, Hammond\u2019s day on the mound was done.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to get better,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that we\u2019ve got high hopes for and believe in, but it\u2019s time for him to start getting on the mound and getting after it.\u201d\n\nAs zeros lit up the scoreboard for USC, the Trojans were finally able to put some runs on the board after a two-out, RBI double by Hedges drove in a run in the sixth. UCLA immediately responded, scoring two more to lead 5-1 entering the seventh.\n\nUSC was still looking for that one big hit to bring it back into the game. Gabrielson stepped up to the dish in the seventh with runners in scoring position and two outs. If there was anyone the Trojans wanted at the plate at this moment, Gabrielson was the guy.\n\nAfter drawing a full count, Gabrielson struck out looking on a backdoor slider, once more falling short of cutting into the Bruins\u2019 lead.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 bats remained silent until the ninth inning. After entering the game in the seventh, junior second baseman Nate Clow came up to the dish and launched a two-run home run, giving USC life.\n\nAfter two infield singles put the tying run on base, the Trojans had the Bruins on their heels with Lopez coming up. That was all the fight the Trojans had in them, as Lopez soared a high fly ball to left that was caught for the final out.\n\nThe Trojans fell short, losing 5-3. USC was 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position, unable to execute on offense when it needed to most.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating because we didn\u2019t play particularly well,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe had some opportunities early, took some big swings and couldn\u2019t get the runner in from third base with less than two outs.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans aim to bounce back Wednesday night at Dedeaux Field against the Nevada Wolfpack before hosting second-ranked Stanford for a weekend series to begin Pac-12 play.\n\n\u201cWe just got to learn how to play complete baseball,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not putting it together for nine innings, and against a good ball club, that\u2019s gonna hurt you.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Ethan Huang, Katelyn Do and Chuck White\nMarch 08, 2023 at 8:36 pm PST\n\nThis weekend, Inglewood hosted Rolling Loud, its first-ever large-scale music festival. While roughly 60,000 hip-hop fans flocked to the festival to see artists like Travis Scott, Future and Lil Wayne, many harbored concerns about the venue\u2019s safety following recent concert-related tragedies. After a crowd crush during Scott\u2019s set at 2021\u2032s Astroworld Festival in Houston left 10 dead, security and crowd control have become a concern for both festival attendees and organizers.\n\nWhile some injuries and minor incidents were reported this weekend, it appears to have been a relatively safe event. \u201cWith all of the protocols and plans in place, I felt prepared to know what to do in case of an emergency and had confidence in the systems in place,\u201d said Nina Patel, a human biology major at USC, who volunteered as an EMT at Rolling Loud with the organization Rock Medicine.\n\nOrganizers actively worked to calm crowds during performances at this weekend\u2019s festival. Rolling Loud\u2019s founder, Tariq Cherif, came onto the stage alongside other officials to encourage attendees to take steps back and make sure their fellow concertgoers had enough space.\n\nRolling Loud has a history of dangerous situations. In 2019, a man was beaten to death during a festival held at Exposition Park. That same year at Rolling Loud Miami, Travis Scott allegedly continued to incite mosh pits and stampedes after local police urged him to stop his performance. This resulted in one of the many lawsuits against Scott after Astroworld highlighted the artist\u2019s responsibility in regard to crowd safety.\n\nA stampede at a recent GloRilla concert in New York left one dead and nine injured after false rumors of a shooting at the venue. That event had no connection to Rolling Loud.\n\nAt Rolling Loud this weekend, Scott\u2019s set ended abruptly. In the middle of his hit song, \u201cSicko Mode,\u201d the clock struck 11 p.m., and the speakers were cut. While Scott continued to perform, the screens behind him went black before a goodbye message appeared. The festival had set a curfew for 11 p.m. which was strictly enforced.\n\nThis was just one of the many ways that the crew behind the scenes worked to ensure a safer environment for attendees. Even so, there were still a few moments where security had to intervene, including when a fan tried to jump on the stage during Ice Spice\u2019s performance after professing his love for her. Two security guards immediately took care of the situation, blocking the man from approaching the stage.\n\nAccording to Rolling Loud\u2019s team, this was a publicity stunt, but some attendees weren\u2019t so sure. Caitlin Reeves, a student at the University of Tampa, traveled across the country for her spring break to attend Rolling Loud in Los Angeles. She said ID checks, bag checks and a wristband system were in place to contribute to safety measures. Still, she made sure to stay close to her friend who went with her.\n\n\u201cWe would just make sure that we grabbed onto each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re always together in crowds because people would rush to the stage, and we\u2019re just scared of it getting too crazy.\u201d\n\nReeves added that much of the sense of security actually came from the crowd itself, as many attendees supported each other to create a safer experience. \u201cI saw someone kind of like, get sick and everyone backed up and gave them space,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cA bunch of people were making sure he was okay, bringing him water and stuff. Like people are definitely looking out for each other.\u201d\n\nA Rolling Loud representative pointed out after this article was published that the organization has produced six successful festivals in the U.S. and in Portugal and Canada since November 2021. \u201cRolling Loud has remained a safe festival for fans to attend,\u201d the representative said.\n\nWith all the measures in place, Rolling Loud still was not exempt from risk and injury. \u201cRolling Loud was one of the largest events I have worked,\u201d Patel said. \u201cDue to the nature of the event, we had many calls relating to drugs and alcohol as well as crowd-related injuries. Providing care in a festival and concert environment can be difficult due to the constraints of large crowds and it being very loud.\u201d\n\nAfter this article was published, Patel requested for her comments to be deleted as she is not an official spokesperson for the organization.\n\nAs for Reeves, she spent much of her time in the VIP section, where she said it was much calmer. However, the same cannot always be said for the general section. The VIP section is less crowded and includes many luxuries that make the concert-going experience more enjoyable and less stressful. For example, it has air-conditioned restrooms, seated areas in the shade and private food and beverage vendors. These privileges are not accessible to those who are in general admission and might not have been able to afford VIP tickets.\n\nBut for regular concertgoers, coveted general admission tickets could also mean lesser protection from dangerous and rowdy crowds. The Rolling Loud representative said that is not accurate and that the organization \u201ctreats the security and wellbeing of all their guests with the utmost care, regardless of ticket type.\u201d\n\nWith the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on the horizon, many will be interested to see how other festivals plan to approach the safety of attendees.\n\nTaylor Contarino also contributed to this reporting. This story was updated to correct the number of fans attending the event, to reflect that an incident on stage was a prank and to include additional context from a Rolling Loud representative.\n```"}

President-elect Divya Jakatdar and Vice President-elect Michelle Lu, both current USG senators, told Annenberg Media they received at least four misogynistic comments from fellow student leaders in one-on-one conversations.\n\n\u201cWe saw the culture in student government, as it is right now, there have been many complaints over the last year about misogyny and condescension,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cWe have been on the receiving end of several instances of misogyny over the last year.\u201d\n\nJakatdar said she thought the comments intended to undermine female leadership in the organization, but neither Jakatdar nor Lu would describe the incidents in detail.\n\n\u201cWe want to be very open, [but] there are also rules according to the current processes about how we can discuss this while the situation\u2019s being addressed,\u201d Jakatdar said.\n\nJakatdar said comments in question had come from both men and women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s misogyny, and it\u2019s like varying forms of condescension,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cBut some of the comments were not about that. It was about income. And like it was about some pretty crazy, obvious [diversity, equity and inclusion] issues.\u201d\n\nThe accusations have ignited a debate over the culture of an organization that represents 21,000 students with a $2.5 million budget.\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media, USG President Hannah Woodworth, whose term expires in May, acknowledged an \u201cisolated\u201d incident of misconduct.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say that this has been one specific person that I have heard this come from,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cWe have followed the appropriate and necessary channels that are created by the university to ensure that the correct disciplinary action was taken.\u201d\n\nWoodworth and others in USG leadership declined to elaborate on the incident, citing privacy reasons, but said the comment did not target a specific person and described it as \u201clow impact\u201d in offensiveness.\n\nLu said she\u2019s filed one report to the USG administration. It\u2019s unclear whether that report was the complaint Woodworth mentioned.\n\nMembers in the organization have the ability to file anonymous complaints that go straight to executive leadership for review. Just like any organization tied to the university, USG leadership has an obligation to hand over \u201csignificant\u201d violations to USC campus partners, such as Title IX and Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services.\n\n\u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened yet because nothing has been significant enough to be sent to those officers,\u201d said Diego Andrades, USG chief of staff. \u201cIf we get a complaint \u2014 we don\u2019t have the permission to share it across the entire organization, but we will let people know if something is cultural.\u201d\n\nJakatdar said the current administration has \u201cgood intentions\u201d but described a gap in what reporting processes can address.\n\n\u201cWe have repeat offenders in our organization. We know of people who have gotten many complaints from many different people, and if the most that can happen is them to get lectured and they keep doing it, that\u2019s just not going to work,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cThat makes our own students feel uncomfortable. Nobody deserves to feel like that.\u201d\n\nJakatdar and Lu said they want to address the problem on Day One.\n\n\u201cWe want to create tangible consequences beyond that initial conversation so that these offenses don\u2019t continue to happen,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cWe\u2019re currently in the process of amending [the] bylaws that would also hold officers to a behavioral standard.\u201d\n\nWoodworth described student government as \u201cvibrant and compassionate\u201d but did not dismiss other claims of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThis has not been reported or shared with us, so it makes me sad that this is what people are experiencing within our organization, Woodworth said. \u201cI will never question or doubt women who are coming forward about what their experience looks like.\u201d\n\nJakatdar and Lu emphasized that not every person subjected to offensive comments makes an official report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not to say that anyone has bad intentions, but it\u2019s just surprising sometimes that at this stage in our lives, other students say things or think like that,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely upsetting, it\u2019s hurtful.

Now two months in office, Lee said some policy debates have turned personal but nothing outwardly offensive.\n\n\u201cI would never say that it got so personal, that like a serious fight broke out or anything [but] I would say certainly, a little bit rude and unprofessional,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee added that USG\u2019s administration has been professional in \u201cmaking sure the culture at USG is not toxic.\u201d\n\nWoodworth acknowledged areas for improvement but touted the growth of the organization.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear contrast between the culture that we see this year and people\u2019s excitement being in the office as compared to last year,\u201d Woodworth said.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore March 08, 2023 at 7:06 pm PST\n\nFor USC students, finding a ride back to campus from LAX can be frustrating. Three USC students have a solution. USC juniors James McColl, Toan Huynh and Max Albright designed their first original app \u201cShairport\u201d which launched on the App Store on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe ourselves would be at LAX, and we\u2019d be trying to get a Lyft back, and they\u2019d be sometimes $70 or $80,\u201d McColl said. \u201cWe thought, what if we could implement an easy and secure way for USC students to find other USC students so they could share that ride back to campus?\u201d\n\nTo use the app, users must be near LAX\u2019s Lyft pickup area, LAX-it, and log in with their USC email address to make sure all riders are only USC students. According to the app\u2019s Instagram account, Lyft and Uber rides from LAX back to USC cost up to $70. With Shairport, the founders hope to cut that cost in half for students.\n\nWhile the app is in early stages, some USC students already seem to like the idea of a shared riding system for traveling back to campus. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s gonna be beneficial because the cost of an Uber from LAX is sometimes really expensive,\u201d said Iliyan Valani, a sophomore majoring in biology and data science. \u201cSometimes you can get away with having a $30 Uber and sometimes it\u2019s $70 or $100.\u201d\n\nMcColl, Huynh and Albright came up with the idea for the app in an introduction to software development course and pitched it for a project. The idea went from a pitch, to a website and eventually to an app available for download on the App Store.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that people don\u2019t want to go on websites and make this ticket,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cWe thought the website itself wasn\u2019t the path to take and we knew that iOS was the way to go.\u201d\n\nMcColl, Huynh and Albright pitched the idea to Lyft to see if they were interested and the three of them are in the process of discussing a potential partnership. They believe it could serve as an improvement to Lyft\u2019s shared ride program because of the fact that you are guaranteed to be paired with another USC student.\n\nSwitching from a website to an app came with its challenges as the group originally built the website to help people get rides from campus to LAX. They soon learned that the demand surrounded issues getting rides from the airport back to campus.\n\n\u201cWe had to basically learn a whole new tech stack and a bunch of languages,\u201d Albright said. \u201cBut it was also way more rewarding because we were learning so much. It was a fun experience, but it definitely was not easy.\u201d\n\nWith safety being the top priority for the group, McColl, Huynh and Albright are open to looking for more methods to ensure students do not have to worry about any potential safety concerns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting in additional measures in the next round of rolling out the app,\u201d McColl said. \u201cWhether that be just an additional support link that you can contact if something is going wrong with your ride, or if you get paired with someone who is not reaching out or being responsive, you can easily create another ticket to find another person to go with.\u201d\n\nUSC students also think the app could help create a safer experience for students trying to travel back to campus. \u201cI think the app will be really good,\u201d said Athena Diamantidis, a senior majoring in computer science major. \u201cIt would probably help a lot of low-income people and I think it would also be good in terms of safety.\u201d\n\nAs the app continues to grow and get more traction, the founders hope to expand and involve other colleges in Los Angeles. \u201cWe actually want to expand to other colleges around L.A.,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cI know a lot of students travel to LAX from UCLA, LMU and other schools, so that\u2019s in the future for us.\u201d\n\nAs more users get access to the app, McColl, Huynh and Albright are looking for any feedback they can get that will improve the experience for everyone.\n```"}

(Photo by Tatiana Sataua)\n\nBy Mia Thompson, Sana Mahmud and Tatiana Sataua\nMarch 08, 2023 at 6:57 pm PST\n\nUSC\u2019s Alumni Park was painted with vibrant hues Wednesday afternoon as Afghan feminist street artist Shamsia Hassani joined students and community members in a live art session to kick off a three-part series celebrating International Women\u2019s Day. Participants sat on picnic blankets on the grass and painted alongside Hassani while she created meaningful large-scale art pieces. The event, held by USC Visions and Voices, provided all of the art supplies and encouraged walkups, inviting the public to create art and chat with Hassani. She spoke with them about the process and purpose of her work and how she uses it to communicate powerful messages as a graffiti artist and muralist.\n\n\u201cI would love to give them hope. But I know that hope is not something temporary, just for a moment,\u201d Hassani said. \u201cWhen they look at my art, they feel something and they can get anything they want. Usually people ask me, \u2018Who is this character?\u2019 But it could be anyone.\u201d\n\nBefore the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Hassani\u2019s murals sprawled across the city of Kabul, depicting women breaking down barriers and defying traditional gender roles in a male-dominated society. Many of those murals depicted a woman in a burka, and over time, Hassani explained that she changed the shape of her character to have a sharp shoulder and a stronger appearance.\n\nGender inequality remains an ongoing issue for women in Afghanistan who are denied access to livelihoods, health care and education, and often subjected to gender-based violence, according to the United Nations. Much of Hassani\u2019s work depicts a woman who demonstrates strength and resilience despite the many issues and hardships standing in her way. She gives her female characters \u201ca face with power, ambition, and willingness to achieve goals,\u201d according to her website.\n\nIt is a canvas for the power of art in the global fight for women\u2019s rights. Inviting artists like Hassani can infiltrate the bubble that many USC students are living in, said Farrah Diogene, a sophomore majoring in psychology.\n\n\u201cArt is definitely full of emotions,\u201d Diogene said. \u201cIt\u2019s full of pain; it\u2019s full of love; it\u2019s full of hope. And so being able to observe this in person and see this, I don\u2019t think anyone can really look away. No one can really ignore what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nTen-year-old Isla Curtis and her father drove over an hour to paint with Hassani, after completing a school project about her last week. Hassani is featured in a book called \u201cGood Night Stories for Rebel Girls,\u201d which Curtis brought along for her newfound hero to sign.\n\n\u201cI was inspired by her because I like painting and doing art. And she used it to help change the world for people. So I wanted to choose her,\u201d Curtis said. Curtis, who is in fifth grade, brought her school project to share with Hassani and got her autograph. Like Hassani, she said she wants to use art to help change the world.\n\nHassani\u2019s newest series, \u201cBirds of No Nation,\u201d is what initially inspired the three-part series on USC\u2019s campus in celebration of International Women\u2019s day.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that birds are always traveling and they have no specific nation,\u201d Hassani said in a Youtube video by the Creators Project. \u201cI feel that Afghan people are feeling that they have no nation. They have no country because they are not feeling good in their own country.\u201d\n\nThe second part of the event kicked off after the live art session and featured a creative letter-writing workshop with Gazelle Samizay, an acclaimed Afghan American multimedia artist whose work highlights the \u201ccontradictions of culture, nationality and gender,\u201d according to the event description.\n\nUSC librarian Sophie Liesinska helped coordinate the event and spoke about the inspiration she found through Hassani\u2019s work. For Liesinska, the emotions that Hassani conveys through her artwork resonate deeply.\n\n\u201cWhen a friend of mine started sending me pictures of some of Shamsia\u2019s work, I thought, \u2018This is beautiful \u2014 so feminine, so full of joy, despite the circumstances and hopeful and defiant at the same time,\u2019\u201d Liesinska said.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Hassani joined Samizay along with acclaimed journalist and human rights activist Najiba Ayubi for a conversation about \u201cAfghan Women on Art, Gender, Freedom and Exile.\u201d```"}

The survey collected responses from over 2,300 students at 100 LAUSD schools.\n\nThe Police Free LAUSD Coalition, a group of 15 L.A. community-based organizations, spoke at the LAUSD headquarters on Tuesday in support of the Black Student Achievement Plan, which increases financial aid for mental health resources for Black students.\n\n\u201cTo the 2,300 students that completed the survey, mental health is still an issue because there are still not enough resources,\u201d said Amir Whitaker, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and the event\u2019s first speaker. \u201cSchools are still relying on policing, criminalizing and abusing students in response to fighting and other behavior that would be stopped and prevented with mental health support.\u201d\n\nLAUSD declined to comment on the findings of the survey and the Police Free LAUSD Coalition\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cThe LAUSD is designed to spend on everything other than the value of our students,\u201d Phillip Lester, an intervention expert with the Reverence Project and a mentor to LAUSD work, said. Union leaders, teachers and members of LAUSD at the event said their structure is flawed. They argued that the school system isn\u2019t allocating enough funding into programs that concern students\u2019 well-being.\n\nPrograms such as the BSAP serve as a resource for Black students to turn to in light of the lack of resources provided by LAUSD.\n\n\u201cWe know that the district does not continue to fund and support programs that they don\u2019t have an obligation to fund and support so that\u2019s why we, the teachers, are demanding that the BSAP is codified in our contract,\u201d Julie Van Winkle, the secondary vice president of United Teachers of Los Angeles, said.\n\nSince the survey, students have made their voices heard about what they need out of a learning environment. LAUSD teachers are supporting their fight for the BSAP to take form in the district\u2019s agenda for the school year.\n\n\u201cWe are demanding that they have access to mental health resources, community-based safety programs and support for Black teens on campuses,\u201d said Jacob Jackson, a youth outreach coordinator with the Youth Justice Coalition. \u201cIs that too much to ask for?\u201d\n\nJackson and his peers agree that their voices need to be heard by LAUSD, because they are the ones who are suffering from the district\u2019s neglect of Black students\u2019 mental health needs.\n\n\u201cWe have to end the criminalization of our youth,\u201d said Christian Flag, director of training and youth programming of the Black Community Coalition. During Flag\u2019s speech, he emphasized that there is still room for change to be made for students like Jackson.\n\n\u201cThere are close to 40,000 Black students in LAUSD who [see] this program as powerful and transformative as it is on paper,\u201d Flag said. \u201cCurrently, it is only concentrated [on] targeting 52 schools. So just that baseline, we got some victories, but we are forever pushing and fighting for more.\u201d\n\nFlag acknowledges that LAUSD is looking to implement mental health programs for Black students; however, he said they need to bolster their efforts to see real change happen in students\u2019 lives by implementing programs like BSAP.\n\nFlag led a chant to students, teachers and activists at the end of his speech at the LAUSD headquarters: \u201cIt is our duty to fight for freedom, it is our duty to win.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Mia Thompson)\n\nBy Nora Miller and Sophia Ketterer\nMarch 08, 2023 at 5:34 pm PST\n\nStudents are worried after recent news that the university approved a tuition increase of 5% for the 2023-24 school year, making the annual tuition $66,640. USC announced the tuition increase on its undergraduate admission website on Tuesday, but the university has yet to notify its student body in an official announcement. This price raise follows the 5% increase from the current academic year.\n\nThe university cited inflation for the increase of tuition. \u201cLike other universities across the country, inflation is impacting our costs,\u201d the university said in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cTuition is the largest source of the university\u2019s academic operating budget, which pays for teaching, student services, facilities and administrative support.\u201d\n\nTaking into account additional costs including housing, dining, books and supplies, and transportation, the total cost for students would be roughly $90,900, according to the USC admissions website. For the current school year, USC ranked 7th in most expensive schools according to U.S. News. With the recent increase, USC is expected to move up the ranks in the most expensive list.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of shocked,\u201d Emily Lynch, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, said. \u201cWe already pay so much to go here. What else are they possibly going to do with that money?\u201d\n\nAlong with tuition, the university is also expected to increase their financial aid pool by 7%, according to their statement to Annenberg Media. Two thirds of the student population at USC receive financial assistance from need-based grants, merit scholarships and federal work study and loans, according to the university, but students are still worried about how the increase could set limitations for them.\n\n\u201cMany students might get accepted and have to deal with the financial aspect of education and decide not to come,\u201d Diego Hsu, a senior studying economics and math, said. Sofia Stojanovski, a freshman studying music industry, agrees with Hsu, noting that \u201ca lot\u201d of her friends from home were accepted to USC but chose not to go, because of the high tuition and not being offered enough financial aid.\n\nSome students expressed frustration that tuition increases are the norm. \u201cThis isn\u2019t new and it isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d Will Chambers, a senior majoring in politics, philosophy and law, said. \u201cIt should change, but I\u2019ve experienced it all four years and I don\u2019t expect it to change now.\u201d\n\nStudents fear that the cost of tuition will impact the incoming class of students, especially considering Los Angeles is one of the most expensive cities to live in the nation. \u201cThe cost of living here is already astronomical,\u201d Madeleine Reinoso, a sophomore studying health and human sciences said. As a transfer student, she doesn\u2019t have on-campus housing and is paying $18,000 in rent for the year.\n\nAdditional costs of being a student include groceries, off-campus activities and meal plans, which are required for students who have USC housing. The university estimates that living expenses can range from $13,000 to $20,000 depending on class standing.\n\n\u201cJust surviving and living in L.A. is very difficult and crazy,\u201d Shay Thiede, a sophomore studying law, history and culture, said. While other colleges and universities have raised their tuition by as much as 4%, none of these tuition increases have surpassed USC\u2019s new sticker price.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a deterrent for many people from coming to USC and college in general,\u201d Royce Ilaga, a sophomore studying human biology, said. \u201c[For] a lot of students who have to take out loans or pay out of pocket, there will be a lot of consequences.\u201d```"}

And today here at Visions and Voices through the Birds of No Nation Series, we are highlighting the fact that the global fight for women\u2019s rights obviously is not just here in the U.S. it is national. It is global.\n\nDavid Delgado is a Visions and Voices staff member.\n\nDELGADO: We are focusing on Afghanistan. We have three amazing Afghan artists and activists who, through their work, are highlighting the importance that is the liberation in all forms of women in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, women often face barriers in accessing healthcare, higher education, and can even be barred from working. And these Afghan artists highlight the struggles Afghan women face through their paintings, photography, and journalism.\n\nUSC Law student, Melanie Abramoff, is also participating. She\u2019s standing in front of a blank canvas getting ready to paint. She says she\u2019s inspired by the Afghan artists and plans to paint something that celebrates women\u2019s accomplishments.\n\nABRAMOFF: Unfortunately, women are still oppressed and we are very thankful and lucky to live in a country where we are not secondary in the same way that women are considered secondary in other parts of the world. So it\u2019s very important to lift up artists who are women, business people who are women and people who identify as women or were raised as women. So that way we can see different diverse opinions and understand the complexity, the complexities of what it is to be raised as a woman.\n\nSophie Lesinska is a librarian at Doheny.\n\nLESINSKA: There\u2019s it\u2019s there\u2019s a reason why this is International Women\u2019s Day.

She explains the importance of all works being showcased today.\n\nLESKINSKA: The Taliban takeover ruined lives, the lives of many Afghans, but particularly of women. And, uh, it it happened over a year ago. And we start forgetting about this. So many other things internationally have happened. But these women need us. Uh, we need to remember about them and give them as much support as we can.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what USC student, Tamara Margaryan, was doing. She was participating at the event. And she reminds us why it\u2019s important to appreciate the women around us.\n\nMARGARYAN: It just means taking a moment to talk to the women in your life that you appreciate.

Today more than ever, it is important to honor the women who are not granted the same freedoms as their male counterparts. A group of about fifteen stood in front of Tommy Trojan today holding signs in solidarity with women who have fallen victim to Iran\u2019s violent actions.\n\nWe spoke with some of the attendees about the significance of the demonstration. Third year business major Efran Zeraat made it clear that he believes everyone should educate themselves about the severity of the gendered related issues going on in Iran.\n\nZERAAT: Today we are hosting a demonstration to raise awareness for the current revolution going on in Iran, which came as a result of a lot of the oppression that women have been facing for years. And it originally came after the Iranian regime killed a woman for not wearing her hijab correctly. So that\u2019s how it all started. And today we\u2019re spreading the movement.

I mean, no, let me rephrase. More like forty-four years of oppression in Iran of an apartheid system that\u2019s basically racially, ethnically, and specifically gender-sexually designated. So that goes with that. And then moreover, stand in solidarity with the brave Iranian women and all Iranian people in general living under the most evil and ruthless of dictatorships. My parents lost their homeland because of the revolution of 79. Just imagine, you know, you\u2019re studying abroad in Paris and you\u2019re a USC student, you are going to school in LA and all of a sudden there is a revolution and you just can\u2019t go home because a bunch of radicals take over. Instability ensues.\u201d\n\nWomen in Iran have been subjected to unfair practices for decades including restrictions like entering sporting events, being jailed for singing in public, violence if not properly covering one\u2019s hair, and many others. With everyday activities posing a risk to safety, women in Iran are in constant fear for their well-being.

If overturned, this will be the first time in 30 years Congress has nullified a local D.C law. This has brought up questions of Washington D.C\u2019s statehood.\n\nWe spoke to Monica Hopkins who is the executive director of The American Civil Liberties Union, also known as the ACLU. Her knowledge of the D.C. district presents the problem on how the D.C. legislation is practiced in its jurisdiction.\n\nHOPKINS: A little bit about DC itself. D.C. is not a state. It is actually one of the only capital cities whose residents cannot vote in the government that actually represents us. And a lot of people would say, \u2018Oh well, it\u2019s in the Constitution that DC can\u2019t be a state\u2019, which is absolutely false. What the Constitution says is that the federal government, the federal seat of government should be no more than ten square miles. It does not say how small it can be.\n\nTo the surprise of Democrats, President Biden pledged full support behind the Republican-backed effort to overturn the law. Outrage was imminent from Democrats and members of The American Civil Liberties Union. The Washington Branch of the ACLU said: \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s support to overturn the Revised Criminal Code Act undermines D.C\u2019s fight for statehood and maintaining home rule.\u201d\n\nThe DC city council chair has since tried to withdraw the law from congressional consideration, but to no avail. Monica Hopkins simplifies for us what the people of D.C. are currently dealing with.\n\nHOPKINS: So imagine living in California. You elected people to a legislative body. That legislative body passes laws, but they are not the final deciders. The final deciders are every other state has elected people and that body of elected officials.

This drop in revenue comes as a result of the company\u2019s decision to break partnership with Ye in October. They broke from the artist, formerly known as Kanye West, in response to his anti-Semitic and anti-Black comments made on social media. The Yeezy line accounted for an estimated 15% of Adidas\u2019s net income. The financial strain of the loss of these products has led to a reported new deal between the artist and the sportswear manufacturer.\n\nOn February 24 Hypebeast reported that Ye and Adidas had reached a new deal to sell $500 million of the remaining Yeezy sneakers. Some USC students feel that the move is problematic. Zaira Blake: I saw it as like a real brave act for Adidas to cut ties with them. Considering that Kanye has contributed so much revenue to Adidas. But then now that they\u2019re coming back, another that they lost so much money and now they\u2019re coming back, I realize that it really was all just performative. So it really makes me kind of look down and Adidas.\n\nOther students feel that the new partnership is troubling but it won\u2019t affect their decision to buy Adidas or Yeezy products. Shari Hill: I think it just goes to show that these companies really promote, you know, being inclusive and just caring about their customers. But in actuality, everyone is just out for money. And I\u2019m not here to say like, oh, don\u2019t buy from them, because maybe if I like a new Yeezy, I might buy it. Like, I\u2019m not going to lie. But at the same time, it\u2019s just about, you know, just try to find brands that actually do care about their customers and aren\u2019t only worried about, you know, what they can produce for themselves.\n\nDespite the debate, Jeffrey Hirsch, Professor of branding and integrated marketing thinks that the smartest move for Adidas is right in front of them. Hirsch: I think the best case scenario for them as they liquidate the inventory, they give the profits to charity, preferably some, you know, education, anti-Semitism, education in Germany. After this dilemma, Hirsch sees no future for the shoe line. Hirsch: Yeezy is over. I mean, you know, there\u2019s no going back to that. You know, the damage is done and Kanye is toxic and, you know, they can\u2019t possibly go on with that. And it can\u2019t be Yeezy without Ye...\n\nRegardless of the situation that they\u2019re in, Adidas seems like its in between a rock and a hard place.

New Genesis is an audio series about the black women reporter experience. My primary focus for this series is to spotlight black women reporters and I also will spotlight executives in the media and entertainment industry. We will discuss how each guest got to where they are today. So let\u2019s hop straight into what I call, \u201cNew Genesis\u201d - which is the beginning of each individual\u2019s story.\n\nKandiss Crone: Yeah, well, you have to check your emotions and at the door because the story is about something bigger than you. That\u2019s Kandiss Crone. She is a reporter for CBS2/KCAL 9 News and a Video Coach for students at USC Annenberg. Today we will talk with her about why she wanted to pursue a career in journalism, and then how do you cover an event like the death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant, and the importance of representation on TV, We\u2019ll also hear the special meaning of Beyonce\u2019s Cuff it in Kandiss\u2019s life at the moment.\n\nSince this is New Genesis, all about beginnings, let\u2019s start with how Kandiss\u2019s story began. Crone: Growing up, we watched a lot of news in my house. It was always on, especially dinnertime. So it would be, you know, the TV would be on the local news or the evening news national. And so it was just sort of a conversation piece. You know, it was about current events and what\u2019s going on in not only the neighborhood but in the world was a very important focus of my family. So and just being surrounded by it, that\u2019s how I knew I wanted to do something important. I wanted to be able to tell stories and to give information to the public that was needed. That was important. And so that responsibility I sort of gravitated to.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of the late, great PBS journalist Gwen Ifill.... She covered history and made history.. Gwen once said... when asked about other little brown girls watching her on TV... that it always stopped her in her tracks.... because as long as she could remember, there was someone on the other side of the camera.. Who was watching her... with expectation... and Gwen Ifill knew that this experience could shape what they do next.. So she said... \u201cI have to take what I do seriously every single day.\u201d And her statement reminds me of all black women reporters. I asked Kandiss has she had a similar experience?\n\nCrone: to that point, representation is important, right? It\u2019s important to see people that look like you, that come from a similar background or experience that are relatable because it gives you hope, it gives you drive and and sort of an example to look forward to and to have that inspiration and motivation. So that\u2019s very important. And that also with that comes a responsibility for myself. I don\u2019t take it lightly that there are other little brown girls, you know, just like me who want to be a reporter or who have dreams or who, you know, watching me. That gives them inspiration or encouragement. And so I certainly don\u2019t take that lightly and look at that as a duty to do my best, to be my best, to set an example, to give back, to mentor and to help guide the next generation of journalists, you know, that\u2019s our future.\n\nSpeaking of the future, remember when I said that this song holds a lot of meaning to Kandiss. She\u2019s getting married in roughly two weeks. So, the song \u201cCuff It\u201d is her current mood because she\u2019s falling in love. We love to see it! Huge congrats to Kandiss and her fianc\u00e9. That\u2019s a wrap for our first episode. Stay tuned in for more of New Genesis! For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nia Cross.\n```"}

The event is one of a three-part series titled \u201cBirds of No Nation,\u201d which seeks to highlight the use of art and creative expression to address the issues women are facing around the world.\n\nIn 2016, Hassani presented a collection of artwork under the same name to honor those who have had to flee their home of Afghanistan. The country is experiencing one of the largest humanitarian refugees crises after a 20-year-war and subsequent takeover by the Taliban in 2021.\n\n\u201cThis series is about those Afghans who migrate to other countries, Afghans who don\u2019t have a nationality anymore, who are from nowhere, and those Afghan who seek security and peace,\u201d Hassani said on her website.\n\nKeeping with her theme of showcasing strong and independent women figures, Hassani\u2019s \u201cBirds of No Nation\u201d series displays women looking out onto city landscapes and playing piano, representing the agony and loneliness that arises from having to leave the only place you\u2019ve ever known.\n\nSophie Lesinska, a USC literary studies librarian who helped organize the event, is hopeful that Hassani\u2019s demonstration will draw needed attention to the cause. \u201cThe world is forgetting,\u201d Lesinska said. \u201cI hope that this will express our solidarity with the women of Afghanistan \u2013 their struggle continues, and young women of Afghanistan are not giving up.\u201d\n\nPrior to the Taliban taking control, Hassani served as a fine arts lecturer at Kabul University, before seeking refuge abroad. While in Afghanistan, Hassani could be seen rushing through the streets of Kabul, creating vibrant murals on buildings that were either abandoned or bombed.\n\nNow, Hassani organizes graffiti festivals, art classes, and exhibitions, inspiring other Afghan women to use their creativity for good. In 2016, Hassani upheld a residency at Hammer Museum, painting a mural in the West Adams district of Los Angeles.\n\nIn a YouTube video by the Creator\u2019s Project, Hassani highlights art\u2019s role in social change. \u201cPeople get tired of words,\u201d Hassani said. \u201cArt is kind of a friendly way to fight with every problem.\u201d\n\nHassani\u2019s art demonstration will be held from noon to 1:30 p.m. at Alumni Park on Wednesday, March 8. She will be joined by Najiba Ayubi, Afghan journalist and activist, and Gazelle Samizay, an Afghan American artist, for a panel discussion later that evening at 7 p.m.\n\n\u201cI am tremendously excited about tomorrow\u2019s event,\u201d Lesinka said. \u201cThis is a fascinating panel, and I\u2019m curious how they will show us this face of Afghanistan, of the Afghan women that we might not be familiar with.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of USC Athletics/John McGillen)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino\nMarch 08, 2023 at 12:10 pm PST\n\nNo. 11 USC was fully back into the swing of things \u2014 or it seemed to be that way. After failing to retain their Icon Invitational championship, the Trojans looked to bounce back and capture another title. After a strong start, USC struggled in the final round and had to take second place in the Juli Inkster at Meadow Club Invitational in Fairfax, California.\n\nWith the added complication of top player sophomore Cindy Kou being away at the Asian Pacific Amateur Championship, the Trojans had a lot of pressure on them. \u201cI think we would have won the tournament with Cindy,\u201d said head coach Justin Silverstein. \u201cShe is great at the really little things, like bunker play, chipping, speed on the green, stroke maintenance and knowing your yardage, and this golf course required all of that.\u201d\n\nWith Kou gone, it was expected of sophomore Amari Avery and junior Brianna Navarrosa to step up. Avery, another top scorer, delivered and then some. She tied for third place and was the only Trojan to shoot under par. Navarrosa has been in a slump in past tournaments, but the stakes of this event gave her the push she needed to find her groove. In the second round, Navarrosa started collecting birdies and hitting the golf ball long and straight. Navarrosa finished tied for ninth place, playing very consistently.\n\nThe standout for USC, though, was freshman Catherine Park. She picked up the slack with Cindy being gone and delivered in a big way. The lone true freshman on the team tied for sixth and was the second lowest scorer for the Trojans. Junior Christine Wang wasn\u2019t as consistent as her teammates, but her second round was a career-best 66 and the lowest score of the day for all players. This secured second place for the Trojans, because No. 5 San Jose State was only three strokes behind.\n\n\u201c[Wang has] been working hard, really smart, her game has looked great the past few weeks,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cSo we have been waiting for a bust out performance like that.\u201d\n\nUSC was fully aware of the pressure, and for the first two rounds it didn\u2019t show any cracks. In the first round, the Trojans had second place behind eventual winner, No. 1 Stanford. However, USC was not far behind, with its overall score only being five strokes above Stanford\u2019s. A great second round allowed the Trojans to over take the lead from the Cardinal.\n\nUnfortunately for the Trojans, just as their play started looking promising, it soon went south for them. The third round was the worst round for them, scoring 298 overall, 11 strokes higher than their first round and 20 higher than their second round. This ended up being detrimental to USC and lost it the lead.\n\n\u201cWe putted awful this week, and I think it finally caught up to us,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cThe greens were really wet and really slow. Traditionally in the last five years since we changed our home course, we have really struggled with slow greens.\u201d\n\nThe other major difference-maker would be sophomore Rose Zhang of Stanford. Zhang was eleven under par, all her rounds were 70 or under and she birdied the last three holes to win individually. Zhang\u2019s great performance was the downfall for the Trojans.\n\n\u201cI think we played those last few holes just as poorly as Stanford. They just happened to have someone get hot,\u201d Silverstein said.\n\nSilverstein was disappointed in the outcome, but he sees a bright future for his team. \u201cWe had a firm grasp on that trophy and let it go late in the third round, which is disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was our third tournament in a row, and we put ourselves in position to win. That\u2019s really all I can ask for. If we keep doing that, good things are going to happen.\n\n\u201cIf we hit like this and putt like we did in Houston, we will win every time. We\u2019ve gotten so much better since January. If we can get the same amount better from now until May, we are going to have a chance to lift some really big trophies in the postseason.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have a little over two weeks, and few days off, until their next tournament at the PING/ASU Invitational in Tempe, Arizona. With the whole team now playing well and Kou being back, USC will look to capture gold for the first time this spring between March 24-26.\n```"}

But the second the singer stepped onto the stage in her bedazzled holographic knee-high boots, it was clear that the night would be anything but boring.\n\nDel Water Gap, the show\u2019s opening act, warmed up the audience for an evening of exhilarating entertainment with his contagious energy and enlivening setlist. During his entire 40-minute act, Del Water Gap did not stand still, jumping around the stage while strumming his yellow and neon pink electric guitar and still not missing a beat.\n\nBy the time he played \u201cPerfume,\u201d Del Water Gap had the crowd on their feet dancing along with him. Once the opening notes of his most popular hit \u201cOde to a Conversation Stuck In My Throat\u201d blasted over the Shrine speakers, members of the audience began shouting every lyric back to him.\n\nDel Water Gap, the solo project of Holden Jaffe, played a variety of instrument-heavy tracks to amp up the crowd. The indie rock artist\u2019s well-known tracks and new song from his upcoming album, paired with his ability to successfully demand and sustain the audience\u2019s attention, seem to serve as a promising combination in furthering the singer\u2019s musical career and name recognition.\n\nBy the end of his act, it would not be surprising if Del Water Gap\u2019s energetic performance and musical talent, reflecting a blend of Shawn Mendes and Joshua Bassett, garnered a host of new listeners. While Del Water Gap is a solo project, several band members, including a drummer and two guitarists, accompanied Jaffe on stage during Del Water Gap\u2019s energizing opening set.\n\nAfter a short break just long enough for audience members to catch their breath, images of Rogers accompanied by a monologue about resistance, anger, hope and change \u2014 themes Rogers intertwined throughout her entire performance \u2014 flickered to life on the auditorium\u2019s projector, marking a bold beginning to an even bolder show.\n\nBeginning with \u201cOverdrive\u201d from her most recent album \u201cSurrender,\u201d Rogers captured the audience\u2019s attention with stunning high notes and intense vocals, maintaining her impressive range throughout the entire set. The artist kickstarted the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm with \u201cWant Want,\u201d a drum-heavy rock track.\n\nFrom the moment she lifted her mic, Rogers poured her whole body and soul into her performance, strutting across all areas of the stage to captivate the entire audience. But the show didn\u2019t only consist of dancing, and it was far from one-dimensional. Rogers created emotional connections with everyone in the auditorium, from those in the upper balconies and pit to those she shared the stage with.\n\nDuring \u201cBe Cool,\u201d Rogers sang to each member of her band individually, bringing an element of humor to the set while spotlighting each member and her unique relationships with them. Rogers later played \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Friend,\u201d an acoustic track dedicated to her best friend.\n\nWhile the artist asked her fans to give her friend space and \u201clet us have our moment,\u201d Rogers allowed the crowd to witness this intimate moment between two lifelong friends, and her ability to communicate treasured memories through her raw yet soothing lyricism translated into a touching moment for the entire audience.\n\nThe singer had multiple friends by her side: For her performance of \u201cNew Song\u201d featuring Del Water Gap, she brought the opening act back on stage for a somber ballad that the two wrote together when they were 18. The pair\u2019s genuine connection, complementing vocals and flawless harmonies lent themselves to another moving celebration of friendship.\n\nHowever, the relationships that Rogers explored weren\u2019t purely platonic. Before playing her fresh and lighthearted single \u201cLove You For A Long Time,\u201d the singer gave a shout out to all of her fans, single and in love alike, hoping that someone would find love during her show. The song clearly impacted the crowd: couples held each other close and danced along, echoing the artist\u2019s lyrics to their partners.\n\nNot one to alienate the single fans in her audience, Rogers next sang \u201cShatter,\u201d a track expressing the painful and persistent feeling of longing. The crowd\u2019s response to the blaring hit visibly shook the entire balcony, causing the Shrine to feel as if it might shatter.\n\nBuilding on the audience\u2019s excitement, the singer\u2019s performance of her highest streamed hit \u201cLight On\u201d demonstrated a fresh and uplifting take on the praised alternative track.\n\nEven once Rogers exited the stage, the audience did not budge, eager for an encore. The artist\u2019s return for a final two-track performance of \u201cFallingwater\u201d and \u201cDifferent Kind of World,\u201d complemented by a speech highlighting the \u201cscary\u201d state of the world that Rogers hopes can be mended through acts of creation, seamlessly aligned with the show\u2019s opening monologue.\n\nThe performer\u2019s choice of touring partners, Planned Parenthood and HeadCount, whose representatives engaged with attendees at the door, demonstrated that Rogers herself is willing to initiate the first steps in a better direction. The artist\u2019s use of her clearly captivated crowd\u2019s attention to help reinforce the importance of positive change was present from the moment fans entered the venue, and was nothing short of admirable.\n\nRogers\u2019 clear vocal and lyrical flair, in combination with her energetic audience engagement and optimistic spirit, led to the creation of a concert atmosphere where all were embraced, lending Rogers\u2019 show a perfect fit to its \u201cFeral Joy Tour\u201d name. In the direct words of an audience member, Maggie Rogers \u201chas gotten better and better, and she\u2019s not done.\u201d\n```"}

But this time, it\u2019s not low rise jeans or matcha lattes or hot girl walks. In fact, this new movement might surprise you. And as Meredith McCabe reports, businesses are catching up to the trend.\n\nGONZALEZ: My favorite, always, is the Monday Mezcal. (fade) I am a big agave spirit person, and my dad loves mezcal, so I\u2019m biased because of its sentimental value. But also, it also just really captures the astringence and the flavor profile that I really like.\n\nThat\u2019s Brianda Gonzalez. She\u2019s pointing at a bottle of yellow-ish liquor with an eye-catching black and blue geometric label. We\u2019re standing in a small bottle shop on bustling Lincoln Boulevard in Venice, California. The store is full of brightly-labeled liquors, wines, and cocktail mixes. At just 28, Gonzalez is the founder and CEO of the New Bar.\n\nGONZALEZ: By the beginning of 2022, I decided to leave my job in tech to build the New Bar full time. I found this incredible, tiny, cute shop, and I thought, you know, I could, I could, pull this off, I think. And so, yeah, so we opened mid-July, and now here we are.\n\nBut the New Bar isn\u2019t your typical bar where you\u2019ll find spilled drinks, sticky floors and drunken college students stumbling around. HAYES: Garnished with a little orange peel for you. (sound of ice clinking and stirring) ...all the fun without the alcohol. You heard that right! No alcohol!\n\nNew Bar employee Eva Hayes serves mocktail samples just like this one seven days a week. The New Bar is one of several non-alcoholic bottle shops in the L.A. area. It\u2019s become part of the sober curious movement...a movement that has many young people exploring their relationships with alcohol...whether that means quitting cold turkey or just cutting back on the binge drinking.\n\nTwenty-four-year-old Bharat Rai knows this movement well. RAI: You know, back when I, when I drank a lot, like it may have been like three days of me, just like, you know, really slogging through the day and, you know, dragging my feet...\n\nRai recently graduated from USC with a master of science in translational biotechnology. RAI: And I really realized that if I want to stay productive and get all the things done that I need to get done effectively, then, you know, I really do need to watch what I drink because that hangover the next day is really not going to be worth it in the long run.\n\nRai is the co-founder of an app called Ethos: mindful drinking. He began his research for the app as a student when he started looking at alcohol consumption through the lens of biomedical sciences. RAI: Ethos\u2019 mission is to increase the awareness and the mindfulness of social drinkers, and the way that the way that we\u2019re doing that is we\u2019re providing an educational experience. When someone is downloading the app, you\u2019re going to set your limits, you\u2019re going to log your drinks.\n\nRai launched Ethos this past November after months of research. Like Gonzalez, he capitalized on a trend of young people wanting to explore their own alcohol consumption. RAI: I think really, since the last few years, there\u2019s been a bigger emphasis on public health issues and just more conscientiousness towards your own individual health at large.\n\nThere are many reasons why young people might cut back on their alcohol consumption...productivity, mental and physical health, and sleep are just a few. And studies back it up. A 2020 study from the University of Michigan shows that over the last two decades, the number of college students who abstained from drinking went up by 8%. And according to a 2022 U.K. study from Drinkaware on alcohol consumption trends, Gen Z is the most sober and sober-curious generation yet.\n\nGonzalez still does drink but infrequently and not heavily. GONZALEZ: I\u2019m very high strung. I am a chronic overthinker, and I found that hangovers really seem to exacerbate that for me.\n\nRai has also cut down on his alcohol consumption quite a bit. In fact, he pulled up the Ethos app and showed me his target amount of standard drinks for the week: 1.4. As a founder of a start-up, decreasing his alcohol consumption has paid off...literally. RAI: And I\u2019ll tell you, like drinks are not cheap here either. And it really put a dent in my bank account for a little bit there.\n\nNow to be fair, these non-alcoholic drinks, like a bottle of Sovi\u2019s reserve red wine or Bax Botanics\u2019 gin, could set you back as much as $40. In fact, Gonzalez knows she has to work extra hard to get people interested in these drinks when there\u2019s still such a strong culture of drinking to get drunk. GONZALEZ: When I was building the experience and the way the brand looks and feels and the entire concept, I was really focused on making the category feel exciting and sexy and interesting and accessible for the Gen Z and millennial demographic in particular.\n\nGonzalez adds it\u2019s not just about getting a buzz. She says it\u2019s important to understand the intensive process of how these drinks are made and to examine the inherent value in a drink other than its physical effects. GONZALEZ: I don\u2019t really drink to get drunk personally. What I have come to find is that I actually really, really value the flavors, the experience, the reminder to slow down and enjoy something with somebody or to participate in mixology or to pair something with a meal, right, that\u2019s the inherent value of a drink to me.\n\nNow, I\u2019m 21 years old and new to the world of fancy cocktails. But with all of this talk of complex non-alcoholic drinks, I couldn\u2019t not give it a try. NARRATOR: All right, I\u2019m going to try a sip. See how it is. It looks really pretty. All right. It\u2019s really good. I\u2019ve never had a real negroni before. But I love it. I love sweet and citrus. So this is perfect.\n\nAn added bonus?

They also alleged that the university never disclosed its plans to open the Village Dining Hall, which they believe took away from Rance\u2019s business and ultimately led to their inability to remain open.\n\nUSC has other dining halls, which are traditionally used to accommodate student needs. The new restaurant\u2019s menu includes six different kinds of pizza: cheese, pepperoni, spicy pepperoni, supreme, barbeque and alfredo. All of the pizza can either be bought by the slice or in full 12 or 16-inch pie sizes. The shop also offers various sandwiches, wings and salads. For of-age customers, they have several beers on tap and refrigerated canned seltzers.\n\nThere are various options for students with dietary restrictions or just looking for something a little healthier. For students looking for vegetarian options, all pizza is customizable. USC student Rushikesh Pande heard about Pizza Please\u2019s opening from the @shopuscvillage Instagram story and decided to check it out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other pizza place in the village. I have to Fryft for Domino\u2019s, so I thought I might as well try something new and see how it is,\u201d Pande said. On his first visit, Pande enjoyed a slice of his customized veggie pizza, a supreme without pepperoni. Compared to the other pizza shops around the area, Pande says Pizza Please is a little pricey.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll come back to get slices and not like a whole pizza unless I\u2019m getting it with friends because it is a little pricey in terms of Dominos or Blaze or things like that,\u201d Pande said. Slices like cheese and pepperoni are sold for as little as $3, but pies can go for up to $21.50 depending on the type of pizza.\n\nMarco Sanchez, the general manager of the shop, said he expects a large turnout of students in the coming weeks as they prepare for the grand opening since this week is more of a soft launch. Pizza Please will be open for limited hours every day from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a week, before beginning serving every day from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nLooking forward, Sanchez is excited about what the future holds for the establishment. He envisions the future of Pizza Please, he said he wants it \u201cto be the number one selling pizza place at USC.\u201d Pizza Please is not a chain but was opened by a larger company called Crews. Although Sanchez is unsure about the future franchising plans of the company, he did say that he expects Pizza Please to do well and open in other locations such as airports.\n\nCustomers can find the shop at 835 W. Jefferson Blvd. in between City Tacos and Sol\u00e9 Bicycles.\n```"}

But are people still tuning in? \n\nA view of the stage before the start of the 95th Academy Awards nomination ceremony on Tuesday, Jan. 24, at the Academy Museum in Los Angeles. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) \n\nBy Cami Twomey March 07, 2023 at  5:43 pm PST \n\nFinally, Hollywood\u2019s biggest night is this weekend: The Oscars. But is the award ceremony still relevant? Cami Twomey asked USC students to get their perspective. Hollywood\u2019s biggest night of the year is coming up fast. The 95th annual Academy Awards are this Sunday so, I spoke with USC students to see if they will be watching and who they will be rooting for. \n\nNina Koh is a sophomore communications major and unsure if she will be watching the show. \nKOH: I just personally, I mean, I would I guess I would watch it, but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to watch it. I would talk about it with friends and look at the results though. \n\nGeryn Dizon, a freshman studying lifespan health, shares Koh\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the Oscars. \nDIZON: I\u2019m just not really into movies like that where I care about who wins a specific award. I realized over the years that I don\u2019t watch that many movies. \n\nDespite being a film major, senior Natalie Grace hasn\u2019t had the time to catch up on all the Oscar Nominations this year. \nGRACE: It\u2019s actually kind of funny because you\u2019re so busy making films at film school that you don\u2019t have time to actually watch film or watch the Oscars for that matter. \n\nOn the other hand, some students are looking forward to rooting for their favorite films to take home the golden statuette. Sophomore history major Katalina Velez is excited to watch the awards. \nVELEZ: I really love \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin,\u201d I\u2019m not going to lie. I know it\u2019s not really seen as a frontrunner per se, but it\u2019s just like a personal fave of mine. But also, I know \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d is like a fan favorite, and I\u2019m rooting for them as well. I think they deserve it. ] I think actually after last year, maybe they\u2019ll be watching more because it was a major like cultural moment. \n\nVelez is of course referring to the infamous Will Smith Oscar slap. \n\nChristopher Smith, history and health and human sciences double major and senior says he will absolutely be watching the Oscars this year. \nSMITH: I\u2019m part of the \u201cTar\u201d Hive. Let\u2019s get all Lydia Tar content even though Lydia Tara as a character is quite complex, we love that. But also \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once.\u201d I\u2019m very happy that that seems like that\u2019s going to do well. There\u2019s definitely some good picks this year. \n\nAfter #OscarsSoWhite, sophomore journalism student Vishu Reddy is excited to see Asian representation in the nominations this year. \nREDDY: Definitely. \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once.\u201d I\u2019m super excited that a movie with a lot of Asian representation has gained a lot of nominations this year, and I\u2019m really hoping it takes home best picture. Also in the best original song category, a South Indian movie was nominated and I really hope that wins because I\u2019m South Indian and it\u2019s crazy seeing that it\u2019s been nominated for a Western awards ceremony. \n\nThe awards ceremony will be hosted by talk show host and comedian Jimmy Kimmel. Whether, you are a die hard movie buff or just watching in for the red carpet and Rihanna\u2019s performance it looks like the 2023 Oscars will be an event you don\u2019t want to miss. \n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Cami Twomey.\n```"}

Which means the summer is fast approaching. Here\u2019s Anthony Slade with a story on how USC students plan to spend their summer holiday. With spring break right around the corner, many students have already begun making plans for the summer. And while my dream summer vacation includes traveling to Europe, meeting an Italian boyfriend and partaking in a whirlwind star-crossed romance some Trojans have other plans. For example, here\u2019s sophomore computer science and business administration major Hallie Faust.\n\nFAUST: I\u2019m going to do a software development intern at Amazon. According to  Zippia , roughly 60% of college undergraduates and recent graduates complete an internship -- at USC, this number is closer to  80% . These career-related pressures have primed some students to panic at the very thought of summer plans. Valia Oliva, a senior sociology major, is one of these students.\n\nOLIVA: When you ask me, what are your plans for the summer, my first thought was, how can I prove that I know what I\u2019m doing? And I started thinking, like, do I have any internships? Am I doing any volunteer work? Am I working anywhere? And I was like, okay, I can say this and oh, this makes me seem like I\u2019m very put together. And, unfortunately for people like me, internships are actually largely beneficial for students entering the job force post-grad. The same study from Zippia found that students who completed an internship are 15% less likely to be unemployed in the first years after college. Moreover, entry-level professionals with internship experience earn roughly 6% more than their peers who do not have internship experience. My European voyage is suddenly looking like less of a priority...\n\nInterestingly enough, one student has actually found a way to live my dream, while still maintaining her girl-boss status. Molly Ahyun, a sophomore law, history and culture major, will be crossing the Atlantic as soon as this semester lets out.\n\nAHYUN: I\u2019m going to Paris. It\u2019s the public memory and ghosts of history class, so it\u2019s like a credit for me. So I\u2019ll be there for the first three or four weeks. And then my family is actually going to be in Europe after that. But, students staying local shouldn\u2019t fret. Summer break is the perfect time to wind down and decompress after two semesters of grueling schoolwork. Paris-bound Ahyun made sure to take pity on me and proffer some valuable advice for those less fortunate:\n\nAHYUN: If you don\u2019t really know what you want to do, you don\u2019t really even have to do anything. We\u2019re really young, honestly. And so even just taking the summer to go visit family is so real. You can\u2019t do that for the rest of your life. And internships will always wait for you. With less than two months until summer recess, time seems to be running out for students without an internship already lined up. Don\u2019t worry though -- we\u2019ll have the rest of our lives to worry about clocking in hours and putting in the work. For now, let\u2019s just enjoy spring break!

{"key": "/2023/03/07/whats-the-deal-with-ozempic/", "response": "```\nWhat\u2019s the deal with Ozempic?\n\nOzempic, the promising weight-loss drug, is in short supply.\n\nBy Janey Zhang March 07, 2023 at 4:10 pm PST\n\nIf you\u2019re following celebrity news or engaging in mainstream media, then you\u2019re likely to have heard the term \u201cOzempic\u201d - the new hot weight-loss drug. It\u2019s now experiencing a supply shortage. How is the shortage affecting patients with diabetes, and should we even be taking Ozempic in the first place? Janey Zhang has the story.\n\nThere is a new drug that is going viral: Ozempic. It\u2019s an injectable prescription medicine for adults with type two diabetes. It was approved by the FDA for treatment in 2017 and then in 2021 under another brand name, Wegovy, which targets obesity. Both drugs contain semaglutide, a key element that constructively regulates blood sugar while also reducing appetite. The weight loss effect feeds into the ongoing skinnyfying fad.\n\nCelebrities are making this a widespread term by being explicit about their use of the drug. When asked about his secret to always looking fit and healthy on Twitter, Elon Musk simply replied: fasting and Wegovy. Andy Cohen also commented on how Ozempic has permeated our everyday lives. He wrote \u201cEveryone is suddenly showing up 25 pounds lighter. What happens when they stop taking #Ozempic ?????\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it has already become a trend on TikTok, with 508.9 million views under the hashtag #ozempic. The sudden rise in popularity is not without its costs. The growing demand among the non-diabetic population has ultimately led to a worldwide shortage of semaglutide. Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy, announced that they were unable to supply enough to meet up the growing need.\n\nAccording to Dr. Alyssa Dominguez, a specialist in endocrinology diabetes and metabolism at USC Keck School of Medicine, this is unfavorable for patients who actually rely on the drug to stabilize their blood sugar levels.\n\nDOMINGUEZ: It is frustrating when people are doing well on a specific medication and it\u2019s controlling their blood sugars really well. When they\u2019re not able to get that medication, the blood sugars will go back up again. Sometimes we have to restart them on therapies that we had had them on before, such as insulin for patients who are using it for weight loss. A lot of the issues that they have reported is returning the appetite that had been suppressed by the medication and then weight regain for some people as well.\n\nFor diabetes patients, Ozempic is a necessity in their everyday lives. In order to cope with the shortage, doctor Dominguez mentions switching people to a different medication, such as Trulicity or Jaro. The idea that people can lose weight by simply injecting our dose once a week is so appealing that they are not taking into consideration the possible side effects.\n\nDOMINGUEZ: The sort of short term risks are things that I tend to counsel patients on or the effects of stomach upset nausea, diarrhea and constipation. In addition, the consequences of taking Ozempic and Wegovy in the long term remain to be unclear. A study conducted by the National Institutes of Health on animals indicates that Ozempic has caused thyroid cancer in animals. It is uncertain if this drug also results in increased thyroid cancer risk in humans.\n\nThere is a lot more that needs to be uncovered about Ozempic, according to Doctor Dominguez.\n\nDOMINGUEZ: Really it just hasn\u2019t been studied. I would say like we don\u2019t really know what the particular risks are and using it in that population. So a lot of you know, a lot of the risks are unknown.\n\nStill, the Ozempic shortage has not yet been resolved. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Janey Zhang.\n```"}

For Tara Mojtahedzadeh, a sophomore global health major and president of the USC Persian Student Organization, Women\u2019s History Month is an avenue to spread awareness of the plight of women in Iran.\n\nParticularly due to the heightened coverage of Iranian women\u2019s rights following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, Mojtahedzadeh said that having a month dedicated to women is an opportunity to contribute to the cause. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize that this is a much bigger issue than it may seem,\u201d Mojtahedzadeh said. \u201cIt is not very easy to overthrow an entire regime, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mojtahedzadeh acknowledges the delicate tension that exists between celebration and tangible activism: \u201cWe need to find a balance between mourning and trying to contribute to the cause, but our people don\u2019t want you to sit around and just feel guilt and pity,\u201d she said. Doing so would be a disservice to the Iranian people, she continued, saying that students should celebrate Women\u2019s History Month not just for themselves, but for the women in Iran who can\u2019t.\n\nMojtahedzadeh acknowledges that there needs to be more realistic expectations in the minds of Iranian people and the rest of the public in general. \u201cYou can\u2019t necessarily expect to change a tyrannical regime overnight. Do what you can, spread awareness, be active,\u201d she said. \u201cThe women in Iran, they\u2019re fighting for something they deserve.\u201d\n\nOn September 16, 2022, Amini, an Iranian woman from the Kurdistan province of Iran, died after sustaining wounds from being detained and beaten by the Iranian Guidance Patrol \u2014 Iran\u2019s \u201cmorality police,\u201d a group that enforces the Islamic dress code \u2014 for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Amini\u2019s death sparked a global outcry among the Iranian community, with Iranian women cutting their hair short, publicly removing their hijabs and burning them in protest.\n\nSince her death in September, about 450 activists have died worldwide at the demonstrations, including 29 women at the hands of the police. Demonstrations have occurred both overseas and here at USC, with students and faculty marching through the USC Village last October.\n\nChristopher Manning, USC\u2019s Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer, released a statement of support for students impacted by Amini\u2019s death, while President Folt tweeted a similar sentiment in September.\n\nMembers of the Iranian community at USC continue to emphasize the importance of broadening the conversation from beyond the women in Iran. Dr. Anna Atefeh Farzindar \u2013 a part-time lecturer of computer science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, is the faculty advisor to the Persian Academic and Cultural Student Association.\n\nFor her, the month of March constitutes attending celebrations of women empowerment, like mentoring young women in STEM. But every time she visits her family in Iran, including her sisters, she can\u2019t help but notice the vast disparities in the treatment of women in her home country.\n\n\u201cThe quality of life of a woman is very important for me. As a first generation and immigrant generation, I work hard to build a life here,\u201d Dr. Farzindar said. Despite being highly educated \u2013 having earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in applied mathematics from the Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, and a doctoral degree in computer science at the University of Montreal, Canada \u2013 she still struggles to advocate for her place in Iranian society.\n\n\u201cI want to bring my knowledge to my own country, but unfortunately each time I travel, there is no place for a woman. There\u2019s no voice.\u201d\n\nHowever, she acknowledges that by having public conversations, especially about the treatment of women in Iran \u2013 where women and girls are required to cover their hair and bodies and prohibited from traveling without parental or spouse approval \u2013 pushes the feminist movement forward.\n\n\u201cI hope the voice of the Iranian women can be reflected outside of the country, because from the inside of the country they can\u2019t do anything,\u201d she added. \u201cFor many years they have tried to communicate with the government to have a relationship to build something. But unfortunately, there\u2019s no one to listen to that.\u201d\n\nMojtahedzadeh echoes this statement, saying that the best thing that people far from \u201cwhere the turmoil is actively happening,\u201d is to continue to spread awareness, but censorship in Iran often puts a muzzle on the cause.\n\nThis is where U.S. allies must use their privileged access to freedom of speech, Mojtahedzadeh said, rising in a crescendo of support for Iranian women. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough to be in the United States. Somebody made a sacrifice for us to be here \u2013 take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nParticularly as Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, approaches, Iranian women look to the spring equinox as an opportunity for growth, planting and nurturing a renewed sense of hope for their community like flowers in the spring.\n\n\u201cWe are in a connected universe. We have just one earth, and if the people are ignored, it\u2019s not beneficial for the rest of the world,\u201d said Dr. Farzindar.\n\nThis sense of unity and sisterhood among women is intersectional, connecting women in America and women in Iran and other aspects of the world like a thread. Mojtahedzadeh agrees, adding, \u201cOne thing about Iranian people is that they know how to unite [themselves] and even non-Iranian people. It\u2019s been a very prideful experience to see all these people from different walks of life and different experiences come together to go against this common theme and fight this battle in any way they can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think as long as we stay consistent and fight apathy, there\u2019s a fair chance of creating some real tangible change,\u201d she added.\n```"}

(Photo by Flickr user Prayitno Hadinata)\n\nBy Joseph Hyslop, Nicole Bednar, and Maddy Brown March 06, 2023 at 6:20 pm PST\n\nNo doubt you\u2019ve seen the orange buses traveling up and down Figueroa and Hoover, and the trains rumbling along Exposition. While it\u2019s often said to be impossible to navigate Los Angeles without a car, the city has a more-than-capable public transportation system that can take you to a countless number of mouth-watering restaurants. So, if you find yourself at USC this spring Break, yearning to break free from the culinary confines of Cava or El Huero, you\u2019re in luck. We\u2019ve compiled a list of some of the best restaurants in LA that are easily accessible through the Metro system.\n\nWhile USC students are no strangers to Lyft, many L.A. transplants have never stood waiting underneath the green awning of a bus stop. But, for those students without an AMEX in their Goyard wallet, the Metro system provides a reliable and inexpensive means to get around the city. Emma Garcia, a freshman majoring in law, history and culture, finds the Metro to be a \u201cvery cost-efficient\u201d way of traveling around L.A. \u201cI\u2019ve only used the Metro once actually, but I\u2019m hoping to utilize it more in the future,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nStudents that grew up in L.A. have long been aware of the Metro\u2019s convenience. Shant Kassabian, a homegrown Angeleno and sophomore majoring in business administration, said that even though he mainly uses his car now, he used to take the Metro everywhere. For other Angelenos, like Kaylee Young, a freshman majoring in psychology, the Metro has always been a useful way of exploring the city. \u201cI\u2019ve been in L.A. my whole life, so the Metro system has been a staple for me getting around anywhere,\u201d Young said.\n\nUSC students who haven\u2019t used the Metro before can buy a physical TAP card, which costs $2, plus fare, and includes transfers to Metro rail and bus. Students with iPhones can also add a Metro Card directly to their Apple Wallet. For the students who\u2019ve escaped from the clutches of the pome-titled monopoly, a TAP app is available to download for Android users as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re not headed to Cabo for spring break, don\u2019t despair. Go out and explore all the incredible food options L.A. has to offer. We\u2019ve gathered a list of eateries for you to try this spring break along with directions on how to get there.\n\nGrand Central Market \u2192 A fixture in L.A. for over a century, Grand Central Market is a must-visit for tourists and Angelenos alike. The Market\u2019s 40 stalls feature menus from a variety of cultures, designed for a variety of tastes. Visit La Tostaderia for some seafood-forward Mexican cuisine, grab a boba tea and banh mi sandwich at Moon Rabbit, or try an authentic taste of Berlin at Berlin Currywurst. TO GET THERE: Get on the Metro E Expo Train Line and get off at the 7th St/Metro Center stop. Then, get on the B/Red Line or D/Purple Line to Pershing Square, and exit towards 4th/Hill.\n\nManson\u2019s Dumpling Shop \u2192 Tired of the frozen Trader Joe\u2019s dumplings you keep throwing in the microwave? Ditch the cardboard and get onboard the Metro to a cult-favorite spot for a hearty bowl of handmade dumplings. Made fresh to order, you can adjust your preferred spice levels to your desired preference. Vegan dumplings are also available for those following a greener diet. TO GET THERE: Walk to the bus stop on Figueroa and Exposition, and ride Bus 81 on Figueroa until you reach Ave 57, Manson\u2019s Dumpling Shop will be on your left!\n\nSmorgasburg, DTLA \u2192 Wanting to spend some time outdoors? Then head to one of the largest open-air food markets in L.A. There\u2019s something for everybody here, whether it be desserts, vegan options, pizza, Mexican \u2014 the options are endless. Open every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at The Row in Downto L.A., Smorgasburg offers free entry and an opportunity soak up some sunshine while you take on some satiating grub. TO GET THERE: Head to the Figueroa and Exposition bus stop, and hop on Bus 81 until you reach the stop at Hill and 7th. Get off, walk a block up to the stop on Hill and 6th, and get on Bus 60. Ride until you reach 7th and Central, get off, and head into the ROW LA Building to get a spoonful.\n\nTracey\u2019s \u2192 They don\u2019t sell oxtail in the USC Village. For a taste of some authentic Belizean cuisine, look no further than Tracey\u2019s, a favorite spot for South L.A. locals. TO GET THERE: Behind the Marshall school, hop on the Metro E Line on Expo and ride west until you reach the Expo and Western station. Hop off the bus, head down S. Western Avenue, and Tracey\u2019s will be down on your left.\n\nTibet Nepal House \u2192 Serving some delicious food, this restaurant\u2019s all the way in Pasadena. Put on your favorite podcast or bring a book, and strap in for an hour-long bus ride. Serving Himalayan cuisine, the cozily-decorated place is adorned with art and statues showing the beauty of Nepalese culture. But don\u2019t just feast with your eyes. Indulge in some phing noodles, treat yourself to some naan and tuck into some Yak Meat (a lean protein healthier than beef). TO GET THERE: Hop on Bus 81 at the Figueroa and Exposition stop, and ride that baby 30 stops until you reach Figueroa and Woodside. Walk up Woodside to the Metro L Line and ride the train 14 stops until you reach Memorial Park. Hop off the train, and take a right up Holly Street where you\u2019ll reach the restaurant on your left.\n\nDos Besos \u2192 Another tasty spot in Pasadena, prepare for another hour plus trip. They say it\u2019s about the journey, not the destination, but the paella served here will have you thinking it\u2019s both. TO GET THERE: Hop on Bus 81 on any stop on Figueroa Street, and ride the bus until you reach Figueroa and Woodside. Walk up Woodside to the Metro L Line and ride the train 14 stops until you reach Memorial Park. Head down Ledge Alley and treat yourself to some delicious Spanish cuisine on your left.\n\nLe Grande Orange and The Luggage Room \u2192 So, you and your friend can\u2019t decide between pizza and salmon? Why not head to Le Grande Orange and The Luggage Room, two restaurants attached at the hip in Old Town Pasadena? Housed in the historic Del Mar Train Station, people go crazy for the menu items served here. Whether you want to sit in or outside, there\u2019s something for everybody here. TO GET THERE: Like the other Pasadena-located locales, you\u2019ll hop on Bus 81 at any stop on Figueroa Street, and ride the bus until you reach Figueroa and Woodside. Walk up Woodside to the Metro L Line and ride the train 4 stops until you reach the Del Mar stop. Head down Raymond Avenue and treat yourself to a slice of warm pizza.\n\nLangers \u2192 If you\u2019re craving hot pastrami sandwiches, there\u2019s only one place to go \u2014 Langer\u2019s Delicatessen Restaurant. If you\u2019re unsure whether their sandwiches are any good, just know that the old-fashioned deli has been serving customers since 1947. If you don\u2019t know what to get from their expansive menu, try the No. 19, a combination of hot pastrami, cole slaw, a slice of Swiss cheese and Russian dressing on rye that is so delicious that the Los Angeles Times called it \u201cthe Marilyn Monroe of sandwiches.\u201d TO GET THERE: For a less than a half-hour bus ride, head to the Jefferson and Hoover bus stop situated across from campus and Rock and Reilly\u2019s. Head on Bus 2, and ride until you reach Alvarado and 7th. Hop off, and the deli will be directly in front of you.\n\nMillet Crepe \u2192 If you need to satiate your sweet tooth, some of the best crepes in L.A. can be found at Millet Crepe. You likely won\u2019t be able to sit down at this tiny location in Little Tokyo, but you can watch workers make creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, custard and ice cream crepes in easy transportable cones right in front of you. The crepes aren\u2019t small by any means, so come ready to eat! TO GET THERE: You can\u2019t take the train straight there anymore, but you can hop on a bus. At the stop on Fig and Jefferson, get on Bus 38 and ride until you reach Broadway and Venice. Get off, hop on Bus 40, and get off at the Los Angeles and 1st Stop. From there, you\u2019ll take an approximately five-minute walk. Head down the lengthily-named Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Street. At the stoplight, cross and head left on 2nd Street for some thin, delicious confections.\n\nBirria Los Socios \u2192 For the birria lovers out there, fear not. Birria Los Socios is open for business five days a week, and they\u2019ll put birria on almost anything. Birria pizza, birria ramen, and keto tacos are just a few of the options presented to customers of this beef and goat birria restaurant in Boyle Heights. TO GET THERE: It\u2019s going to take an hour to get there, but it\u2019s going to be worth it. Head to the Jefferson and Figueroa Street Bus Station, and hop on Bus 423. Ride north until you hit the Fig and 6th Street stop, and head up 6th Street to the 6th and Flower Stop. There, get on Bus 40 and when you reach the 3rd and Indiana stop, hop off. Birria Los Socios is right there.\n\nHotville Chicken \u2192 Listen \u2014 you\u2019ve got to indulge every once in a while. Treat yourself to some mind-blowingly tasty Nashville-style hot chicken and other Southern-based side dishes at this casual eatery. The food is fresh, and you can customize the level of spice to your ideal level of comfort (or pain). Forget the local Chick-fil-A, and treat yourself to some mind-blowing cuisine. TO GET THERE: At the Jefferson / USC Expo Line, hop on the E Line headed West. Get off at the Expo and Crenshaw stop, and make your way to the bus stop at Crenshaw and Exposition. Get on Bus 210, and head South until you reach the stop at Crenshaw and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Make your way to the Baldwin Hills Mall and prepare your taste buds for a healthy and hearty dose of spice and heat.\n```"}

Sara Kahn has the story. Jamilla Johnson belts it out at the end-of-year showcase last night. She and her fellow graduating seniors at Thornton\u2019s Popular Music program held their final performance as students. They showcased their hard work and growth of the past four years.\n\nThis concert gives students the opportunity to take charge of their artistry. Senior Jamilla Johnson opened the show and performed two of her own songs that she worked on with another student in the program. Jamilla Johnson: Two that I\u2019m releasing very soon. The first was Spotlight written, and both were written and co-produced by my best friend, and he\u2019s my bassist as well, Austin Brown.\n\nCollaboration is key to these showcases. Students work together as artists to create a show that highlights their unique skills. Austin Brown also performed. He\u2019s also a senior in the Popular Music program. He was glad to see the collaborative work he did come to fruition. Austin Brown: Last year, we wrote some of those songs and we kind of just wrote it for fun, not for class or for anything, but just because we were friends and we wanted to work together. And then over time, those songs transformed into something that we could perform. And I\u2019m really happy that Jamillah chose to pick those songs to do at the Senior Showcase.\n\nCollaboration is one of many moving pieces that went into the Senior Showcase. USC Thornton Professor Chris Sampson founded the program. He says this senior wrap-up performance gives the students a taste of the music industry in a professional environment. Chris Sampson: Well, my hope is that the showcase can serve as a little bit of a as a as a little bit of introduction to the stages that they\u2019re going to experience later. So one of the things that we want to make sure of is, is that they get used to the professional environments that they\u2019re going to be in. Sampson lists just some of the venues his students have gone on to play. Chris Sampson: Some of the world\u2019s significant stages Madison Square Garden, Staples Center, Hollywood Bowl, just to name a few. And you want to be prepared for that.\n\nThe showcase gives students a taste of their future, and while doing that... it\u2019s also an emotionally-charged culmination of their time as students in the Pop Music program. Austin Brown: It was a special moment for our class as a whole. Austin Brown looks forward as he looks back. Austin Brown: It\u2019s the last time we performed together. We\u2019re all performance majors. We used to perform every quarter, every year together. And now this is the last time that we all perform as one unit.\n\nMaria McMillan is a senior in the program with an emphasis on keyboards and she sings. She\u2019s filled with pride at the show that was put on. Maria McMillan: I feel very like satisfied and really proud of the work that me and my classmates and the the show that we put on last night.\n\nEmotions are always high at this end-of-year showcase. Ellie Williams also sang last night. For her, this performance represents a full-circle moment. Ellie Williams: I remember as a senior in high school, I came to one of the senior showcases before I even knew I got in. I just kind of wanted to go to see it. And I remember just being blown away by the performers and all of the music that was played. So being able to, kind of go through that process now, I think it just kind of signifies a greater like you did it, you made it through. You kind of like did the whole thing.\n\nIn music, there\u2019s often a pause before things really take off. That should be the case for these graduating Thornton seniors. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sara Kahn.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/03/06/la-metro-announces-ambassador-program/", "response": "```\nL.A. Metro announces ambassador program\n\nAround 300 ambassadors will help riders throughout the rail systems\n\nThe 37th Street/USC Metro Station, located just a block away from USC's campus. (Courtesy of METRO96)\n\nBy Dana Hammerstrom, Nina Moothedath and Jack Smith\nMarch 06, 2023 at 5:57 pm PST\n\nThis morning at Downtown Los Angeles\u2019 Union Station, the new Metro Ambassador program was unveiled. With the introduction of the program, which will employ around 300 Metro Ambassadors into rail systems around the city, comes more skepticism from local residents. Here\u2019s Nina Moothedath with the story.\n\nAt a podium in Downtown Los Angeles\u2019 Union Station, surrounded by local residents and leaders, a new safety measure for the L.A. Metro was brought to light. LA Metro is employing what they refer to as \u201cMetro Ambassadors\u201d -- unarmed individuals who\u2019s role is to connect riders to resources and report safety concerns for the public. The new three-hundred ambassadors will seek to improve the overall quality and safety of user\u2019s experiences on LA\u2019s public transportation.\n\nAra Najarian: We\u2019re hoping that metro ridership increases, that we have very few incidents of crime, overdose, homelessness, and that we can bring the system to an even higher level than we have it currently.\n\nThat was Ara Najarian, Chairman of the L.A. Metro Board of Directors and a city councilman from the City of Glendale. Najarian has broad hopes for the future of the ambassador program, but when it got to specifics about safety the Chairman looked more into the future than present actions.\n\nThe evolution of this program, from its ideation to its current employment, has finally morphed into a three-to-five year pilot program of non-armed local liasons.\n\nAra Najarian: Some of us, including myself, thought the answer was to increase by large numbers the numbers of law enforcement officers. The alternative that was raised by several directors was, you know what, we don\u2019t need a full on armed officer for many of these instances. We can go with something less, something more friendly, and thereby the concept of the transit ambassadors came.\n\nThe role of Metro Ambassadors was initially more logistics-based, with less regard to safety. However, as crime and drug overdoses in the metro system increased, with this year\u2019s number of deaths already tied with that of 2022, some last-minute changes had to be made.\n\nAra Najarian: We\u2019re hoping that they\u2019re going to be able to make the call. We can get help to that person. We\u2019re hoping that they\u2019ll be able to administer and get trained in the use of Narcan to help revive individuals in an emergency situation. So we hope that that\u2019s going to help solve the drug use and abuse issue that we have in Metro.\n\nSo far, ambassadors haven\u2019t been trained extensively in safety, with their main course of action being calling external forces for help if they see something occurring. Despite these mentions of an increased concern for safety, the Metro\u2019s solutions are unclear for some riders.\n\nOne of those riders is Steven Klotzsche, a resident of Los Angeles and a frequent user of the Metro.\n\nSteven Klotzsche: They need to put more security. Doesn\u2019t have to be armed police officers, but somebody that kind of keeps an eye on things.\n\nKlotzsche has also noticed differences in safety depending on the line you ride around the city.\n\nSteven Klotzsche: They need to improve that a little bit, especially when you go down, like to the blue line in Long Beach. Here it\u2019s not so bad, but in the later hours, you got to be careful.\n\nThe program has been running since September of 2022, and despite Najarian\u2019s hopes for success, only time will tell whether this program will ensure LA riders safer trips.\n```"}

With only one week until Selection Sunday, chaos erupted over the college basketball landscape, with No. 9 Texas flattening No. 3 Kansas, Oklahoma taking down No. 22 TCU and a phenomenal ending in the greatest rivalry in college basketball: Duke and North Carolina. Here are my top headlines from this past week.\n\nAlthough unranked, Duke vs. Carolina does not fail to entertain Duke brought their brooms with them to Chapel Hill as they swept the Tar Heels to finish out the regular season and earn a double-bye in the upcoming ACC tournament. It was only the fourth time since 1960 that these two titans of college basketball met unranked, and both the Tar Heels and Blue Devils proved why they should be outside of the AP Top 25. Like I said, it was a great game which came down to the final possession, where Duke outlasted UNC 62-57, but the two Blue Bloods did not fill up the stat sheet. Duke shot a measly 37% from the field, while North Carolina shot an abysmal 30% from the field. Nonetheless, the matchup is always entertaining and this iteration was no different. Duke freshman center Kyle Filipowski was the star of the game, and proved he\u2019s one of the best freshmen in the country, dropping 22 points and 13 rebounds. He now leads all freshmen in the country in double-doubles this season. North Carolina played 13 players this game, as head coach Hubert Davis was still looking for a spark for the Tar Heels. As per usual, the only ones who brought energy for North Carolina were senior forward Armando Bacot, and the junior backcourt tandem of RJ Davis and Caleb Love. The trio combined for 45 of the Heels\u2019 57 points. The game came down to the final play where Caleb Love missed a game-tying three, then Duke grabbed the rebound and rifled the ball up to a wide-open Filipowski to seal the sweep for the Blue Devils. While it is always fun when these two battle it out, boy was it agonizing to watch, as both teams could not hit the broad side of a barn. This game would have been incredibly important for the Tar Heels, who are still searching for an NCAA tournament bid. However, since they lost, they will most likely need to win the ACC tournament to make March Madness. The Blue Devils, however, just proved how they are still top dog in that rivalry and will compete in the NCAA tournament.\n\nMy pick of who will win the red hot Big 12 Now I know I said a few weeks ago I would not proclaim any team to be \u201cmy team;\u201d however, it is just too tantalizing not to since it is the Power Six conference tournament week. The Big 12 is probably the best conference we have seen in the last 10 years, and truly anyone could win it. Last week, I said I could see nine teams winning it, and I still firmly believe that. However, I think that the regular season champ will take home the cake. Though Kansas just suffered a loss to No. 9 Texas, the Jayhawks still are the best team in the conference. Kansas is led by redshirt junior forward Jalen Wilson who is most likely to win Big 12 Player of the Year, averaging 19.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. Kansas has 15 Quad 1 wins this year, the most out of any team in the country. The team has been by far the best in the Big 12 this year, beating every single opponent handily at least once. The Jayhawks will have a tough road ahead, as even though they have a first round bye, they play the winner of Texas Tech and West Virginia, two teams who they very recently barely escaped from. Either way, I\u2019m looking forward to a great game for whoever Kansas plays. Head coach Bill Self is still the most battle-tested coach in the Big 12 and arguably all of college basketball. When the going gets tough, Kansas is a team you can rely on to get it done under pressure. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the championship game will be held in Kansas City. So if the Jayhawks can get there, they should have a pretty decent home court advantage. However, I would take all of this with a grain of salt, as teams who I pick to win usually lose shortly after I proclaim them to be the best. \u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo by Nia Harris)\n\nBy Cl\u00e9mence-Maureen Feniou March 06, 2023 at 1:15 pm PST\n\nWSU finished their incredible run at the Pac-12 tournament with a victory crown. \u201cI would have never thought we could do it. I don\u2019t even think when I took the job, I thought this was possible,\u201d Washington State head coach Kamie Ethridge said. \u201cIf you get the right people in place that believe and work and are committed to each other, you can accomplish amazing things together.\u201d\n\nNo. 7 seed Washington State pulled off its third upset in a row by defeating Utah, Colorado and then winning 65-61 against No. 5 seed UCLA Sunday at Michelob ULTRA Arena. It marked WSU\u2019s first-ever women\u2019s basketball Pac-12 title and the school\u2019s first in a women\u2019s sport.\n\nUCLA redshirt sophomore center Emily Bessoir scored the game\u2019s first two points on a jumper. WSU sophomore guard Tara Wallack responded by burying a three. And the game was on.\n\nAs against Colorado, WSU\u2019s defense was stellar when its offense consecutively buried back-to-back threes in both the first and second quarters. But the Cougars struggled to take the lead, suffering from seven turnovers in the first half. UCLA\u2019s poor shooting, only 33% from the field, kept the Bruins low on scoring.\n\nJunior guard Charlisse Leger-Walker buried a three with 35 seconds on the clock, giving WSU a four-point lead just before halftime, 32-28.\n\nReturning from the locker room, UCLA was determined not to let its win slip away, taking the lead back 36-32. The Cougars went scoreless for more than four minutes until Leger-Walker relieved the team with a driving layup.\n\nWashington State took its lead back thanks to Leger-Walker and senior center Bella Murekatete wrapping the third quarter 44-42.\n\nBoth teams traded leads 13 times, and with a two-point lead, any team still had a winning chance. Freshman guard Astera Tuhina, coming off the bench, displayed incredible defense and locked down UCLA freshman guard Kiki Rice.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Murekatete made a layup. The Cougars had the lead and never let it go. Later, Leger-Walker extended the lead to eight. It was then a game of free throws. The crowd fell silent during the plays and was incredibly loud on the opponent\u2019s free throws. This was a game for a Pac-12 title, and everyone could feel it.\n\n\u201cEvery timeout or every time we came back on to the court, there was something being side, like, we\u2019ve got this, we just need to focus on this play right here,\u201d Leger-Walker said. \u201cAll the little things that we say to each other to keep us in the moment, I think, really helps.\u201d\n\nWith 38.4 seconds on the clock, Murekatete made two free throws, taking WSU\u2019s lead up to 63-59. With 23.3 seconds to go, Kiki Rice scored two, pushing UCLA closer to retaking the lead at 63-61.\n\nWith 21.7 on the clock, Leger-Walker made one of her two free throws, WSU still leading 64-61. It was a mental game for each shooter. Teams traded timeouts, transforming 30 seconds into an almost ten-minute session.\n\nThe score was 64-61 with 14 seconds to go. UCLA had to go for a 3-pointer to send both teams to overtime. Senior guard Charisma Osborne tried the shot but was blocked by Tuhina. Leger-Walker forced a held ball, giving possession back to the Cougars with five seconds on the clock.\n\nA last foul on Wallack gave her the opportunity to make the game-sealing free throw. She only made one of the two, but it was enough to crown WSU with its first-ever Pac-12 title.\n\n\u201cI just had to really trust the work ... and we did it,\u201d Murekatete said.\n\nLeger-Walker finished with 23 points, and Murekatete had 21. Tuhina had only six points but was highly active defensively and delivered six assists. Wallack finished with eight rebounds, including important ones on the defensive side.\n\nFor the Bruins, Osborne had 19 points, Rice with 13 and Bessoir had 11.\n\nBoth teams were honored in the All-Tournament team with Charlisse Leger-Walker (WSU), Emily Bessoir (UCLA), Cameron Brink (Stanford), Bella Murekatete (WSU), Charisma Osborne (UCLA) and Kiki Rice (UCLA) being placed on the list.\n\nLeger-Walker was granted the most outstanding player of the tournament and set the tournament points record with 76.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just an amazing student-athlete,\u201d Ethridge said. \u201cShe\u2019s a leader on and off the court.\u201d\n\nWith the Pac-12 win, Washington State picked up its ticket for the NCAA tournament, where the Cougars have even higher hopes. After all, they proved that anything was possible.\n\nUntil then, it\u2019s time for the Cougars to celebrate.\n\n\u201cNever would have thought we would be doing that [cutting the net]. We\u2019ve watched teams do that in the past or especially the last three years,\u201d Leger-Walker said. \u201cThat moment just felt so surreal to get up there, cut down the net, actually soak in that we\u2019re champs.\u201d\n```"}

The Pelicans won 139-111. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nBy Jonathan Martin March 06, 2023 at 12:46 am PST\n\nNBA superstar Ja Morant\u2019s life was easy, and now he is on the cusp of throwing it all away. All because he is chasing an image that is not him, or maybe, this is who he is. Imagine winning the lottery at birth. Imagine growing up in a two parent household. Imagine a life where you\u2019re afforded the best education possible and having the ability to pursue whatever dreams you want with no hindrances to succeed. Perception is reality. Whether he realizes it or not \u2014 Ja Morant is a role model. It\u2019s 2023, Athletes, whether they like it or not, must set a better standard for the fans that follow them. With social media outlets like Twitter, Instagram, and Tik Tok, impressionable youths have the most access to their favorite player ever.\n\nJa was suspended for two games after he posted a video of himself brandishing a gun in a nightclub while singing lyrics to an NBA Youngboy song. The NBA is now investigating him, and there\u2019s no telling when he will return. Ja\u2019s foolishly timed Instagram video comes amidst allegations against him last summer of punching a 17-year old teen after a pickup basketball game and flashed a gun at the accuser. Since then, Morant has apologized, taking full responsibility for his actions and said he is going to \u201cwork on better methods of dealing with stress and my overall well-being.\u201d\n\nMorant\u2019s recent actions call to mind Javaris Crittenton, a highly talented college player and former NBA professional, playing for the most storied franchise in the league, the Los Angeles Lakers. Crintenton had a bright future ahead of him but it was cut short when he became involved in gang activity, drug trafficking, and murder charges and more famously bringing guns into the locker room. Crittenton is now serving a 23-year sentence for the murder of a mother of four. Morant has not committed murder; however, he\u2019s starting to be involved in on, and off, the court incidents. Recently Morant caught flack for his friends riding in an SUV that aimed a laser possibly attached to a gun at the Indiana Pacers team bus. Morant himself threatened the head of security at a mall in Memphis and engaged in a verbal altercation during a game with NFL hall of famer Shannon Sharpe.\n\nWhy is Morant, a superstar talent and franchise player with a $200 million contract, acting in this manner? He secured a multi-year Nike shoe deal. He\u2019s a Powerade athlete and a potential face of the league for years to come. Who is to blame for his actions? Let\u2019s try to think deeper. I\u2019m not a psychologist. If I were, I\u2019d attribute his actions to the cultural media he consumes, unedifying rap music and stereotypical Black media entertainment that never fails to depict Black characters in a constantly negative light either through gang violence, drug empires or victims with no hope, relying on a handout from others. Think of what Black youths consume nowadays through social media and the television and music that is made.\n\nJa doesn\u2019t realize the position he is in. \u201cTo whom much is given, much is required\u201d - Luke 12:48 Whether he likes it or not, Ja is a role model for youth worldwide, specifically in America. He\u2019s a light for the underprivileged. He\u2019s an example to children in impoverished situations, waiting for an opportunity to make a difference for their family through sports or another outlet. Ja needs to do better, and I hope he can see the error of his ways, and correct them before it\u2019s too late. The last thing I want to see is another talented Black man fall and quite frankly, it\u2019s sad.\n\nJa was raised in a stable picturesque suburban home. It was the Black American dream \u2014 a middle-class family with married, college-educated parents. He grew up with an active father in the house to set an example for his son, an opportunity many Black children in America don\u2019t have. Ja played for one of the premiere teams in AAU basketball \u2014 the South Carolina Hornets. He was fortunate enough to be noticed by assistant coach James Kane of Murray State, who stumbled upon him at a tournament. Ja was gifted with athletic talents and a robust personality to match them, making him an extremely marketable athlete whom major companies like Nike, Gatorade, State Farm and so many others fawn over.\n\nIt begs the question: Where is Ja\u2019s father, Tee, amidst everything happening now? Now would be the best time to pull your son aside and guide him before he makes a huge mistake. A friend recently compared Ja to \u201cPapa Doc,\u201d played by Anthony Mackie from the 2002 film \u201c8 Mile.\u201d Doc is a gang leader of \u201cTha Free World\u201d and threatens with violence and guns. All the while, Papa Doc was living a double life. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, dawg? You embarrassed? This guy\u2019s a gangster? His real name\u2019s Clarence; and Clarence lives at home with both parents. And Clarence\u2019s parents have a real good marriage,\u201d said B-Rabbit, played by rapper Eminem.\n\nAll jokes aside, I was blessed with privileges similar to Ja. My parents, who are celebrating their 31st anniversary on March 15, have been present in the lives of my brothers and I since birth. They have always provided for us and raised us to be contributors to society. We had the privilege of going to phenomenal schools and pursuing the interests that we have always wanted. I do not take it for granted, especially knowing friends from broken families with fewer opportunities to make it out of their circumstances.\n\nJa may be doing this unknowingly, but he\u2019s spitting on the faces of Black Americans who are trying to break the age-old narrative of young, Black men who are labeled as \u201cthugs,\u201d prone to violence and crime. He\u2019s playing into the stereotype that the media has put on Black Americans for years.\n\nMy message to Morant is this: Get it together, because the 23 years of work you\u2019ve put in can disappear in the blink of an eye.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Drake Lee\nMarch 05, 2023 at 12:36 am PST\n\nAfter losing against Arizona, USC knew it had to bounce back against Arizona State. A second loss in a week at Galen Center might have jeopardized the Trojans\u2019 chances of making the NCAA tournament. Instead, the Trojans narrowly escaped the Sun Devils\u2019 second-half comeback in a 68-65 victory.\n\n\u201cIt was a great win for us,\u201d Head Coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about the improvement this team has made. One of the most improved teams we\u2019ve ever had here in ten years.\u201d\n\nOn Senior Night, the packed Galen Center crowd of 8,671 honored senior guard Boogie Ellis and fifth-year guard Drew Peterson.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a blessing to play at a high level at Galen Center,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cTonight, it was a great environment.\u201d\n\nEllis led all players with 28 points after scoring a career-high 35 against Arizona. Meanwhile, Peterson scored 9 points while playing through a back injury. The former Rice Owl did not know if he was going to play until the hours leading up to tip-off.\n\n\u201cI told everybody at shootaround I wasn\u2019t playing,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cBetween that time and the game, I just gutted it out.\u201d\n\nAside from Ellis and Peterson, the Trojans\u2019 bench shined despite missing freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu to a back injury and sophomore guard Malik Thomas due to personal reasons, according to Enfield. USC received 23 points from the bench compared to Arizona State\u2019s 6.\n\n\u201c[Our bench] was a big part of the game,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cFor those guys to perform like they did tonight was a huge reason why we won the game.\u201d\n\nOn defense, the Trojans limited the Sun Devils to just 23% from field-goal range prior to halftime. Arizona State\u2019s 20 points in the first half are tied for the lowest number of points scored in a first half this season for the Sun Devils.\n\n\u201cWe played great defensively,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guys like Kobe in passing lanes, contesting everything. We\u2019ve got Drew\u2019s length, and me being able to put pressure and get steals.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans led by as much as 14 in the second half. But in the final six minutes, the lead evaporated. Sun Devil sophomore guard Frankie Collins\u2019s jumper cut the deficit to as close as 1 with 15 seconds to go. Freshman guard Tre White and redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan made enough of their free throws to force ASU to take a 3-point shot. Sun Devil junior guard DJ Horne\u2019s final shot bounced off the rim, sealing the Trojans\u2019 victory.\n\nUSC\u2019s regular season ends with a 22-9 overall record and a 14-6 conference record. The Trojans went 15-2 at home and 5-5 on the road.\n\n\u201cI think our team deserves to be in the NCAA tournament,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cAnd I think Arizona State deserves to be in as well.\u201d\n\nUSC will head to Vegas to play in the Pac-12 Tournament. Its first game will be on Thursday at 8:30 pm. After their first-round bye, the Trojans will face the winner of No. 6 Arizona State and No. 11 Oregon State.\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Wendi Lu March 04, 2023 at 3:34 pm PST\n\nSpirits were at a high when UCLA brought the deficit down to three points. Just minutes later, the Bruins were able to reverse that to a three-point lead of their own. Looking at the past two days in the Pac-12 Tournament, \u2018tis the season for an underdog\u2019s comeback. In this case, it\u2019s a bear.\n\nFriday night, No. 5 seed UCLA showed its claws in the semifinal, upsetting No. 2 seed Stanford 69-65 inside Michelob ULTRA Arena. The Cardinal dominated the first half of the game, shooting 48.4% from the field. The Bruins, on the other hand, were having a hard time shooting through the Cardinal\u2019s tight wall of defense.\n\nBy the end of the first quarter, Stanford was heating up on a 6-0 run over a 2:21 stretch. The Cardinal continued to have their share of fun in the second quarter: their largest lead of 16 points appeared with 1:39 to go.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that the Bruins couldn\u2019t shoot \u2014 Stanford junior forward Cameron Brink is second in the country in blocks per game. \u201cStanford\u2019s identity is scoring from the inside out and dominating people on the glass,\u201d UCLA Head Coach Cori Close said. \u201cWhen you look at so many of their close games, against USC, they were like 34 to 2 in the paint. It\u2019s just where their bread and butter lies.\u201d\n\nIndeed, 40% of Stanford\u2019s score came from shooting in the paint. Yet, somehow the Cardinal lost momentum in the second half, allowing the Bruins to catch up from behind. \u201cWe knew [the Bruins] were going to come out big in the second half,\u201d Stanford senior guard Haley Jones said. \" I just don\u2019t think that we matched their energy in the second half.\u201d\n\nStarting from the third quarter, UCLA worked hard to bring down the deficit, doubling shooting from their first quarter to 40%. On the other side of the ball, the Bruins\u2019 defense improved, leaving Stanford in a scoring drought for the last 2:07 of the quarter.\n\nThe last quarter was when the Bruins chopped down the tree. Freshman guard Kiki Rice\u2019s jumper at 2:07 put UCLA ahead 60-59 and gave the Bruins their first lead since 2-0 in the first quarter. Rice poured out 22 points \u2014 a new career high capped off with the final point of the game.\n\n\u201cI hit my first shot, and then after that maybe I missed a few times,\u201d Rice said. \u201cBut when I got pulled out, Coach was putting the confidence in me and telling me what adjustments I needed to make. That\u2019s really what allows me to go back in the game and figure out my assignment, knowing what to do and also having all my teammates on my back.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinal didn\u2019t give up  \u2014 junior guard Agnes Emma-Nnopu made a diving layup from the field when there was 50 seconds left, cutting Stanford\u2019s deficit to one point. After two timeouts, the Bruins were quickly back on their feet and made their free throws down the stretch. When Stanford committed another team foul in the last five seconds, it was over for the Cardinal.\n\n\u201cAs thrilled as we are for this game and this is a monumental win, we didn\u2019t come here to beat Stanford in the semifinals,\u201d Close said. \u201cWe came here to pursue a championship at the highest level.\u201d\n\nNo. 5 seed UCLA will face No. 7 seed Washington State for the Pac-12 Tournament championship Sunday at 2 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Cl\u00e9mence-Maureen Feniou March 04, 2023 at 1:17 pm PST\n\nThe underdogs struck again in another historic night for Washington State. One day after shocking Utah, WSU pulled off another win. The No. 7 seed Cougars extended their remarkable run in the Pac-12 Tournament, stunning the No. 3 seed Buffaloes with a 61-49 victory Friday at Michelob ULTRA arena. For the first time ever, WSU is headed to the Pac-12 Tournament championship game.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even express how thrilled I am for our program,\u201d WSU Head Coach Kamie Ethridge said. \u201cWe have worked a long time to put ourselves in a position to advance, and to do it to the championship is really exciting.\u201d\n\nThe game was smooth for the Cougars in the first quarter; with a stellar defense and a well-established attack, WSU took off 11-6. With two seconds left on the clock, freshman guard Astera Tuhina shot a 3-point jumper. The ball bounced on the rim and banked in with the buzzer sound.\n\nDanger came in the second quarter from Colorado senior guard Jaylyn Sherrod, actively dribbling through the key, delivering assists and cutting through passes to pick up steals. But Sherrod\u2019s performance could not save Colorado from its poor shooting, 31.8% from the field and 20% from behind the arc in the first half.\n\nWashington State claimed its largest lead, 16 points, early in the third quarter. The Cougars\u2019 advantage vanished as fast as it was built, surrendering a 20-4 run to the Buffaloes, wrapping the third quarter 38-38.\n\n\u201cIt was urgent to not keep self-inflicting ourselves with turnovers or bad decisions,\u201d Ethridge said. \u201cIt felt like there were seven of them on the court, and we were just kind of out of sync and out of rhythm.\u201d\n\nAmid angst, stress and the loud support of fans, the fourth quarter began. But this time, all had to be redone. Colorado tied the score again at 41-41. The Cougars went on its game-deciding run with 6:17 to go. Senior center Bella Murekatete dove for a loose ball, got the ball back to sophomore guard Tara Wallack behind the arc and passed to senior guard Johanna Teder, who rifled to an open fifth-year forward Ula Motuga. She buried a 3-pointer, giving the lead back to the Cougars. The Buffaloes never tied it again.\n\nWSU went on shooting 6 free throws from Tuhina, Wallack and junior guard Charlisse Leger-Walker. One last rebound from freshman guard Kyra Gardner sent the Cougars into the final.\n\n\u201cIt was the most stressful moment ever,\u201d Murekatete said. \u201cI\u2019m just so glad that the clock went to zero.\u201d\n\nWashington State pulled off an impressive team win. Leger-Walker scored 15 points, Murekatete put up 12 points and 8 rebounds, Tuhina had 10 points and Motuga finished with 9 points herself. For Colorado, sophomore center Aaronette Vonleh had 18 points and junior guard Frida Formann had 11. Sherrod almost changed the course of the game by herself with 13 points, 5 rebounds, 6 assists and 6 steals, but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop the Cougars from clinching the win.\n\nWashington State will face an even tougher challenge Sunday at 2 p.m., facing the UCLA Bruins. But if the Cougars proved one thing, it\u2019s that underdogs should not be underestimated.\n\n\u201cI just think back on when we got these guys to sign with us, all they had was a vision, all they had was our words of what we could accomplish over time,\u201d Ethridge said. \u201cIt is beyond belief that we are here, knowing where we\u2019ve come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the greatest ride I\u2019ve been on with a team,\u201d Ethridge said, \u201cso I\u2019m going to just sit back and keep riding it.\u201d\n```"}

This Women\u2019s History Month is especially significant because it is taking place during USC\u2019s yearlong celebration of the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the legislation which prohibits sex based discrimination within any school or other educational program that receives funding from the federal government.\n\nWomen\u2019s History Month reminds us all of the major strides women have taken to gain respect and appreciation in all aspects of life.

On the list are radio calls about noise complaints, illegal vending and drinking in public, to name a few. The union proposed the list to counter LAPD\u2019s understaffing issues, such as delayed response times to emergencies, and address the public\u2019s concerns about potential dangerous escalation in these calls for service.\n\nAccording to the proposal, officers will still respond if the situation becomes violent, but only after the initial call is routed to an agency or affiliated nonprofit. The top three scenarios among these listed calls are non-criminal and non-violent homeless and quality of life-related calls, non-criminal mental health calls, and non-violent juvenile disturbances or juveniles beyond parent control calls (refusing to go to school).\n\nThe driving force behind this proposition is \u201clong-term, chronic understaffing\u201d of the police department that is said to have increased neighborhood crime and decreased overall officer morale, the Alternative Response Proposal said. The union says that this initiative will allow armed officers to dedicate more of their focus toward violent crimes.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the support of the Los Angeles Police Protective League in calling out the importance of establishing an alternative non-law enforcement service response to non-emergency calls,\u201d LAPD Police Chief Michael Moore said in a statement provided by the department\u2019s media relations division. \u201cThese emerging alternatives have already diverted thousands of calls away from a police response, allowing officers time to focus on our most essential activities.\u201d\n\nWhile several benefits could come from this new development, some people are concerned about the potential repercussions following it. \u201cThe police wanted to make a change, they\u2019re just not trained to deal with issues like mental health and family issues,\u201d said Laurie Levenson, Professor of Law at Loyola Marymount University. \u201cWe need other services other than police forces.\u201d\n\nBillion Godsun, a community organizer with Fight 2 Save Black LA, agreed that the proposal could provide more resolutions than instant citations and arrests. However, he shared his concern, \u201cWith those officers no longer actively patrolling the lesser crimes then, is it a need for more violent responses?\u201d Godsun said. Godsun believes that a spike in violent crime should be expected with a prospective recession on the horizon. \u201cThe thing to be would be to go ahead and invest funds and alleviate that need \u2013 let\u2019s anticipate the violence to see how we can possibly divert it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe implication of this proposal holds a lot of power and potential to make a change in communities, especially those that are overpoliced, such as South L.A. However, it is a challenging fix, according to some community leaders. Keyanna Celina, the lead organizer with Coalition for Community Control Over the Police, shares how she believed this proposal would be in the communities best interest. \u201cIt needs to be an organization that is democratic and that has long-standing roots in the community and not something of their [the LAPD\u2019s] choice,\u201d she said. \u201cOrganizations that haven\u2019t become swollen, there are a lot of poverty pimps too; we\u2019re looking for authentically grassroots organizations that have ties with therapy [resources] and things like that.\u201d\n\nThis proposition is still pending as different perspectives weigh in on the possible LAPD change.\n```"}

The month rolls on And Spring draws near, And March goes out Like a lamb so dear. -Lorie Hill\n\nMarch is finally here, and in Southern California, Lorie Hill\u2019s poem couldn\u2019t be more true. In the college basketball world, however, this poem is a bit less accurate. March roars in like a lion, but goes out like the king of the jungle, in the heart of March Madness.\n\nThe madness started this week with the beginning of conference championship week. There are 352 schools fighting for glory against their fierce conference rivals, but, more importantly, one of the 32 automatic qualifying bids to the big dance. Also up for grabs are 36 at-large bids to fill out the 68-team bracket.\n\nWhile ESPN\u2019s Bracketology is a great reference of which teams will be fighting for a national championship, expect to see something completely different come Selection Sunday. With 32 conferences and hundreds of games to play between now and then, I\u2019ve answered the five biggest questions on how to follow all of the action.\n\nWhich teams will punch their ticket this weekend? Eleven tournaments are already underway, highlighted by the West Coast Conference. Gonzaga and St. Mary\u2019s are once again on a collision course for the championship game. However, neither of those teams will be in action this weekend thanks to a triple bye; they\u2019ll play their first games Monday.\n\nThe most intriguing tourney this weekend is the Sun Belt, where the top six teams all finished within three games of each other. Tomorrow starts a three-day stretch of games for these teams with no true favorite, but I did highlight the sharpshooting Louisiana Ragin\u2019 Cajuns in the Cinderella edition of this column. If the No. 2 seed in the Sun Belt can win out, they figure to be a threat to a top seed in the big dance.\n\nWill mid-major tournaments identify potential Cinderellas? Yes and no. For the smallest of small schools, making the tournament is the accomplishment. They don\u2019t have the roster power to compete against a No. 1 or 2 seed. But some of these teams will be seeded in the No. 11 to 13 range, which I like to call \u201cupset central.\u201d The best mid-major teams with something to prove versus Power 6 schools who see the game as a tune-up for the later rounds: a recipe for disaster.\n\nOral Roberts is the popular Cinderella pick due to their dominance in the Summit League \u2014 same with Colgate in the Patriot League. Both are currently slotted in this range in the latest Bracketology. A team nobody\u2019s talking about is Rick Pitino\u2019s Iona Gaels. Pitino\u2019s first season in New York resulted in a tournament appearance as a No. 15 seed, and the Gaels finished the regular season atop the MAAC conference in all three years of his tenure. This year has been their best yet. Should Iona creep into a No. 13 or possibly 12 seed, Pitino\u2019s name alone makes it a popular upset pick. Not to mention how well the MAAC champion did in last year\u2019s tournament: the Saint Peter\u2019s Peacocks.\n\nWho needs to prove themselves for an at-large bid? This year\u2019s bubble has been one of the most competitive in recent memory, featuring big names like Duke and Kentucky at certain points this year. Right now, North Carolina sits atop the bubble headlines. Last year\u2019s runner-up and this year\u2019s preseason No. 1 will enter the ACC tournament as a No. 6 or 7 seed. Virginia Tech won the tourney from this seed last season, but it took a miracle run that requires winning four games in four days. UNC\u2019s most recent win against Virginia was important for its at-large hopes, meaning the Tar Heels won\u2019t have to go all the way in the ACC to make the tournament.\n\nThe Pac-12\u2019s \u201cbest of the rest,\u201d USC and Arizona State, are in a similar position. Both should have a bye in next week\u2019s tourney and will be favored in the second round matchup. A win there and then a close game against UCLA or Arizona in the semifinals helps their cases tremendously, while a loss in the second round spells disaster.\n\nWhich teams have to win their way into the dance? Virginia Tech\u2019s magic is not uncommon; in fact, it happens just about every year. In this season that\u2019s featured so much parity and losses at the top, a Cinderella conference champion is inevitable. Villanova is the most likely candidate in this category. The Wildcats are heating up at the right time, winning three of their last four, including two ranked wins. They also sit on the opposite side of the bracket from Big East favorite Marquette, leaving \u2018Nova plenty of time to prepare for that game.\n\nThere\u2019s also the case of the Colonial Athletic Association. Despite a 20-game win streak earlier this season, the Charleston Cougars are still on the outside looking in. The most recent Bracketology shows no appreciation for the Cougars, meaning they would have to defeat Hofstra \u2014 who snapped the impressive streak in January \u2014 to secure their tournament dreams. But if any conference is going to feature a surprise champion, it\u2019s the Big 12. All but one team is currently locked into the Big Dance or on the bubble. West Virginia, Texas Tech and Oklahoma State are the three in a must-win scenario but would have to run through a gauntlet of powerhouses for this to happen.\n\nThere\u2019s so many games to follow, what should I watch for? The bubble watch sets up to be the most exciting, considering most teams are fighting through top conferences to gain at-large bids. For many mid-majors, the only games off ESPN+ will be the championship games, which will feature blockbuster action from tipoff to buzzer. Watching those can be a great first look at some teams that don\u2019t get any attention. But, of course, the best action will come from the top teams, and the five-team fight for the No. 1 seeds shapes up to be a fun one. Watching these top teams \u2014 Houston, Alabama, Kansas, UCLA and Purdue \u2014 in their respective conferences should give a read on who the favorite to win it all will be. But keep in mind, it is March, and the Madness has begun.\n\nTourney Talk runs every Friday.\n```"}

Rodgers says he will make a decision on his future \u201csoon enough\u201d as the four-time MVP quarterback ponders whether to play this season and if his future remains with the Packers. (AP Photo/Morry Gash)\n\nBy Kamyar Moradi\nMarch 03, 2023 at 2:28 pm PST\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d is a satirical sports column by Kamyar Moradi depicting everything and everyone who should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nDear Aaron Rodgers,\n\nBefore I proceed to dismantle yet another aspect of sports, I think it\u2019s only right that I take the time to switch things up and show some love and appreciation for this. With this being around the halfway point in the semester, I think it is time I show some serious thanks and appreciation for what this column has provided me. \u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d has allowed me to spit hot fire towards the people and things that need it the most. It has become the canvas to house my muse, and for that, I\u2019m forever grateful.\n\nNow, as we continue with my personal revenge tour, I figured it was only right to talk about someone who spends more time with State Farm than his own receiving core. Aaron, if you think this will be a cakewalk, guess again, my friend. You better not overlook this like a home game against the Lions because I heard that didn\u2019t go too well either, right Mr. Rodgers?\n\nFrom the beginning of my football fandom, you taught me that a modern-day gladiator sport could be an art form just by the spiral you put on that ball. There wasn\u2019t a more talented thrower of the football, there wasn\u2019t a quarterback with half the moxie and there wasn\u2019t a better magician in sports than you were in the 2010s.\n\nEver since your lone Lombardi trophy, I carried your legacy around like I was your personal ball boy for 11 straight years like it was a 9-to-5. The endless media cycle every January about how you couldn\u2019t get done in the playoffs and how you massively underachieved. When the lights shined the brightest, you folded like Vontae Davis at halftime.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t understand, I want you to conduct a quick Google search just to appreciate how elite of a reference this really is. I was there for you Aaron, every time that team from the Bay Area ripped the heart out of every Green Bay, Wisconsin resident, including myself. I still have night terrors of when Colin Kaepernick hung 181 yards on your head, which happened to be a playoff record for any quarterback in NFL history.\n\nI was there for you when you lost to a 9-7 New York Giants team after you lost only one game all season. I was there for you when you were finally about to overcome Seattle and the Legion of Bums until disaster struck and you lost in overtime. Even when you openly admitted to ingesting Ayahuasca, I somehow managed to convince myself and others that you were on the path to enlightenment and just wanted to become more in tune with your true self.\n\nI was willing to look over everything, Aaron, but unlike your darkness retreat, it was time for me to see the light. One of the things I adore the most in sports is when athletes pretend not to care about their image, just to turn around and make sure everyone in the entire country knows about \u201ctheir true intentions\u201d and \u201ctheir side of the story.\u201d GIVE ME A BREAK, RODGERS!\n\nYou sure don\u2019t care what the media thinks of you when you make a weekly appearance every Tuesday with your boy Pat McAfee. Like a trust fund kid on Christmas, you always find a way to complain about something. You\u2019ve threatened to leave Green Bay and even contemplated retirement until a Brinks truck backed up $150 million in Blue Benjamins into your bank account.\n\nI guess it wasn\u2019t about the treatment from the front office, the disconnect from the coaching staff or even the lack of offensive talent that the Packers failed to surround you with. And the icing on this disgusting cake has to be you throwing your own rookie wide receivers under the biggest bus in the history of automobiles.\n\nYou let one of the best receivers of this generation walk, claimed you\u2019d be fine without him, and then trashed all of your current group of receivers. You want to cut reps from people who are fighting for their lives trying to make an NFL roster. How do you sleep with yourself at night?\n\nYour pompous nature has caused current and former teammates to speak out about how you couldn\u2019t lead a team. You were even anointed with the title of \u201cdiva.\u201d A word so heinous that it\u2019s reserved for the likes of Kyrie \u201cflat-earth\u201d Irving, Chad \u201cI spelled 85 in Spanish incorrectly\u201d Ochocinco, Terrell \u201cteam obliterator\u201d Owens and every single Kardashian in existence.\n\nYour crowning achievement over the past 12 NFL seasons is that you\u2019ve owned the Chicago Bears. I hate to break it to you, pal, BUT EVERYONE HAS OWNED THE CHICAGO BEARS SINCE 1986!\n\nThe only thing that might rival this unprecedented feat is the fact that you managed to dupe the entire world about being immunized. There was honestly a point in time where I had to find the nearest Merriam-Webster just to know for certain that I hadn\u2019t been using the word wrong my entire life.\n\nFinally, Aaron, I know you could make a case that a lot of what I\u2019m writing is simply conjecture from an outside perspective. You could say I don\u2019t have all the facts. But Ryan Tannehill, Dak Prescott, Jimmy Garoppolo, Matthew Stafford, Jared Goff, Nick Foles and Gardner Minshew all have as many or more playoff wins as you in the past six seasons.\n\nRespectfully, you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Wendi Lu March 03, 2023 at 12:52 pm PST\n\nIn the last 39 seconds, junior forward Alissa Pili helped to nearly complete a comeback for Utah \u2014 bringing the Utes\u2019 deficit down to 3 points with a 3-pointer. However, it wasn\u2019t enough to overpower what Washington State built up in the third quarter. Thursday night, inside Michelob ULTRA Arena, the Cougar fans went crazy for this hard-earned victory. WSU defeated Utah 66-58 in the Pac-12 quarterfinal. This win marks the first time since 2016 that a top-two seed did not make the semifinals of the Pac-12 tournament.\n\n\u201cWashington State is a good team and they are the seventh seed,\u201d Utah Head Coach Lynne Roberts said. \u201cIt just speaks to how good this conference is and how on any given night anyone can win.\u201d\n\nIt was a tight game from the beginning. The Utes got the upper hand when there were 10 ticks left, wrapping the first quarter neatly at 16-13 with a 3-point jumper by sophomore guard Gianna Kneepkens. Both teams were shooting at 40% from the field, so the lead depended on the Utes having a better defense. Utah claimed its strongest lead 22-13 in the second quarter at 8:24. Just a few minutes later, junior guard Charlisse Leger-Walker\u2019s 3-point jumper regained the lead for the Cougars temporarily at 23-22. Still, the Cougars couldn\u2019t keep up with the Utes\u2019 shooting and had trouble keeping the ball in their possession.\n\nThat\u2019s when WSU adjusted its game plan and brought out the Kryptonite against Superwoman Pili. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give away too many secrets,\u201d WSU Head Coach Kamie Ethridge said. \u201cBut [Pili] is impossible to guard. We did have a way we wanted to defend her pick and rolls. Every single time we match up with Utah, we do have a kind of secret weapon in Ula Motuga. She can match when not everybody can. Bella Murekatete did not want any part of [Pili] in the first quarter. She was just saying \u2018do I have to guard her?\u2019 Pili contributed 11 points in total. However, under fifth-year forward Ula Motuga\u2019s heavy defense, she was only able to get a total of 2 rebounds. On the other hand, Motuga contributed 13 points and 8 rebounds. As the team high, senior center Bella Murekatete scored 19 points.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Cougars made a comeback. WSU\u2019s shooting was off the charts \u2014 scoring 3 3-point jumpers in a row. Utah did bite back, though. The lead changed back and forth three times, with WSU bringing it up to a tie first. This quarter, the Cougars put up 27 points while the other three quarters added up to just 39. The fourth quarter was a tough one. Foul trouble disrupted the Utes\u2019 rhythm: Dasia Young was called for two in less than one minute. Nevertheless, Utah still put up a good fight until the last second.\n\n\u201cI thought we did a great job defensively. We were going to grab a rebound and call timeout,\u201d Roberts said. \" [The Cougars] were inbounding and getting the ball to their free-throw shooters. They had a great defense. We\u2019ve got five people on the floor and shoot the three out of the timeout, so I just thought we\u2019d have a good shot.\u201d\n\nWhen there were eight ticks left, all hopes were lost for the Utes when Leger-Walker extended the lead to 64-58 with a 3-point jumper. Motuga took advantage of Utes\u2019 disrupted rhyme and threw in 2 more shots to finish the game off.\n\n\u201cEverything leading up to that moment was just so good for my team. Obviously, in those moments, it\u2019s a big-time shot,\u201d Leger-Walker said. \u201cBut the plays we made before that, the runs that we had ... and then taking that third-quarter momentum into the fourth, that\u2019s what got us that win. So I\u2019m glad I could finish it off for our team but just super proud of how we came out tonight. \"\n\nOn Friday night, WSU will face No. 3 seed Colorado. The Buffs will be hungry for the win as this is their highest seed ever entering the Pac-12 tournament.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/03/03/interview-with-journalist-meghann-scully/", "response": "```\nInterview with journalist Meghann Scully\n\nSports and entertainment journalist talks about making her way in the industry.\n\nBy Sophia Ketterer\nMarch 03, 2023 at 10:00 am PST\n\nBorn and raised in Ireland, broadcaster and multimedia journalist Meghann Scully is based in Limerick, Ireland and currently works for Iconic Media Group. She covers sports and entertainment events. She studied Irish and media studies at the University of Limerick and is fluent in Gaelic.\n\nFrom a young age, Scully knew she wanted to work in journalism and media. Joking that \u201cit\u2019s a very Irish story,\u201d she said her interest in journalism sparked from her Catholicism and growing up going to church every weekend. She often read at Mass and became the priests\u2019 go-to for readings. She says that, looking back, this experience helped her in the work she does now, such as standing in front of strangers, delivering a message, working on projecting her voice and confidence. She liked how it felt like a performance.\n\nAs soon as she wakes up, Scully opens Twitter and other social media platforms to see what\u2019s trending. When in the office she spends a lot of time on research for her stories, which is something she made clear: \u201cWhen you work in media, people only see what goes on Instagram or what goes on the website. They might see a three- or four-minute interview and think, \u2018Oh, so that\u2019s your day?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, no, no, there\u2019s so much behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nScully practices mobile journalism and shoots everything on her iPhone. Something Scully said she particularly loves about her job is that \u201cwhile media is really pressurized and time sensitive\u201d her company ensures that journalists take time off and work reasonable hours. She stressed that it\u2019s important to \u201cgive yourself a break from constant news and constant updates\u201d that comes with journalism and always being online.\n\nScully draws inspiration from Holly Willoughby, the host and face of \u201cThis Morning,\u201d a UK morning show. Scully loves that Willoughby isn\u2019t afraid to show emotion when covering a story. Willoughby, who is a mother and a journalist, inspires Scully as \u201cshe seems to just be able to juggle it all.\u201d\n\nScully\u2019s interest in sports journalism stemmed from growing up horseback riding and playing camogie (an Irish sport like lacrosse), hockey and Gaelic football, in addition to attending sporting events. Seeing female hosts and presenters, she wondered if she could do it too. When she first started out, she loved how welcoming other journalists were, explaining to her how things worked and making sure she was able to ask the players her questions. She loved it even more when it sunk in that she was getting paid to go to matches and meet players.\n\nScully said that being a female in this industry brings a lot of opportunity and proves to be useful in sports journalism. Often seen as \u201cjust a girl who doesn\u2019t know her stuff,\u201d she uses being underestimated to her advantage. While covering a rugby match, she was the only female journalist, and it gave her an \u201cupper hand in a male domination environment because it\u2019s a unique selling point.\u201d She likes to ask completely random questions to athletes, based on something she might have seen on Instagram because \u201csuddenly their demeanor changes and they\u2019re relaxed.\u201d She said she gets to know them as people, not just players. \u201cWho I am as a person and when I\u2019m in front of a camera is the same person I am with my friends. I get underestimated a lot but whether you\u2019re male or female, being authentic is definitely the most important part.\u201d\n\nAfter interviewing a rugby player and congratulating him on his recent engagement, which none of the other journalists knew about, her competitors said that she\u2019s \u201cthe only one who\u2019s been able to crack him and got a laugh and smile out of him.\u201d\n\nHaving lost her 18-year-old brother when she was just 15 in a tragic car accident, Scully is extremely conscious of right and wrong: \u201cI just think you have to know where to draw the line.\u201d She remembers seeing his photos all over the front pages of newspapers across Ireland without her family\u2019s consent, nor were they informed that photographers would be at the funeral. From this loss, she later wrote two books: \u201cBroken Love\u201d and \u201cLittle Pocket of Love.\u201d \u201cYou have to remember there is a family behind a story like that,\u201d Scully said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there is a mother, a brother, a father, or a sister and a community of people. That\u2019s where you have to be able to draw the line with journalism. Maybe take a split second and think if the family would like what you\u2019re writing or doing. You just have to tread carefully and just see what\u2019s morally right and what\u2019s morally wrong.\u201d\n\nAlthough there were times she considered walking away from journalism, Scully embraced the motto, \u201cWhat\u2019s for you won\u2019t pass you.\u201d She said that, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s competitive, it\u2019s worth it in the end. Journalism is universal. You can go anywhere.\u201d\n\nHer advice for prospective journalists is to take advantage of social media and networking. \u201cThe media industry changes a lot. Jobs come and go. You might not always be in full time work. It\u2019s really important to keep up and keep active. I\u2019m definitely getting to know people behind the scenes like the producers, the directors, the editors, and the photographers. Get to know them all,\u201d Scully said.\n\nMore about these From the Classroom submissions: Students in an intro to reporting and writing course interviewed working journalists and asked their career advice and how they got their start. It\u2019s a rare assignment where they were allowed to have just one source in the story or Q&A. Read more work \u201cFrom the Classroom\u201d here.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Sara Atashi March 03, 2023 at 12:31 am PST\n\nUSC was plagued by foul trouble, mismatches and injury in its 87-81 loss to No. 8 Arizona on Thursday night. Senior guard Boogie Ellis led the Trojans with a career-high 35 points in their quest for a second top-10 win this season, but his persistence could not make up for the team\u2019s issues.\n\nUSC was left scrambling with fifth-year guard Drew Peterson suffering from lower back tightness and three players, including Ellis, posting at least 4 fouls. The first player to reach foul trouble was sophomore guard Kobe Johnson, who collected his third personal foul with 9:23 left in the first half and did not return until the second half.\n\nJohnson averages 2.2 steals and 4.8 rebounds a game, and his defensive presence is one that was needed against the Wildcats. \u201cIt\u2019s hard without Kobe, Drew and Boogie in the first half,\u201d Head Coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cAll three of those guys were on the bench because of foul trouble, and Drew was hurt, so that did not make it easy to beat a team like Arizona, who\u2019s very talented.\u201d\n\nTo combat the size of Arizona\u2019s players and to adjust to the foul trouble, the Trojans traded their usual four-guard system for a two-forward system that consisted of redshirt junior Joshua Morgan and freshman Vincent Iwuchukwu. \u201cIf we were to play two bigs again, Josh and Vince definitely got to get together and work on that high-low game, because they are two very good players,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cJosh has improved greatly offensively, and Vince is still growing obviously, but they are two great players. I feel like they could feed off of each other.\u201d\n\nEven with the lineup adjustments, the Wildcats\u2019 offense could not be stopped. The Trojans had no answers for the combination of redshirt junior center Oumar Ballo and junior forward Azuolas Tubelis in the key. Tubelis had 15 points in the first half, and he seemed unstoppable until USC was able to slow him down to only 10 points in the second, which all occurred within the first eight minutes.\n\nAgainst this lethal pair that had already handed USC its only loss with a fully healthy roster this season, sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters stepped up. Dixon-Waters only trailed Ellis and Tubelis in points, racking up 17, along with 6 defensive rebounds, 1 block and 1 steal. \u201cI\u2019m definitely looking up to Boogie, also just working on my craft, watching film, trying to make smart decisions,\u201d Dixon-Waters said. \u201cThere\u2019s times in this game where I may have shot a shot that was a tougher shot, could\u2019ve gotten an easier shot, but I\u2019m just learning, watching film, just listening to my coaches.\u201d\n\nEllis and Dixon-Waters, along with Johnson, led the comeback against Arizona late in the second half. With 6:59 left in the game, the outcome looked bleak for the Trojans. Arizona had its largest lead yet at 71-55. But, after a pair of threes following a pair of free throws, Ellis managed to make it a five-point game at 83-78 with 36 seconds left.\n\n\u201cBoogie\u2019s matured and he\u2019s very focused. He\u2019s a great leader. He\u2019s really good with his teammates,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s a totally different player and person than he was last year when he first got here and even throughout last season to this season.\u201d\n\nWith 19 seconds to go, Ellis fouled out, sealing the ill-fated deal for the Trojans. Johnson managed to last a little over 10 minutes with 4 fouls and made his last 3 free throws with six seconds left to end the game 87-81.\n\n\u201cNobody on his team is a quitter. I\u2019ll go to war with these guys any given day,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe can play with any team in the country.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, the Trojans likely must win against Arizona State at home Saturday to secure their spot in March Madness. USC locked in its spot as the No. 3 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament and will face Arizona again in the conference semifinals if both teams win their first games.\n\n\u201cWe have to prepare starting tonight or tomorrow, very early for Arizona State, who is an exceptional team and very talented,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cSaturday\u2019s a big game.\u201d\n\nUSC will look to improve its record to 25-6 overall in its last conference game Saturday at 8 p.m.\n```"}

USC aimed to get back on track after going winless in their previous four games, but fell short again 6-5.\n\nSophomore pitcher Fisher Johnson made his first career start for the Trojans on a brisk, windy night in South L.A. with temperatures under 50 degrees for the first pitch. Immediately, the weather played a factor, as a routine flyball turned into a leadoff triple for Riverside. After scoring on a sacrifice fly, the Highlanders ended the first with a 1-0 lead.\n\nRiverside stayed hot in the second, tallying 4 hits to start the inning. Fortunately for the Trojans, a perfect relay from senior left fielder Adrian Colon-Rosado and junior shortstop Ryan Jackson gunned down a runner trying to score from first on a double. However, the Riverside bats kept firing, scoring 2 more runs on 5 total hits in the top half of the second.\n\nUSC wasted no time to respond, as senior catcher Connor Clift ripped an RBI single to center to put the Trojans on the board. After loading the bases with 2 outs, Colon-Rosado put his body on the line, getting hit by the pitch and driving in a run. Senior outfielder Cole Gabrielson followed up with a full-count walk, capitalizing on the free bases that Riverside was giving USC. Senior infielder Nick Lopez looked to continue his early season tear after Gabrielson but came up just short, driving a ball to the warning track before it got caught to end the inning, leaving the score tied 3-3 entering the third.\n\nAfter setting down both sides in order in the third, sophomore reliever Evan Clarke entered the game for the Trojans in the fourth, striking out three batters in the single inning he pitched. Things started to get sloppy for the Trojans in the fifth, as a leadoff single and 2 walks put the bases loaded for the Highlanders with no outs. After back-to-back sacrifice flies scored 2 runs for Riverside, the Highlanders were able to muster another run on a wild pitch, extending their lead to 6-3.\n\nSenior relief pitcher Ethan Hoopingarner made his season debut for the Trojans, eliminating Riverside\u2019s threat in the fifth. Hoopingarner came back out in the sixth, retiring three of the four batters he faced in the inning via the strikeout.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 bats grew quiet through the middle innings, recording a mere 3 hits over a five-inning span, only putting one runner in scoring position After the first two batters were retired in order in the eighth, things were looking gloomy for the Trojans. Then stepped up Clift, who took matters into his own hands, launching a solo home run to deep left, cutting the lead to 6-4.\n\nAfter a 1-2-3 inning in the top of the ninth, the Trojans looked to pull off some late-night heroics entering the bottom of the frame. Senior Johnny Olmstead got things started with an infield single. After falling behind in the count 0-1, Gabrielson sent a drive to deep right, a double off the wall, putting the tying run in scoring position. USC was knocking on the door with Lopez coming up to the dish. Lopez drove in a run after rolling over a ground out to first. The score was now 6-5 with the tying run just 90 feet away and redshirt freshman Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek coming up to the plate. Unfortunately, that was all the fight the Trojans had left, as Martin-Grudzielanek grounded out to short to end the game and the comeback bid.\n\nUSC\u2019s offense failed to show up on Wednesday, tallying just 9 hits and 5 runs, only the second time this year the Trojans failed to put up more than 5 runs in a ballgame. The loss now puts USC at 3-4-1 on the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good lesson for us offensively as well, as we just have to stay within ourselves,\u201d Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe were chasing out of the zone, we had a lot of lazy ground balls, lazy taps to the infield and a lot of lazy fly balls. When you combine that with the free bases, you\u2019re going to have a hard time winning games, and so that\u2019s what happened tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans look to get back in the win column Friday night against Sacramento State at home. This will be the beginning of a weekend slate of games as part of the Southern California College Baseball Classic, and the Trojans will conclude the weekend away against crosstown rival UCLA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about being complete and we just haven\u2019t been complete as a team in terms of pitching and better at bats and playing better defense,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna keep running out there, and we\u2019ll get it figured out. You go through these little growing pains early in the year, so we\u2019ll be ready to go Friday.\u201d\n```"}

The theme, \u201cThe Power of Women Leaders,\u201d was brought to life at USC Town and Gown Hall. ATHENA\u2019s mission is to increase the number of women investors at USC and increase the number of women in the investment ecosystem. ATHENA provides women entrepreneurs and investors with highly regarded mentors and funding sources. This allows the women to develop their skills and networks, while preparing them to seek funding.\n\n\u201cThe fact that women are coming together to celebrate women entrepreneurs and the ecosystem surrounding them is significant,\u201d Annenberg Dean Willow Bay said. \u201cIt\u2019s always frankly been a joy for me on behalf of Annenberg to partner with the Marshall School and the Greif Center for Entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nThe opening panel was moderated by Bay and included a number of panelists, eager to share their experiences in the workplace. Some notable names included Candace Nelson, founder of Pizzana and Sprinkles Cupcakes, Lauren Santo Domingo, Chief Brand Officer at Moda Operandi and Ellen Chen of Mendocino Farms.\n\n\u201cI would really hope that it encourages other women, especially women of minority groups, that they can do anything that they set their mind to and that they have more than the capabilities to be up on that stage with all the other women on there,\u201d said sophomore Vianca Ruiz, who attended the event.\n\nOne of those women was Sophie Lin. Lin leads a double life: She\u2019s part CEO, part engineer. But her idea to blend the two landed her first place in ATHENA\u2019s Female Pitch Competition, a competition that preceded the summit. It gave female USC student startup founders a chance to present their ideas with all in attendance. Lin is CEO of OSEM, a 3D-printing device with a very special power.\n\n\u201c[The device] is intended to revolutionize how scientists develop nano drugs for personalized medicine, cancer and mRNA vaccines,\u201d Lin said. Lin developed her product during the COVID-19 pandemic after noticing a gap in the market.\n\n\u201cI saw that we\u2019re still using ill-defined tools for COVID-19 vaccine production, which are micro-sized channels that are prone to clogging. And there are so many challenges that scientists have to face in order to realize their goals,\u201d Lin said. \u201cBecause of that, I developed this 3D-printed tool that is going to have helped scientists overcome these challenges so that we can have better medicine sooner.\u201d\n\nLin\u2019s work is a testament to the importance of funding women entrepreneurs. This Women\u2019s History Month marks over 50 years since the implementation of Title IX, a federal law that ensures both male and female students are treated equally and fairly. For sophomore Charlotte Marsoun, the workplace ecosystem has come a long way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the easiest to be in an industry like this as a woman, but you won\u2019t be the only woman at the table anymore,\u201d Marsoun said. \u201cI think that is pretty special.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly wrote the Grace Center instead of the Greif Center, and that Annenberg Dean Willow Bay moderated the event. Bay moderated the opening panel along with Lauran Santo Domingo, the founder of Moda Operandi, and Tony Florence of NEA.\n```"}

Expand L.A. Metro stop at Expo/Crenshaw in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nBy Siara Carpenter, Thomas Johnson, and Peter Makk\nMarch 02, 2023 at 7:37 pm PST\n\nA recent vote to uphold the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s contract with the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority sparked controversy surrounding police funding, over policing and minority passenger safety. LAPD had a five-year contract with Metro, which started in February 2017. The L.A. City Council retroactively voted, with a 10-2 margin, to extend that contract over the last six months of 2022. Since it was done retroactively, the vote would have left over a $50 million pit in the city budget if it had not been approved.\n\nSince the contract has been in effect for over five years, critics and supporters alike have been able to evaluate the results. Scarlett De Leon, Campaigns Director with ACT-LA and one of the critics of the contract, questioned whether spending so much money to have LAPD police buses and trains of the L.A. Metro system has a positive effect. \u201c[The contract] was a waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d De Leon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing reports of folks feeling safer on the [Metro] system and actually quite the opposite. So we\u2019re calling for Metro to really use their funds for community safety alternatives ... instead of continuing spending this policing contract that not only has been wasteful but actually has caused real harm to our communities.\u201d\n\nDe Leon argued the $54 million that went to LAPD to police public transportation could have gone to social services such as mental health and outreach. Metro recently started a pilot program of 300 transit ambassadors to create a feeling of safety in numbers and help with customer service. The unarmed ambassadors are also supposed to help with de-escalation and maintenance. De Leon wishes Metro would have spent that $54 million to increase the number of ambassadors.\n\n\u201cThere is an ecosystem of services that can create actual safety in the system and also feelings of safety,\u201d De Leon said. According to De Leon, many people of color do not feel comfortable or safe with a police presence. She found that many of the people she interviewed would feel safer \u201chaving lights at bus stops than having police presence.\u201d\n\nDe Leon found that many of the arguments in support of police presence on public transportation are faulty or misinformed. One such argument is that recent reports show an increase in crime on the Metro, meaning public transportation needs more police. De Leon says this argument is misleading, since it is a comparison of statistics taken during COVID-19 when there were significantly less riders.\n\nArguments in favor for more policing also lie within an increase in overdoses on public transportation or at public transit stations. De Leon, again, says this argument is faulty. \u201cWe know that getting to the root of problems is really the best way to tackle some of these issues,\u201d De Leon said. \u201cAt the last Metro board meeting, folks were talking about an increase of overdoses that have happened on the system. And I think one of the board members, I believe Mayor Bass, said something that was extremely important to remember, which is that this is a public health issue.\u201d\n\nDe Leon emphasized the way to solve this public health issue is not by policing. \u201cWe know social services work and therefore we are calling for us to continue focusing and expanding those and really focus on the root causes so we can have a safer system,\u201d De Leon said.\n\nHowever, some people still would feel better having police presence on the metro. Thomas Dudek, who often uses public transportation to get to Santa Monica to go surfing, does not feel \u201ctoo secure\u201d on the metro. \u201cI think police officers are the best idea and the best solution for the problem,\u201d Dudek said. \u201cI think it can help with harassment and the homeless people that are using public transportation.\u201d\n\nDudek said he has never been a victim of harassment or a crime on the Metro, but is worried about the recent reports of an uptick of crimes on public transportation. While Lucas Rune \u2014 also a Metro regular \u2014 says he would feel comfortable with having police presence on the Metro, he thinks alternative methods to police officers for Metro safety would work as well.\n\n\u201cI think unarmed ambassadors could be a good way to make it safer,\u201d Rune said. \u201cI think they could try switching to an alternative approach since police officers are a scarce resource and they might be needed at other places more.\u201d\n\nMetro will now have to weigh all of the arguments and go into another contract with LAPD, or use alternative methods to look after the public transportation system.\n```"}

(Photo by Jennifer Laurent)\n\nBy Kassydi Rone, Peter Makk and Marco Ramirez\nMarch 02, 2023 at 7:18 pm PST\n\nA cohort of Black, female street vendors \u2014 Black Women Vend \u2014 come together every Wednesday evening at Leimert Park Village to host a community night market. Black Women Vend functions as both a service organization and a training program sponsored by the nonprofit, L.A. Legal Assistant. Black Women Vend offers free guidance for local food entrepreneurs to obtain the proper permits and business licenses necessary for street vending in Los Angeles.\n\nThis mission is spearheaded by Jennifer Laurent, a South L.A. resident of over 30 years, who wanted to make a change when she recognized the struggle of navigating the legalities of street vending. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to figure out the whole permitting process for street vendors because you have to go through so many different agencies,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cYou have to go through the state for a seller\u2019s permit, and then the city for a tax registration certificate and then to a different part of the city for a street vendor permit. And then when it comes to food vendors, there is no official permit for an individual street food vendor.\u201d\n\nOut of approximately 10,000 sidewalk street vendors in the city of L.A., less than 200 received permits, according to an August report by the UCLA School of Law Community Economic Development and Public Counsel. Many L.A. vendors operate outside of the law due to the complications of receiving permits, which subjects them to heavy fines, and sometimes, arrest. This disproportionately affects women of color \u2014 who make up 80% of L.A. street vendors \u2014 which is a problem that Black Women Vend aims to combat.\n\nThe Leimert Park Night Market provides participants of the Black Women Vend program a place to legally sell their food, so they can grow a customer base and earn money after completing their training. \u201cWe were doing pop-ups because we had so many issues with our building permits,\u201d said Genelle Brooks-Petty, owner of AllChill Hip Hop Ice Cream shop and member of the first Black Women Vend cohort. \u201cWe were looking for ways to connect with the community, let people know what we do, and that we were coming in brick-and-mortar form ... and I was approached by Jen. Just the wealth of knowledge that she has and the resources that [she] connects us to, it\u2019s been a really good experience.\u201d\n\nBlack Women Vend gives participating vendors access to resources such as agents and food business consultants, creating learning opportunities for business preparedness. Wholly Mother Vegan, another vendor from the first Black Women Vend cohort, expanded her brand presence and clientele over the past few months as a result. \u201cI\u2019m at Black Women Vend every Wednesday, and I\u2019m all over the city at different events. I\u2019m at the museum, I\u2019m at USC, I\u2019m all over now,\u201d said Loni Lightburn, owner of Wholly Mother Vegan. Lightburn hopes to operate a full franchise for vegan drive-thru restaurants in the next five to ten years.\n\nThe wide selection of vendors at the market provide a variety of food options for attendees. From comfort dinners to freshly made desserts, customers like Chrysalyn Byrd find the environment equal parts satisfying and inspiring. \u201cThere were a lot of things that I could relate to, and things I actually wanted to buy. My favorite part of the experience was Filthy Rich Banana Pudding. [Tanya Ward, the owner,] had amazing customer service. She let me sample all of the flavors and decide which one I wanted, and I definitely want some more of that pudding,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cIt made me want to open up a business and be a part of that Black excellence.\u201d\n\nVendors of the Black Women Vend program hosted a market for the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum during the first weekend of Black History Month. Most recently, members of the Angel City Football Club, L.A.\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team, visited and promoted the market via Instagram. \u201c[That was] huge for the women because there\u2019s no other way we would\u2019ve been able to get that kind of publicity and uplifting of the individual businesses without them,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cThe way people can support is by just coming out and supporting the market, purchasing food from the vendors. Leimert Park is a part of South L.A., and it is a food desert, so there\u2019s not always a lot of good options. But we have vegan choices, organic, cold-pressed juices, home cooked Jamaican food, just really good food.\u201d```"}

But it wasn\u2019t enough for Arizona to come close to UCLA\u2019s level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a team that can beat anybody in the country ... but then I\u2019ve seen the team that doesn\u2019t fight and is not cohesive ... and that\u2019s today against UCLA,\u201d Arizona Head Coach Adia Barnes said.\n\nThe next step for UCLA is the semifinal against No. 1 seed Stanford on Friday at 6 p.m. at Michelob Ultra Arena.

Members of the cast and crew viewed the first of ten new episodes alongside fans and loved ones in February at the Regency Village Theatre in Westwood. As audience members cheered for each character\u2019s initial appearance in the episode, it was evident that the show\u2019s success is largely due to the close-knit dynamic of the cast.\n\nEver since the series was initially released three years ago, the \u201cOuter Banks\u201d cast has developed a uniquely dedicated fan base. With the first season coming out during the peak of quarantine, viewers were trapped in their homes with copious amounts of time on their hands to binge the show repeatedly. Fans now feel a wave of nostalgia each time they hear featured songs such as \u201cWhere\u2019d All the Time Go?\u201d by Dr. Dog. The first verse of \u201cLeft Hand Free\u201d by alt-J transports Netflix viewers back to their times of isolation and, for some, loneliness.\n\n\u201cOuter Banks\u201d permitted fans to live vicariously through the adventures of John B and the rest of the Kooks, as they could not run anywhere farther than their neighborhoods. \u201cOuter Banks\u201d has been able to foster a fan base unique from most teen dramas in the past. The show has redefined fan culture within the television industry, especially with its interactive Poguelandia music festival event that closely followed the season premiere.\n\nIn the first episode of the third season, John B, Sarah, and their friends are stranded on a tropical island of bliss. At the music festival, Netflix recreated the care-free environment for fans to experience as if they were Kooks drinking coconuts by the sea. Madelyn Cline, Chase Stokes, Madison Bailey, Jonathan Daviss, Rudy Pankow, and other talent reunited at Huntington Beach to celebrate the release of the new season with fans. The event consisted of performances by The Nude Party, Surf Mesa, Elley Duh\u00e9, \u201cOuter Banks\u201d rite of passage, alt-J, Lil Baby and headliner, Khalid.\n\nCast members were seen interacting with fans throughout the day as they traversed through the festival grounds.

They were overwhelmed with excitement for the musical performances and to share pieces of the \u201cOuter Banks\u201d experience with their fans.\n\nPoguelandia was a fan-centered experience, with themed food trucks, American Eagle X OBX capsule collection merchandise and interactive experiences. From Kook Kove, a VIP area where actors gathered to answer interview questions, to John B\u2019s Twinkie as a photo opportunity, every aspect of the environment alluded to a detail within the show. Just as the series brought viewers to life during isolation, Netflix brought the care-free environment of Outer Banks to Huntington Beach.\n\nAttendees were immersed into the show as if they were Pogues navigating the sandy beaches of North Carolina. They obtained coconut juice from The Boneyard with stars Austin North and Drew Starkey. Viewers purchased American Eagle and Outer Banks-exclusive clothing from the Kildare Surf Shop. Fans passionately screamed the lyrics to \u201cYoung Dumb & Broke\u201d by Khalid alongside some of their favorite Pogues, Madison Bailey and Jonathan Daviss.\n\nThere was no better way to celebrate and promote the new season of \u201cOuter Banks\u201d than an immersion into Pogue life at Huntington Beach. Thoroughly detailed occasions like this strengthen the connection between viewers and their favorite series. \u201cOuter Banks\u201d truly redefined the experience of being a television series fan, and it would be intriguing to see how Netflix may take inspiration from Poguelandia for the promotion of its other programs.\n\nSeason three of \u201cOuter Banks\u201d is now available to stream on Netflix.\n```"}

Starr also encourages parents to read with their kids and she welcomes reading in any language.\n\nStarr: It\u2019s really important that parents read to their children and not just in English, that parents read to their children whatever languages are spoken at home. It\u2019s important that we as a society teach children, especially that reading means access.\n\n[Mccoy reading to kids] Rosero McCoy is finishing up the story he\u2019s reading to the kids. He has given them access. McCoy: the beauty of reading is something that you can get lost in and take you places that you may not ever get to travel to, you know, or people\u2019s experiences in life that really will help you. And when you take that time out to just read for yourself. I just think that the knowledge that comes from it is priceless. No matter what age, all of us can learn a thing or two from reading.\n```"}

But this isn\u2019t the first time the Golden State has experienced such extreme rainfall early in the calendar year. Some may see this increase in precipitation as a light at the end of the drought tunnel, but USC Professor of Earth Sciences Lowell Stott says we should stay wary.\n\nLowell Stott: I want to emphasize to you that we\u2019ve been in situations not unlike those before where we\u2019ve received a lot of precipitation early on in the water year and then the latter part of the water years turned out to be very dry. A water year, in comparison to the calendar year, starts every October 1st.\n\nClimate change warming is a prominent issue, and California continues to experience the heat of it. The snowpack accumulating over the past winter months is bound to melt fast due to high temperatures during the spring and summer seasons. And unfortunately, much of that precious water will not be available for Californians to use says Professor Stott.\n\nStott: We can\u2019t accommodate a really rapid runoff melt from these high elevations. We just don\u2019t have any place to put it, basically, if it all, all melts fast.\n\nSouthern California gets much of its water supply from the Colorado River, by way of Lake Mead. This conduit is currently in jeopardy. It has been experiencing very low levels of water. In early January, Lake Mead was only about one-quarter full! So low that it\u2019s only a few feet away from becoming an inactive reservoir.\n\nThe dwindling lake water is one of Southern California\u2019s biggest problems when it comes to having a stable source of water. USC tries to remind all students: please, be mindful of your water usage. And that will help some, but most of our water consumption in California goes to a surprising use, says USC\u2019s Professor Stott.\n\nStott: A large fraction of California\u2019s water goes to agriculture and it\u2019s really, really difficult to cut back on agricultural water use. California is a very big agricultural state and uses a lot of water.\n\nEven after the big storms of the last few weeks, the current drought won\u2019t be known until April. So USC and the California Department of Water Resources remind you: please, continue to monitor your water usage and practice water conservation.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Susan Nyirenda.\n```"}

The price reduction for its non-branded insulin is effective May 1, 2023. Cuts for Humalog, its most commonly prescribed insulin, and Humulin are effective Q4 2023. This price cap is only at participating retail pharmacies for consumers with commercial insurance. Those without insurance can download the Lilly Insulin Value Program savings card to receive Lilly insulins for $35 a month.\n\nIn a press release, CEO and Chair David A. Ricks commented on the company\u2019s changes.\n\nDavid A. Ricks (read by Spencer Cline): While the current healthcare system provides access to insulin for most people with diabetes, it still does not provide affordable insulin for everyone and that needs to change. The aggressive price cuts we\u2019re announcing today should make a real difference for Americans with diabetes.\n\nThe decisions made today effects diabetics like Nicole Barron, a USC student diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in May 2020. After Barron\u2019s diagnosis, she started a podcast called Your Diabetic Bestie to spread awareness about diabetes. After today\u2019s announcement, she\u2019s shocked.\n\nNicole Barron: It\u2019s crazy that it took this long to come up with this price cap, but just very grateful that we\u2019re making steps in the right direction.\n\nBarron is insured however it\u2019s not the case for millions of Americans. Today\u2019s cuts make Lilly the lowest list-priced mealtime insulin available. Before today, without insurance the average cost of traditional insulin was $455 and $249 for mixed insulin. These prices are disproportionate to the cost to manufacture insulin.\n\nFor those uninsured, this price cap could have a big affect. Barron: A vial is supposed to last about a month and if you drop it like I did that one time or you don\u2019t have insurance to get you another one, then it\u2019s like, okay, what can I do now? You know, it\u2019s like your life literally depends on it and if you don\u2019t have it, your body starts to hurt physically, it\u2019s aching.\n\nOver 34 million Americans have diabetes in a nation where health care is not a government granted industry.

{"key": "/2023/03/02/no-offseason-top-five-quarterback-battles-to-watch-as-college-football-spring-practices-commence/", "response": "```\nColumn No Offseason: Top five quarterback battles to watch as college football spring practices commence\n\nWith college football spring practices about to start up across the country, here are the top five quarterback battles to watch.\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d is a column by Adam Bradford discussing college football developments during the winter and spring months. Snow is beginning to melt. The days are getting longer. Winter is starting to turn into spring. And that can only mean one thing: College football spring practices will soon be upon us! Over the next couple of months, we will get to watch teams across the country as they take the field for the first time in preparation for the 2023 season. And while there will be playing time up for grabs at every position, no position battle gets as much of the spotlight as quarterback competitions do. So today, let\u2019s take a look at the top five quarterback competitions to watch during college football spring practices.\n\n5. UCLA: Ethan Garbers vs. Colin Schlee vs. Dante Moore\nDorian Thompson-Robinson, who appeared in 49 games for UCLA over the past five seasons, is officially out of college eligibility. And with it, the Bruins\u2019 starting quarterback job heading into their final season in the Pac-12 is officially up for grabs. Redshirt junior Ethan Garbers, Thompson-Robinson\u2019s backup last season, is still around and will push to win the starting job. Battling him, however, will be a pair of talented additions in redshirt senior Kent State transfer Colin Schlee and highly-touted freshman Dante Moore. Making UCLA\u2019s task of contending without Thompson-Robinson even more difficult is the fact that the rest of the Pac-12 is arguably the strongest quarterback conference in the entire country. With high-profile returnees such as USC\u2019s Caleb Williams and Utah\u2019s Cameron Rising on their schedule, UCLA better hope that whoever wins the starting job is up to the challenge if they want to compete for a conference title.\n\n4. Ohio State: Kyle McCord vs. Devin Brown\nThe Ryan Day era at Ohio State has been marked by stellar quarterback play. Next month, C.J. Stroud will likely become the second Buckeye signal-caller in three years to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft, following Justin Fields in 2021. Battling to replace Stroud will be redshirt sophomore Kyle McCord and redshirt freshman Devin Brown. McCord served as Stroud\u2019s backup last season, while Brown, a one-time USC commit, redshirted. Given the high level of quarterback play that Ohio State has had in recent years, whichever QB emerges as the starter will immediately have high expectations placed on their shoulders. In addition, he will have the unenviable task of ending the Buckeyes\u2019 two-game losing streak to archrival Michigan, a team that Stroud never defeated during his time in Columbus.\n\n3. Georgia: Carson Beck vs. Brock Vandagriff vs. Gunner Stockton\nAfter a decorated 12-year college career (kidding, it was only six) capped off with back-to-back national championships, legendary Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett IV is off to the NFL. Hence, the starting QB job for the two-time defending champs is officially up for grabs. Battling for that role will be a trio of former highly-touted recruits: redshirt junior Carson Beck, redshirt sophomore Brock Vandagriff and redshirt freshman Gunner Stockton. After serving as Bennett\u2019s backup last season, Beck is the early favorite to win the job. However, we cannot count out Vandagriff, a more mobile option who was a top-20 player in the class of 2021. It should be noted that in addition to a new starting quarterback, the Bulldogs will be breaking in a new offensive coordinator in 2023. Following the departure of Todd Monken to the Baltimore Ravens, Head Coach Kirby Smart promoted analyst Mike Bobo to be the team\u2019s new play caller.\n\n2. Alabama: Jalen Milroe vs. Ty Simpson\nFor the past seven seasons, Alabama has enjoyed the benefit of having stellar quarterback play. Jalen Hurts was replaced by Tua Tagovailoa, who was followed by Mac Jones, who then passed the torch on to Bryce Young. But with Young moving on to the pros, the Crimson Tide have a major question mark at the QB position. The early favorite to win the starting job for 2023 is Young\u2019s backup from last season, redshirt sophomore Jalen Milroe. A true dual-threat, Milroe would bring an element to the running game that Alabama has not had since Hurts was under center. However, some Tide fans believe Milroe is too limited as a passer, and have been clamoring for redshirt freshman Ty Simpson. A gifted arm talent, Simpson would look to continue the style of quarterback play that Alabama has had in recent years with Tagovailoa, Jones and Young. Much like at Georgia, whoever winds up winning the job will be working with a new offensive coordinator. After Bill O\u2019Brien left Tuscaloosa for the New England Patriots, Head Coach Nick Saban replaced him by hiring Notre Dame offensive coordinator Tommy Rees.\n\n1. Texas: Quinn Ewers vs. Arch Manning\nNormally, when an underachieving program has a mediocre season marked by inconsistent quarterback play, it does not get too much of the national spotlight. In this case, however, it is arguably the biggest storyline in college football this spring. So why is that, exactly? Well, there are three main reasons: 1. This is the University of Texas that we are talking about. Everything is bigger here, including the spotlight. 2. The incumbent starter who struggled last season is redshirt sophomore Quinn Ewers, one of the highest-rated quarterback recruits of all time, whose bizarre journey to Austin could be its own entire column. 3. The biggest challenger to Ewers\u2019 role as the starter is a five-star true freshman whose name just so happens to be Arch Manning. Hailing from the legendary Manning family of quarterbacks, Arch is hoping to write his own legacy at a Texas program that has been struggling to return to the top of the sport after over a decade of underwhelming results. When you factor all of that in, it seems safe to say that the eyes of the nation will be upon Texas this spring.\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}

Mid-majors are the most widely misunderstood teams each year in March Madness. Often coming with the stigma that \u201cthey don\u2019t play anyone good,\u201d the teams frequently succeed in the tournament \u2014 Gonzaga and Houston both reached the Final Four in 2021. Rather than writing off any team that doesn\u2019t play in a Power Six conference, let\u2019s look at four of the best mid-majors and how they stack up against the rest of the field.\n\nQuick fourth wall break: I\u2019m not talking about the No. 1 Houston Cougars in this article. They are currently the betting favorite to win the title, and most people can admit they are an elite team this year. Anyways:\n\nNo. 10 Gonzaga (25-5)\nGonzaga is actually having a down year in 2022 despite being projected to be a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament. In the last three NCAA tournaments, the Bulldogs were a No. 1 seed, boasting future NBA lottery picks throughout the roster. The team is much different than years prior \u2014 with the loss of center Chet Holmgren, senior forward Drew Timme has had to start at the center position. Timme is not a great rim protector, and head coach Mark Few has had to compensate for the loss of an outstanding big. Gonzaga employs a three-quarter court press most possessions in order to delay teams offensively. When teams run pick and rolls, the defender not being screened double-teams the ball handler to force them to the sidelines. Both are smart coaching moves to prevent teams from running their traditional offense and force them into quick shots. The team is elite offensively, par for the course of recent Gonzaga teams. They lead the nation in scoring and rank No. 1 in KenPom\u2019s offensive efficiency. Timme and junior guard Julian Strawther are elite, experienced scorers who can carry the team in March. The major worry for Gonzaga is facing teams with great ball handlers who will attack their press and score easy points. That combined with an off shooting night could spell an early exit in March Madness.\n\nNo. 17 Saint Mary\u2019s (25-6)\nSaint Mary\u2019s is the exact opposite of Gonzaga. Contrasting the Bulldogs lighting quick offense, Saint Mary\u2019s ranks 359th in KenPom\u2019s adjusted tempo, fifth slowest in the country. Going along with this, the Gaels have one of the stingiest defenses in the nation. They are No. 5 and No. 10 in the country in points and field goals allowed per game. They produce these numbers with physical on-ball defense that forces teams into difficult, contested shots. Offensively, the team is led by two guards: fifth year Logan Johnson and freshman Aidan Maheny. Johnson is a speedy slasher who might be the best guard in the country at getting downhill to the basket. Maheny doesn\u2019t play like a freshman and is a gifted three level scorer who will be relied on in the clutch. Both guards are the catalysts to an offense full of driving to the basket and kicking it out to players cutting from the perimeter. Saint Mary\u2019s looks like a team that may be underseeded in the March Madness bracket. Even though they are projected to be a five seed, the Gaels rank sixth in the NET rankings. Saint Mary\u2019s looks poised to make a run.\n\nNo. 18 San Diego State (23-5)\nThe Aztecs are a team tailor-made for a second weekend in March Madness this year and will be a tough out for any team. The roster is full of experience as, in conference play, their rotation has consisted of only upperclassmen. Head coach Brian Dutcher has led the program to six consecutive seasons with at least 20 wins. The Aztecs are also 8-2 in road games. Usually known for their stout defense, this year\u2019s team is no different. The Aztecs are No. 14 in defensive efficiency this year according to KenPom. The deep, experienced roster is full of defensive stoppers, and they allow the lowest field goal percentage, three point percentage and points per game in the Mountain West Conference. Offensively, the team is capable of competing with most high-powered offenses. Senior guards Matt Bradley and Darrion Trimmel have been the two go-to guys for the Aztecs this year, but due to the unselfish nature of their offense, any player can lead the team in scoring in any game. The Aztecs should break their two year streak of losing in the first round of March Madness.\n\nBoise State (23-7)\nRight behind the Aztecs in the Mountain West are the Boise State Broncos with a similarly elite defense. The Broncos are top-heavy with their scoring and run a shallow rotation, but they are still No. 2 in the Mountain West in scoring. Redshirt senior guard Max Rice and sophomore forward Tyson Degenhart are a great scoring duo who are both shooting at least 40% in conference play. Down the stretch, the Broncos also turn to fifth year guard Marcus Shaver Jr., who is known by fans as \u201cBig Shot Shave\u201d. Boise State\u2019s issues will come if they deal with foul trouble early, as they lack the depth to win consistently without a few starters. I think the Broncos could be out in the first round, but their defense should keep them in games.\n\nThat was a lot of writing. When we as college basketball fans make our brackets, let\u2019s give serious thought to mid-major teams being serious threats to make runs in the tournament. This should help us get over the confirmation bias we receive from networks like ESPN and Fox Sports, and the college basketball fandom as a whole, leaving us with better brackets. \u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

From riding the bench at previous schools to battling through serious ankle injuries, the graduate guard didn\u2019t even know if she would play one more year of college basketball. But she decided to forgo medical school, at least for the time being. Now, she has finally found a home with the Trojans.\n\n\u201cI told [USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb] I don\u2019t even know if I want to play basketball, but I\u2019m willing to take a chance,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cI for sure made the right decision.\u201d\n\nLittleton, playing high school basketball in San Diego, originally signed to play for USC back in high school, but after former head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke resigned in 2017, Littleton requested a release from her National Letter of Intent.\n\n\u201cIt was tough, I knew I wanted to stay home for the most part,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cI was ready to go and then the head coach got let go literally two months before I was about to come to campus. I asked for my release, I was just kind of distraught. I didn\u2019t really understand too much of what was going on.\u201d\n\nLittleton had placed her trust in Cooper-Dyke and USC, but that trust was broken.\n\n\u201cAt that time as a kid, I really had trust issues and I felt like that was just another barrier,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cI was like, okay, well, you trust a program, you trust the coach, and then it kind of all tumbles down.\u201d\n\nThe highly-ranked recruit was then forced to find a new school, just a few short months before the school year started. That\u2019s when Littleton decided to trust Texas. She spent her first two collegiate years down in Austin, but only started twelve games despite winning the California Gatorade Player of the Year award during her senior year of high school.\n\nAlthough Littleton placed her trust in that program, Texas could not give her what she needed.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot trying to choose a different school. I didn\u2019t want to go through the process of recruitment again. And so I kind of just took word for word and, \u2018hey, I trust this person at this school, [let\u2019s] try it out,\u2019\u201d Littleton said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I don\u2019t regret any decisions that I make, but I would definitely say that it was a learning experience. I made a decision at the time because I was just overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nLittleton had already signed with two schools. She had already placed her trust in two different programs. But she found another opportunity with a school who had been recruiting her since middle school: the University of South Carolina.\n\n\u201cAfter I was already in college and done spent two years, I was more mature. I understand what I wanted, what I needed,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cI knew that I could become a better person and a better player if I committed there. And that\u2019s essentially what I did.\u201d\n\nDue to the old NCAA transfer rules, Littleton had to sit out a year. She took that time to get surgery and recover from injuries in both her ankles. During her recovery, COVID-19 hit. Littleton couldn\u2019t even trust how the world around her worked anymore.\n\nAfter her third year of collegiate ball, Littleton had seen the court in a total of 41 games and knew it was make-or-break time for her career. She could give up and pursue her career dreams, or she could continue to hone her craft on the court.\n\n\u201cEspecially in my position, I needed to be on the court every single day \u2014 if I was able to go, I needed to be on there,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cAnd I felt like I didn\u2019t want some COVID scare or tracing to prevent me from doing that. And so I really cut off a lot of extracurriculars and friends and going out to dinner and all this other stuff.\u201d\n\nDespite Littleton\u2019s efforts, she still got contact-traced twice, forcing her to sit out. Basketball was her life, and it was being taken away from her.\n\nWhen she came back for her redshirt-sophomore season, she again did not start for the Gamecocks. Coming off the bench, she averaged 2.6 points per game in the two years she played at South Carolina.\n\nLittleton, though, became something in her final season at South Carolina that few people get to claim. She became a national champion.\n\n\u201cGoing through the parade process and finally living out a dream that I\u2019ve had since I was a little kid, it means a lot,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cJust seeing my ring up there and just being able to look back and say I\u2019ve accomplished a lot of things and national champion is one of them.\u201d\n\nAfter that season ended, something clicked. Littleton no longer trusted her ability to go professional. She almost gave up. But then, she and Gottlieb talked. Littleton took that chance to come back home and play in the second year of Gottlieb\u2019s head coaching tenure at USC.\n\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s in California, and really nationally, knew Destiny Littleton for her ability to score and all her accolades,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI was like, \u2018gosh, I wonder if she would ever want to come home\u2019 ... We pulled out all the stops to get her because I knew how important she could be for us.\u201d\n\nGottlieb was right. Littleton is leading USC in assists and total minutes played by a whopping 160 minutes over the second leading player this season. She\u2019s never had to play this many minutes since high school but credits her former coach at South Carolina, Dawn Staley, for preparing her for the moment.\n\nGottlieb believes Littleton\u2019s impact goes beyond what she does with the basketball on the court.\n\n\u201cI would say her most important [contribution] would be her leadership and high IQ, I mean, she\u2019s coming from a national championship program,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cHer insights are so respected on the team.\u201d\n\nLittleton is a floor general on the court, yelling directions at her teammates to make sure they are always at the right place. While that may seem jarring to fans and spectators, her teammates look to her on and off the court for guidance.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like a sister, a big sister. She\u2019s a very generous person, she cares a lot,\u201d freshman guard Aaliyah Gayles said. \u201cHaving somebody to look up to, just play basketball with, talk to, ask for advice \u2014 she\u2019s always looking out for you.\u201d\n\nNow Littleton is poised to lead the Trojans into March Madness, despite losing in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament. But beyond just this year, Littleton has found that trust again. She regained trust in herself to make it to the pro level, even if she does not want to think about it just yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reflecting and, just wow, [the end] is finally here and what am I going to do? I don\u2019t even want to think about that because we\u2019re not trained to think about anything other than basketball,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to play professionally, whether that be in the WNBA or overseas. And do I have a plan other than basketball? Probably not.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a plan, but Littleton does trust she will be able to come up with something to do after basketball. One thing she knows she will not be doing: coaching.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Littleton said. But then she backtracked just a little bit. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nLittleton\u2019s not too interested in thinking about the future just yet, though. Her mind is on the here and now. It\u2019s on the NCAA tournament. It\u2019s on going back-to-back. From one SC to another, Littleton will try to bring another national championship back to Southern California.\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Wendi Lu\nMarch 02, 2023 at 2:42 pm PST\n\nUSC\u2019s first shot of the night wedgied on the rim, an ominous sign that would precede a Trojan defeat. USC lost 56-48 to Oregon State in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament Wednesday night at Michelob ULTRA Arena in Las Vegas. The No. 6 seed Trojans came up short as the highest ranking they\u2019ve been since their Pac-12 Tournament championship in 2014.\n\nGraduate forward Kadi Sissoko contributed 16 points, and graduate guard Destiny Littleton put up 12 points. Sophomore forward Rayah Marshall had 11 rebounds but fouled out with 1:53 to go in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to beat a team three times. Oregon State executed their game plan and we didn\u2019t execute ours at all.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans let their first half lead slip. USC struggled to find the bucket in the first quarter as the team shot 26.7% from the field. The Beavers had better aim, shooting 38.5%. Still, USC managed to stay ahead 22-21 at the end of the first half.\n\nAs the game progressed, the Trojans\u2019 disadvantage started to reveal itself \u2014 the offense was not up to speed with the Beavers\u2019 defense. In the third quarter, redshirt sophomore Jelena Mitrovic tied the score up at 26-26 with 7:43 to go. Sissoko wrapped up the third quarter with two layups after the Trojans\u2019 forced turnovers, allowing USC to lead by three.\n\nThis built up to the Trojan\u2019s largest lead of the game at 43-35 in the fourth quarter when junior guard Kayla Williams and graduate guard Okako Adika both hit 3-pointers. The lead could not save USC from a defensive collapse \u2014 a surprising turn of events given the team\u2019s defensive prowess this season.\n\nOn the offensive end, the Trojans coughed up the ball on their late possessions, allowing the Beavers to build up an 11-0 rally.\n\n\u201cWe were pretty undisciplined with our shot selection,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cOregon State had a game plan defensively. It\u2019s not one I haven\u2019t seen before, but we played right into their hands by taking some early not-so-great shots. For the most part, I thought the way we played on offense was not how we practiced this week. And it was unfortunate because you can\u2019t win that way.\u201d\n\nUSC was reliant on 3-pointers \u2014 nearly 44% of the scoring came from beyond the arc. But the Beavers overpowered the Trojans in every other area, including 19 points from free throws and 13 points off of forced turnovers. On the other hand, USC\u2019s eight free-throw attempts marked a season low.\n\nWithout Marshall on the floor for the last two minutes, the Trojans fell apart. With 26 ticks left on the clock, Williams hit a 3-pointer to cut USC\u2019s deficit to two. However, the glimpse of hope did not save the Trojans, as the Beavers hit their free throws and got stops down the stretch to close the game out.\n\n\u201cI wholeheartedly believe that we do have more basketball to go,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cIn particular, this game, we were playing like individuals too much of the game and it came back to bite us.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, the Trojans await the 2023 NCAA tournament bracket reveal, which will be announced March 12.\n```"}

It\u2019s been a long time since the Pac-12 had this much coaching talent. The Pac-12 has some of the brightest minds and best leaders in college football. But who are the best five coaches in the conference? You could make a case that more than half the coaches in the conference deserve consideration to be in the top five. However, these five coaches are the best of the best:\n\n5. Kalen DeBoer, Washington\nWashington Huskies head coach Kalen DeBoer has already put himself in the top five after his first season in the conference. DeBoer and Oregon State head coach Jonathan Smith were co-Pac-12 coaches of the year this past season. In his first season with Washington, DeBoer went 11-2 and won the Alamo bowl. DeBoer also did one of the best coaching development jobs of the season with Michael Penix Jr. DeBoer and Penix Jr. first worked together in 2019 when DeBoer was Indiana\u2019s offensive coordinator and Penix Jr. was the Hoosier\u2019s starting quarterback. Penix dealt with several severe injuries during his career at Indiana, including two ACL tears, and in 2021 it looked like his career was on the verge of ending. However, he transferred to Washington and became one of the best players in the country. Penix Jr. threw for 31 touchdowns and 4,641 yards, the second most in the FBS. This wasn\u2019t the first time DEBoer made a quarterback into a superstar. During his brief tenure as the head coach of Fresno State, he molded Washington transfer Jake Haener into a legitimate player who is expected to get drafted in the upcoming NFL draft. DeBoer also won three NAIA championships in five years as the head coach at Sioux Falls. DeBoer knows how to win, and his offensive tactics are among the best in the game. This coaching hire was a slam dunk by Washington athletic director Jennifer Cohen.\n\n4. Dan Lanning, Oregon\nAnother first-year head coach makes the list. Former Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning was superb in his first season as the Ducks\u2019 head coach. In 2021, he led one of the most memorable defensive units in college football history and helped Georgia win a national title. He didn\u2019t have anything close to Georgia\u2019s talent in Eugene but made do with what he had, and Oregon became one of the best defenses in the conference. Lanning went 10-3 and beat UNC in the Holiday Bowl. Lanning also had the first offensive coordinator he picked, Kenny Dillingham, get hired to become the head coach at Arizona State. Dillingham\u2019s hire is a very telling sign, as it\u2019s infrequent for a first-year head coach to have a coordinator become a head coach in college football. Lanning also made great use of the transfer portal as he recruited former Auburn starting quarterback Bo Nix, who became one of college football\u2019s premiere quarterbacks. Nix opted to stay for a fifth year since he gained an extra year of eligibility from COVID-19. As a second-year head coach, I fully expect Lanning to be competing for a Pac-12 championship next year.\n\n3. Chip Kelly, UCLA\nThis will be the one I get hate from in my Twitter feed. But let\u2019s face the facts: Chip Kelly is the only coach in the Pac-12 to have coached in a college football championship and for an NFL team. The NFL argument holds less weight since it\u2019s college coaches I am ranking, but he did win a division championship and had two ten-win seasons. So the fact that he had at least some success gives him an edge over other coaches. While at UCLA, Kelly recently had success and started recruiting at a high rate. Kelly has never been the most prominent recruiter; his classes have always been mediocre. However, he is exceptional at developing talent. Even during his glory days at Oregon, he never had a top-10 recruiting class. But in terms of his keen ability to find talent and get the most out of them, I have to put him at three on the list. Even with what he did with outgoing UCLA senior quarterback and NFL prospect Dorian Thompson-Robinson has been sensational. After a miserable first two seasons as a starter, Kelly guided Thompson-Robinson to college stardom and helped him become UCLA\u2019s all-time passing yard leader. This was a remarkable coaching job with a player who only a few people believed could find success in college. Kelly will now be paired with one of the best, if not the best, 2023 quarterback prospects, as Dante Moore will be a Bruin next season. Moore has legitimate potential to be a first-round pick in the NFL draft if he lives up to the possibility that he possesses. Kelly is on the brink of bringing UCLA to where he once had Oregon.\n\n2. Kyle Whittingham, Utah\nOne of the winningest coaches in Pac-12 history and possible college football Hall of Famer, Kyle Whittingham, comes in at number two. Whittingham has been at Utah since 2004 as the head coach and has been a coach at the university since 1994. He had huge shoes to fill after replacing college football legend Urban Mayer who bolted for Florida after two seasons with the Utes. Whittingham has been the best hire the program has ever made. He has turned them into one of the premiere teams in college football. He helped lead them to a Pac-12 championship this season after upsetting USC in the title game. He is also one of the most intelligent defensive minds in the nation. Whittingham is known for his shutdown defenses, which always find a way to win the game. This is a big season for him, as a national championship would cement his legacy as an all-time great.\n\n1. Lincoln Riley, USC\nThis is an absolute no-brainer, as Lincoln Riley has made three college football playoffs in his first six years as a head coach. While all three did occur during his five years as the head coach of Oklahoma, he was one win away in his first year at USC. Riley rarely loses, exactly why he is one of the best and on pace to be an all-time coaching legend. He\u2019s gone 66-13 in six years as a head coach. Riley has produced three Heisman winners: Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray at Oklahoma and Caleb Williams at USC. He also had one runner-up, Jalen Hurts, who just took the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl. Riley is an offensive wizard and probably the country\u2019s best quarterback whisperer. His current starter at USC, Caleb Williams, is the projected favorite to be the first overall pick in the 2024 draft. If Riley wins a national title in the next few years, we can pencil him as a first-ballot college football Hall of Famer.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

In an online seminar dubbed \u201cCelebrating Trailblazers and their Stories\u201d Folt pointed to the successes of women in sports like Billie Jean King, Barbara Hedges and Allyson Felix. Hedges grew the number of women\u2019s sports teams at USC from five to 12 since starting in 1973 \u2013\u2013 the same year Congress enacted Title IX. Title IX, a landmark federal rights law, prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or educational program that receives federal funding.\n\n\u201cWe celebrate Women\u2019s History Month as a diverse range of accomplishments, perspectives, and experiences of women around the world, in the United States and here at USC,\u201d Monique Allard, Interim Vice President for Student Affairs said. \u201cWe honor all we have overcome, achieved and continue to work towards as women.\u201d\n\nSince the passing of Title IX, the USC women\u2019s sports teams have achieved 36 national team championship titles and 91 NCAA Individual Female champions. USC has also produced 149 female olympians including Allyson Felix, the most decorated track and field athlete in Olympic history and the namesake of USC\u2019s main track field. Folt applauded Felix in her speech, calling the trailblazing athlete \u201ca proud Trojan and a national voice for women in sports, maternity rights and women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nAt 32 weeks pregnant, doctors diagnosed Felix with a severe preeclampsia \u2013 a potentially life-threatening, pregnancy-related complication,  according to the CDC.  Felix\u2019s attentiveness to health and fitness helped doctors detect the condition early \u2013 a potentially life saving action. The Olympic gold medalist has since joined the CDC\u2019s Hear Her campaign to educate women about the urgent warning signs of pregnancy-related complications.\n\nDr. Endesha Ida Mae Holland was a playwright in residence at the School of Dramatic Arts and biography professor in Dornsife, who paved the way for the first joint-appointment between a college and professional school. Folt described Holland as \u201ca trailblazer for women in higher ed, including me.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Folt continued to highlight accomplished female students at USC such Amani Ghonim, Lt. Margaret Dante and Lt. Lindsey Evans. Ghonim was the first ever female chief engineer behind the student-designed race car in USC racing history. Lt. Dante and Lt. Evans are proud Trojans who were members of the all-female naval aviation team at the Super Bowl pre-game flyover.\n\n\u201cEveryday, women everywhere and here at USC are changing the ways things are done,\u201d Folt said. Folt touted the historical strides women have made in recent years, but acknowledged that roadblocks remain. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of progress since Title IX passed, but our work doesn\u2019t stop here. Today\u2019s challenges may look a bit different but at their core the challenges remain the same,\u201d Folt said. \u201cThey\u2019re all about ensuring women at USC and everywhere have access, inclusion, respect and voice.\u201d\n\nSome featured guest speakers at the event commended their loved ones for paving the way. Donna Elliot, vice dean for medical education at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said her mother broke barriers as a Black woman in the world of business and healthcare. \u201cShe showed me how not to be afraid of a challenge, how to work hard and how to do the right thing even if you\u2019re not recognized or rewarded as others are,\u201d Elliot said. The licensed physician said she learned from her mother how to work twice as hard to receive equal recognition amid \u201climits\u201d based on gender and race.\n\n\u201cHearing my mother\u2019s words daily, I strive to always work hard, think out of the box and to strive for excellence in all that I do,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cI hope that women can be recognized as the leaders, the scholars and the trailblazers that we are.\u201d\n\nUSC hopes to echo Elliot\u2019s calling through a packed slate of celebrations throughout the month. On Thursday, the University will be hosting the 2023 USC Women\u2019s Conference, which aims to bring together women, nonbinary and transgender people of all ages and backgrounds to inspire positive change in their personal lives. The university hopes to empower women in workplaces historically dominated by men. In 2019,  USC Viterbi achieved gender parity  in its entering class. In 2021, USC Marshall, achieved  gender parity for the first time ever.  The University hopes to expand on that progress in a March 7 conversation between the USC Center for the Political Future and  Martha Escuita , a former California legislator and first woman to chair the Assembly and Senate Judiciary Committees.\n\nAt the end of the month, USC hopes to wrap up Women\u2019s History Month with an inspiring message for young students in the L.A. area. On March 25, high school girls from LAUSD schools will have the opportunity to meet with influential women in politics and business to cultivate community engagement and public service on USC campus.\n```"}

The training exercise was held from 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in four different parts of the campus, including the Bovard Auditorium and Tutor Campus Center Courtyard, where students normally go to eat, rest and study.\n\nOlivia Cookman, a sophomore majoring in public relations, was troubled by the presence of the Police and the dogs. \u201cThis is not a police training ground, this is a college campus,\u201d Cookman said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to come to learn and feel comfortable and safe, and having police officers here, and training happening, is kind of distracting from our studies.\u201d\n\nNya Manneh, a sophomore majoring in communication, said she was surprised and somewhat worried when she saw the warning signs about the training. They were more alarming to her than the training itself. \u201cWalking around and seeing [the signs], I was taken back a little bit,\u201d Manneh said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really see any of it happening, but I was just a little curious and a little worried, I guess, just because I\u2019m a Black person. I was just interested in why it had to be here.\u201d\n\nEric Lambkins II, a master\u2019s student majoring in specialized journalism, said he was happy when he heard there were dogs on campus but held back when he realized they were K9 police dogs. \u201cI\u2019ve been chased by police dogs, so I kind of stood back and was just observing what was going on,\u201d Lambkins said. \u201cI have mixed emotions about it. I understand they need [it] for real world training, not only for the canines, but for the officers as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, as a student, I prefer not to be a guinea pig without my consent,\u201d Lambkins added.\n\nCampus groups such as Reimagine Public Safety and USC Abolition have been pushing back against police presence on campus, often using the hashtag #PoliceFreeUSC on their social media posts to speak about unfair policing of students and residents by DPS.\n\nRalph Roseli, a sergeant in training at DPS, said they are hosting the event on USC campus because they work closely with the LAPD and want the scent dogs to get used to the campus in case of emergencies. Roseli also pointed out that bringing the dogs while students were around was a way to showcase them as a resource.\n\n\u201cThis training is an opportunity to see what this resource is and why it would be worthwhile for us to have it ourselves,\u201d Roseli said.\n\nRoseli said that USC is thinking about university safety, and they are willing to talk with anyone who has questions about this process. He said that the university wants to be prepared and prevent any dangerous situations that could happen on campus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to ensure that we\u2019re prepared, and we\u2019re building relationships that will help us serve the community,\u201d Roseli said. \u201cWe want to put ourselves in a position to field questions, to just have conversations about what it is we\u2019re doing, why we are doing it, and what\u2019s the value,\u201d Roseli added. \u201cAnd of course, to listen to any sort of critique that may come back.\u201d```"}

It\u2019s a good feeling, isn\u2019t it? Now what if I told you Google gets that same feeling in under a second?\n\nBy Haylee Clophus March 01, 2023 at 6:25 pm PST\n\nGoogle Assistant, similar to Apple\u2019s Siri, is an always accessible assistant ready to answer all your questions, and fulfill your needs. This software recently has gotten new updates, which now allows Google Assistant to also be able to recognize music samples. Producers have been able flip cut and change samples so much in the past that the original audio was unrecognizable. Now though, your Google Assistant can uncover samples that are even less than a second long. This technology could become a problem for smaller artists or producers who use samples, making the what once was unrecognizable now quickly revealed by the AI. This brings in the issue of royalties, and owner\u2019s rights when artists want to use material from already existing music.\n\nStudent film major and rising musician Autumn Bryant shared her thoughts on the matter. BRYANT:\u201dI think that so much of the magic of using samples was the fact that a lot of times listeners couldn\u2019t recognize that it was a sample or what the song was from.. Producers would cut or stretch or tone down different songs to sample them, and a lot of times it would just go unnoticed.\u201d Bryant claims that the science of sample digging is an intimate process and is not something that can be easily accredited to via Ai. BRYANT :\u201dI feel like now in 2023, lets say someone made a song and it was a sample... I feel like the internet would go crazy, like oh this isn\u2019t even original.. Versus just listening to the sample itself and taking it in and appreciating it and then potentially figuring out that it was manipulated.\u201d Bryant also expressed an interest for the future of music as well. BRYANT: \u201cIt definitely changes the fun for the artists, I dont think its gonna make the people appreciate the music less, hopefully not, but I do think itll definitely change that kind of experience for the musician. I\u2019m going to be interested to see how artists or different record labels use the Ai in terms of sampling, I\u2019m not too savvy when it comes to AI and the sampling verse right now, so I think it will be interesting to see how it affects the music industry.\u201d\n\nThis AI is new on the block and already shaking the music industry. Music is constantly evolving and with this new technology we should be expecting even more changes to come in the near future! For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Haylee Clophus.\n```"}

(Photo by Philip Salata)\n\nBy Kamyar Moradi and Daniel Palmore\nMarch 01, 2023 at 6:14 pm PST\n\nHuge gusts of wind left vendors at the Trojan Farmers Market holding on for dear life. Over the last few days, the USC community has had to adjust to the unusual winter for Los Angeles that has brought in strong winds and heavy rainstorms. The farmers market runs on campus every Wednesday, and this week vendors have felt the effects of the unusual weather with signs, clothes, and other items being knocked over.\n\nVendors including Esteban Aldana, a small business owner who sells tamales, were surprised by the impact of the unusual cold and rainy weather. \u201cEvery year we try to prepare a little for the slow season,\u201d Aldana said. \u201cThis year did hit us kind of unexpectedly. As far as preparations go, we didn\u2019t know the rain and wind would be so heavy.\u201d\n\nAldana has been operating his tamale business \u201cMe Gusta Gourmet Tamales\u201d at USC for around six years with the goal of providing students with unique-tasting tamales. Aldana has been in business since 1995 and when he is not at USC, he sets up shop in San Fernando.\n\nThe weather dampened student turnout, making it tougher for businesses to serve enough customers to turn a profit. \u201cFood traffic is very important for a business like ours,\u201d Aldana said. \u201cAt the farmers market, we want as many people and as many eyes as possible, not to necessarily buy at first glance, but to provide variety and something that students are not used to.\u201d\n\nThe farmers market wasn\u2019t the only thing affected by the rain. Animation activities that take place at the School of Cinematic Arts have become more difficult for Jones to attend because of the weather as well. \u201cI don\u2019t have an umbrella, so it\u2019s been a little rough on me,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen I have to walk across campus, I still end up kind of wet. So that\u2019s kind of a bummer when that happens.\u201d\n\nMadeline Wu, also a senior animation student, said her health has been affected during this lengthy stretch of inclement weather. \u201cI have an umbrella, but it\u2019s rusty and kind of broken so I don\u2019t go outside very much,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI also got sick last week maybe because of the weather and stuff. I\u2019ve been healthy for a while, but it\u2019s just annoying.\u201d\n\nDespite the harsh weather conditions, Aldana still encourages people to go out if they are able to and support any small businesses they can. \u201cIf you can, just get out there and enjoy the markets,\u201d Aldana said. \u201cThe markets are a great time to get to know your vendors and have a good time.\u201d\n\nAustin Li, a student vendor at the market and arts and technology student, has also missed out on sales from low student turnout on the windy day. Li\u2019s business, Trojan Bins, sells affordable clothing that caps out at around $30 for students and visitors at the weekly market. Lately, the wind has been knocking over Li\u2019s clothing racks and making it harder to keep his stall standing upright. \u201cPeople talk about the rain but they don\u2019t talk about the wind,\u201d Li said. \u201cThe wind is what\u2019s knocking everything over. We try to have around two to three people set things up, but everything just falls apart. It\u2019s just been difficult.\u201d\n\nLi has used tents to help with preventing items from being knocked over and even has to put out more clothes than usual to keep the tents up. Despite the difficulties, having multiple friends help Li run the business has made the process of adjusting to the weather easier. \u201cAs soon as you have one or two teammates by your side, it clears the air,\u201d Li said. \u201cI think all it takes is just a little push to get things started.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Mia Thompson March 01, 2023 at 6:07 pm PST\n\nBoasting an impressive history of star-studded performances, the Troubadour is often a launchpad for artists looking to make it big. This Friday, five USC students are planning for take-off from their first self-produced concert at the iconic club. Named one of the best rock clubs in America by Rolling Stone Magazine, the \u201cTroub\u201d has been praised as the \u201ckey to L.A.\u2019s late Sixties rock explosion and the glam-metal scene of the Eighties.\u201d In the same place where Elton John made his U.S. debut in the \u201870s, the stage has since hosted performances by iconic artists such as Bob Dylan, Guns N\u2019 Roses and Harry Styles.\n\nThe 303, a concert taking place on March 3, will feature a three-artist lineup of up-and-coming artists Lorelei Marcell, Magnus Ferrell and Indie-rocker band the Runarounds. The 303 is the brainchild of USC students Ashley Taylor, Laurellei Marple, Madi Ingrassia, John Thornton and Katherine Loose, who are taking a live music production and promotion class at the USC Thornton School of Music. What started as a group project became something much bigger when the group of five made the ambitious decision to book the Troubadour.\n\nNestled between buildings on an unsuspecting sidewalk off of Santa Monica Boulevard, the West Hollywood club has been a platform for artists since 1957. Notable performers throughout the years include Johnny Cash, Tom Petty, Ringo Starr, Stevie Nicks, Greta Van Fleet, Billie Eilish, Lizzy McAlpine, FINNEAS, Jacob Collier and John Mayer, to name just a few. Comedian John Mulaney even reopened the club following the pandemic with 15 nights of performances.\n\nWith its rich music history, capacity to fit a sizable crowd and \u201cintimate, organic feel,\u201d group member and USC student Thornton said the Troubadour was at first an attractive idea, but one that seemed out of reach. \u201cWhen we first started talking about our show as a group, the Troubadour was being thrown around as an idea,\u201d Marple said. \u201cWe were like, that would be insane if that happened.\u201d\n\nThe concert is being produced entirely out of pocket, so the decision to book the venue is a financial risk for the group of five. But for these students who are bent on breaking into the music industry, it was worth it to \u201cgo big or go home,\u201d Thornton said. Ultimately, the decision came down to how much the group was willing to risk for their artists. \u201cWe really wanted to pick artists that we thought deserved to have this turning point in their career,\u201d Marple said. \u201cSo a lot of that fell on, are we risking this for the artists and do they deserve it as much as we think they do to play at a venue like this?\u201d\n\nThe artists on the lineup may very well be seeing a turning point on the horizon, with each making major strides in their music careers. Magnus Ferrell, a USC student who describes himself as a jazz-pop artist, has performed at venues like the Mayan for KCRW, Hotel Ziggy in West Hollywood, and most recently, at the Music Box in San Diego where he opened for the Psychedelic Furs. \u201cI feel really special about the Troubadour,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a special night and I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s just a vibe around it that feels very destiny-ish, if that makes sense.\u201d\n\nLorelei Marcell, who dabbles in alternative pop and R&B grooves has amassed millions of streams and has performed for packed crowds after joining pop-rock band TRANSVIOLET on the road. The Runarounds formed more recently through an open casting call for a new TV pilot by the creator of the hit Netflix show \u201cOuter Banks.\u201d The band of five made a guest appearance in the latest season that came out last week. The indie rockers have even captured the attention of rock and roll Hall-of-Famer Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads, who will help produce their live EP in the upcoming spring.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even intentionally have the Runarounds in mind at first,\u201d Taylor said. Taylor and Marple, who both work at the music school, recalled their interaction with the Runaround\u2019s singer, Will Lipton, who also happens to be a student at USC Thornton School of Music. \u201cIt was funny because he came in one day and was like, \u2018Hey, come to our show tonight,\u2019\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe ended up coming and they had a whole production team and it was so cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they started, Ashley and I looked at each other and were like, \u2018What the hell? Like these guys have something,\u201d Marple said. It was an opportunity for the two to see the band in action as they recorded a live version of their album. \u201cTheir energy was great, and they were great at engaging with the audience. And so that was when we were like, yeah, they\u2019re going to be our headliner,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAnd the producers and the artists are not the only potential beneficiaries of the concert. A portion of the proceeds will be donated directly to the nonprofit LA Animal Services. It\u2019s one of the largest municipal shelter systems in the U.S., according to the department website.\n\nAs for the show, the producers said \u201cThe 303\u2032\u2032 will be a concert not defined by genre, but one that embraces the diversity of sound, where each artist can bring their own unique voice to the stage. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want them to all fall into one genre because the fact that they\u2019re all kind of scattered helps people come in and have a different experience with each artist,\u201d Marple said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just pop. It\u2019s not just R&B. It\u2019s a little bit of everything.\u201d\n\nThe hope, they said, is that the concert will provide something that everyone in the audience can resonate with. \u201cWith USC being such a diverse school and a diverse community, I think that\u2019s really important to have a very wide range of genres,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nA little more than a month of dreaming, planning and producing will soon come to fruition as the artists inch closer to a legendary stage. \u201cWe did a walk through last week and that\u2019s when it started to feel real,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt was cool seeing it as an empty venue because soon it\u2019s going to be packed and very vibrant and energetic.\u201d\n\nTickets for the all-ages show are available at the Troubadour website.\n```"}

But then once we actually begin the role starting in around April, the actual date hasn\u2019t been set yet. That\u2019s when we get to push out those those short term projects like the housing directorate or the medical supply vending machines, which not necessarily a short term project, but something that can be released around them.\n\nMichelle Lu further explains the timeline of their project and how it has been in the works for a few years now.\n\nLu: A lot of the projects that we had put on our platform we were working on for a couple of years now are currently working on. Medical supply vending machines, for example. We are expecting to roll that out in the next 2 to 3 months. The housing directory.

Students and members of the public packed Norris Cinema Theatre at Frank Sinatra Hall for the 90-minute panel, which consisted of an hour-long discussion of Eichner\u2019s career evolution and a 30-minute Q&A segment.\n\nEichner, known for his starring role on the game show \u201cBilly on the Street\u201d and more recently in the romantic comedy \u201cBros,\u201d detailed his roots and \u201cslow burn\u201d rise, which began far from the flashy red carpets of Los Angeles; but rather in a middle-class neighborhood in Forest Hills, Queens. Eichner was forced to counter close-mindedness and create his own unique blend of theater and comedy in order to achieve national success that would eventually take him from a starry-eyed audience member in the upper mezzanine at Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s \u201cStarlight Express\u201d to some of the nation\u2019s largest stages.\n\nDuring the panel, Eichner repeatedly compared his journey to \u201cnepo babies,\u201d explaining that he did not have the privilege of a foot already in the door. \u201cI was very much not that,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cEvery step of the way, there are new challenges, [and] that I can tell you.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Eichner found himself \u201cmesmerized\u201d by the entertainment world, parked in front of the television to watch anything from MTV to the Academy Awards at age five. Eichner recalled hosting a \u201cBroadway meets pop music\u201d themed bar mitzvah and later opening a storage unit in New York City to stockpile his Playbill programs. \u201cI was an only child, and I loved TV, and I loved the movies, [and] I loved, loved, loved Broadway,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cI just absorbed it all like a sponge.\u201d\n\nBut despite the fact that pursuing a career in some area of the performing arts was \u201cone of the only things [Eichner] ever knew for sure,\u201d he struggled to find roles that producers felt perfectly suited him \u2013 a trend that would come to characterize the early stages of his career. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever been what the casting person...pictured in their head,\u201d Eichner said, explaining that he could not recall a time that he booked a job because of an audition. \u201cSo no matter how good of a job I might have done, a lot of times they\u2019ll be like: \u2018We love you, you\u2019re so fucking talented, you\u2019re not getting the part. But we love you, and there\u2019s nothing more you could have done.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeaving New York City and his childhood dream of attending NYU Tisch behind to embrace a new direction, Eichner started to find his place in the performing arts at Northwestern University, where he wrote a talk show and recorded grainy videos with Robin Lord Taylor, beginning to develop what later became the \u201c\u2018Billy on the Street\u2019 persona.\u201d \u201cIt was only ever the students who really really got me and cast me... my peers got me, you know, and that\u2019s always how it\u2019s been,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cIt was my saving grace.\u201d\n\nBut back in New York post-graduation, Eichner found himself lacking professional opportunities once again, instead spending his time scrolling on Playbill as a temporary employee at various buildings in Manhattan and bartending at the New Amsterdam Theatre during productions of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d to maintain a steady income. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy because I bartended at \u2018The Lion King,\u2019 and then 20 years later did a voice in \u2018The Lion King\u2019 remake,\u201d Eichner said.\n\nBut this level of achievement was anything but instant, and Eichner struggled to secure roles that producers felt aligned with the skills he brought to the table. \u201cI was neither quirky enough at the time to be like the weird, supporting wacky guy. I wasn\u2019t presenting that way yet,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cI eventually thought, all right, like, what do I do that\u2019s unique?\u201d\n\nDeciding to lean into his innate humor, Eichner enrolled in stand-up comedy classes, which forced him to refine his writing skills. From there, he began writing 90-minute shows that were \u201csomewhere between theater and comedy,\u201d similar to the style of \u201cBilly on the Street.\u201d \u201cPeople always told me that I was funny,\u201d Eichner said, \u201cand I could get a laugh; I could get laughs on lines of dialogue that were not even meant to get laughs.\u201d\n\nEichner went on to perform stand-up at open mics for crowds across Midtown, the West Village and the Upper West Side, but once again struggled to find acceptance \u2013 this time among audience members who were hesitant to embrace his comedic style and content. \u201cThe only place you saw a lot of gay representation at the time was in theater in New York.\u201d Eichner said. \u201cEven in New York City at those comedy clubs on the Upper West Side, I did not feel comfortable there. I didn\u2019t think that\u2019s where I was headed.\u201d\n\nAfter reaching another dead end, Eichner took his act to Ars Nova, an off-Broadway theater in Hell\u2019s Kitchen founded by artistic director Jason Eagan, where creators including Lin-Manuel Miranda and Elizabeth Meriwether had successfully established themselves. While Eichner felt \u201cvery, very comfortable, and they let me do my thing,\u201d he decided to return to Upright Citizens Brigade, the prominent comedy theater and training center where he was once a student.\n\nBut pitching his own show at UCB was not without its own obstacles. \u201cThe artistic director at the time, I won\u2019t say his name because I\u2019m a nice person, he told me \u2018it\u2019s really good, but I don\u2019t think it belongs here, because it\u2019s a little too cabaret,\u2019 which, you know, is a code word. He thought it was too gay. But then I pushed back,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cAnd I pushed and I pushed and he was like, \u2018okay, sure.\u2019 And I did it and everyone loved it. And it was great. And I did it there every week for a year.\u201d\n\nLacking a sense of stability in his career and equipped with personal drive for a deal, Eichner was prepared to prove initial critics wrong in order to create his own platform, rather than conform to what directors thought audiences wanted to see. \u201cIt\u2019s hard and it\u2019s, for me, necessary,\u201d Eichner said.\n\nWhile the show generated acclaim in the New York area, Eichner remained unable to secure what he believed was the next step in furthering his professional career \u2013 a partnership with a television network \u201c\u2018You are great, but we still don\u2019t want you\u2019 is a recurring theme in my life,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cProfessionally, and sometimes personally.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, once the \u201cBilly on the Street\u201d videos that Eichner had created since 2004 started to go viral around 2010, Eichner acquired the public backing he seeked to support his endeavors. \u201cIt allowed me to do my own thing,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cI put the videos online, and they took off...then I was able to go to TV producers and say like, look, there\u2019s like millions of people are watching this, and it\u2019s not all just people in New York, and it\u2019s not all just gay men or whoever you think is watching these things.\u201d\n\nDrowning in credit card debt and still lacking a permanent TV presence beyond a cameo on comedian Joan Rivers\u2019 \u201cFashion Police,\u201d Eichner booked a ticket to Los Angeles to pitch the idea for the long-form \u201cBilly on the Street\u201d game show to Mike Farah, CEO of the comedy brand Funny Or Die. With Farah\u2019s support, Eichner received between four and five offers for a pilot episode from companies including Comedy Central and E!; but when a smaller channel called Fuse offered to take him straight to series for 12 half-hour episodes, Eichner knew his decision was made.\n\nFive seasons and 54 official episodes later, \u201cBilly on the Street\u201d has evolved with the times \u2013 with full episodes now housed on HBOMax and many clips posted on YouTube, a new generation has engaged with Eichner\u2019s content, most notably on YouTube and TikTok. \u201cI only have a career because of the internet,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cIt was taking segments from the show and putting them online, which really was a career and gave \u2018Billy on the Street\u2019 longevity.\u201d\n\nDuring the Q&A portion of the panel, Eichner shared his admiration and gratitude for his accomplishments and support along the way, while acknowledging his refusal to remain stagnant. \u201cThe first Billy on the Street video I ever shot from my live show was 2004. Now we\u2019re in 2023. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s taken. That\u2019s a really long time,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cI am still clawing my way to the things that I want to do and the opportunities I want to do in order to not just sort of get stuck.\u201d\n\nEichner\u2019s most recent project, the 2022 romantic comedy \u201cBros\u201d that he wrote, starred in and produced with Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller, demonstrates yet another new approach for the comedian \u2013 intertwining comedy and true elements of his own experiences in hopes of enhancing non-stereotypical, substantive LGBTQ+ representation in mainstream romantic comedies. \u201cWe\u2019re so hungry for representation, but no one movie, no one show can represent the entire gay experience,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cAll you can do is tell your own story... and I think that we\u2019re all still navigating it and figuring it out. It\u2019s just about letting as many people as possible tell their stories.\u201d\n\nLooking to the rather uncertain future, Eichner intends to continue pursuing projects that he finds \u201cartistically satisfying,\u201d refusing to abide by existing conditions in popular media and quelling voices suggesting more of the status quo. \u201cEveryone tells you on social media \u2018stay in your lane, stay in your lane, stay in your lane.\u2019 And, my, if I have one message, it\u2019s don\u2019t ever stay in your fucking lane,\u201d Eichner said. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to people who tell you to stay in your lane. You just really have to work hard, and you really have to want it, and you really have to stick with it.\u201d \n```"}

While starring in prominent comedy productions, including \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d and \u201cBeetlejuice,\u201d Issacs made particular mention of \u201cSecond City Television,\u201d the pioneering late-night sketch-comedy group who \u201cwere doing meta before anybody had a name for it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hara then proceeded onto the stage, welcomed by roaring audience applause. Next, both O\u2019Hara and Higgins reflected on their time working with director Christopher Guest nearly 25 years back. Despite her seamless execution in mixing improvisation with scripted lines, O\u2019Hara admits to having \u201calways found those [scenes] really hard.\u201d \u201cThere was no particular goal in mind other than try to do something funny,\u201d O\u2019Hara joked. \u201cI might as well have been drunk in those scenes.\u201d\n\nHiggins then steered the conversation back to O\u2019Hara\u2019s beginnings in Ontario, Canada. Raised as the second-youngest of seven kids in an Irish-Catholic family, O\u2019Hara credits her natural comedic disposition to her upbringing. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s born funny. But you either are fortunate enough to have it encouraged, or you have life beat it out of you, unfortunately. I was very fortunate to grow up in a fun family.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hara recalled regularly using comedy as a vehicle for attention at the dinner table with her large family. Despite her parent\u2019s love for music and comedy, O\u2019Hara said her father worked for Canadian Pacific Railways, and neither had careers in entertainment. Regardless, her father \u201cwould tell jokes he heard at the office\u201d and her mother \u201cwould always tell stories about people she met that day, she would imitate everybody and was really good at it,\u201d naturally leaving O\u2019Hara and her siblings primed to follow in their footsteps.\n\nIn fact, her brother\u2019s romantic relationship with the late Gilda Radner initially opened the door for O\u2019Hara\u2019s career in comedy. During Radner\u2019s run in \u201cGodspell\u201d and \u201cSecond City Theater,\u201d O\u2019Hara silently watched from the wings and \u201cjust imitated her\u201d until she could land roles on her own. On that same production of \u201cGodspell,\u201d O\u2019Hara was introduced to future co-stars and comedy legends Martin Short, Andrea Martin, and most notably, Eugene Levy. \u201cWe\u2019re all still friends!\u201d O\u2019Hara exclaimed.\n\nO\u2019Hara then offered some advice to the audience: \u201cJust attach yourself to some really talented people and don\u2019t let go!\u201d The conversation then pivoted to O\u2019Hara\u2019s run on \u201cSecond City Television,\u201d which aired weekly following \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d As \u201cSecond City Theater\u201d transitioned into \u201cSecond City Television\u201d following the success of SNL, O\u2019Hara admits she \u201cjust lucked out\u201d as a cast member during the production\u2019s shifting period. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been any cast at that time, but we happen to be the cast that was on stage, O\u2019Hara said. \u201cSo when they decided to do a television show, we were the ones that were there.\u201d\n\nDuring O\u2019Hara\u2019s time on SCTV, she accumulated awards for writing, including a 1982 Emmy Award for Writing in a Variety or Music Program. She recalled being fortunate to \u201chave an audience that would tell us what\u2019s funny,\u201d which allowed for positive growth among the cast and writers. O\u2019Hara then discussed how \u201cSCTV really opened doors\u201d in comedy opportunities outside Canada. She began receiving audition offers from renowned casting directors who O\u2019Hara confessed to disregarding too soon. \u201cI was like, \u2018Ha, I don\u2019t know who you are. No thanks.\u2019 Ignorance. Just ignorance.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hara made light of her past casting misconceptions admitting she \u201cwished [she] had the internet back then to look people up before [she] met them.\u201d O\u2019Hara\u2019s first role in America in Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cAfter Hours,\u201d which she called a \u201creally fun and exciting\u201d experience. However, when O\u2019Hara began a relationship with Tim Burton, director of \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas\u201d and \u201cFrankenweenie,\u201d she found her stride in American TV and Film. O\u2019Hara admitted repeatedly rejecting meeting requests with Burton until she finally agreed to a meeting in Los Angeles. \u201cReally, it went on for a while,\u201d O\u2019Hara acknowledged.\n\nIn addition to the repeated denials, O\u2019Hara recalled driving to the wrong studio and missing their meeting, yet still receiving an offer to work with Burton. Capping off her conversation with Higgins, O\u2019Hara summarized the success of her career by crediting the talent around. \u201cIf you can work with good, smart, funny people who lift each other up, that\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\nA Q&A from the captivated, fan-filled audience followed the conversation. Sophie Lee, a BA theater major braved the microphone to ask how O\u2019Hara came up with her infamous accent in her portrayal of Moira Rose on \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek.\u201d \u201cThink of Moira as an actress who, lately, nothing\u2019s going on for her...and now she\u2019s married to this very successful man, and I know that she would take credit for his success, but still, when you\u2019re married to somebody really famous, and you want people to know that you\u2019re interesting too... she developed this vocabulary.\u201d Referencing Moira\u2019s iconic use of words often absent from the everyday conversation.\n\nCatherine O\u2019Hara\u2019s Master in Comedy Lecture was solidified in the final moments of the presentation when she was officially awarded the Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Comedy Award. Toward the end of the presentation, O\u2019Hara offered a piece of advice she received from a producer on SCTV at the start of her career. \u201cBe really conscious of the foot you\u2019re going in on, and make sure it\u2019s the foot you want to stay on because it\u2019s really hard to change after that,\u201d O\u2019Hara explained, \u201ctreat yourself with the respect that you hope to one day earn.\u201d```"}

That was my goal when I was brought on into this position, my goal was just to boost civic engagement.\u201d\n\nThe elections commission implemented several initiatives to try to increase turnout including voting days for students, engagement with administration, collaborations with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and handing out information and food on campus during election week.\n\nOut of 22,000 undergraduates, only 4,105 students cast ballots, resulting in Divya Jakadar and Michelle Lu taking office as president and vice president for the 2023-24 school year.\n\nSome students who didn\u2019t vote said they equate low turnout to lack of awareness and were skeptical that their vote would have an impact on relevant community decisions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what each of the people represented or stood for and how that was going to impact me as a student,\u201d junior astronautical engineering major Ashley Modena said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know their platforms, so I didn\u2019t feel very motivated to vote for them.\u201d\n\nSome students who did turn out said they only did so because of a personal connection to one of the candidates.\n\n\u201cI voted because the candidates had come to one of our club meetings and encouraged me to vote,\u201d freshman music industry major, Julia Eden said. \u201cI feel like [if] I didn\u2019t have the interaction, I wouldn\u2019t have voted because I honestly didn\u2019t know much about it.\u201d\n\nLow voter turnout is not a new occurrence for the organization and was a challenge that Habhab faced in his time as commission chair. Candidates also saw about a 20% voter turnout in last year\u2019s election when there was an uncontested president and vice president.\n\nLooking towards the future, he thinks that by keeping students informed about USG in the fall semester, more students will vote when election season comes along in the spring.\n\n\u201cSome students aren\u2019t interested because they\u2019re just not familiar with what USG is,\u201d Habhab said. \u201cWe tried to interact with students and the students weren\u2019t interested because they didn\u2019t know what we actually do.\u201d\n\nConfusion about how USG candidates impact students was also a concern for senior music industry major, Sam Nicholson.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much it directly affects me, but maybe if I was more educated about [it would],\u201d Nicholson said.\n\nThe USC administration and USG have teamed up to create projects like the free Lyft system, medical vending machines and the creation of shuttles to LAX during student breaks.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, these are going to be the student leaders that represent us and that hopefully get these projects done that will make our time at USC so much more memorable and beneficial,\u201d Habhab said.\n```"}

Coming off a strong performance at the Therese Hession Regional Challenge, the No. 11 Trojans started off the first round strong, shooting 22 under par with a total team score of 274, starting them in first place. A notable performance in the first round came from sophomore Cindy Kou shooting 65, seven under par.\n\nThe momentum soon shifted, and USC lost steam going into the next 18 holes with a 280 team score. Silverstein believes the weather contributed to the Trojans\u2019 struggles. \u201cWe made a lot more birdies in the first round, and I think part of it was that the wind changed,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cSecondarily we didn\u2019t have anyone get hot, especially in the third round.\u201d Silverstein added no one was able to get hot on the second day. Only sophomore Amari Avery was able to stay on track in the second round with 5 under par.\n\nThe third round ended the worst out of the three with a total team score of 288. USC\u2019s great start was unable to keep it ahead of first place No. 1o\u2019s Texas A&M\u2019s dominance and a surprising second place North Texas, which consistently shot 280 for all three rounds.\n\nAlthough the Trojans putted well throughout the invitational, Silverstein thinks their biggest flaw was their wedge game and getting the ball on the green. \u201cI think the wedge game and short iron game needs to be sharper. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been working really hard on at practice,\u201d Silverstein said.\n\nThe Trojans have little time to rest, as they have three days and two practices until they are on a flight for their next event at the Juli Inkster at Meadow Club Invitational in Fairfax, California. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue doing our putting stuff \u2014 it seems to be working well \u2014 and just keep hammering away at the wedge and short iron play,\u201d Silverstein said.\n\nSilverstein still has high confidence in his team\u2019s ability and thinks USC has been playing some great golf. He believes he\u2019s seen a lot of great performances in matches and at practice; the Trojans just need to put everything together. \u201cExpectation is that any tournament we play in we can win. We think any five of our eight that we play are good enough to win,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working really hard, and it\u2019s going to be rewarded in the long term.\u201d\n\nAs the Trojans refocus for next week, some players are going to need to step up, as standout Kou will be traveling to Singapore to represent China in the Asian Pacific Amateur Championship. Silverstein expects to see a strong showing from Avery, who is USC\u2019s highest-scoring player in the World Amateur Golf Rankings. Junior Brianna Navarro also will be expected to get back into the swing of things. \u201cI think the Meadow Club where we are heading fits her game nicely. I think [Navarro] is prime to put up a good performance,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cIf Amari and Bri can get going in the right direction, I think we\u2019ll be just fine without Cindy.\u201d\n\nUSC women\u2019s golf still has confidence and high hopes of capturing its first tournament win of the spring season at the Juli Inkster at Meadow Club Invitational Monday, March 6 and Tuesday, March 7.\n```"}

I was taken aback. I was a pregnant teen, the first in my family to attend college and not sure how I would navigate school, work and my personal life. I came seeking help and resources. but was instead told that maybe time away was best. I was confused. Not because I didn\u2019t understand what a leave of absence meant; I was confused because the thought of leaving school hadn\u2019t crossed my mind as a possibility. I didn\u2019t know much, but I knew if I left school I would certainly never make my way back \u2013 sealing my fate as an economically unstable young mother.\n\nWhen I walked out of that building, I was more determined than ever to graduate. That determination led me from teen mom to (almost) triple Trojan. USC has always been a formidable force in my life. I grew up less than two miles away in Jefferson Park and spent many weekends grocery shopping with my family across the street at the 32nd Street Market. As close as I was to the university, there was an impenetrable wall around it. To me, USC was an ivory tower only for the elite, which I was not.\n\nEven when I found myself on campus for the first time at my junior high school graduation in 1993, the campus felt so formidable and beyond my reach. Perhaps my curiosity about the formidable ivory tower got the best of me. In 1995, I was a senior in high school and USC was the only school I applied to. It was a risky decision, but it paid off. I was accepted as a biomedical engineer major. The running joke is that to this day, I have no clue what biomedical engineering is.\n\nDespite that, I was so excited to start college. My excitement quickly turned to confusion and dismay. I realized almost immediately that I was NOT prepared academically for the coursework. Many of my classmates had learned some of the coursework in high school and I had never seen any of it before. I also did not fit in culturally. I was a commuter student from South Los Angeles who struggled to create relationships with other students. I had more in common with the workers at Caf\u00e9 84 that I worked with than my classmates. And of course, I was pregnant, which brought its own challenges.\n\nAfter four changes in my major, a scary labor and delivery (my daughter was born eight weeks early and weighed a little over three pounds), custody disputes that caused me to miss class, and a ton of support from my family\u2013 I graduated in the summer of 2000 with a degree in Public Policy and Management. I distinctly remember walking out of Black Grad at Bovard auditorium in tears and meeting up with my family. My daughter, seeing me in tears, began to cry. As far as I was concerned, we both earned that degree.\n\nThree years later I had fallen in love with public health, a profession I had never heard of until I became a student worker at the local health department right before graduation. The people I worked with were amazing. They got to go into the community and educate people about sexually transmitted infections. They created presentations, flyers and helped people get tested or treated via the STI hotline. Everyone on the team had Master\u2019s Degrees in Public Health. A colleague would always encourage me to go back to school. I always complained about spending two more years at school. She gently reminded me that those two years would go by anyway and that an advanced degree would double my salary.\n\nSo once again, I applied to only one school and was admitted. This time was different. I had a full-time job and a school aged child, but managing it all was much easier because the subject area was of great interest to me. I also had the advantage of taking what I learned at school and using it at work and tackling work issues at school. I graduated and began a rewarding career in public health that has spanned two decades.\n\nI spent my first decade working on public health issues in the very community I was born and raised in. I considered it an honor and a privilege to be able to make a difference in the health status of my neighbors. One of the biggest lessons I learned during that time was how communities can be shaped by the physical and social environment. I worked with non profit organizations along the South Figueroa Corridor and learned how displacement, gentrification and economic disinvestment harms communities. I learned about residents in the University Park area having to move because of high rents and how some organizations were not happy with USC\u2019s actions in the neighboring community.\n\nThe irony of it all was that my USC education gave me the skills to take a critical look at USC\u2019s role as a community partner. I\u2019ve taught undergraduates about health and public health for almost 15 years at colleges such as Cal State Los Angeles and Occidental College. I\u2019ve participated in fellowships, chaired a City Commission and sat on Boards, including the inaugural Alumni Council of the Keck School of Medicine Department of Population and Public Health Sciences. I\u2019ve written two books and currently host a weekly video podcast.\n\nBut I wanted more. So 18 years after receiving my MPH degree and 25 years after setting foot on the campus of USC for the first time, I decided to pursue a doctoral degree. I am currently a student at the Rossier School of Education in the EdD Program. In May 2024, I will finally be Dr. Vick, just like my great grandmother said I would be when she asked me over 30 years ago if I was going to go to college. My great grandmother was only one generation removed from slavery, so to fulfill this goal means so much to me and my family.\n\nUSC and I have had an interesting relationship over the last thirty or so years. On the one hand, USC has provided me with an education that made it possible to have gainful employment and raise my daughter, who is now 26 years old. I was able to be a living example of self determination and grit for her. My hope is that she is as proud of me as I am of her. My success did not come easy. If I had listened to that advisor all those years ago, my life would be completely different.\n\nI have made it my personal responsibility to do what I can to educate, inform and uplift younger Black students and early career professionals, so they have some sense of what\u2019s ahead. On the other hand, USC is not perfect. I no longer see USC as an inaccessible ivory tower. Its presence has impacted the surrounding community in ways that are helpful and incredibly harmful. Many students have no idea of the impact USC has had on the low-income Black and Brown residents who used to live in the area.\n\nBecause I grew up and worked nearby and have extensive public health knowledge, I understand the negative impact of the university\u2019s presence and the added responsibility USC has to be a good and welcoming neighbor. I have learned to always be critical of powerful institutions like USC and to push for social justice whenever and however I can. I will always cherish the relationships I have made over the years, from the women working at Caf\u00e9 84 that checked on me after I had my baby, to professors like Dr. Lavonna Lewis, Dr. Rita Burke, Dr. Michael Cousineau and Dr. Jane Steinberg who I consider colleagues and friends. They have reached out to me to share my knowledge and expertise with current students and I am always happy to do so.\n\nMost importantly, I finally feel like my voice, my presence and my perspective has value to the USC community. I think back to those early days when I wasn\u2019t sure I even belonged at USC, when I would come to campus with my daughter in her stroller, wondering what all this was for. Almost 3 degrees and a lifetime of experience later, I am sure I belong here.\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Nolan Ezzet\nFebruary 28, 2023 at 11:21 pm PST\n\n\u201cSCoop\u201d is a column by Nolan Ezzet about USC\u2019s sports teams.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Trojan spirit was dwindling. USC had lost two straight games against Oregon and Oregon State, making the Trojans a bubble team at best. But since then, they have been electric and are now on a four-game win streak. A spot in the tournament is now theirs to lose.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I said that if the Trojans want to earn a spot in March Madness, they must improve their 3-point shooting and assist numbers. They\u2019ve done exactly that; USC has recorded double-digit assists and shot over 40% from behind the arc in each of its four games over the last two weeks.\n\nUSC began this four-game stretch at Galen Center, where they faced Cal and Stanford. USC shot over 50% from deep and recorded at least 16 assists in each of the two games. The Trojans beat the Golden Bears 97-60 and the Cardinal 85-75.\n\nUSC then hit the road to play Colorado and Utah where the Trojans remained hot, shooting over 40% from 3-point range and recording double-digit assists in both games. They took down the Buffaloes 84-65 and the Utes 62-49.\n\nAlthough USC had a double-digit margin of victory in all four games, the matchups against Stanford and Utah were tighter than the scores suggest; it never felt like either game was sealed until regulation ended. The only visible flaw in the Trojans\u2019 performance was their ball handling. They had double-digit turnovers in both games, which prevented them from going on large runs. Had USC gone up against ranked opponents instead of Stanford and Utah, the Trojans might have lost both those games due to the turnovers alone.\n\nAs the Pac-12 and March Madness tournaments approach, the Trojans need to maintain their momentum from 3-point range and keep sharing the ball well, but they also need to take care of the ball and decrease their turnover totals. It all starts with fifth-year guard Drew Peterson, who has the third most turnovers in the Pac-12 with 82.\n\nIf the Trojans can fix this issue while maintaining the momentum they\u2019ve gathered over the last two weeks, they should have no problem making the NCAA tournament.\n\nOther than turnovers, the other thing that seems to plague this Trojan squad is injuries. USC has only played nine games with its full roster healthy. During those nine games, however, the Trojans are 8-1 with an average margin of victory of 11.9 points.\n\nRedshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan and sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters returning to full health will help bolster the Trojans\u2019 efficiency on both sides of the ball. USC just needs to hope Morgan, Dixon-Waters and its other key players don\u2019t go down again. But of course, that is mostly out of anyone\u2019s control.\n\nFor now, the Trojans need to focus on taking care of the ball and riding the momentum of the past four games. USC will face a tough No. 8 Arizona team next week, followed by their season-closer against Arizona State. As long as the Trojans win at least one of these games and then proceed to play well in the Pac-12 tournament, I have little doubt that they will make an appearance in March.\n\n\u201cSCoop\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Words like \u201cconnection,\u201d \u201cextravagant,\u201d \u201cdiversity,\u201d and \u201cwood\u201d have been jolted alongside in black ink. To 75 second-year architecture students who have been challenged to design sustainable and community-centric infrastructure for the LA 2028 Olympics and Paralympic games, these are the ideas that paint a vibrant picture of the City of Angels.\n\nTitled \u201cMaking LA,\u201d the semester-long project aims to have each student answer what the city means to them and design sustainable structures for the city, from concession stands and media centres to stadiums. \u201cWith this project, we are asking students to look at the LA 2028 Olympics and specifically, the afterlife of it,\u201d said Juan Salazar, one of the advisors for the project. \u201cMore often than not, when the games are over, all the investment that went into [the city] is lost. If we think about the Olympics games in Athens, Greece, all the stadiums are pretty much abandoned.\u201d\n\nThe 2028 games mark the third time that LA hosts the Olympic games, having previously been the host in 1984 and 1932. The city has laid out multiple initiatives for LA2028 including rehabilitating existing stadiums, using UCLA as the Olympic Village, and expanding the public transportation network in the city. \u201cWe need structures that can actually benefit the community that it takes place within,\u201d said Mira Singh, one of the students involved in the project.\n\nMany students are excited for the extension of the Purple Line that will connect Downtown Los Angeles to the Miracle Mile, Beverly Hills, and Westwood, which would reduce the travel time between DTLA and Westwood to just 25 minutes. The city\u2019s aggressive push for sustainable building and development for the LA2028 games lay the foundation for the framework of the Making LA project.\n\nOver the weeks, the students\u2019 designs have matured into a wide range of forms which all exhibit their individual take on building for disassembly, reuse, and adaptability. Tianyu Guo works with strictly slanted, parallel surfaces, but breaks this rule to create a highly sculptural space where people can walk up, sit around and enjoy some boba drinks. Her work aims to create a sense of \u201cinteraction,\u201d where all the elements of the building are connected to how people intend to use it. \u201cThe Olympics aim to bring all the people together. The temporary architecture for the Olympics also needs to do so,\u201d Guo said.\n\nAnother student Brady Lin sees a sustainable approach within his work with hexagons and how they can be arranged to create all kinds of structures. He talked about how small hexagonal loops can be used to create bike racks and can later be taken apart to build structures like bus stops.\n\nRob Berry, the project coordinator, encourages his students to investigate where the materials for construction come from and how they are processed. He gives examples of small structures from the LA84 games where many of the temporary towers, arches, and monumental art were made from recyclable or reusable materials such as cardboard and fabric, and shows how sustainable materials can truly transform the city. \u201cGenerally, when we talk about sustainability as it relates to architecture, the conversation always centers around new technologies. But new materials come with expensive costs,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cIf students are to take something out of the studio, they should understand that you can be sustainable with very simple means \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be radical.\u201d\n\nWhile tacking on a green roof or constructing a new garden in a building seems like an easy solution towards sustainability, Salazar said that it can often be unrealistic because the construction costs exceed the budget of the client. \u201cIn LA, more often than not, the commissioners and developers want to reuse existing projects to reduce costs,\u201d Salazar said.\n\nIn DTLA, many office and commercial spaces were abandoned due to a shift towards working from home since the pandemic. Instead of destroying these buildings to construct newer ones, many have now been converted to apartments. The \u201cMaking LA\u201d project aims to encourage ideas of adaptive reuse and historic reconstruction, aspects of sustainability that have been less discussed in architectural education. \u201cIt is so easy to make a statement from scratch, or to be original. Instead, to me, it is way more challenging to rework existing structures into something that you can still call your own,\u201d Salazar said.\n```"}

(Art by Qiuya Chen)\n\nBy Valerie Fang February 28, 2023 at 9:29 pm PST\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. Massimiliano Ambesi, an Olympic analyst and a commentator for Eurosport, was absolutely right when he tweeted that Hanyu Yuzuru\u2019s GIFT ice show held at Tokyo Dome on Sunday was \u201cby far the biggest and most important event in the very long history of figure skating.\u201d Those three hours were the monumental moment the world had been waiting for. As always, Hanyu has shattered any prior expectations we had of the show with 12 programs, plus the two encore pieces. The audience walked away with a renewed interpretation of both Hanyu and the sport of figure skating.\n\nLike a movie, GIFT was a combination of various forms of arts. Unlike any of his previous ice shows, this time Hanyu dedicated a significant portion to narration, which was accompanied by visually stunning videos that helped convey his emotions and messages. Using various symbols and imagery, Hanyu poetically painted the journey of his life so far. A different side of the almighty two-time Olympic champion is somewhat surprisingly marked by vulnerability and many insecurities.\n\nListening to Hanyu\u2019s monologues, which served as connections between programs, felt like flipping through an incredibly personal journal. And we could clearly feel how his understanding of dream, efforts, pain and \u2013 above all \u2013 the meaning of life has shifted through all these years of his trials and struggles. I can never praise Hanyu enough for having the courage to face his heart and always live from within.\n\nTwo of the most touching moments were his monologues before and after \u201cA Fleeting Dream.\u201d The videos portrayed a transformative experience of Hanyu realizing what he truly cherished: the support of and the connections with people around him. He seemed to have finally made peace with not landing the quadruple axel, embraced the fact that not every goal of his can be achieved and that at times he has to simply let go of those unattainable dreams.\n\n\u201cI want me and everyone else to want me and see who I really am,\u201d Hanyu said during one of his monologues. For a long time (especially the period between PyeongChang 2018 and Beijing 2022), conquering the quadruple axel was one of the few, if not the only, motivations that kept Hanyu in the sport as he has won all the titles a figure skater could win. In fact, landing this jump with 4.5 rotations was his dream ever since childhood. But as we know, the under-rotated opening jump of his free skate at Beijing 2022 was his closest attempt.\n\nIn his pursuit of the back-to-back Olympic gold, Hanyu was always advocating for holding onto one\u2019s dream as tightly as possible and not giving up until it comes true. So it was especially touching to hear his renewed perspective on the transience of dream and how letting it go meant breaking free from his own chains. Does it mean that we will not see any more 4A attempts from him? Maybe. But it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. If what he truly wanted all along was to be with the ones he cares about, then he is living this dream right now.\n\nKnowing this change in his attitude towards dreams, I couldn\u2019t help but perceive his first encore piece, \u201cHaru yo, Koi\u201d (May Spring Come), differently. The costume for this program was decorated with cascading sakura, a flower which can display breathtaking full bloom for just two weeks out of the year. The flower symbolizes the fleeting nature of beauty in Japanese culture. For all his previous performances of \u201cHaru yo, Koi,\u201d especially the one at Beijing 2022 after he missed the podium, this poignant piece meant a powerful combination of melancholy and hope to me. Yes, our life is ephemeral and fragile. But while we are still here, we should still fight to become the better version of ourselves every day because the resilience of life can shine through only when we are battling adversity.\n\nHowever, this time, Hanyu showed a more joyful interpretation of this program. Just look at his smile before entering the gorgeous layback Ina Bauer. It was the kind of bliss so pure and contagious that it poured out of the screen and consumed you. It was the kind of happiness that signaled he has made peace with himself, found a new direction in life to head toward and filled himself with gratitude for people around him.\n\nThe GIFT ice show was entirely cinematic in scope. Besides merging various forms of arts as mentioned earlier, the Hanyu Yuzuru as we perceive became more fleshed out throughout the show as if he was the hero of a movie. And it\u2019s all thanks to his bravery of being vulnerable with the world and honest with himself.\n\nI\u2019ve always struggled to find the right words to describe Hanyu because at times he seemed to be a poem, an abstract artwork and even an enigma. The complexity of his personality, the depth of his thoughts and the incredible ability to blend art and storytelling into athleticism always fascinates me and many more figure skating fans. But now, the godsent GIFT to his supporters is finally unwrapped. We can\u2019t help but marvel at yet another evolution of Hanyu\u2019s creation. This is the dawn of the next illustrious chapter of his life. This is perhaps also the beginning of a new era in figure skating. And in that, we are all blessed.\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Veronique Louis-Jacques February 28, 2023 at 9:19 pm PST\n\nEver since the Screen Actors Guild Awards (SAG) first took place in 1995, actors opened the show by sharing the origin stories of their careers and the fond memories they\u2019ve made along the way, a tradition that has lived on as \u201cI am an actor.\u201d In recognition of the 2023 SAG Awards on Feb. 26, Annenberg Media asked a few SDA students majoring in theatre with an acting emphasis to share their origin stories.\n\nMaximus Allen, a sophomore majoring in theatre and English literature, found his path to acting from his childhood passions of reading and writing. Growing up, Allen initially wanted to become an author, eventually discovering his passion for acting through a drama class in high school. \u201cInstead of creating the stories, I can be performing the story as well,\u201d Allen said. \u201cImmersing yourself in a character\u2019s reality and their environments kind of created the same purpose [as writing]. So I was like, \u2018Why not do both?\u2019\u201d\n\nIan Grady, a sophomore, began his acting career in the Britt Amphitheater in Jacksonville, Oregon, when he starred in his elementary school\u2019s production of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d His love for acting was replaced by athletics early on, but a high school rendition of \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d rekindled his love for the theater. Grady said he hopes to follow in the footsteps of famous comedians and actors like Jim Carrey, who was able to convey depth in his films, while also bringing their comedic talents.\n\nNaila Gomez, a sophomore, discovered her love of acting at only 4 years old. After watching \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d with her grandfather, Gomez was inspired to act by the character of Christine Daa\u00e9. Her mother, an English turned theater teacher, also influenced her decision to pursue acting as a career.\n\nLexie Hastings, a sophomore, grew up as a shy child who used both Barbie and Disney Princess movies to bring her out of her shell, dancing along to all of the songs. When her mom signed her up for theater, Hastings ended up enjoying the experience, playing the Skunk lost boy in \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Yet Hastings credits the film \u201cEnchanted\u201d for allowing her to look at film differently when she was a child. \u201cThere was something about it being live action, not animated. She was like a real Disney princess,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cI want to do that. I want to sing and dance in parks and be part of movies like that in the future.\u201d\n\nMadison Olea\u2019s journey to acting wasn\u2019t easy. Now a junior, Olea grew up doing musical theater, participating in many acting and film classes. However, Olea was unsure whether or not she wanted or was capable of pursuing acting as a career. Graduating high school during the pandemic, she chose to go to a community college instead of pursuing a psychology degree at a four-year university. At community college, she joined the speech and debate team and fell in love with performing once again. When she was ready to transfer, her friend convinced her to apply to USC\u2019s theatre program. \u201cI did [the application] in a week and I got everything back, and I got in,\u201d Olea said. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, I guess it\u2019s time to actually believe in myself because I felt like [acting] just kept coming back to me.\u201d\n\nProfessional actors Niecey Nash, Bob Odenkirk, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janelle James and Quinta Lee Brunson carried on the tradition at this year\u2019s SAG awards ceremony. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been fired from \u2018Operation Petticoat,\u2019 I would have never had the opportunity to audition for a little tiny, no-budget horror movie called \u2018Halloween,\u2019\u201d Curtis said. \u201cMy name is Jamie Lee Curtis and I am proudly an actor.\u201d\n\nDuring his acceptance speech for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, USC alum Ke Huy Quan noted that he was the first Asian actor to earn the nod in that category, winning for his performance in \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once.\u201d \u201cTo all those at home who are watching, who are struggling and waiting to be seen, please keep on going because the spotlight will one day find you,\u201d Quan said.\n```"}

For Izabella Flores, a junior in the Bachelor of Architecture program, taking out student loans was the financial route they took in order to attend USC, a decision Flores describes as \u201cstressful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt kind of puts a lot of stress on me to get as much as I can out of my education, which, while it\u2019s not a bad thing, it is just like an added stressor that I\u2019m jealous of the people that don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d Flores said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish it upon anyone, but yeah, I do find myself [being] bitter about it sometimes.\u201d\n\nAllison Fiedler, a junior studying intelligence and cyber operations, said that if she had not received a scholarship, she would have had to take out student loans to attend USC.\n\n\u201cI just feel like we shouldn\u2019t be [harming] people who are already disadvantaged in the college access and equity system,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see an issue with it, so I think we should get rid of college debt.\u201d\n\nWith USC\u2019s yearly tuition of $64,726 exceeding the national average of $41,568, a recent USC graduate will, on average, end with $27,136 after four years in debt if they begin taking out loans their freshman year.\n\n\u201cNo one should be living with that for years, upon years, upon years,\u201d Fiedler said.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court\u2019s current conservative majority, the outcome for Biden\u2019s loan relief program is facing skepticism from the majority of justices, who have questioned the legality of Biden\u2019s proposal due to a lack of congressional approval. Biden\u2019s debt relief program aims to reduce up to $20,000 in debt cancellation for Pell Grant recipients and up to $10,000 for non-Pell Grant recipients. The bill stresses that no high-income individual or high-income household, specifically those in the top 5% of income, will benefit from this program.\n\nFlores has shared that despite not knowing specific policy details about the President\u2019s plan, debt relief would benefit their family.\n\n\u201cIt would help me and my family out a lot because my younger sister still has to go to school,\u201d Flores shared. \u201cSo that\u2019s like another reason why I\u2019m trying so hard to make this work, [and] it\u2019s in the back of my mind a lot.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s main argument relies on the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act (HEROES Act) of 2003, a resolution that was enacted as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic as a means to ease the financial burdens of households amidst a global economic crisis.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard two cases that challenged Biden\u2019s plans, with some conservative judges saying the President had exceeded the bounds of his authority, especially since Congress had previously rejected his plan. However, one conservative judge, Amy Coney Barrett, demonstrated she may possibly swing in favor of the loan forgiveness program after her questioning during the oral arguments.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to reach a decision by the end of June. According to a CNN exit poll, the country remains politically split on this issue, with 50% of Democrats in favor of Biden\u2019s student debt relief plan and 47% of Republicans disapproving. A news poll by NBC also revealed that among voters with student loan debt, 69% expressed approval for Biden\u2019s plan compared to 22% of voters in the same group who believed it to be a bad idea.\n\nThomas Baek, a freshman studying psychology, also took out student loans. After hearing about Biden\u2019s student debt relief plan, Baek stated his support for the legislation, framing it as something that all students [can] benefit from.\n\n\u201cI think we have to be more financially cognizant and aware of how we spend our money,\u201d Baek added. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s such a big part of student lives, so it\u2019s almost normalized. So if Biden\u2019s putting together this proposal, I\u2019m totally down for that, honestly.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Tomoki Chien)\n\nBy Tomoki Chien\nFebruary 28, 2023 at 7:51 pm PST\n\nPerhaps never before has hand sanitizer caused USC so much grief \u2014 until earlier this month, when a battery-powered sanitizing station sparked a small fire on the sixth floor of Parkside Apartments. Now, USC Housing will swap all 150 of its automatic hand sanitizing stations in favor of manual pumps, according to a university spokesperson, who also noted that USC Fire Safety recommended the move \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nLithium-ion batteries in consumer electronics, including automatic sanitizer dispensers, are known to spark fires at times. Under the contract with the vendor, the replacements come at no cost to USC, which only pays for the refills that go into dispensers.\n\nHousing officials originally told residents that the fire was a suspected case of arson, but changed their tune when they discovered the dispenser was battery-operated: a potentially welcome relief for some residents, depending on whether those students prefer living in close quarters with arsonous neighbors or just down the hall from a spontaneously combusting hand-sanitizing station.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard the potential cause of the fire was arson, I was kind of skeptical,\u201d said Katrina Kong Smith, a Parkside resident and freshman majoring in health and human sciences. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t interact with everyone on my floor, I feel like I knew enough about our area that it was not [arson].\u201d\n\nThe fire didn\u2019t cause any injuries or major damage, though it did temporarily relocate nine students from five apartments in the building while USC Housing repaired water damage from the sprinkler system.\n\nNBC reported earlier this month that lithium-ion batteries are sparking fires at an alarming rate across the United States and that those fires are often faster-spreading and harder to tame than traditional blazes.\n\n\u201cWhen designed, manufactured and used properly, lithium batteries are a safe, high energy density power source for devices,\u201d reads a 2019 Occupational Safety and Health Administration bulletin. \u201cWhile lithium batteries are normally safe, they may cause injury if they have design defects, are made of low-quality materials, are assembled incorrectly, are used or recharged improperly, or are damaged.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Kaitlyn Becenti)\n\nBy Kaitlin Becenti and Jack Waterman\nFebruary 28, 2023 at 7:45 pm PST\n\nAround 30 USC bus drivers and supporters marched from the USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work to Tommy Trojan on the morning of February 28. Their reasoning? A union for better wages and working conditions. USC bus drivers are among the lowest paid in Los Angeles. Their wages start at $18 an hour, whereas less than 20 miles away, unionized UCLA drivers start at $22.74 an hour. Unionized drivers at Los Angeles International Airport also earn more, making up to $39.34 an hour.\n\nA USC bus driver who asked for anonymity due to fear of retribution thinks $24 an hour is reasonable. \u201cThe cost of living keeps going up and up. We can\u2019t survive. I feel uncertain because I know they don\u2019t want a union, but we need this. USC has money. They have big money. Why can\u2019t they give us a piece of it?\u201d\n\nUSC bus drivers provide essential transportation to students, faculty, staff and other university guests to and from USC\u2019s main campus. These routes stretch across multiple cities, from L.A. to Alhambra, and span from L.A. Union Station all the way to Marina del Rey.\n\nAt the rally, chants of \u201cWhat do we want? Justice!\u201d and \u201cSi, se puede,\u201d echoed as bus drivers dressed in purple and yellow walked around campus stopping at the statue of Tommy Trojan to share their message. Several of them held signs that said \u201cunion yes!\u201d with a bus on a purple background.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just bus drivers at the rally. \u201cThe school has way too much money not to be treating its workers with respect,\u201d said USC student Owen Ramsby. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that make the school run and they deserve respect, better wages, benefits, all that. So we\u2019re going to do what we can to support them.\u201d\n\nTrojan Left, a student organization interested in making radical change at USC, spoke out in favor of the drivers. One of their representatives, Lili Adkins, attended the rally. \u201cWe know that as USC students, we have a lot of privilege and leverage in what the university decides to do in terms of the union,\u201d said Adkins, a sophomore majoring in history. \u201cI hope that it can have a wider impact on USC by discouraging their union-busting practices so that all workers at USC can get the wages and rights that they deserve.\u201d\n\nThis effort comes after drivers filed their intent to form a union with the National Labor Relations Board on February 6. If USC drivers are able to become unionized, they could negotiate higher wages and fight to improve the conditions of their workplace. If successful, the drivers will be represented by SEIU 721, an organization that \u201crepresents the county and city employees across Southern California.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are getting folks to support the shuttle [bus] drivers here,\u201d said Felipe Caceres, a coordinator from SEIU 721. \u201cSo what we\u2019re looking for and asking for the USC community, is to support these drivers and their right to a union.\u201d\n\nThe 30 to 35 current USC bus drivers will have the opportunity to vote on whether they should unionize on March 23. USC opposes the unionization effort saying, \u201cWe value our shuttle drivers and the important work they do for the university. We also value the direct, collegial and cooperative relationship we have with our drivers and our ability to flexibly and directly respond to their concerns and needs as they arise. We do not believe they need a third party to speak for them,\u201d said a statement released to Annenberg Media. \u201cThat said, we respect our drivers\u2019 right to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to have a union represent them, and this decision should be made through the election scheduled for March 23.\u201d\n\nIn a press release issued by Tim Sandoval, communications specialist at SEIU, Sonia Olivarez, a USC bus driver said, \u201cUSC President Carol Folt needs to know that we emphatically support joining SEIU Local 721 to finally have a strong voice on the job to advocate for ourselves and our passengers. We\u2019re fed up with being underpaid and undervalued despite our critical role in keeping students, staff, faculty and visitors moving.\u201d```"}

Biden\u2019s student debt relief plan is trying to put a dent in that. But challenges to the legality of the plan remain. Cami Twomey explains what\u2019s at stake at the Supreme Court.\n\nTuesday, the Supreme Court heard two arguments against Joe Biden\u2019s student debt forgiveness plan, which remains on hold after being blocked by the lower court last fall. Biden\u2019s Plan seeks to forgive up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for more than 40 million Americans due to the effects of the pandemic. His plan relies on the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, known as the HEROES Act, that grants the secretary of education the power to \u201cwaive or modify\u201d a federal student loan program in emergency situations.\n\nThe first lawsuit brought by six Republican led states, argues that the act would exceed the authority of the Department of Education. The second, was brought by two individual borrowers who did not qualify for full benefits under the program. The core question centers on whether the HEROES Act, grants the executive branch an emergency power to implement President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program in the wake of the Covid-19 Pandemic.\n\nRepresentative Jamaal Bowman, has been a staunch advocate for student debt relief. He argued that college should be free in the first place.\n\nBOWMAN: Why the hell are we paying for education in the first place? College should be free. Oh, you should pay us to go to school. Because guess what? When we get out, we are contributing to this society and this democracy and this economy and making it stronger.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch remained skeptical of the executive branch\u2019s authority to enact such a plan.\n\nGORSUCH: If you\u2019re going to give up that much amount of money, if you\u2019re going to affect the obligations of that many Americans on a subject that\u2019s of great controversy, they would think that\u2019s something for Congress to act on.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, led the conservative questioning against the act and argued that the cost of the program exceeded the benefits.\n\nROBERTS: Not just the cost of government. I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but what I think they argue that is missing is cost to other persons in terms of fairness... half a trillion dollars is being diverted to one group of favored persons over others.\n\nWith Republican justices holding the court majority, 6 to 3, it is likely that Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program will likely be struck down. The decision won\u2019t be released for months, with a decision expected by summer.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Cami Twomey.\n```"}

And so it ended up we still had a plan.\n\nAs of last week, Downtown L.A.\u2019s cumulative rainfall rose above its 14.25 inch average for an entire rain season -- which isn\u2019t over until the end of June.

And I got to my sorority house and I put my umbrella in the bucket at the front door. And then about an hour later, I went to leave. And the bucket was not the bucket. The umbrella was no longer there. I don\u2019t think it was a malicious stealing of an umbrella. I think that all black umbrellas look exactly the same and somebody just took it. But now I\u2019m umbrella-less.\n\nThis smattering of umbrellaless students may be the cause for what seems like a trend in class attendance ... or lack thereof.

But the worries varied across party lines.\n\nActivists call for gun control during a vigil in Monterey Park on Jan. 23. (Photo by Draco Guan)\n\nBy Caitlin Calfo February 28, 2023 at 4:25 pm PST\n\nGun violence is an unfortunate reality in America. Despite this, not everyone carries the same level of fear around shootings. Caitlin Calfo breaks down a recent UC Berkeley study on gun violence. In California, a mass shooting happens every 8.3 days...despite having the strictest gun laws in the nation. A new statewide poll from the University of California Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies comes weeks after a wave of deadly mass shootings this year. Nearly two-thirds of California voters surveyed worry that they or a loved one could become a victim of gun violence and that control over gun ownership matters more than protecting the second amendment. But these beliefs reveal a stark partisan divide, with Democrats more than twice as likely to feel concerned.\n\nPast studies have shown that fear of violent crime looms over both parties. But when it comes to guns, Republicans feel less threatened, according to Eric Schikler, the poll\u2019s co-director. This extreme difference in attitudes, says Schikler, emphasize how much guns contribute to political polarization in California and beyond. In fact, three in four Democrats worry that someone close to them could experience gun violence, compared to one in three Republicans. Among Republicans, only 10% believe that passing more gun laws will reduce mass shootings.\n\nWomen, people of color and voters living in urban areas are more likely than men, white voters and rural Californians to view gun violence as an eminent danger.

(Credit: ABC News )\n\nBy Jinge Li February 28, 2023 at  3:53 pm PST\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos believes journalists should always be ready to seize the moment. He put that idea to the test on a recent Thursday, surprising a student journalist with a call from his personal cell phone just 56 minutes after the reporter sent an interview request.\n\nStephanopoulos is the anchor of This Week and Good Morning America for ABC News, where he has worked since 1997. Prior to that, he freelanced for the nonprofit news organization Christian Science Monitor and served as White House communications director during the Clinton administration.\n\nIn this interview, Stephanopoulos shared his unique path to the news industry and gave advice on purposeful communication. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow did you get started in the news industry?\n\nI took an unusual path into this industry. [When] I first started journalism in college, I worked in my college radio station as a sportscaster. I did play-by-play for baseball and soccer. [Later] in graduate school, I did some freelance jobs for Christian Science Monitor and ended up getting hooked up with CBS Television, helping them do documentaries. But the first part of my career was actually in politics. I worked for the Michael Dukakis campaign in 1987 and 88. I went back to work for Dick Gephardt in Congress. And then, of course, I worked for Bill Clinton. I didn\u2019t get back into journalism until I left the administration after the first term in 1997, when I joined ABC News as a political analyst and contributor.\n\nHow did you transition from covering political news to becoming the anchor for GMA?\n\nI started out as an analyst at ABC News, [it] gave me the opportunity to learn how to become a reporter and anchor. I would do stories for the weekend news and I would fill in on the overnight shifts and anchoring and learn how to do it. [In 2002] I became This Week anchor, I did that till 2009 when ABC asked me to take over as anchor of Good Morning America. [This] was not something I was eager to do at first, I actually said no [to it] three times. But I ended up deciding it was the right thing for me to do and my family was okay moving to New York and I realized it would be a different challenge. And I\u2019ve been there ever since.\n\nCould you elaborate more on the different challenges?\n\n[For starters] it\u2019s two hours of live television every day versus once a week, [and] it\u2019s not just politics. It was all kinds of different stories. You\u2019ve got human interest, consumer, entertainment and the challenge [to me] was learning how to be myself and be authoritative as I dealt with a wider range of subject matters.\n\nHow does your background covering politics prepare you for the transition?\n\nWhat would always help me is that I always had a base of expertise to fall back on. My home base was [covering] politics, political analysis, and political news, and from the security of that home base, I was able to stretch [out to] cover other topics.\n\nCould you walk me through your preparation for the interview and how you build an interrelationship with your interviewee?\n\nA lot of it depends on what the interview [is] about and who the subject is. [When you] handle an interview with a politician who you\u2019re trying to hold accountable or someone who\u2019s in the news like  Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX , you\u2019re going to challenge them in a different way than interviewing [ a] mother [who recently] lost their child. [The] context and the subject matters [in a situation like this]. When I [interview] the president of the United States, I\u2019m going to do a lot of research, [try to] know everything that he has said about the subject at hand. And then I\u2019m going to work with my researchers, coming up with an outline and thinking through what are the two or three most important things I need to get out of the interview and [focus] on those.\n\nIn your masterclass, you talk about your interview with former  President Trump in his Oval Office . It wasn\u2019t something part of your plan, how did you recognize the moment and how do you capitalize on it?\n\nIt was instinct and preparation. Luckily I\u2019ve been in the Oval Office many times before because I worked for the president, so I wasn\u2019t as intimidated as others might be. But also, I realized that he was going off script, so I knew that I had to adjust as well. Take the shot there to get the answers that I needed to get and he was willing to go down that path [with me]. And, [that] wasn\u2019t even the main interview where we made all the news. But by seizing that moment, I was able to reveal something about the president and his plans.\n\nHow do you set your own opinion aside when pursuing a story?\n\nWhat I would do in those moments is to illuminate the issue for the viewers and let them make up their own minds. As for doing that, I never do anything or I would try never to do anything that would run against my beliefs or my values. But I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking the questions [that need] to be asked. Even tough ones to people that I generally agree with.\n\nWhat do you think of my interview with you?\n\nI like that you are prepared. I kind of surprised you with the call you weren\u2019t expecting at the moment, but you were ready to go. I think that\u2019s the sign of [being] a good journalist. You\u2019re always ready and you seize the moment.\n\nMore about these From the Classroom submissions: Students in an intro to reporting and writing course interviewed working journalists and asked their career advice and how they got their start.

Location: undisclosed due to request from source. Credit: Aadya Chidanand/USC.\n\nBy Aadya Chidanand\nFebruary 28, 2023 at 1:20 pm PST\n\nMy grandpa always told me to listen to life in its immediacy. To listen to the unpredictability. \u201cJust close your eyes. What do you hear?\u201d Born in a tiny, coastal village in southern India, I grew up listening to calm winds that carried the promise of afternoon rain. When I closed my eyes, I heard cicadas, peacocks, some woman yelling guarantees of fresh fish, and in the distance, I heard the crashing of waves in the ocean. There was always one sound I tried to ignore but couldn\u2019t \u2013\u2013 tourists.\n\nIn the summer when the sun dried our wells and the heat shredded our crops to dust, our roads would fill up with screeching tires and blaring honks. Unfamiliar faces would look at us through car windows and find us as strange and bizarre as we found them. Some pointed. Some took pictures. Most would roll down the windows to throw out their garbage. Our village, my village, soon became a passing landfill, somewhere they could get rid of their waste. A convenient dustbin en route to a sun-kissed beach.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about vacations, isn\u2019t it? You want them to be hassle-free and worry-free. To roam around without a care in the world. You want to sunbathe and watch the light sparkle on water or cozy up in a cabin atop a snowy mountain. You want to eat, laugh, take pictures and not fret about the unopened emails in your inbox. You want to escape life for a little bit.\n\nBut while you\u2019re exchanging the mundaneness of your daily life with thrill and a few cocktails in a location you deem exotic, you forget that stepping out of your life means that you\u2019re also stepping into someone else\u2019s. We tend to think life is all about us, forgetting that we aren\u2019t the main characters in every world we enter. Trust me, you were no main character. You were the villain of my story. And the stories of countless others.\n\nWhy is it important to be an ethical traveler? We, as travelers, have been graced with the gift of exploration. That yearning to go someplace new, that insatiable pull towards the unknown... It\u2019s pretty hard to beat. But we are also guests. Think about it. When you go over to someone\u2019s house as a guest, have you ever tried to kill their pet? Or looked around their house and belongings without their permission? Hopefully, you have not. And you did so out of consideration. Ethical travelers do the same. We don\u2019t behave like we have the right to act as we please, without any regard for someone else\u2019s feelings, culture or values.\n\nBeautiful places attract people, yes. But these places, these communities, often see tourists with disdain. Notice how I said tourists and not travelers. Why? Because many tourists: Are insensitive to the history and culture of the place. Take what they\u2019re not supposed to. Prefer the luxury of hotels that unfairly pay its workers, who are usually the locals who live there. Act and speak as though they\u2019re from a more advanced country and so, they end up sounding like a colonizer. Are not aware of the consequences of over-tourism and their impact on the environment and biodiversity of the area. Don\u2019t stop coming even when they\u2019re asked not to.\n\nHow to be an ethical traveler? I know this may seem like a little more work, especially when you\u2019re just trying to book flights and get the hell out of somewhere, but this will earn you something very few tourists have \u2013\u2013 respect and the title of \u201ctraveler.\u201d\n\nBefore booking your flights, make sure to read up on the tourist scene of the place you\u2019re going to. Or ask a friend who\u2019s been there. Or a friend of a friend. When places like Santorini, Machu Picchu or Hawai\u2019i are struggling with over-tourism, refrain from going there. There are 195 countries in the world to choose from.\n\n2. Learn about what the locals expect out of tourists. When they tell you not to touch the wildlife, don\u2019t touch them. This is more to protect the animals than to save ourselves, but these wild animals are in their natural habitats, and it\u2019s important to be respectful of their space too. When they tell you to not take anything from their land (volcanic rock from Hawai\u2019i or coral from the Andamans), don\u2019t take it. What you try to smuggle through airport security is of much more value in the place you found it than on a shelf in your room. Remember the British Museum has \u201csamples\u201d from all over the world and they were colonizers. Don\u2019t be like them.\n\n3. Buy from locally run businesses. Don\u2019t go to the largest, tackiest shop run by a non-local. Don\u2019t buy souvenirs at the airport. Show your support by buying locally-made items. You get authentic items and you help someone out.\n\n4. Be responsible for your trash. It\u2019s 2023. Do you really need me to tell you not to litter? To dispose of your waste in a trash can?\n\n5. Don\u2019t do stupid things to look cool. Do you remember that one person who jumped a barricade to take a cool selfie and plummeted to their death? Yeah, don\u2019t do that. Common sense is the new cool. Don\u2019t take pictures of locals or with them without permission. They\u2019re not animals in a zoo. If you do see someone you\u2019d like to photograph, go up to them. Say hello. Tell them you dig their look. Ask politely if you could photograph them, and always ask how you can send these pictures to them.\n\n6. Respect the cultural values of any place you visit. Dress appropriately. Yes, you may be on vacation but you gain nothing by openly flouting their cultural norms or making them all uncomfortable. This is especially important if you\u2019re visiting religious sites. If the native language isn\u2019t English, learn a little of theirs. Hello, please, and thank you is a good place to start.\n\nParting words\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do all these things. You don\u2019t have to unlearn certain problematic behavior. But if you choose to be a little more sensitive on your next vacation, then you\u2019ll have a more warm and welcoming experience. Locals would love to host you again! They become not acquaintances, but friends and family. So pack your bags, read up, and get out there in this big, beautiful world. And when you look out your car window and see someone standing in their yard, offer a smile and wave. Then you won\u2019t be a tourist anymore. You\u2019ll be a traveler.\n\nCredit: Aadya Chidanand/USC.\n```"}

But just like the carnival ride, the album is extremely redundant. It doesn\u2019t have any striking developments or provide anything more value than his previous work, similar to the cyclical nature of the tunnel of love.\n\nIt seems like Toliver is attempting to progress aesthetically. For instance, this album is flooded with futuristic and psychedelic instrumentals with abundant atmospheric synths. These instrumentals provide the listener with an out-of-this-world experience instead of solely using traditional trap beats like in his last two albums. All in all, it just seems like the album lacks cohesion and consistency.\n\nHowever, there are few diamonds in the rough that make this album worth listening to, like \u201cLet Her Go,\u201d where Toliver teams up with singer James Blake. Toliver exhibits his vocal versatility here, shifting between a trap flow and a smooth R&B melody throughout his verse. The back-and-forth between Toliver and Blake is also so infectious as both artists use their angelic voices to create a heavenly aesthetic. I\u2019m eager to hear more about the Toliver-Blake duo.\n\nApart from the diamond \u201cLet Her Go,\u201d the album goes downhill. \u201c4 Me,\u201d featuring his girlfriend Kali Uchis, is a prime example of why the album is not his greatest work. In theory, a track with his lover should fit the love-struck vibe of the album, but instead, it feels overly saturated with affection. Uchis and Toliver\u2019s vocals are inviting, but the song\u2019s energy feels way too lovey-dovey lyrically and sonically to the point where it seems both artists are trying too hard to be big-hearted.\n\nThe production in this track is all over the place, as there is so much commotion in the background, which is simply irritating. It lacks some of the early tracks\u2019 heavenly aesthetic, makings it feel out of place and not nearly as contagious to the ear.\n\nSimilarly, in \u201cBus Stop,\u201d featuring singer Brent Faiyez, Toliver again includes this messy production. There are infinite layers of background vocals that feel like he\u2019s trying to put a square peg in a round hole. It just doesn\u2019t fit. The lyrics of the track do not make it any less annoying. The repetition of \u201cOkay, what about the girl in the drop-top / With the lollipop at the light, by the bus stop,\u201d tries to create this vibe of a 70s romantic comedy with the desirable, popular girl in a vintage convertible. This storyline is presented in Toliver\u2019s short film, \u201cLove Sick: Open All Day, Every Night,\u201d which was introduced in the album\u2019s rollout.\n\nHowever, the delivery is very corny in the track and the film. I respect Toliver for experimenting, but \u201cLove Sick\u201d feels as if he put more effort into creating a unique aesthetic than creating the actual music itself.\n\n\u201cLove Sick\u201d is available to stream on Apple Music, Spotify and other streaming services.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Ethan Huang, Julia Zara, and Brandon A. Garcia\nFebruary 28, 2023 at 8:42 am PST\n\nIn the winter months, residential assistant Rocky Rivera must often choose between cold and comfort. A senior business administration student who works as an RA at New North Residential College, Rivera has tried his best to endure February\u2019s frigid temperatures. But the latest cold front to blast through Southern California has made living comfortably in the dormitory even harder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very cold. There\u2019s no other way to say it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also has a smell about the building. And so you tend to want to keep your windows open, keep the air and the ventilation running through. But, of course, that makes it colder. It\u2019s like choosing the lesser of two evils.\u201d\n\nWhen Rivera chooses to face the cold, time spent in his dorm room looks like having multiple blankets and wearing socks at night. He\u2019s not the only student struggling to brace the cold.\n\nFollowing an emergency blizzard warning issued by the Los Angeles National Weather Service last week \u2013 California\u2019s first blizzard warning since 1983 \u2013 torrential rain, hail, and temperatures ranging from the mid-40s to the high 30s impacted South Los Angeles. This downpour and surprise cold front upends the saying that many Californians are all too familiar with: \u201cIt Never Rains in Southern California.\u201d\n\nLow temperatures raise concerns for students living on campus, particularly freshmen and resident assistants without centralized heating or air conditioning. Buildings without these amenities include halls like Birnkrant, Marks Tower, Pardee Tower, and New North. Many USC students must find ways to stay warm without heating systems.\n\nMikayla Ashe, a freshman TV and production major living in Birnkrant Residential College, doesn\u2019t mind having a chilly dorm room. However, she still prepares for colder nights.\n\n\u201cIf it gets too cold, you throw on an extra blanket or a sweater,\u201d Ashe said.\n\nHowever, the lack thereof in other buildings is surprising for students who have access to heating. Dana Hernandez, a freshman law, history, and culture major living in McCarthy Honors Residential College, has access to both heating and air. Her close friend \u2013 who lives in Pardee Tower \u2013 is not as lucky.\n\n\u201cOne time I went over to her dorm, and it was really, really cold,\u201d Hernandez said. She even considered offering her friend a space in her suite with an air mattress, hoping it would help her escape the extreme cold during the winter and heat during the fall.\n\n\u201cI was like, it\u2019s freezing in here... and she [already] had like three heaters,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nAccording to Rivera, these kinds of miniature space heaters violate the residential housing contract.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t actually allow space heaters in the dorms for fire reasons or safety reasons because it is a fire hazard,\u201d Rivera said.\n\nBut without heating, many students must default to having personal heating items, such as space heaters, heated blankets, and hand warmers. Hernandez said that access to heating should be made available to all students, regardless of the dorm they live in because it impacts their quality of life.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine having to go through that on a daily basis. Obviously, that would affect your sleep, and sleep is something that you need,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe\u2019re here for school and academics, and [a good night\u2019s sleep] is essential to being able to function properly in an academic setting.\u201d\n\nWhile the public lounges of freshman dorms have air conditioning, the individual rooms lack thermostats, leaving students with no way of knowing the internal temperature of the building.\n\nPast the red brick bubble of USC student housing, rental housing in the greater Los Angeles area must meet a heating requirement. According to Sec. 91.8111 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, any rental or leased building needs heating units \u201ccapable of maintaining a room temperature of 70\u00b0F at a point three feet above the floor in all habitable rooms.\u201d\n\nFor places where tenants are unable to activate heating facilities, LA code requires the owner to \u201cactivate the heating facilities whenever the residential unit temperature is 70\u00b0F or less.\u201d\n\nWhile this code presents an ideal regulation for off-campus households \u2013 like those in the broader South Central community \u2013 this is not always the case. USC alumnus Austin Peay lived in a house off-campus that had been built in the late 19th century, one that didn\u2019t follow the LA code.\n\n\u201cOur landlord had done some renovations to the place, but from what I remember, either due to its historic designation or other restrictions, it was poorly insulated and did not have AC or central heating,\u201d Peay said. \u201cSo during the winter months, it was particularly chilly, and during the summer the house was swelteringly hot.\u201d\n\nPeay is not alone. It wasn\u2019t until 1975 that Californian residences began requiring exterior wall insulation, meaning that many of the homes built prior to that aren\u2019t equipped to deal with bitter temperatures. If that\u2019s the case, it should be noted that Birnkrant Residential College was built in 1963. It\u2019s unclear whether or not it has been retrofitted to fit the standard insulation code.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the process of acclimatization \u2013 when the human body adjusts its internal temperature to balance the temperature of its surroundings \u2013 takes about two weeks to normalize after exposure to a harsh temperature. Hence, with LA\u2019s constantly changing weather conditions \u2013 from the high-70s one week to the mid-40s the next \u2013 Southern Californians simply aren\u2019t used to the cold, down to an exact science.\n\nThe lack of heating and air in freshman dorms can be traced to the university\u2019s sustainable Energy Program, which utilizes a \u201ccost-effective approach to energy conservation\u201d that \u201cfocuses primarily on building-system efficiency.\u201d\n\nEspecially because a winter storm is expected to hit areas of high elevation in Southern California, like Ventura county, students said equitable access to heating is necessary.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re not choosing where they want to live,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cSo placing them in a dorm where there aren\u2019t systems to keep them cool when it\u2019s hot or warm and it\u2019s cold just doesn\u2019t seem right. Obviously, I don\u2019t know what goes into it. But if you put systems in place in these older dorms to help the residents, that\u2019d be nice.\u201d```"}

And which first basemen am I targeting?\n\nIn the 2022 season, Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman hit 23 homers, while returning to a 19.5 average launch angle. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza February 27, 2023 at 7:13 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe Strikeout\u201d is a column by Diego Ynzunza dedicated to all things fantasy baseball. Welcome to the third week of \u201cThe Strikeout.\u201d This week, I\u2019ll be previewing first and third base for 2023. In general, I\u2019m looking to get surefire production from third base early. Your choices will fade quickly, so I\u2019m looking to use one of my first five picks to get one, with the exception of one guy who is going a bit later. For first base, the position runs a bit deeper. Even if you wait until you get to the pick 150 range, you can find good value down there.\n\nStarting with my top 10 at first base, I see it stacking up as follows: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Freddie Freeman Paul Goldschmidt Pete Alonso Matt Olson Nathaniel Lowe Anthony Rizzo Rhys Hoskins Christian Walker Luis Arraez\n\nFor third base, this is how I see things playing out: Jose Ramirez Manny Machado Rafael Devers Nolan Arenado Bobby Witt Jr. Austin Riley Alex Bregman Max Muncy Gunnar Henderson Eugenio Suarez\n\nFor first base, I\u2019m privy to Paul Goldschmidt. Goldy put up an MVP year last year, and I believe people are expecting him to regress. In reality, he\u2019s been very consistent and put up similar numbers to 2022 in almost every season since 2013. His NFC ADP of 26 is a steal for the production he will offer. However, I\u2019d like to take a deeper look at Christian Walker\u2019s numbers. Walker has quietly put up tremendous numbers. Last year was by far his best, as he put up 36 homers and 94 RBI, all while walking more than he ever has. I find it intriguing that his best year came when he had a career-low K and Chase percentage. If he continues on that same trajectory, I can see him coming close to last year\u2019s numbers. The counting stats will most likely stay similar to last year as well with the addition of guys like Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Gabriel Moreno and the emergence of top prospect Corbin Carroll to provide him some protection in the lineup.\n\nAs far as late sleepers, I\u2019m looking to target Isaac Paredes. Paredes is typically going late in leagues, just barely inside the top 400. He\u2019s eligible at first, second and third base, so he can offer up some much-needed positional eligibility. In just 381 plate appearances last year, he slugged 20 homers. The power is accompanied by a K% in the 73rd percentile, as well as a Chase Rate in the 94th percentile. He also plays tremendous defense, which will most definitely keep him on the field. I see Paredes as a 20+ homer, big slugging type, late-round dart who can provide multi-position eligibility with a bit of upside in terms of counting stats, just because of how much he walks.\n\nAs I said previously, third base is tricky. I\u2019d really like to deep dive into Alex Bregman, to see if there is any possibility of him returning top-five position value. Bregman will begin 2023 at 28, right in the middle of his prime. Last year was a mini return to form for the former All-Star, after a couple of years when he performed below his career norms. He was able to elevate the ball closer to his 2019 levels by hitting 23 homers returning to a 19.5 average launch angle \u2014 a vast improvement from 2020 and 2021. He sports a good amount of red on his Baseball Savant page, even in the years in which he underperformed. He\u2019s always been well above average in K%, BB% and Chase Rate. He will likely always boast excellent counting stats, as he sits in the middle of one of the best line-ups in baseball. The BAT X on FanGraphs projects Bregman to be the second-best third baseman in baseball, just behind Jose Ramirez. While I would still probably take Ramirez and Machado over him, I think there\u2019s a tremendous possibility to wait to get Bregman. He\u2019s going to perform similarly to Nolan Arenado and Rafael Devers, two guys going more than 50 picks ahead of him. If I miss out on one of the top-five third basemen, Bregman will not be a consolation prize for me at his NFC ADP of 76.\n\nA deep-round third baseman I\u2019m targeting is Gio Urshela. Urshela is reuniting with his former hitting coach, Phil Plantier. Plantier was the Yankees\u2019 Triple-A hitting coach when Urshela was with them in 2018, and he credits Plantier with a lot of his career resurgence. In general, Plantier was able to tap into Urshela\u2019s pull-side power, which led to his career high of 21 home runs in 2019. If he can tap back into that, he has an upside of 20 home runs, while maintaining his floor of a .260 batting average. Even if Urshela isn\u2019t hitting the ball out, he will provide a good batting average, as well as decent counting stats. He currently sports an NFC ADP of 446, so I\u2019m looking to get him with one of my last picks. The only issue for him is playing time. The Angels currently have a crowded infield, with the likes of Anthony Rendon, David Fletcher and Luis Rengifo competing for time. If Urshela is producing, I don\u2019t see him struggling to get at-bats. If anything, he could gain multi-position eligibility if Rendon is holding down third base.\n\nThanks for joining me for this week\u2019s edition of The Strikeout. Next week, I\u2019ll be diving into second base and shortstop. \u201cThe Strikeout\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo by Philip Salata)\n\nBy Brooklyn Blasscyk, Maddy Brown and Chuck White\nFebruary 27, 2023 at 6:38 pm PST\n\nAfter an overwhelming vote to form a union earlier this month, USC graduate students are preparing for their next steps in officially signing a contract. The vote results mean that graduate student workers employed by the university can now begin to advocate for better working conditions on a larger scale.\n\nOn February 17, graduate workers voted 1,599 to 122 in favor of forming a union with United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. This win by a 93% margin is a testament to their belief in the lack of workers\u2019 rights from the university.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can get this contract up and running as fast as possible with the university,\u201d said Piril Nergis, a second-year electrical engineering research assistant.\n\nUSC\u2019s Graduate Student Workers Organizing Committee reached out to UAW in 2020 to request their help in successfully forming a union. As one of the largest and most diverse unions in North America, UAW has been joined by over 100,000 employees in higher education from multiple universities across the country, including UCLA, Harvard and Columbia.\n\nWith the finalization of the vote behind them, GSWOC-UAW now intends to negotiate with USC to obtain better working conditions. Third-year Ph.D. student Ellen Herschel has been involved in organizing and outreach for GSWOC since 2020. She said the next steps in this process are electing a committee to bargain that is \u201crepresentative of the graduate student body.\u201d They also plan on \u201csurveying all graduate students for the main goals to focus on within bargaining.\u201d\n\nAccording to GSWOC\u2019s website, graduate student workers at USC \u201clack secure rights and protections in the workplace\u201d and \u201cstruggle with low pay and high housing costs, inadequate health care and increasing uncertainty about [their] futures.\u201d\n\nNergis said that bargaining could last anywhere from four to 18 months, depending on how cooperative the university is. They said that it\u2019s a common process for universities to stall.\n\nIn an article published by GSWOC-UAW in October of last year, USC graduate students detailed alleged examples of misconduct against them from USC faculty. The report included allegations that faculty members had bullied, verbally abused and discriminated against many graduate student workers \u2014 some claimed that they had been required to go grocery shopping for their advisors during the pandemic and been told to \u201cshut up\u201d during meetings.\n\nNergis said that based on preliminary surveys from 960 graduates and workers, the most common form of harassment was in regard to international students. \u201cIt\u2019s very common in our department of electrical engineering for faculty advisors to dangle international students\u2019 visas over their heads to make them work more,\u201d Nergis said.\n\nSince the election, there has been little response from the university. They emailed graduate students, but Herschel and Nergis expect communication to start once an official plan is made for bargaining.\n\nThe provost\u2019s office did not provide a statement to Annenberg Media in regard to the voting or the next steps in the process. However, in an email from Interim Vice Provost for Academic and Faculty Affairs Kelvin J.A. Davies to the faculty, he clarifies, \u201cthe University must maintain the status quo with respect to graduate student terms and conditions of employment.\u201d\n\nAlong with not being able to adhere to any of the graduate students\u2019 demands prior to negotiations, the provost\u2019s office also said that faculty \u201cmust avoid\u201d talking with students about \u201cpay, terms of employment, benefits and other working conditions.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s graduate students were inspired by the efforts of organized academic workers during the University of California strike of 2022. The strike, which lasted six weeks and was also aided by UAW, yielded improved working conditions, including significant wage gains, increased child care and protections against workplace harassment.\n```"}

(Photo by Peter Makk)\n\nBy Peter Makk, Sixx Orange and Michael Pincus\nFebruary 27, 2023 at 6:24 pm PST\n\nThe Music Complex building at Thornton was closed indefinitely on Monday after heavy rainfall flooded the building\u2019s mechanical room, blowing the main power transformer and causing a power outage. \u201cWe are hoping to only be down for this week, but it may be shorter or longer depending on how fast many of the building systems can be repaired and examined,\u201d said Thornton operations manager Marvin Munson. \u201cIn the meantime, we are asking classes to be online this week or trying to find alternate meeting spaces.\u201d\n\nStudents were notified via email by Interim Dean Josh Kun that the building was completely without power \u2014 HVAC, card readers, phones, and restroom services are all still inoperative. Continuity plans for classes, lessons and office work are contingent on the upcoming week while USC Facilities Management and Restoration Services work to get the building functional again.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that USC has to deal with this level of rain damage. According to the Los Angeles Almanac, Downtown L.A.\u2019s cumulative rainfall for this season sits at 14.27 inches \u2014 two inches more than normal for an entire season, with four months left to go.\n\n\u201cThe standing water was isolated to an electrical room, which is why the power went out,\u201d said Munson. \u201cThere is no other standing water \u2014 that was pumped out. The main problem preventing classes right now [is] the lack of electricity.\u201d\n\nUSC facilities personnel are scrambling to fix the damage and reinstate electricity. Acquiring the equipment needed has stalled the process. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to several vendors right now and seeing how quick[ly] they can turn around some of the equipment that we need,\u201d said USC construction traders supervisor Raul Martinez. \u201cThere are other trades that are involved also, and it depends on how quickly they can get their equipment that they need to replace.\u201d\n\nHowever, these students know how to make do with these difficult circumstances all too well. Many have become accustomed to hybrid learning during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 some are just now taking their first in-person classes. \u201cThese students have been through a lockdown, most of them,\u201d said Professor Andy Abad, who is an adjunct instructor at Thornton. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s not completely foreign to them. But if it turned into several weeks, I would assume that the sense of frustration from them would increase because they want one-on-one instruction.\u201d\n\nWith midterm season in full swing, this prior knowledge of remote learning will work in their favor and hopefully alleviate some stress during their exams. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t affect it too much. We\u2019ve all had online classes in the past,\u201d said Aspen Jacobsen, a freshman studying popular music performance with a songwriting emphasis at Thornton. \u201cThe practice rooms in University Gateway were unaffected, so we still have practice spaces for midterms.\u201d\n\nAccording to an email from Phillip Placenti, the school\u2019s associate dean for admission and student affairs, the affected spaces will be reopened within a week. However, it is difficult to say for sure at this time, as they are still awaiting more information.\n```"}

Due to damage from recent weather, the School of Music has been forced to conduct classes online. Here is Nataly Lozano with the story.\n\nWhile Los Angeles attempts to recover from the unusually powerful winter storms, all electricity is out at the main building of the Thornton School of Music called The Music Complex building. The building is expected to be closed for at least a week, perhaps longer.\n\nThe beat goes on \u2014 classes have been moved online, but Zoom is not optimal for music students. You know, the audio on Zoom is not exactly high fidelity music quality. With the building closed, Thornton students are concerned about missing rehearsal and class time. They need to prepare and practice for their upcoming midterms.\n\nFiona Kessler: I actually was supposed to have my drumming midterm this week, Sophomore music industries major Fiona Kessler plays electric drums! But not at Thornton this week! Fiona Kessler: but because they are an electrical drum kit, we\u2019re unable to use them and therefore unable to prepare and actually play for my midterm and. That class specifically two was held on Zoom and. It\u2019s very challenging to learn drums and progress in the class when you can\u2019t physically play the instrument.\n\nKessler has lived in L.A. all her life. Fiona Kessler: We\u2019ve never really been able to take on these extreme weather conditions. The city really isn\u2019t built for such strong conditions and it usually doesn\u2019t have to deal with it. So that\u2019s why I think we were seeing a lot of flooding this past weekend. Water got into the circuits at Thornton. That\u2019s what caused the electricity to go out. Much of L.A.\u2019s sewage system is 80 years old, and not built to accommodate the millions of people who live here today.\n\nPerformance majors have been the most affected since the building closed. Asia Fuqua studies popular music performance, but not for now in the Thornton building. Asia Fuqua: I\u2019m just surprised, honestly, that the storm took it down because I feel like it wasn\u2019t that big of a storm and the building probably should have been better prepared for that. And that maybe says something about the amount of money that they\u2019ve put into certain renovations and things like that.\n\nAlthough not all majors and classes at Thornton have been affected, USC is coming up with alternative spaces that music students can use. More rain is expected this week, but despite these weather conditions, Thornton students play on\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nataly Lozano.\n```"}

Sara Kahn has the story.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the lives of Ukrainian citizens changed forever as Russian rockets were fired into the country. Over a year later, the conflict is ongoing. Annenberg Media covered the breaking news story in 2022 and has continued to follow it in the past year.\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of the invasion, Annenberg Media is following up on the story with a testimonial from a Ukrainian student. Masha Shevchuk is an international student from Ukraine whose life has been severely altered as a result of the conflict overseas. While her father, grandparents, and other loved ones are in Ukraine, her mother moved to the United States to find employment.\n\nFor the past year, Shevchuk\u2019s life has been riddled with anxiety about the goings on at home in Ukraine. She recounts how she first heard about the start of the war last February.\n\nMasha Shevchuk: It was 11 p.m. But I saw the first messages and kind of like, weird to me, messages about what\u2019s going on in Ukraine. I started to text my mom and dad, \u2018Is everything okay?\u2019. And they said \u2018No, the war started. We just woke up because of the rockets.\u2019\n\nBeing so far from home has affected Shevchuk\u2019s view of the conflict. She remembers what Ukraine was like before the war and has been unable to go back home since.\n\nMasha Shevchuk: Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to imagine because I wasn\u2019t there when the war started. And I remember my home country as it was at that moment. And everything that I see is just like photos from Ukraine, and it\u2019s hard for me to imagine that it\u2019s real.\n\nShevchuk\u2019s own family, specifically her grandfather, have faced direct repercussions as a result of the war. One of her mother\u2019s friends was watching the Russian news and saw that the TV and radio station where Shevchuk\u2019s grandfather works was being targeted. Thanks to that tip, Shevchuk\u2019s grandfather and his employees were saved.\n\nMasha Shevchuk: My grandparent asked all his employees to go, to go home, and he went to the bomb shelter. And the rockets bombed the plant and the plant was ruined partially. But all his employees were saved because of my mom\u2019s friend.\n\nThis togetherness and cooperation between Ukrainian people has served as an emblem of hope for Shevchuk to hold onto. In this time of severe hardship for her country, she still remembers the beauty of her home.\n\nMasha Shevchuk: Ukrainian people, their unity and generally like mentality, Culture, food, everything of this, like even places-- infrastructure is a lot different from here. So sometimes I\u2019m just going to Google, just Google Maps to see my house from the photo.\n\nThe war has not only affected Shevchuk\u2019s personal life, but her education as well. When the conflict began, she was studying at a university in Florida. Due to financial hardship as a result of the war, she was unable to continue her studies there. Luckily, USC was able to provide both a home and an education for her.\n\nMasha Shevchuk: I had like problems with housing because I literally couldn\u2019t afford housing there. And my mom came to me, so and we found volunteers at USC that helped us with housing for summer. And we were living in the USC dorms for the whole summer. And then during the summer I was able to transfer to USC and got a scholarship.\n\nShevchuk is one of many Ukrainians affected by the war and her story serves as a reminder of the immense hardship being felt abroad. As the conflict in Ukraine continues, there are ways for USC students to help.\n\nMasha Shevchuk: I keep donating and helping like whatever I can and just like generally supporting workers and respecting all the refugees that come to the U.S., it\u2019s very helpful for us and we really appreciate it a lot.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sara Kahn.\n```"}

A change of status that will bring essential funding support to the group.\n\nBy Shaudeh Farjami, Dana Hammerstrom, and Matt Chen\nFebruary 27, 2023 at 5:46 pm PST\n\nExpressions, a student dance company on campus has recently managed to become recognized as a recreational sport by USC. This new status, which allows for increased opportunities for funding, provides a huge relief to its members. Matt Chen has the story.\n\nUSC student-powered Xpressions Dance Company lands the leap in securing their name as an official recreational sport on campus. After being voted in by the recreational council, Xpressions is now eligible for financial support from the university. Under the fearless 6-director leadership team, the company is meeting financial and creative goals this semester.\n\nUntil this month, the Xpressions Dance Company secured all funding themselves by collecting $75 in dues per semester from all 35 dancers. However, booking USC\u2019s Bovard Auditorium for their semi-annual showcase calls for $3500 -- leaving the group about $900 short each semester. Additionally, Xpressions does not charge USC students to attend their shows, making finances even tighter for members.\n\nIn previous semesters, the company resorted to fundraising through the sale of various baked goods, along with scouring USC\u2019s Undergraduate Student Government\u2019s Judicial Board for more support. However, the cha-cha for cash may finally come to an end.\n\nNow that the team has the foundational support of the recreational council on campus, its leaders are hopeful that more funding will enable a seamless showcase and a decrease in overall angst for members.\n\nJunior Xpressions Dancer Kate Hammond spoke about the grueling process of becoming a rec sport.\n\nKate Hammond: we struggled with obtaining rehearsal rooms, and we\u2019ve been able to rent Kaufman but sometimes that doesn\u2019t work, so you\u2019d have to be a minor, and then we\u2019ll go into PED, but you can\u2019t rent those rooms out unless you\u2019re in a rec sport, I\u2019m pretty sure, so we\u2019d get kicked out of rooms all the time.\n\nUsually the money Xpressions saved throughout the semester would waltz its way to renting out the auditorium, but this will change with the new funding.\n\nKate Hammond: Normally it goes towards renting out Bovard for the show because it is a few thousand dollars to rent it out. And I\u2019m pretty sure now that\u2019s included in being a rec sport is that they\u2019ll rent it out for you for one or two semesters.\n\nHammond also touched on some benefits that Xpressions will gain from joining rec sports.\n\nKate Hammond: I think it just allows us to first of all perform without having the huge stress of having to rent out Bovard with our own money and company money, and also just like, obtain rooms to rehearse in, and practice in without like being stressed that they\u2019re like, kick us out or like, we don\u2019t really have like a space to practice.\n\nThis semester\u2019s showcase will be held April 8th in Bovard Auditorium, featuring 13 choreographed numbers as well as a full-company piece to close the show.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this step may pave the way for USC\u2019s other dance groups to achieve better funding underneath Rec Sport\u2019s umbrella.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Matt Chen.\n```"}

We are only two weeks away from Selection Sunday, and the craziest season in recent memory continues to shock the world, including three Top-10 upsets on Saturday alone. With that being said, here are my top headlines.\n\nThe Big 12 is the best conference, and it isn\u2019t even close\nThere are 10 teams in the Big 12 (I know it\u2019s a bit confusing), and eight of them are currently in Joe Lunardi\u2019s most recent Bracketology, six of which are a No. 6 seed or better. You may say, \u201cBut, Terence, the Big Ten has nine projected teams in March Madness.\u201d I\u2019m here to tell you that the Big Ten is a big fat bowl of mediocrity. The top of the Big Ten is No. 5 Purdue, who is 24-5, but just got swept by in-state rival No. 15 Indiana. There are four 20-win teams in the Big Ten, then a whole lot of teams between 16 and 19 wins. The top of the Big Ten has a bunch of infighting, which allows a mediocre team like Michigan to be tied for third in the conference, despite being terrible outside of conference play.\n\nThe Big 12, on the other hand, pretty much dominated their non-conference schedule, including a 7-3 victory over the SEC during the SEC-Big 12 Challenge. The bottom team in the conference, Oklahoma, waxed No. 2 Alabama 93-69 when the two faced off. The conference contains the two reigning national champions, Baylor and Kansas, who are both projected top three seeds in Bracketology, and I could see either one winning again this year. The middle of the conference also could knock off anyone in college basketball, with teams like TCU and Kansas State surging. I said in my very first edition of \u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d that I could realistically see six teams winning the Big 12 tournament. Now I could genuinely see nine teams \u2014 the only one I don\u2019t think can, is West Virginia. But teams like Texas Tech, who started off the season 10-2 before getting to conference play, very much could make a run in their conference tournament. All I know is that I\u2019m excited for the Big 12 tournament.\n\nThe NCAA tournament bubble is boiling over\nAs usual, as we get closer to March Madness, the NCAA tournament bubble, which includes teams who are either just in or out, starts to get airtight. So let\u2019s look at some of how those teams did this weekend. The teams I will focus on are USC, North Carolina, Mississippi State and West Virginia.\n\nShockingly enough, USC has the most wins out of all these teams, yet a few bad losses keep them in the play-in-game spot. However, the Trojans are now peaking at the right time with four straight wins. The Trojans are back to full strength with no major injuries, which is huge, as they are 8-1 when at full strength, with that one loss coming at No. 8 Arizona. In my opinion, the key to Trojans\u2019 success is winning out, and you\u2019re in. USC plays at home this week against Arizona and Arizona State, and if they win, they are in.\n\nNorth Carolina has by far been the greatest disappointment of this season after starting the season as preseason No. 1. The Tar Heels are currently projected as a First Four Out by Joe Lunardi. If they miss the tournament, they will be the first preseason No. 1 to miss the tournament. However, UNC picked up a huge win over No. 6 Virginia on Saturday, which will bolster their resume. Nonetheless, I still think they will need to make a deep run in the ACC tournament if they want to hear their name called on Selection Sunday.\n\nMississippi State is another team that just picked up a much-needed win but will most likely need to make a run in the SEC tournament if they want to make it to March Madness. The Bulldogs just beat a solid No. 24 Texas A&M squad on Saturday. Earlier in the season, they picked up wins over No. 22 TCU and No. 6 Marquette, their main driving arguments for the tournament, combatting some poor losses, including Drake and a 30-point steamrolling by No. 12 Tennessee. If they want to get into the NCAA tournament, Mississippi State will have to finish strong.\n\nWest Virginia is on the lesser side of my personal bubble watch. The Mountaineers, I think, are receiving an insane amount of undeserving Big 12 bias, as they have only one win over a ranked opponent and are 5-11 in Big 12 conference play. That being said, West Virginia plays Iowa State tonight, and on Thursday, they play No. 11 Kansas State. If West Virginia can win those games, I think the selection committee will put them in, even if I don\u2019t believe they fully deserve it.\n\nThis next week, I am looking forward to No. 4 UCLA vs. No. 8 Arizona on Saturday and all the mid-major conference tournaments starting this week because although some consider them unimportant, they signify that March is right around the corner.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Jeff Lorch)\n\nBy Charlotte Phillipp February 27, 2023 at 1:35 pm PST\n\nWhat does it mean to be an artist? How do you stay true to your work while toeing the line between art and business? How do you create without hurting the ones you love? The Pasadena Playhouse\u2019s stellar new production of James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cSunday in the Park with George\u201d sets out to answer these very questions.\n\nSet on the literal backdrop of Georges Seurat\u2019s \u201cA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,\u201d the first act follows Graham Phillips as the renowned painter and Krystina Alabado as Dot, his muse, as he sketches people sitting by the water on the island \u2014 all of whom become still images in the painting.\n\nThe show, which opened on Sunday as the first mainstage production of the Playhouse\u2019s season-long \u201cSondheim Celebration,\u201d is a continuation of the 2017 Broadway production, which originally starred Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford. Directed by Sarna Lapine, who also directed the 2017 show and is the niece of James Lapine, the production takes a somewhat minimalist approach to the musical.\n\nThe staging is simple, the set pieces are minimal and many of the costumes \u2014 although they use traditional period silhouettes \u2014 are more color blocked instead of ornately detailed like the original 1984 production\u2019s costumes. The production\u2019s austere direction also makes stunning use of projection, designed by projection designer Tal Yarden, to show Seurat sketching, erasing and painting in real time.\n\nAs he messes up, black and white sketches fade away behind the actors, and in numbers like the phenomenally performed \u201cColor and Light,\u201d the audience sees Seurat\u2019s infamous Pointillist dots appear as he paints on stage. This kind of staging also allows for a fascinating new look at James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim\u2019s 1984 work from a modern lens.\n\nIn 2023, it\u2019s quite possibly more difficult than ever to create art and make a living from it, and Phillips perfectly captures Seurat\u2019s tortured artist persona that rings all the more true today, especially to any theatre artist in the audience. However, unlike other actors who have played Seurat, Phillips allows more empathy for the character than he sometimes gets in productions of \u201cSunday.\u201d\n\nThe sadness and difficulty that comes with being an artist\u2019s muse shine through in this production as well \u2014 Alabado\u2019s performance as Dot is heart-wrenching and powerful. Audience members audibly gasp upon hearing the news that Dot is pregnant or when it\u2019s revealed that George has painted over her sketch with a different model.\n\nIn act two, Seurat\u2019s great-grandson struggles with the same issues faced 100 years prior as he speaks at the Art Institute of Chicago (where the real \u201cA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\u201d resides today). This century, he deals with a boring, corporate art world as he struggles to balance taking on commissions to live while also creating something new and exciting.\n\nThis act is particularly where scenic designer Beowulf Boritt and lighting designer Ken Billington\u2019s work shines through. When George reveals his \u201cchromolume\u201d (or rather, his seventh chromolume as he struggles to come up with something new and his assistant considers leaving him to work at NASA), all the stage lights dim to reveal a fantastic light show, where rigs descend from the ceiling from all sides of the Playhouse\u2019s theater. The display is stunning \u2014 until it\u2019s shut down in a smokey explosion.\n\nThis production revitalizes and adds new conversations to an already fascinating work of theatre, particularly because of the newly reinvigorated love for Sondheim since his passing, as well as the fact that it\u2019s being produced in Los Angeles in 2023. As the show argues, corporate culture and art are constantly at odds with each other, but in a city such as this where so many people must try to make a living, creating art is what can keep you going.\n\n\u201cSunday in the Park with George\u201d is on stage at the Pasadena Playhouse now through March 19.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nFebruary 26, 2023 at 7:10 pm PST\n\nKyle Busch took the lead late and didn\u2019t look back on his way to winning the Pala Casino 400 Sunday at Auto Club Speedway in its last race as a two-mile track. The win marked the 19th straight year in which Kyle Busch won a race in the Cup Series, breaking a tie for most consecutive years with a win, which he held with \u201cThe King\u201d \u2014 Richard Petty.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not very many records that you can beat that Richard Petty has,\u201d Busch said. \u201cCertainly that was one that I set early on a long, long time ago that I always wanted to achieve.\u201d\n\nIt was Busch\u2019s first win on pavement in almost two years \u2014 his 2022 win came in the Bristol dirt race \u2014 but competitors don\u2019t think his success this season should shock anyone.\n\n\u201cWhy is anyone surprised?\u201d Chase Elliott said. \u201cKyle\u2019s one of the best race car drivers ever to do this and that didn\u2019t change overnight. So I\u2019m not surprised, and anybody who is should rethink their NASCAR knowledge.\u201d\n\nFor most of the day\u2019s running, it was a well-behaved race. It lost its composure early in the second stage. Three cautions came out in quick succession to start the stage, culminating in a ten car pile-up on a restart. After that incident, however, the cautions dried up. There was only one more caution for cause following the crash, when Ty Dillon\u2019s No. 77 car seemed to lose power. With that the one caution in the third stage, the race ended on a 55-lap green-flag run.\n\nBusch spent much of the run behind Ross Chastain (No. 1) but opened up a lead of greater than three seconds after getting ahead in the pit cycle. Getting ahead of Chastain on the track, however, was a struggle for Busch throughout the race.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment there when I ran Ross Chastain down the first time and I got to his bumper and I was trying to make a move to get by him and I just couldn\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Busch said. \u201cI about crashed a few times, and I was just hanging on at the end of that stage and then we were able to make some more adjustments to it to get it better on the long run.\u201d\n\nThe race marked Kyle Busch\u2019s third race with Richard Childress Racing, having left Joe Gibbs Racing after 15 years. Busch himself was surprised at how quickly he\u2019s adapted to his new team, but they\u2019ve been on an upswing since the start of the Next Gen era last year. It\u2019s the second year in a row the No. 8 car has been strong around Auto Club Speedway. Last year, Tyler Reddick won the first two stages before puncturing a tire late and losing a lap to the rest of the pack.\n\nAlthough they were strong last year, Busch\u2019s crew didn\u2019t take much from last year\u2019s set-up for this year\u2019s package.\n\n\u201cLast year when we got here, we might have been a little ahead of the curve or a little more aggressive on things ... obviously it showed when we blew our left rear last year,\u201d Busch\u2019s crew chief Randall Burnett said. \u201cThe setup today was completely different than it was a year ago, and that just shows how much we\u2019ve evolved with this car and how much we\u2019ve learned in a year.\u201d\n\nWhatever they learned this year won\u2019t have much of an impact on next year\u2019s race in Southern California with Auto Club Speedway due to be dismantled soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for me to see this racetrack be in its last race being a two-mile configuration,\u201d Busch said. \u201cGlad I was able to win the final run here.\u201d\n\nNASCAR will stay west of its roots for next weekend\u2019s race in Las Vegas.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Will Camardella\nFebruary 26, 2023 at 5:00 pm PST\n\nBefore a single pitch was thrown in this weekend\u2019s three-game series, USC baseball was faced with adversity. Its series against the Auburn Tigers, which had originally been scheduled to be played in Los Angeles, would be moved over 2,000 miles east to Auburn. Suddenly facing their first road series of the year, the Trojans were unable to earn a win, dropping the first two games of the series and tying the third.\n\nOn Friday night, USC\u2019s red-hot offense cooled down mightily. The Trojans had been averaging 11 runs per game in their first four outings, but only mustered 3 in a 5-3 defeat. USC\u2019s six through nine hitters had a combined .555 batting average, with 3 extra base hits and 3 RBI\u2019s, but the one through five hitters hit just .136. Additionally, the Trojans had just 1 hit in 9 at-bats with runners in scoring position.\n\nOne crucial missed opportunity occurred in the top of the third inning with the game scoreless. Against sophomore right-handed pitcher Chase Allsup, USC loaded the bases with nobody out, and brought its two, three and four hitters to bat. However, dreams of a big offensive inning faded away quickly when junior left fielder Carson Wells chased a pitch out of the zone to strike out, junior second baseman Ryan Jackson fouled out and senior first baseman Nick Lopez flew out on 3 straight at-bats.\n\nAfter the Trojans scratched the game\u2019s first run one inning later, Auburn\u2019s offense came alive in the bottom of the fourth. A pair of 2-run hits from junior shortstop Cole Foster and redshirt senior left fielder Bobby Pierce gave Auburn a 4-1 lead. Junior pitcher Tyler Stromsborg\u2019s 2 walks and 1 hit batsman set the table for the Tigers\u2019 biggest inning, but the right-hander delivered a strong start outside of that. Stromsborg gave USC 5.2 innings, allowing 7 hits and those 4 runs.\n\nSophomore relievers Josh Blum and Caden Connolly also had solid outings out of the bullpen, combining for 2.1 innings and allowing just 2 hits and 1 run to keep the Trojans in the game. USC drove in a run in the sixth and eighth innings to get within 2 runs heading into the ninth. Facing sophomore right hander Will Cannon, the Trojans had runners on first and third with the tying run on base, but redshirt freshman designated hitter Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek grounded to short to make the game\u2019s final out.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Auburn clinched the series with a 12-6 win. Three multi-run innings by Auburn\u2019s offense ensured the game would be out of reach. Junior starting pitcher Jaden Agassi cruised through his first time facing the Tiger batters. He retired seven of the first nine hitters, and threw a scoreless first three innings. The Trojans were able to build a 3-0 lead, but Agassi hit a wall in the fourth.\n\nSenior third baseman Bryson Ware drove in freshman designated hitter Ike Irish after a leadoff double, then advanced to second on a wild pitch. The extra base allowed Ware to score on a single from redshirt sophomore Cooper McMurray, who then scored on a single by sophomore second baseman Brody Moss after also advancing on a wild pitch. Ultimately, Agassi would not survive his disastrous fourth inning after such a promising start.\n\nSix relievers would then pitch the remainder of the game for USC, but only two could keep the Tigers off the scoreboard. Sophomore relievers Fisher Johnson and Caden Aoki combined to give up 5 runs in the bottom of the sixth to untie the game. They were not aided by the Trojans\u2019 defense, as 2 of the 5 runs given up were unearned.\n\nWith runners at first and third, sophomore pinch hitter Mike Bello chopped the ball to Lopez at first, who threw the ball over redshirt freshman shortstop Caden Huber\u2019s head and into center field. The error allowed a run to easily score on the play and set up Auburn\u2019s five-spot.\n\nWith the bases loaded in the top of the eighth, Wells hit a bomb to deep center field, but fifth-year center fielder Kason Howell made a leaping catch against the fence to turn an extra-base hit into a sacrifice fly. Senior left fielder Adrian Colon-Rosado then hit a moonshot to deep right that had home run height and distance, but the 37-foot left field wall at Plainsman Park limited the damage to a 2-run double that cut the deficit to 2.\n\nRedshirt senior reliever Toby Spach recorded the first 2 outs of the eighth for USC, but Stankiewicz elected to bring in senior right-hander Kyle Wisch to finish the job. That move did not work out for the Trojans, as Wisch surrendered 2 2-run bombs to Ware and McMurray to balloon the Auburn lead to 6.\n\nUltimately, the Tigers made USC pay for every baserunner it allowed, hitting a staggering .412 with runners in scoring position in the game.\n\nUSC was already guaranteed to lose the series when the final game began on Sunday afternoon, but it did not waste the opportunity to demonstrate its resilience. Two 2-run homers helped the Trojans jump out to an early 4-0 lead in the first inning. That lead would be short lived, however, as Auburn\u2019s offense tattooed redshirt freshman right-hander Eric Hammond for 7 runs in just two innings of work.\n\nSenior reliever Ben Sodersten did not fare much better, allowing 5 runs in his two innings pitched following up the starter. Graduate right fielder Justin Kirby gave USC the most trouble, hitting a 3-run homer in the second and a grand slam in the fourth. Kirby\u2019s power helped the Tigers build leads of 8-4 and 12-8, but USC would not go away quietly in the late innings.\n\nDown 3 runs in the top of the seventh, the Trojans recorded 4 straight base hits with 2 outs and the bases empty. Jackson drove in 2 runs with a pinch-hit single, and freshman center fielder Austin Overn tied the game with an RBI double.\n\nBy the time the eighth inning began, time was now a major factor. Because of USC\u2019s travel arrangements returning to L.A., it was agreed on beforehand that no new innings would be played after 3:30 p.m. local time. Yet, the eighth inning went quickly, and the game went to the ninth.\n\nKnowing that this would be the final inning of the game, it was do or die for the Trojan offense. Wells hit a 1-out double, bringing senior catcher Connor Clift to the plate. Clift knocked a base hit down the left field line, driving in Wells and seemingly giving USC a late lead. The USC celebration didn\u2019t last long, though, as the umpire ruled that Wells did not touch home plate when he appeared to score. On an appeal play, Wells was ruled out.\n\nThe ninth inning only got stranger when Jackson struck out, but senior catcher Nate LaRue threw the ball away on a wild pitch, keeping the rally alive and putting the go-ahead run 90 feet away. However, Overn flew out the following at-bat, meaning the best the Trojans could do was tie.\n\nIn the bottom of the ninth, the Tigers loaded the bases with just 1 out and a chance at a walk-off win, but redshirt senior reliever Garrett Clarke locked in from there. Clarke forced back-to-back fly outs to end the game, which ended in a 12-12 draw. It was the first USC baseball game to end in a tie since 2019.\n\nAfter the winless series, the Trojans drop to 3-3-1 on the season. They will finish their four-game road trip much closer to home, with a matchup against Cal State Fullerton on Tuesday night.\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Wendi Lu February 26, 2023 at 4:38 pm PST\n\nWith 23 seconds left on the clock in the second overtime, Washington State called another timeout. Somehow, the team had lost its 19-point lead from the third quarter. For the Cougars, their lead lasted for 39 minutes and 37 seconds. For the Trojans, that number was just over two minutes. However, according to head coach Lindsay Gottlieb, the team never gave up.\n\n\u201cBeginning in the second half, it wasn\u2019t even close,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe were getting beaten. Credit to our players for deciding who we are and that we are going to give it our best effort.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the Trojans won 68-65 after a comeback at Galen Center against the Cougars, wrapping their regular season up and claiming their spot as the No. 6 seed in the Pac-12 tournament.\n\nThe Cougars knocked the Trojans off track from the first quarter. The game started with WSU taking a one-point lead into the second quarter as the Trojans made just one of eight 3-point attempts in the first frame. In the second quarter, the Trojans struggled to find a bucket, shooting 12.5% from the field. At the same time, the Cougars managed to shoot 80% from the floor and knocked down four 3-pointers. The Cougars had a dominant 32-16 lead when the halftime buzzer sounded.\n\nFor USC, the third quarter didn\u2019t start any better than the last one. WSU\u2019s largest lead appeared four minutes into the half after the Cougars nailed a 3-pointer.\n\n\u201cAt one point, we were down by 20,\u201d graduate guard Destiny Littleton said. \u201cI told them we\u2019ve been here before. We were down by 20 to Utah and fought all the way back. Just remember how that felt and how we came together.\u201d\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Trojans got back on their feet on offense. With the clock down to just 36 ticks, redshirt freshman guard Taylor Bigby lept for a jump shot, successfully narrowing USC\u2019s deficit to 53-51. On WSU\u2019s next possession, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko swiped the ball away, and Bigby was sent to the free-throw line after being fouled on the other end. Bigby made both shots, bringing the game to a tie with fifteen seconds to go.\n\nAfter Bigby\u2019s late-game performance, Gottlieb believes that she can be the key to the team\u2019s potential success in the Pac-12 tournament.\n\n\u201cTaylor Bigby came off the bench in this game. As our only freshman, she\u2019s committed to this group because of these older leaders,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAs we go into the Pac-12 tournament, those [connections] are what you rely on. Everyone has played with each other many times. It\u2019s going to be about who\u2019s the most connected.\u201d\n\nUSC was up to the challenge when WSU wanted to play the \u201cCatch Me If You Can\u201d game in overtime. Despite never being ahead in the first overtime, a 3-pointer with 1:11 left from graduate guard Okako Adika tied the game back up and sent the Trojans to a second overtime.\n\nNearly two minutes into the second overtime, USC took the lead for the first time all day. WSU tried to fight back when fifth-year forward Ula Motuga hit a 3-pointer to put the Cougars ahead 65-64 with 1:47 left. On Senior Day, Sissoko saved the day, finishing off WSU with the last four points of the game to will the Trojans to victory.\n\nThis Senior Day has left seniors, like Sissoko, with no regret about where they decided to play their final years of college basketball.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re achieving right now, I think we deserve it and we gained a lot,\u201d Sissoko said. \u201cWe transferred so many times ... We can\u2019t retell the struggles, but we fought like hell today and in all the other winning games. So I\u2019m just extremely grateful.\u201d\n\nWith the regular season coming to an end, Gottlieb couldn\u2019t help but feel proud of this team\u2019s accomplishment.\n\n\u201cThe most gratifying thing for me is watching your players achieve what they want to achieve,\u201d Gottlieb said. \" I know they want to play in an NCAA tournament and enjoy their final year. Many of [the seniors] have been at three schools. The past leads you to where you are, but you want that place to feel right. So, for a night like tonight, we\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d\n\nThe victory leaves the Trojans with an overall record of 21-8 and 11-7 in conference play. Next up, USC will battle Oregon State in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament on Wednesday night.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nFebruary 26, 2023 at 11:20 am PST\n\nThe end is nigh. Much of the land on which Fontana\u2019s Auto Club Speedway sits was sold Friday, reportedly for around 300 million dollars. That solidified what has long been suspected: This will be the last race on Fontana\u2019s two-mile configuration. Practice and qualifying for both the Cup and Xfinity race were canceled due to rain and snow. Drivers will get their first taste of the last bite of the Fontana apple in racing conditions. Here\u2019s what to watch for when they get going.\n\nMixed up starting order\nWithout qualifying, the starting order for the race is based largely on results of the Daytona 500 \u2014 the only points race run so far this season. Like most other superspeedway races, many big name drivers crashed out early As such, typically competitive drivers like Tyler Reddick, Chase Elliott and William Byron will start in the back, while drivers for underfunded teams, such as Cody Ware and Corey LaJoie, are set to start in the top half of the grid. Faster drivers will quickly find their way toward the front, but it could contribute to early chaos.\n\nSignificant changes in pace\nIt takes time to properly prepare a car for a race. Teams don\u2019t have that this year. Although they have data from last year and from simulations, no one will know who got their car set-ups right until the start of the race. There\u2019s never a guarantee that the best car at the start of the race will also be the best by the end, but that prospect is even less likely without any practice. There also won\u2019t be any rubber on the track, with the Xfinity Series race postponed from Saturday to after the Cup race. The track should gain a significant amount of grip where it can throughout the day, which will force teams to adapt even more.\n\nTire Degradation\nAuto Club Speedway is known for having high tire degradation \u2014 the track\u2019s rough surface is one of the reasons drivers love to race here. That surface is deteriorating though, and that could mean degradation is worse than ever before. With the added complication of no practice, drivers who can manage their tires may have an even larger advantage than normal.\n\n\u201cWeepers\u201d\nEven without rain Sunday, cold temperatures and more than two inches of rain since Friday mean the track could still be wet by race time. Multiple drivers expressed concern regarding \u201cweepers,\u201d spots on the track where water which had sunk into the asphalt leaks back to the surface. A cadre of track-drying vehicles will be on the track all day before the race, but water could still come up. That could result in fewer lines being run than last year as drivers try to avoid wet spots.\n\nCup winner prediction: Tyler Reddick (No. 45) - Reddick may be on a new team \u2014 and coming off a week with no practice \u2014 but he\u2019s an adaptable driver. He was very quick last year before a tire blew late, bringing out a caution and sending him a lap down. With 23XI Racing this year, I expect Reddick to put his demons behind him.\n\nXfinity winner prediction: Cole Custer (No. 00) - Last year\u2019s winner certainly isn\u2019t the most creative prediction in the world, but Custer is very strong around Auto Club Speedway and I don\u2019t see that changing this year. Without practice or qualifying, Custer, who loves this track, should be one of the quickest to adjust.\n```"}

After tough consecutive losses to Oregon and Oregon State, the Trojans have been a bubble team for several weeks. But the strong victory against Utah should bolster USC\u2019s tournament chances.\n\nDefense was the name of the game, and sophomore guard Kobe Johnson led the Trojans with 3 steals and countless possessions of gritty defense. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best defenders in the country,\u201d senior guard Boogie Ellis said. \u201cHe does all the stuff that doesn\u2019t show up on the statsheet.\u201d\n\nFreshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu and redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan were dominant paint presences, and each recorded 3 blocks. \u201cWe have those garbage guys that don\u2019t really care about points,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThey do the little things that don\u2019t show up on the stats.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 paint defense caused Utah to struggle, going 20-for-63 (31.7%) from the field. USC also defended well on the perimeter, and the Utes made 5 of 22 (22.7%) 3-point attempts. This is in large part due to the stingy defense provided by Ellis and freshman guard Tre White.\n\n\u201cA lot of our players have matured and grown,\u201d Head Coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cWe\u2019re a much better team than we were in November and early December. We didn\u2019t have any experience other than Drew and Boogie.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans performed well on offense too. They took advantage of weak points in the Utes\u2019 defense. In the first half, USC shot lights-out from 3-point range, shooting 8-of-15 (53.3%). This helped give them a 34-28 lead at halftime.\n\n\u201cYou have to take what the defense gives you. We\u2019ve been saying all along we need to shoot more threes as a team,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI thought it was great that we got 15 up.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Utes adjusted at halftime and defended the 3-point shot much better in the second half. The Trojans adapted and put the ball near the paint more. They shot 7-of-14 (50%) on 2-point attempts.\n\n\u201cThe second half we didn\u2019t get as many [threes] up,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey made some adjustments, and we had to do some other things.\u201d\n\nEllis led the Trojans with 16 points on 6-of-12 (50%) shooting from the field and 4-of-8 (50%) shooting from deep. \u201cI want to lead this team, and all my hard work is showing,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI\u2019m reading to make a run with this team.\u201d\n\nFifth-year guard Drew Peterson and Johnson also contributed offensively with 14 and 12 points, respectively. \u201c[Drew] punishes defenders with his post moves and finds shooters,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nThe Trojans maintained a single-digit lead for almost the entire game. The win was never sealed until the clock showed \u201c00:00,\u201d as USC struggled to go on large runs and pull away.\n\nUSC will return to Galen Center to face No. 7 Arizona on Thursday. Although the Trojans are on a four-game winning streak and improved to 21-8 on the season, the threat of a single loss and its potential consequences leaves no room for comfort. They may need to take down the Wildcats to secure a spot in March.\n```"}

The Crimson Tide are rolling. They\u2019re the second-best team in the country and haven\u2019t lost a game yet. He\u2019s one in a sea of more than 100,000 fans, his voice lost in the thunderous roar of the crowd. He\u2019s in a fraternity. He\u2019s popular on campus, and a few years later when his sister follows in the family tradition at Alabama, they surely will know her as Howard\u2019s younger sister, Hillary. Life is good. There\u2019s only one problem, something nagging at his core, kicking at his conscience. He wants to be on the field, playing football again.\n\nAfter that, it was bye-bye, Tuscaloosa. Like Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, the now 23-year-old succumbed to the same \u201citch\u201d many athletes experience. He returned home to Southern California, leaving his life at the University of Alabama to play football. This past season, he was the kicker for the Glendale Community College Vaqueros. The sophomore has every intention to transfer and kick at the next level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like that old saying,\u201d Howard said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Arcadia, Howard first went to St. Rita Catholic School in Sierra Madre, where he played several sports, before moving on to St. Francis High School in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. He\u2019s played his entire life. It\u2019s been part of him. He can\u2019t even remember the first team he was on. For Howard, it\u2019s something he believes he was meant to do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like home,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking the time off made me realize how much I really do love it and how happy I am to be back and playing.\u201d\n\nMt. San Antonio College is where Howard recalled the first time he put pads back on. He rushed into the bathroom and looked around. It was silent as he looked at himself with shoulder pads, a helmet and the Mt. SAC white across the maroon jersey above the numbers. It had been three years since he felt the weight of the uniform as tears disappeared into the fabric.\n\n\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m really doing it again,\u201d he recalled saying.\n\nThe last time he put on pads wasn\u2019t as joyous. In fact, it ended in heartbreak. It was the first time St. Francis football reached a CIF championship game in 53 years. Blake was excited. They were headed for a chance to play for a state title in Division III against Rancho Verde. He played wide receiver and linebacker. The 2018 graduating class included UCLA Bruin and now Denver Broncos rookie tight end Greg Dulcich, who made his NFL debut in October.\n\nIn a back-and-forth joust, St. Francis was up 42-41 with less than a minute remaining. Rancho Verde\u2019s kicker lined up to kick the potential game-winning kick. Howard was confident. He felt the kid was young and he\u2019d miss. The kick was up. Howard could only watch as he cleared a hole in the pile for his teammate to have a chance to save their championship hopes. Though the familiar spiral was altered by St. Francis fingertips, sending the ball wobbling in the air, it still went through the uprights. Blake dropped to the floor. So did his sweat and tears.\n\n\u201cIt was so close,\u201d Blake said. \u201cIt felt like 10 years before the refs threw their hands up. I was crushed. My body went numb.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, Blake isn\u2019t the first to pump up his teammates. The game was different. He was the first person to say something. Blackout. He doesn\u2019t even know what he said, but everyone heard him. Including his coach, the late Jim Bonds who died of cancer in October 2020.\n\n\u201cBlake, I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for four years,\u201d Bonds said. \u201cThank you for finally doing it.\u201d\n\nThe Howard Household\n\nBlake\u2019s family all say the same thing about him. \u201cHe\u2019s quiet.\u201d Blake is the middle child. He\u2019s wedged between two sisters, Hannah, 14 months older, and Hillary, two years younger. Hannah watched her brother grow up eating Fruity Pebbles at the kitchen table. At one point, they both attended Alabama and would go to barbecues and watch games. Blake just wanted to be around her.\n\n\u201cWe would do everything together,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cWe were really close ... it didn\u2019t matter where we were or what we were doing, we were always attached at the hip.\u201d\n\nYounger sister Hillary joked about her brother\u2019s demeanor, and how challenging school was for herself and her sister. Not for Blake.\n\n\u201cWe had to work so hard to get a B,\u201d Hillary said. \u201cHe was always the one watching football or basketball with our dad. He\u2019d have a test the next morning and ace it. He was so calm about anything.\u201d\n\nWhen they were kids, Hillary would ride bikes around the neighborhood with Blake. They would jump on the trampoline and get dirty. If she fell off her bike, he would\u2019ve just urged them both to keep riding.\n\n\u201cHe made me tough,\u201d Hillary said. \u201cI think I have a rough side to me because I was Blake\u2019s little sidekick.\u201d\n\nOne day at school, some of the boys were giving Hillary a hard time. Blake sprang into action and rallied all his friends to escort his sister around the school.\n\n\u201cHe put himself to the side to make sure that I was OK,\u201d Hillary said. \u201cThat just speaks to how much love he has for me and my sister.\u201d\n\nLeaving Tuscaloosa behind, Howard returned home to play football and kick like his father, Eddie Howard, who was an undrafted NFL kicker from the University of Idaho. Amid his NFL resume, Eddie Howard was on the San Francisco 49ers team with Hall of Fame players like Steve Young and Jerry Rice. He retired in 2002.\n\n\u201cSomething inside of Blake when he went to Alabama and went to games, he saw himself out there,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI wanted it to be his choice,\u201d he added. \u201cI never really forced him to play football.\u201d\n\nBlake Howard would try on his dad\u2019s uniform when he was a toddler. It was one of his mother Monique\u2019s favorite stories \u2014 the jersey would drag on the floor, the helmet would encase his entire face and the shoulder pads barely fit. When Blake Howard got older, he would sneak out of his room after bedtime to watch Lakers games with his dad. Kobe Bryant quickly rose to No. 1 on Blake\u2019s list of favorite athletes.\n\n\u201cI was always the bad cop,\u201d Monique said. \u201cI\u2019m the teacher.\u201d\n\nOne Sunday evening during a family trip in Palm Springs, Blake and his dad were supposed to put together a rocket. They packed their bags, and the family left. When they returned, the Laker game was on and the rocket sitting there, unbuilt. The game ended and construction began on the \u201cS.S. 830,\u201d code for the Sunday special at 8:30 p.m. The project was due Monday morning. To Monique\u2019s surprise, the rocket won first place.\n\n\u201cMy whole message of, \u2018Don\u2019t procrastinate!\u2019 literally blew up,\u201d she said.\n\nGrowing up in Covina, Eddie Howard\u2019s father died when he was very young. However, he surrounded himself with father figures and found them in football. Once, the family was on their way back from one of Blake\u2019s games at St. Rita. The game was close, with Blake\u2019s team losing on the last play. All Blake\u2019s dad can focus on is the final possession. When he saw his son\u2019s reaction, it surprised him. Blake just wanted to go to the carnival next door.\n\n\u201cIt kept me grounded,\u201d his father said. \u201cYou tend to not want to let things like that go but [Blake] wasn\u2019t going to dwell on it.\u201d\n\nFast-forwarding back to this year, at West Los Angeles College, it\u2019s a gloomy 70-degree day in October. Around 100 people fill the stands. Blake Howard\u2019s parents arrive in the seats like every game. This has been a weekend activity for over 20 years. They order snacks at the concession stand, more than enough to carry.\n\n\u201cWe care about our waistlines,\u201d Monique said in her baby blue sweater, jeans and rainbow sandals. On her phone, she couldn\u2019t turn the Tennessee and Alabama game off.\n\nBlake Howard wore No. 89 and was one of the first players out on the field. He launched a few punts into the air \u2014 50 yards, then 60 yards. The ball slammed into the blue turf and into the hands of one of his teammates.\n\n\u201cDamn, Blake!\u201d a fellow Vaquero yelled.\n\nBlake Howard only punted once for 34 yards but averaged 59.5 yards on kickoffs. Two of the eight were touchbacks and another sailed out of bounds. Early on, he called his dad over to the sideline and they discussed technique, one of the perks of junior college football.\n\nFor two parents who\u2019ve been to hundreds of practices, metal bleachers and brightly lit gyms were their second homes. The clock hits zero, and the scoreboard reads 41-14. A win for GCC football and their son.\n\nMonique and Blake wait along the chain link fence of the blue and gold 10-lane oval track. First, Mom gets a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Dad goes straight into postgame analysis.\n\nThe family leaves with $60 extra in their pocket \u2013 they were the winning ticket of the 50/50 raffle. Monique\u2019s number was called.\n\nBack to Arcadia they go to watch the Dodgers in the NLDS with their son.\n\nIf football ended after this season for Blake Howard, he\u2019d feel incomplete. It\u2019s not where he wants to be. He wants to be kicking at the next level. Any college. In the next two years, Blake Howard said he could see himself in a professional league, kicking for an area football team or even in the NFL, like his father before him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s out of reach,\u201d he said. \u201cI just need to do what I need to do to get there.\u201d\n\nThe entire family would like to see him kick at the next level. He has the support of his family. They know it, but he knows it more than anyone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure a few of my friends think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cFor leaving Alabama and coming back to junior college to kick at 23. All my friends are graduating and getting jobs. I don\u2019t even think about it like that. It\u2019s what I want to do ... I\u2019m going to keep trying.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Zorah Archie-Winston)\n\nBy Zorah Archie-Winston\nFebruary 25, 2023 at 1:45 pm PST\n\nIn December 1985, a black bear was found dead in a Georgia forest after ingesting a large amount of cocaine. A police investigation later concluded that the cocaine had been dropped in the forest by former police officer and drug smuggler Andrew Thornton, who had died a few months earlier in a parachuting incident. \"Cocaine Bear,\" written by Jimmy Warden and directed by Elizabeth Banks, reimagines this novel incident in a reality where that bear hadn't met such an immediate end \u2014 and instead indulged in a drug-induced murder spree.\n\nPredictably, the first trailer depicting this reality quickly went viral upon its November 30 release. I got the opportunity to attend the film's global premiere with USC's Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) on February 21, which attracted veteran actors like Samara Weaving (\"Mayhem,\" \"Ready Or Not\") and Hunter Doohan (\"Wednesday\") and TikTok stars such as Renata Valliulina (@riwww on TikTok) and Brooklynne Webb (@xobrooklynne on TikTok).\n\nAhead of the screening, Banks gave a short speech about the journey to this point in her career. \"I've been a part of franchises like 'The Hunger Games' and 'The Lego Movie,' I launched a franchise in 'Pitch Perfect,' I relaunched the game show 'Press Your Luck,' I got Emmy-nominated for '30 Rock,' and I've directed a couple of films on the way,\" Banks said. \"But I am fully convinced that everything has brought me to this moment in my career: the pinnacle, the rich and deeply cerebral 'Cocaine Bear.'\"\n\nShe then went on to thank the extensive amount of crew members around the world involved in the project and saved the cast members, which included Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich, Christian Convery, Brooklynn Prince, Ayoola Smart and the late Ray Liotta, for last.\n\nBetween the gruesome death sequences and the near-constant swearing in this film, it's safe to say that it earns its R rating. Limbs and entrails are nearly as prevalent in this film as the white powder that fuels it and twice as excessive. The cursing only slightly trails in terms of excess, which is a natural consequence of having an ensemble rife with drug dealers and adolescents.\n\nThe narrative doesn't linger on any character or storyline long enough for the audience to form a genuine attachment to any of them. This would be a problem if the characters were developed beyond their stock descriptions and cliched dynamics: cynic and romantic, innocent and sheltered. For the actors' part, the performances weren't particularly noteworthy or nuanced to elevate the characters beyond their literal functions; I rooted for the characters because I was supposed to, not because I had a true belief that any of them \u2014 save for the protective mother and the children \u2014 deserved to win.\n\nIn any other film, this would have been an irreconcilable flaw and a surefire catalyst for a box office flop; in \"Cocaine Bear,\" it sets the perfect foundation for the true star of the film, the titular bear, to shine. The most memorable and comedic scenes in the film are inherently horrific. The acts, while extremely graphic and brutal for brutality's sake, are too far too juvenile to leave any lasting impression beyond a chuckle or a wince and they primarily victimize caricatures the audience is not primed to genuinely care about \u2014 leading to an experience that more closely resembles a gladiator fight than a senseless massacre.\n\nPut plainly, this movie rests its full weight on the spectacle and novelty of a blasted, barbarous black bear. That's it. Coming with any expectations beyond that will only leave you feeling unfulfilled as the writhing CGI creature on the comedown from its powder-fueled high.\n\n\"Cocaine Bear\" is now playing nationwide exclusively in theaters.\n```"}

As a high school student living in Monterey Park, she is still shaken a month after the deadly shooting that claimed the lives of 11 at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio on Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something beyond shock ... I think a sense of numbness, like the sense that you don\u2019t know exactly what to feel after,\u201d Chau said.\n\nThe shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay were the latest attacks on the Asian community. In the past several years, acts of violence involving Asian and Asian American victims made headlines, including multiple shootings in spas across Atlanta, anti-Asian hate crimes in cities like New York in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an attack within a predominantly Taiwanese church in Laguna Woods.\n\nWhile motives vary, it is undeniable the profound impact these acts of violence leave on the Asian and Asian American communities across the nation. Monterey Park is just the most recent example.\n\nFor Council Member Henry Lo, who recently finished his term as the city\u2019s mayor, news of the shooting came when tweets and texts flooded his phone late at night.\n\n\u201cI think that my reaction, which collectively is the reaction of all residents, is disbelief,\u201d Lo said. \u201cWe\u2019re a community that is very family focused ... I think oftentimes when you hear about incidents, you tell yourself, \u2018Well, it happened elsewhere or under different circumstances. It wouldn\u2019t happen here in our community,\u2019 and yet it happened.\u201d\n\nThis event shattered the usual sense of security felt by many residents of the city. Yannie Chau\u2019s father, Richard Chau, has lived in Monterey Park for nearly 17 years. To him, the shooting was unprecedented.\n\n\u201cI was personally shocked, and then I started to say, \u2018Wow, this can happen in a Chinese community,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIt was made more tragic given the timing of the shooting, on Lunar New Year, a time for gathering and celebration among many East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures.\n\nYannie Chau recalls the moment she heard the news the morning after.\n\n\u201cI woke up to my parents having the television open with the news on,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was in shock and receiving messages from my friends asking if I was okay ... my family was there like two hours prior to the incident at the exact same spot.\u201d\n\nFor both Lo and Chau, they feel the best way to move forward as a community at the moment is to support each other in their time of need.\n\n\u201cThrough my lunch breaks, I\u2019ve gone to eat at some restaurants,\u201d Lo said. \u201cJust ask the owners. \u2018Have you seen a return of customers?\u2019 \u2018Are people still scared\u2019 and \u2018What can we do?\u2019 We have to make sure that for those who need trauma counseling, it\u2019s provided.\u201d\n\nCommunity members leave notes to those who lost their lives in the ballroom shooting. (Photo by Draco Guan)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to see this community to try to come together and try to rebound back from this tragedy,\u201d Chau said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re really impressed to see the amount of help we\u2019ve been able to receive in such a short amount of time.\u201d\n\nTo prevent such incidents from happening again in the future, Lo feels that pinpointing the root of these attacks is important in order to better provide services to tackle issues ranging from mental health to domestic violence to senior isolation in the Asian American community.\n\nMore than 60 mass shootings have already occurred in the United States since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cI shudder to think how many more may occur between now and the end of June,\u201d Lo said. \u201cWe need to demand, demand resources, demand that we have linguistically and culturally competent access to health care services.\u201d\n\nChau, on the other hand, stated that she sees this event as a wake-up call, pushing people to become more aware of the dangers they may face even in their quiet neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe definitely did not have as much awareness in regard to these sort of crimes because it did feel so far away,\u201d Chau said. \u201cI do think that because of this, people of all ages, especially in this area, are more aware, and I think going forward, we can increase that awareness.\u201d\n\nAlthough the culprit has been identified and pronounced dead, the case has not been entirely closed for the community. A national discussion of violence within the Asian American community continues, with the incident also reminding the public about questions on tighter gun control and safety for marginalized communities.\n\nActivists call for gun control during a vigil in Monterey Park on January 23. (Photo by Draco Guan)\n\nIn addition to the acts of violence committed on Asian and Asian American victims, recent news sheds a light on the issue of gun ownership within the community. During the pandemic, gun sales to Asian Americans rose 43%. The reason, according to a study by the University of Michigan, was a response to acts of racism and hate crimes on the Asian community.\n\nFor many who armed themselves, it was an act of self-defense, but with the rise of gun violence perpetrated by members of the Asian and Asian American community, some see this as a red flag to more acts of violence.\n\nJust in the past week, an Asian man was charged with committing a hate crime after shooting two Jewish men leaving synagogues in Los Angeles.\n\nOne month after Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay, the pains of tragedy still linger. Still, the affected communities find ways to push forward, whether it be raising awareness or starting self-defense classes for Asian American seniors.\n\nBut these attacks leave more questions than answers on preventing the attacks themselves across the country. Gun control and mental health remain critical talking points, but the ultimate goal lies in breaking the constant cycle of fear, animosity and prejudice that plagues the community.\n```"}

Even under the pressure of the \u201csingle-rides\u201d petition with 7,500 signatures, there are still no signals that USC, which is \u201cdealing with a big budget deficit,\u201d will backtrack the decision.\n\nTracy Tao, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration proposed new solutions. Upset by the long waiting time for Lyft at night and the obscurity of USC\u2019s response to the shared Lyft debate, Tao decided to take action. Her project, the University Safe Drive program (USD), is a rideshare platform exclusively for USC students.\n\n\u201cUber and Lyft are not and should not be the only options when we are talking about how to address the ride issue,\u201d Tao said. She handed out 85 questionnaires on January 25 at the spring involvement fair and 50 digital copies to her BUAD 302 classmates. In her questionnaires, she asked questions such as \u201cIf there is an app that provides $4 to $8 ride inside the safety zone every day after 6 p.m. with a waiting time of around 10 minutes, would you use it?\u201d\n\nThe findings of the online questionnaires show that those who replied \u201cyes\u201d and those who said \u201cno\u201d are divided nearly half-and-half. A responder to the questionnaire, who is unwilling to use the platform, believes that the safety zone should be \u201caccessible to all students without the inconvenience of having to spend any money just to be safe,\u201d which \u201cdiscourages those students of low-income to access these resources.\u201d\n\nTao said that the majority of responders at the involvement fair are willing to try the new platform and she noticed that the ones who expressed interest were mostly international students, non-Californian students, and students of color, who usually don\u2019t own cars in L.A.\n\n\u201cMy idea is that it\u2019s best if the school can see the value in it, and then they can consider either working with a better platform or we get our own platform,\u201d Tao said. \u201cThat is not hard at all from the software side.\u201d However, from the administration side, Tao has experienced difficulties communicating with the USC administration and student government.\n\n\u201cI just feel like this is not something that we students can take in part at all,\u201d Tao said. She visited the transportation office next to Leavey Library after getting the results from her questionnaires. The staff told her to email the office because they have no power over the issue. She then sent two emails to the transportation office and one to the student government, but all received no response.\n\nTao said that she is frustrated and disappointed by the fact that she has no way to voice her suggestions. \u201cWhat really matters to me is that the school should respond, no matter if it\u2019s a rejection,\u201d Tao said.\n\nBesides students\u2019 reactions, Tao also dug deep into the drivers\u2019 situations. She talked with the founder of Rideshare Drivers United, Nicole Moore, and found out that Uber and Lyft win it all. According to Rideshare Drivers United, drivers are receiving as little as 20% of passenger fares, and Uber and Lyft have never made a rate adjustment to account for the price of fuel, despite raising the prices for customers.\n\nThey talked about how dynamic pricing has been added to the algorithm to get customers to pay more while giving drivers a smaller share of the fares. They also discussed that even though drivers are protected by labor law, Lyft did not fulfill the responsibility and that USC has an obligation to support laborers\u2019 and students\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cWe are like boiling frogs,\u201d Tao said.\n\nSince the topic affects all of the students, the candidates running for student body president have all shared their opinions during the public debate held last Thursday. Yoav Gillath (P) and Monica Rodriguez (VP) said that they\u2019ve talked to DPS. DPS mentioned that through parents and public outcries, the university may switch its decisions. Therefore, the team believed that there\u2019s a possibility for single-rider free Lyft to be restored.\n\nDivya Jakatdar (P) and Michelle Lu (VP) proposed two solutions. One of which is students spend $20 a semester to sustain the single-rider free Lyft model. The other option is a cap on individual rides as well as unlimited shared rides for the rest of that month.\n\nHowever, Aidan Feighery (P) and Ashley Ka (VP) said that they recognized the university has said time and time again that we will not go back to the old system, so they don\u2019t advocate going back to the single-rider system but call for a lower cap instead.\n\nMiko Mariscal (P) and Andrew Taw (VP) agreed with the former group, saying that \u201cWe need to go ahead and be honest with this question: Is this something that University Student Government will accomplish? Or is this something that the administration will accomplish? \"\n\nDevin Ayala (P) and Navya Singh (VP) shared that they have been advocating for a compromise between the administration\u2019s budget concerns and students\u2019 efficiency concerns. \u201cYou think it\u2019s impossible, such as Fryft, but I do think that there\u2019s a possibility to find that compromise,\u201d Singh said during the debate.\n\nTao read the transcripts of the debate a day later. She noticed that the only team who has proposed fresh solutions is Divya and Michelle, but she hoped to see more options from the student candidates as well as other students.\n\n\u201cThis is not a cry from afar. It\u2019s from us,\u201d Tao said.\n```"}

The School for Communication and Journalism welcomed students from Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet School, Downey, Arcadia and Inglewood high schools to participate in media workshops, activities and a tour of the Annenberg Media Center.\n\nYouth Media Day, which used to be called High School Day, has not been held in person since fall 2019. Brittany Hart Scholten, the Civic Engagement Coordinator at Annenberg, noticed a change in the event\u2019s impact on students between the online and in-person Youth Media Day.\n\n\u201cWe did follow through on Zoom during that time [after fall 2019],\u201d Hart Scholten said. \u201cBut now that we\u2019re back in person, students are really able to get more out of campus; they\u2019re able to go in the media center and do interactive activities. I think it\u2019s more inspiring in person.\u201d\n\nThe day began with opening remarks from Scholten, Dr. Gordon Stables, the School of Journalism Director, and keynote speaker Kymia Freeman. Freeman, a second year majoring in public relations and modern art markets and ethics, shared her story and past experience at the Annenberg Youth Academy with the students.\n\nThe Annenberg Youth Academy is a four-week long summer program that offers L.A. high school students the opportunity to learn about writing, ethnography, public speaking and multimedia production from professionals. Freeman, a first-generation student, spoke about the impact that attending the AYA program had on her journey to USC.\n\nWhen Freeman participated in AYA, the program was entirely held online due to COVID-19. \u201cOnce the pandemic hit, all I could think about was keeping myself and my family safe,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cI had forgotten about my application.\u201d\n\nAfter her admission and participation in AYA, Freeman applied to USC Annenberg and began her studies in journalism. During the start of her sophomore year, Freeman made the decision to switch her major to public relations with a minor in modern art markets and ethics. She ended her speech with a message to students.\n\n\u201cStanding up here today, I see myself two years ago,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cI encourage you to put yourself at the forefront. If the answer is ever no, don\u2019t be afraid to change, to pivot, to let go.\u201d\n\nAfter the introductory words from Hart Scholten, Stables and Freeman, students moved on to the rest of the day. As they moved from workshops to tours to activities and back, many of the students reflected on their possible future in media.\n\nNallive Espazas, a junior at Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet School, spoke on her experience at Youth Media Day as a student at a pre-med focused school. \u201cBravo is a medical based school that works in the medical space. I think having access to [and] going to Media Day at USC gives a new perspective that we aren\u2019t really introduced to at school,\u201d Espazas said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s definitely going to be eye opening for students, my peers. Especially me, this is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of Youth Media Day at USC is to expose high school students in L.A. to possible career paths in the realm of media, and what a future at USC studying journalism, public relations or communications could look like for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a great opportunity for these students to see themselves in media, and also just turn on to the study of communication, public relations and journalism.\u201d Hart Scholten said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to inspire folks, diversify media and have them see themselves potentially studying these things in the future.\u201d\n```"}

The National Weather Service forecasted a \u201ccold and dangerous winter storm through Saturday evening\u201d and advised people to be careful with possible roadway flooding, road closures, fallen trees and power lines and a possible severe snowstorm.\n\nEarlier this year, Southern California received above-average rainfall for the month of October, bringing mudslides, sinkholes and flooding that led to the loss of many lives and damaged thousands of homes. Downtown Los Angeles received more than 13 inches of rain since October, nearly the annual average of about 14.25 inches. Now, weather forecasters are expecting to see between 2 to 5 inches of rainwater through the weekend.\n\nThis unexpected amount of rain took people by surprise and raised concerns about climate change. \u201cIndividual storms are statistical. Climate change creates a change in the climate whose consequences may not be directly predicted, but it makes conditions improve statistical changes of getting these kind of events,\u201d said Doug Hammond, a professor of earth sciences. \u201cMore extreme events are more likely [to happen].\u201d\n\nSam Silva, a climate scientist, advises people to be prepared for more unexpected events as climate change affects the weather. \u201cI think there was an unusual amount of rain,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI think that they really point to the fact that disaster preparedness and learning to deal with these extreme events is something that we always need to consider.\u201d\n\nEven public figures, including President Joe Biden and Gov. Gavin Newsom, also state that this unexpected change in the weather may be caused by climate change. \u201cIf anybody doubts that the climate is changing, then they must have been asleep during the last couple of years,\u201d said President Biden at Seacliff State Beach along the Santa Cruz coastline, where a pier was shattered by the recent storms.\n\nLike President Biden, Gov. Newsom took the same approach on social media about climate change effects. \u201cMegadroughts. Wildfires. Historic floods and atmospheric rivers. This whiplash weather is not an anomaly. California is proof that the climate crisis is real and we have to take it seriously,\u201d Gov. Newsom tweeted in January.\n\nResidents from L.A. such as Alina Agopian, a junior majoring in psychology, have similar opinions about the issue. Agopian thinks these storms definitely come from global warming changing the climate in California. \u201cI definitely think this is related to climate change, how volatile our weather\u2019s been when it gets really hot and then really cold,\u201d she said.\n\nTypically, La Ni\u00f1a produces dry winters, a continuous pattern in the past two years, but this winter changed when Downtown L.A. got more than double the average amount of water for this time of the year. \u201cI think [that rain] was abnormal, probably connected with environmental change problems,\u201d Chris Kuo, an electrical engineering graduate student, said.\n\nSome residents enjoy seeing this happening in L.A., stating that it is good to have some water in the dry city. \u201cI enjoyed [the rain] because we don\u2019t get a lot of it in Los Angeles. The past few years have been really dry so it was nice to have consistent rain,\u201d Agopian said. \u201cIt was more rain than I have seen here in many years.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s drought has been the state\u2019s driest three-year period recorded, according to officials. Others do not feel the same way since it makes it difficult to commute. \u201cI always have to travel to school so all that water generated by the rain was a problem for me,\u201d Kuo said.\n\nDespite La Ni\u00f1a\u2019s forecast, a weather phenomenon that occurs when the temperature of the sea is cooler than average in the eastern Pacific, which results in less evaporation, weaker storms and more drought, a series of about 10 storms hit the state, bringing unusual precipitation for this part of the year.\n\nAfter all this rain, the Climate Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service, indicated an anticipated transition from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation neutral (ENSO-neutral), a climate pattern where neither La Ni\u00f1a nor El Ni\u00f1o (a weather phenomenon synonymous of wet winters in Southern California) are present, during the February to April 2023 season.\n\nOn the other hand, some scientists interviewed by the L.A. Times said these storms might not be connected with climate change. Although scientists are still investigating the severity of these storms, researchers stated that they still do not have enough evidence to make that connection.\n\n\u201cWe know from climate models that global warming will boost California storms of the future, but we haven\u2019t made that connection with the latest storm systems,\u201d said Alexander Gershunov, a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography interviewed by the L.A. Times.\n\nEven if people think all these storms are connected to the effects of climate change, scientists state that it is hard to do this directly since they need more proof to confirm it even if they assume that it is related to it. \u201cI think that attributing that an individual event was directly because of climate change is a very difficult scientific thing to say,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThere is variability, large rain does happen even if we would not get any CO2 emissions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we can\u2019t say yet what fraction of the rain we saw in January can be attributed to climate change, we do know that these events are more likely in a warming world and we do know that the world is warming because of CO2,\u201d he added.\n\nEarly reviews suggest that these storms may have more to do with California\u2019s historic drought cycles than with climate change. They state that these unexpected natural hazards after three years of severe drought look similar to other major storms that happened in California around every decade since the 1800s.\n\nWithin the last century, Southern California experienced the \u201cGreat Flood of 1938,\u201d a natural disaster that caused the death of more than 100 people, caused a lot of damage to infrastructure and led L.A. officials to line the Los Angeles River with concrete to prevent flooding. Also, more storms were recorded in history such as in 1964, 1969, 1982, 1986, 1995 and 2005, when a school camp located 3,600 feet above Pasadena in the Los Angeles National Forest, recorded 107 inches of rain in just one week.\n\nBut that does not mean that the past storms follow this same pattern. \u201cClimate change can lead to unusual timing to these events, so that\u2019s something to keep in mind and get those umbrellas handy,\u201d Hammond said.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/02/24/tourney-talk-five-teams-to-keep-an-eye-on/", "response": "```\nTourney Talk: Five teams to keep an eye on\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at which teams are worth monitoring the rest of the way, from bubble teams, Cinderellas and potential title contenders.\n\n\u201cTourney Talk\u201d is a column by Michael Fiumefreddo about the men\u2019s basketball NCAA tournament. T-minus 16 days before the 68-team March Madness bracket is set. But even with such little time to go before the Big Dance, changes are inevitable. The final games of the regular season and conference tournaments will cause drastic changes to the current field.\n\nOver the past three weeks, I\u2019ve revealed which teams should be in line for a No. 1 seed, which teams can be this year\u2019s Cinderella story and which teams have a shot at winning the title. The problem is teams like Purdue, Alabama and even Oral Roberts are already on everyone\u2019s radar; there are still 50-plus teams that fly under the radar heading into March. I looked into these teams so you don\u2019t have to, and I\u2019ve come up with five teams to follow over the next 16 days.\n\nUSC Trojans\nWhat kind of Annenberg Media article would this be if I didn\u2019t mention the Trojans? USC spent the last few weeks playing jump rope on the bubble line, and ESPN\u2019s Bracketology currently has them heading to Dayton for a First Four matchup with Oklahoma State. But USC is far from locked into the bracket, and even winning all three remaining regular season games \u2014 including over No. 7 Arizona \u2014 might not be enough to secure their spot. It comes down to their performance in the Pac-12 Tournament. As it stands right now, the Trojans have a bye as the No. 3 seed. The bad news is their first game could be against Oregon, who beat USC in Eugene 78-60 two weeks ago. A loss there certainly eliminates the Trojans, but a win and a close game or potential win in the semifinals sends the Trojans dancing. However, for the first time all season, USC is fully healthy. Freshman forward Vince Iwuchukwu showed he\u2019s ready for significant minutes against Oregon State, and both redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan and sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters are back on the court after missing some time. The Trojans\u2019 tournament hopes now fall on the shoulders of Andy Enfield\u2019s ability to lead his team through the next three weeks.\n\nEastern Washington Eagles\nMust be something about teams named the Eagles in mid-majors right now. The Oral Roberts Golden Eagles and the Eastern Washington Eagles are the only teams undefeated in conference play this season. What\u2019s important to note about Eastern Washington, though, is its current winning streak: an NCAA-best 18 games. In fact, the Eagles are the only team that has not lost in the 2023 calendar year. Hopefully that raised your eyebrows, but take it with a grain of salt. EWU plays in the Big Sky Conference, where even an undefeated record and conference championship is only good for, at most, a No. 12 seed. The Eagles\u2019 non-conference record is 6-7, and their most notable win is against Cal. They haven\u2019t faced a top 25 team either, which they\u2019ll likely have to do in the first round of March Madness. Yet, should Eastern Washington continue its winning streak, it\u2019ll be upwards of 20 games and nearly four months long. The Eagles also boast a top-five field goal percentage in all of college basketball, which will make them a popular pick to upset a top seed in at least the first round.\n\nNorthwestern Wildcats\nThe Big Ten has been all about Purdue, and if the conference is truly a battle for second place, Northwestern has the edge. Let\u2019s not forget, the Wildcats recently knocked off the Boilermakers and followed that game with another ranked win over Indiana. Northwestern\u2019s 11-6 record in a conference that Bracketology projects to have nine teams is nothing to look past. But, like the next two teams, the Wildcats are projected to be in upset range: No. 5 and 6 seeds often face one of the better mid-major teams or a Power Five First Four winner. Their projection as a No. 6 seed seems low for the No. 21-ranked team in the country, but the Wildcats are surging at the right time. Should they challenge or take the Big Ten crown from Purdue, Northwestern can climb to a No. 3 or 4 seed and make some noise in the tournament.\n\nCreighton Blue Jays\nUnlike Northwestern, Crieghton started off the season as a favorite to win it all. The Blue Jays opened the year in the top 10 but fell out of the rankings after losing six straight. They re-entered the top 25 two weeks ago and are now at No. 19 after winning nine of their last 11. My guess is as good as yours as to who wins the Big East. The top four teams are all within two games of each other, and that doesn\u2019t include Villanova or UConn. While Northwestern has to go through a juggernaut in Purdue to vault itself up in seeding, Creighton has a much easier route to a conference championship. All the Blue Jays have to do is show why they were regarded as a top 10 team earlier this year.\n\nMiami Hurricanes\nThe \u2018Canes are the title contender nobody\u2019s talking about. After Virginia\u2019s loss to Boston College on Wednesday, Miami sits atop the ACC standings. Should the dominoes fall their way, the Hurricanes could see themselves as high as a No. 2 seed heading into the dance, and this scenario is likely. Step one: Win the final two games of the year. Both games happen to be at home, where the \u2018Canes have yet to lose this year. Step two: Win the ACC tournament. They\u2019ll face some tough opponents in Virginia, Clemson, UNC, Duke and Pittsburgh, but Miami\u2019s bested all of them aside from Pitt, which could change in their final game of the season. Follow that up with some chaos in other conferences, and the \u2018Canes are up there with the best. But how far does that push Miami through March Madness? Don\u2019t forget this team, led by junior guard Isaiah Wong and senior guard Jordan Miller, went to the Elite Eight as a No. 10 seed last year. Their top five scorers all returned this year, and Wong has played his way onto the Wooden Watchlist. Miami has shown its ability to compete against top teams with a 2-0 record against top 25 opponents. They\u2019ve stayed out of the spotlight most of the year, but the \u2018Canes are on track to shine when the lights are brightest.\n\nTourney Talk runs every Friday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nBy Kamyar Moradi February 24, 2023 at 2:01 pm PST\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d is a satirical sports column by Kamyar Moradi depicting everything and everyone who should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nDear NBA All-Star Weekend, I have to be honest with you. This was the last thing that I ever thought I was going to be sick of, but alas, here we are. People may be wondering to themselves, \u201cHow do I have the nerve to go after NBA All-Star Weekend when a league who shall not be named played a literal game of flag football?\u201d To those people, I hear you, but being disappointed in Roger Goodell has become a national pastime of mine.\n\nFor years, All-Star Weekend, you were one of my favorites. Every time February rolled around, I could not wait to watch everything from Kevin Hart trying to race the world\u2019s fastest man to Karl Anthony-Towns becoming the third splash brother. But this past weekend, I witnessed some of the worst basketball-related content in human history, and that includes \u201cThunderstruck.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start from the beginning of All-Star Weekend. The saddest thing about you was the fact that I really heard people say blasphemous statements like Mac McClung saved the dunk contest. I need to make something extremely clear. My beef here isn\u2019t with Mac McClung, as he is a living ode to \u201cWhite Men Can\u2019t Jump,\u201d and for that, I have a massive amount of respect for him. With that said, if anyone of you thinks that the supposed savior of the Dunk Contest could even hold a candle to either Aaron Gordon or Zach Lavine, lose my number. Not a day goes by in which I don\u2019t dream about 2016 when I saw a man literally take a seat in mid air and dunk over a furry green mascot on a hoverboard. Nothing in the dunk contest has ever come close since then.\n\nNow, while the dunk contest has been dead in the water for a while now, the 3-point contest has become a staple over the past few years. However, this year the competition was an absolute dud. We had our first-ever pump fake in 3-point contest history, maybe because Jason Tatum saw the ghosts of lost Finals past. Kyden Randle broke down into tears from his father\u2019s attempt to build a house with all those bricks he threw at the basket. And to make matters worse, there was no splash brother in sight. That\u2019s like having a hot dog eating contest without Joey Chestnut, it\u2019s just not the same.\n\nMoving on to something that made me want to throw out my television \u2014 the Taco Bell Skills Challenge. Basketball aside, my deep-rooted hatred for Taco Bell runs so deep, that I hope to one day rid the world of all locations. But I digress. The skills competition has become an absolute aberration to the sport of basketball. Why in the world would the NBA come up with something as entertaining as the old format, when two players faced off and competed against each other at the same time, just to replace it with this dumpster fire of an event? Silver and the boys thought it would be much more invigorating to have a trifecta of players partake in a long, drawn-out set of challenges that nobody in this day and age has the attention span for. The most memorable thing about the entire event was the size and shine of Jordan Clarkson\u2019s Cuban-link.\n\nThe skills competition is single-handedly one of the worst things I ever sat down and watched in my entire life, and that includes the series finale of Game of Thrones. This weekend was filled from head to toe with nonchalant and uninspired performances. It was encapsulated by the main event of this entire shindig, the 2023 NBA All-Star Game.\n\nFor starters, I understand that this column is supposed to describe the stuff that I am sick of. But with this fourth installment, I truly believe I have the backing of an entire fanbase that would agree with me wholeheartedly. Michael Malone took the words right out of my mouth. Team LeBron\u2019s own coach said it was the worst All-Star Game of all time, and who am I to argue that? I guarantee Malone has forgotten more basketball than anyone who\u2019s reading this column ever knew. Jaylen Brown called the entire game a \u201cglorified lay-up line.\u201d This game has about as much panache and flavor as a chicken breast.\n\nWe, as a nation of basketball enthusiasts, need to bring honor back to not just the All-Star Game, but to you, All-Star Weekend. As of right now, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to watch. Respectfully, you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Ushering in excitement and anticipation for the three-day music event happening this March in Inglewood, Cherif shared more than his advice with the Hip-Hop Music and Culture class; he invited them all to attend.\n\nCherif created Rolling Loud \u2014 the largest hip-hop festival in the world \u2014 with Matt Zingler, his Florida elementary school classmate. Inspired by the clandestine house parties that Cherif threw at his grandmother\u2019s house, the pair desired to create an environment and musical lineup that unified as many musical subgenres of hip-hop as possible, he explained.\n\n\u201cWe started identifying these subgenres and saying, \u2018Hey, we put together a lineup that caters to all the subgenres, or at least a good amount of them.\u2019 We make sure that if you\u2019re a fan of any one of those subgenres, you could find at least like ten artists on the bill that you love,\u201d Cherif said.\n\nThe festival\u2019s inception coincided with the rise of SoundCloud, a community-based streaming platform that allows artists to create and share music.\n\n\u201cA big reason for our success is us growing at the same time of the emergence and growth of SoundCloud rap,\u201d Cherif said. \u201cSoundCloud rap had a very DIY nature, and we were a very DIY company, and we came up together in Florida.\u201d\n\nSince Rolling Loud\u2019s early days as an underground event, the founders have expanded the festival globally, establishing it as a household name. Following its 2015 debut in Miami, the festival has also been hosted in New York, Los Angeles and Toronto, as well as overseas in Thailand and Germany.\n\nHowever, Rolling Loud isn\u2019t just about music; it\u2019s a love letter to the hip-hop movement. As the festival has grown and evolved, Cherif and Zingler have also added activities that immerse fans in the creative and visual outlets of hip-hop culture, such as sports, skateboarding, graffiti and fashion.\n\nOn festival grounds, fans have access to basketball courts, skate parks, tattoo shops, barbers or glam stations, which engage them in various cultural aspects that have been influenced by hip-hop music.\n\nThe social and cultural elements of the hip-hop genre are also highlighted in MUSC 320: Hip-Hop Music and Culture, a four-unit Thornton class open to all students. Taught by USC professors Jae Deal and Sean Nye, the class follows the history of hip-hop music and its influences in social, political and cultural issues.\n\nThis semester\u2019s iteration of the class is particularly special because Cherif\u2019s visit coincides with hip-hop\u2019s 50th anniversary. According to Nye, a professor of practice in musicology, Cherif is an impressive addition to the diverse array of \u201ckey artists who founded and lived hip-hop\u201d that have already spoken with the class.\n\nFor Nye, Cherif\u2019s \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d visit played a pivotal role in rejuvenating his classroom and bringing meaning to the idea of togetherness. Similarly, Deal, a professor in music technology, echoed Nye\u2019s sentiments on Cherif\u2019s inspiring lessons on unity and music entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cI live for moments where I get to serve students through live-changing immersive experiences,\u201d Deal said. \u201cI saw the enlightenment of students\u2019 faces in real time as [Cherif] shared his story, experience and passion of building a global brand built on and for the hip-hop culture.\u201d\n\nStudents also walked away feeling inspired about their careers in music and production.\n\n\u201cThe experience was pretty amazing,\u201d said Sierra Sky Fisher, a junior majoring in music industry. \u201cEven though he\u2019s this really big deal in the music industry, he sat up there really humbly and made us all feel really comfortable. He clearly really valued his time there.\u201d\n\nDuring his event, Cherif offered more than just wise words to the class: On a whim, he ended up giving free Rolling Loud festival tickets to all students and professors in attendance, distributing over 100 passes in total.\n\nThough a student had jokingly asked Cherif for complimentary Rolling Loud tickets because of their steep prices, to everyone\u2019s surprise, Cherif agreed.\n\n\u201c[Cherif] just kind of looked at his manager and he goes \u2018F*ck it, let\u2019s just give them all tickets,\u2019\u201d Fisher said. \u201cHe gave our entire class tickets and it was the most epic thing ever ... It was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe professors appreciated the generous offer to students, who can now complement what they\u2019ve learned in class by witnessing hip-hop music and culture in person at Rolling Loud.\n\n\u201c[Cherif] gave back by inviting the class in attendance to a living, breathing example of what we teach each semester, and that was priceless!\u201d Deal said.\n\nThe Rolling Loud experience is made up of more than just the music. From the art to the physical experience, the festival will provide the full effect of hip-hop in our own backyard this March.\n```"}

The show was his second of a four-city tour of the U.S., with the first stop in his hometown of Houston being his first live performance and concert ever. d4vd grew his audience by millions of listeners worldwide after gaining mainstream attention in July 2022 with his TikTok-trending single \u201cRomantic Homicide,\u201d which peaked at No. 33 on the Billboard 100.\n\nAfter his first string of shows were announced, many were excited and rushed to purchase tickets to see d4vd take his vocals and emotional lyrics to the live stage. Singer gigi opened the show. As the crowd waited for d4vd\u2019s entrance, a string of trending TikTok songs played, setting the stage for a setlist heavily influenced by social media.\n\nThe stage was decorated with several frames of neon lights on either side, a several-foot-tall arrangement of red clothes hangers and a large \u201cd4vd\u201d poster as the backdrop. D4vd began his set with \u201cDirty Secrets,\u201d released in April 2022. Donning a white dress shirt with bloodstains, similar to an outfit from one of his recent music videos, he took to the stage with nonchalant confidence.\n\nHe immediately brought high energy to the performance, jumping up and down on the stage to the steady strumming of the background guitarist. D4vd dances around the stage as he performs \u201cDTN.\u201d\n\nD4vd\u2019s path to making music is a unique one. He originally aspired to become a professional gamer and started making music simply to avoid copyright strikes on the accompanying tracks to his video montages of the game Fortnite. He began recording songs in his closet, producing all of his tracks on the platform Bandlab and uploading them to SoundCloud. D4vd, who is 17 years old, paid homage to his earliest fans in both the gaming and music communities he was a part of with his song \u201cYou and I,\u201d mentioning to the crowd that it was his first original Fortnite montage song.\n\nD4vd continued to amp up the crowd, bobbing his head and dancing around the stage with both the slightly shameless confidence of a teenager and the swagger of a seasoned performer. The light displays at The Echo elevated the show\u2019s atmosphere, flashing in different patterns according to the upbeat rhythms of his first few songs.\n\nThe crowd was packed with fans around young adult age, and many brought their significant others to the show. D4vd switched up the mood of the show with a smooth performance of the love song \u201cHere With Me,\u201d while several fans swayed to the familiar, TikTok-famous melody.\n\nD4vd refers to his music as \u201cgenre dysphoria,\u201d and the order of tracks reflected this exploration of various musical influences. Just after performing \u201cHere With Me,\u201d with its relaxed, bedroom-pop feel, he pivoted to \u201cTake Me To The Sun,\u201d a much more fast-paced and heavily electronic track. He then returned to songs with a more melancholy feel, performing his latest single \u201cPlacebo Effect.\u201d\n\nDespite his live vocals not being quite as rich as in the studio versions of his tracks, the storytelling and vulnerability of his lyrics were conveyed through the obvious passion in his performance. D4vd teased some unreleased songs, including one titled \u201cThe Bridge.\u201d During this song, he clung onto the microphone, looking down at the stage while soft streams of light danced above his head.\n\nAfter performing his unreleased track, d4vd asked the audience if he should drop the song or not. An overwhelming \u201cyes\u201d reverberated through the crowd, showing listeners\u2019 anticipation for future d4vd projects to come.\n\nD4vd ended the concert with \u201cRomantic Homicide,\u201d the song that catapulted him to breakthrough stardom and a label signing with Darkroom/Interscope Records. He delivered an emphatic performance, hitting a high note during the song and finishing the night with resounding praise from the audience.\n\nThe concert reflected d4vd\u2019s rise through social media and understanding of content creation. D4vd\u2019s photographer and videographer recorded the entire concert on vertical iPhone video format, making sure to capture crowd reactions throughout the show. Despite having performed live only once before, d4vd interacted with the audience very naturally, joking around and appearing to be genuinely enjoying himself on stage.\n\nHis comfort in both the current digital and live music scenes set him apart as a rising star as he continues to explore styles of music and find \u201cthe root of it all,\u201d whatever that may be.\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade\nFebruary 24, 2023 at 12:15 pm PST\n\nEarly in the first quarter, the Washington Huskies had a dramatic sequence of 4 consecutive possessions without a basket \u2014 a shot blocked by USC sophomore forward Rayah Marshall, a shot-clock violation, a travel and a bad-pass turnover. Little did the Huskies know, that stretch was going to end up being a microcosm for much of the game to come.\n\nWith the help of 18 Washington turnovers, the Trojans took care of the Huskies 47-43 at Galen Center Thursday night and gave themselves a crucial resume boost with just one game left in the regular season.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of season left,\u201d Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cBut, from where this program has been and even where we were at this point last year, I\u2019m really proud of this group earning 20 wins.\u201d\n\nThe win didn\u2019t come easy for USC, especially down the stretch. With the Trojans ahead 44-38 and 12 seconds left, Washington freshman guard Hannah Stines made a layup. On the ensuing possession, graduate guard Destiny Littleton caught the inbound pass and was wrestled to the baseline; she then stepped out of bounds and turned the ball back over to the Huskies.\n\nThe Huskies continued to fight and came close to stealing a win right out from under the Trojans. Freshman guard Elle Ladine swished home a 3-pointer to cut USC\u2019s lead down to just 1.\n\nThe Trojans tightened up on offense in the closing seconds and held on to win by 4.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for either of us,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty. I said this game doesn\u2019t belong in the Louvre.\u201d\n\nUntil late, it was a defensive slugfest with neither team breaking through much at all. USC allowed just 2 points in the first quarter, the least the Trojans have given up in a quarter all year.\n\nPart of what prevented Washington from scoring was its own turnover issues, but the other factor was USC\u2019s shot-blocking at the rim. The Trojans had 11 blocks, 6 of which were by Marshall \u2014 the No. 3 player in the nation in blocks per game.\n\nEleven of Washington\u2019s turnovers came in the first half, due in large part to USC\u2019s defensive pressure. With the Trojans\u2019 offense sputtering, the team focused on forcing turnovers to give the team more chances at scoring.\n\n\u201cWe knew that it was getting ugly, and we knew that possessions mattered,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cSo if we could take possessions from them, it would help us.\u201d\n\nEventually, Washington found a way to score with USC. In the fourth quarter, the Huskies shot 53% from the field and went 4-for-5 from behind the arc. Washington even outscored USC 21-19 in the fourth \u2014 and 41-36 in the last three quarters.\n\nBut it was still too little, too late. Even in performances like this game \u2014 when offense appears optional at times \u2014 the team takes pride in grinding out the ugly win.\n\n\u201cAt some point you surrender your vision of it\u2019s supposed to be this way or that way, and I\u2019m just going to get it done,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s not pretty, you at least want to be the toughest.\u201d\n\nThe win brings USC to 20-8 on the season and 10-7 in Pac-12 play. Beating Washington \u2014 another team on the edge of the NCAA tournament bubble \u2014 could be what solidifies USC\u2019s spot in the Big Dance.\n\nBut ask Gottlieb, and she\u2019s already looking forward to where this team will be in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to me that they\u2019re going to get to experience the NCAA tournament,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe still have more work to do, but these are the things that \u2014 it\u2019s why you do it.\u201d\n\nIt also marks the Trojans\u2019 14th home win of the season, the most home wins in a season for the program since at least 1994.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an energy in here,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cOur players feel pride in playing for our home crowd.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will close out the regular season against Washington State on Saturday at noon. It\u2019s a game that will mean a lot to the six seniors and graduate students who may be playing their last game of college basketball.\n\n\u201cI transferred three times, and it\u2019s my first time actually feeling like I belong somewhere,\u201d the game\u2019s leading scorer with 19 points, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, said. \u201cEvery day I feel grateful to be here and have this team.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of @pengproduktions)\n\nBy Kiara Timo\nFebruary 24, 2023 at 8:00 am PST\n\nLast Friday, two undergraduate students launched their production company, Peng Produktions, with a celebratory party. Solely Liati, a junior majoring in business administration, and Anja Tempel, a junior majoring in dance, have started a company to produce events specifically curated for Black women. Inspired in December of 2022 while listening to \u201cPeng Black Girls\u201d by UK rapper and singer ENNY, Liati and Tempel decided to curate a space for Black women to feel wanted and seen.\n\nReleased in October 2020, the song \u201cPeng Black Girls\u201d was revered for its celebration and cultural critique of how society treats Black women. Peng is UK slang for \u201ccool,\u201d and the uplifting lyrics, like, \u201cRaise my voice, you gonna say that I\u2019m angry / Kiss my teeth and now you say that I\u2019m hood / Drive a Range, you think I\u2019m up to no good / Give us a break and let us breathe, man / Give us a change, let us achieve, fam\u201d made Black women feel appreciated when they are often overlooked and underappreciated.\n\nWith performances from Autumn Stallia, Love Keyyz, Vietta, Honey Blu and a DJ set by Rhi, the event was filled with warm energy and accompanied by purple lights projecting a fairy-like hue on all of their guests. Some attended the event in casual athleisure and no makeup, while others chose bold eye makeup and platform heels. As the room filled, it was clear that Liati and Tempel had succeeded in their goal for people to come as their most authentic selves.\n\nBlack women created a rainbow of pink, blue and red box braids swinging as they danced to DJ Rhi\u2019s set before the performances began. Others wore their hair in a curly pineapple or loose and free. Some had their hair pressed, and some had a ponytail. As guests entered the room, they paid the $5 entrance fee, went to the kitchen for their complimentary beverage and began dancing to a set list curated by DJ Rhi and reminiscent of the poster marketing the event.\n\n\u201cWhen I created that poster I was inspired by Black female musicians \u2014 artists like Lil\u2019 Kim and Brandy. I just thought these women are so inspiring and inspirations to Black women,\u201d Liati said.\n\nDuring the night of their event, they welcomed the roaring crowd with a speech full of gratitude for the audience\u2019s attendance because \u201c\u2018by showing up for Peng Produktions, they were showing up for Black women.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe realized there needs to be more space for us. There needs to be more space for us to party, socialize our intellectual thoughts, and be creative,\u201d Tempel said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do here. We\u2019re in production. This great live event is to celebrate, in honor of Black women.\u201d\n\nThe next day, I held an in-person interview with the team, where we discussed the success of the night and the purpose of their company, \u201cIt was an idea for a while and to be able to manifest it was really rewarding and also was just great to hear people say, \u2018Wow, I really love this. The vibes are so good.\u2019 That\u2019s all we wanted out of it,\u201d Tempel said, \u201cand to accomplish that means success for us.\u201d\n\nWithin their commitment to creating a space for Black women, Liati and Tempel are determined for their production company to maintain its focus on providing a safe and celebratory space for Black women. However, as \u201cPeng Black Girls\u201d became increasingly popular, it faced a controversy that, for some, put a sour note on its celebration of Black women. In December 2020, ENNY released a remix of \u201cPeng Black Girls\u201d and replaced her darker-skinned collaborator with the light-skinned, biracial artist Jorja Smith leading to intense backlash and conversations about colorism.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we do not want to promote. We want to be inclusive. Inclusive of everyone. We don\u2019t want to have a hierarchy within a Black female space,\u201d Liati said.\n\nSo why name their production company after a song with such a layered, viral issue? \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be aware of and try our best to be considerate of,\u201d Tempel said. \u201dThat\u2019s especially important to consider since we are lighter-skinned and biracial, which comes with its privileges. We\u2019re utilizing Peng Black Girl as a source of inspiration.\u201d\n\nLiati and Tempel, the organizers of the event, pose for a photo. (Photo by Kiara Timo)\n\nAs I spoke to Liati and Tempel, it became clear that both women understand the criticism of the song and hope that guests of their events can refocus on the connection they felt with the lyrics \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to focus on the lyrics, the embodiment of what ENNY is talking about, and herself,\u201d Tempel said. \u201cThe beautiful thing about the song is that she\u2019s talking about the layers of being a Black woman and what that means. That\u2019s just something we\u2019re trying to focus on.\u201d\n\nLiati agrees, noting how creating a space like Peng Produktions will come with a lot of trial and error. \u201cWe have a lot of unanswered questions for us as creators of what works and what doesn\u2019t because we haven\u2019t tried it out yet. The priority is Black women and Black females, first and foremost. What makes the most sense when promoting Peng Black Girls? What does it mean for other people of different ethnicities to celebrate us? Make us feel safe?\u201d\n\nTempel said. \u201cFor so long, we have been invisible, so what does it mean to turn around and reorient people\u2019s way of thinking so, no, we\u2019re not using Black women, actually, we\u2019re going to enrich them. We\u2019re going to give them love. We\u2019re going to give them respect because people are taught to erase us.\u201d\n\nAlready in the planning stages of its next event, Peng Produktions is ready to make its mark as its founders prepare to reach out to more Black women at USC and eventually the greater Los Angeles area. \u201cThey need to know that when they come here, it\u2019s not about them,\u201d Tempel said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a black woman, it\u2019s not about you. You\u2019re not going to be in the spotlight. You\u2019re not going to be the center stage of this, and you have to be okay with not being the focus of this but being there to celebrate someone else. Anyone can come, but they have to have the right mindset. They have to have the mindset of \u2018I\u2019m coming here to celebrate Black women.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor more information, follow @pengproduktions on Instagram.\n```"}

This year, the Trojans had been 3-5 on the road, losing five of their last six games away from Galen Center. On Thursday night, none of that mattered, as USC stomped the Colorado Buffaloes 84-65.\n\nAfter averaging 91 points per game in its most recent home stand, USC\u2019s offense picked up right where it left off in the first half. The Trojans were lethal from beyond the 3-point line, making 5 of their first 7 3-pointers. USC finished with 8 3-point makes from five different players. The Trojans\u2019 effective shooting was not limited to long range, as they shot 63% from the field against the Buffaloes in the first 20 minutes.\n\nThe biggest asset for the USC offense was its balance, as seven different players scored points \u2014 five of whom had a shooting percentage of 62% or better. Leading the way offensively for the Trojans was senior guard Boogie Ellis. Ellis got to the rim at will in the early going and established his jump shot as the game progressed. He finished with a game-high 21 points, scoring his first 8 on layups and free throws and his next 6 on 2 3-point makes.\n\nWhile many players in a USC uniform had great offensive days, Ellis may have hit the biggest shot of the game in the second half. Six minutes out of the halftime break, Colorado had ripped off an 8-0 run thanks to two 3-pointers by graduate guard Ethan Wright and a fast-break dunk by sophomore center Lawson Lovering. The run cut the Trojan lead to 8 points. The home crowd was as energized as it had been since the opening tip, but Ellis calmly took the ball down the court to the left elbow. He then hit a mid-range shot to silence the fans and bring the USC lead back to double-digits. After that shot, the Trojans never led by fewer than 9.\n\nIn his second game back from injury, sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters was an offensive standout as well. Dixon-Waters had 15 points off the bench, his largest scoring output since January 5, and shot 5-of-8 from the floor with 2 3-pointers. He was USC\u2019s spark plug offensively throughout the game, shooting efficiently from mid range and long distance.\n\n\u201c[Dixon-Waters has] played great since his injury,\u201d Head Coach Andy Enfield said after the game. \u201cHe played really well in our last game against Stanford at home in his first game back. He had a great week of practice as well. He just has calmed down, he\u2019s making quick decisions, the right decisions, he was terrific.\u201d\n\nEllis and Dixon-Waters were just two of the five Trojans in double figures. Sophomore guard Kobe Johnson scored 15 points on 6-of-9 shooting, freshman guard Tre White was 4-of-5 from the field with 10 points and fifth-year guard Drew Peterson contributed 11. Johnson also led the team in rebounds with 7.\n\nUSC had just 9 turnovers, the 12th time in its last 13 games it has kept its turnover number to 12 or fewer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of our team for sharing the ball, making plays and making shots,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cOur players really drove the ball and made the right play. It was very impressive.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 shooting cooled off as the game progressed. They missed nine of 10 3-pointers after a 6-of-8 start, but the Buffaloes struggled too much offensively to make it matter. USC held Colorado to 36% shooting in the game and 21% on 3-pointers. The Buffaloes had four separate sequences in this game of missing at least 5 field goals in a row, while the Trojans did not miss more than 3 straight shots the entire night.\n\nThe key to USC\u2019s defense success was outstanding guard play. Whether it was Johnson, White or Peterson defending the perimeter, the Trojans consistently kept the basketball in front of them and contested just about every jump shot. The game plan was especially effective on Colorado\u2019s leading scorer, junior forward Tristan da Silva. He averaged over 16 points per game heading into this matchup, but only mustered 6 in this game on 2-of-9 shooting, while missing all 4 of his 3-point attempts.\n\n\u201cWhether we doubled [da Silva], or we didn\u2019t, we switched on him, did a lot of different things, and mixed it up throughout the game,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI give our guys credit; they listened to the scout. Kobe Johnson is the best defensive player in the Pac-12, so he did a tremendous job. We switched a lot on him, and so it was a team effort. You don\u2019t hold da Silva down like that without everybody being engaged and doing their job.\u201d\n\nThe Buffaloes\u2019 best source of offense early on was in the paint. Lovering was 3-of-3 from the field in the first half due to some missed assignments leaving him alone under the rim, but his teammates did not have the same sort of success near the basket. Colorado was short on a series of late attempts at the rim towards the end of the half, and finished just 8-of-17 on layups in the period. Eighteen of its 30 points came in the paint in the first half, but USC cleaned up its defense down low during the break and held Colorado to just 12 in the paint in the second.\n\nBecause of the effectiveness of the Trojan offense, the Buffaloes\u2019 cold spells led to multiple devastating scoring runs. USC\u2019s biggest was a 10-0 run after the midway point of the second half that spanned almost three minutes, ballooning its lead from 9 to 19, and putting the game on ice.\n\nThis win serves as an important milestone for USC; it is the first time in program history that the program has won 20 games four years in a row. The Trojans improve to 20-9 on the season and 12-5 in the Pac-12. They will play their final road game of the regular season on Saturday evening against the Utah Utes.\n```"}

Whether you\u2019re a storyteller or a listener, everyone was welcome at USC\u2019s \u201cHuman Library\u201d event. Upon entering the event, attendees decided to be a \u201cbook\u201d or a \u201creader.\u201d The books then created a title for their story and based on those titles, the readers approached the books they found interesting.\n\nBoya Zhang, an economics and digital social media major, was among those who opted to be a \u201cbook\u201d for the event and her story was titled \u201cEverything Sucks!!!\u201d, a tale about her stolen car. She had to deal with a lot \u2014 the police, the paperwork of filing a complaint, getting a rental car and then an accident on top of school\u2014in the course of two weeks.\n\nThe Human Library project was launched 23 years ago in Copenhagen, Denmark, with a mission to \u201cunjudge someone\u201d and challenge stigma and stereotypes. The organization hosts events for communities across the world, hoping to create a space where \u201cdifficult questions are expected, appreciated and answered.\u201d\n\nGraduate student Sophia Han, who helped organize the event, said the concept encourages students to leave surface level conversations behind. Like Skylar Pak\u2019s story of taking the leap. The junior studying communications, philosophy, politics and economy took her place as a book at the event. She titled her story \u201cA New Chapter\u201d, which chronicled her journey transitioning from gymnastics to track.\n\n\u201cI did gymnastics from when I was 4 years old to 16, so it was a good 12 years and I did it competitively,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was in the gym for 36 hours per week ... And it was my whole life.\u201d\n\nShe said she loved it most times, so she stuck with it. But being a gymnast brought a lot of injuries and she eventually felt it was time to move on. But it took her four years to make that decision. Especially after realizing that people identified her only by her sport.\n\n\u201cMy sister and I would go see family and friends that we hadn\u2019t seen in a while, and they\u2019d look at her and be like, \u2018You\u2019re the swimmer.\u2019 And then they look at me and they would say, \u2018You\u2019re the gymnast.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, are our identities really just tied to our sports?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to call it as if she were quitting because she had given a lot to it. But when Pak began training for track, something clicked.\n\n\u201cI feel like I really just found myself again because I\u2019d started to lose everything towards the last couple of years as a gymnast, so this is like the new chapter and the biggest and best chapter I could\u2019ve hoped for,\u201d Pak said.\n\nHan said the event gives people an opportunity to be a storyteller or a listener and could help people who usually struggle socially.\n\n\u201cInstead of reading books, you read people,\u201d Han said, \u201cand by reading we mean having conversations with them, and not just random conversation, but like engaging and deep and meaningful kinds of conversations.\u201d\n\nHan also said that one of the major goals of the event was to eliminate preconceived notions about one another.\n\n\u201cBy having engaging conversations with them and then just listening to them talk about their stories and stuff, you just have a different perspective of who this person is,\u201d Han said.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Anjali Patel and Eric Yeh\nFebruary 23, 2023 at 6:56 pm PST\n\nA blizzard warning has been issued this weekend for Los Angeles and other Southern California regions. According to a Twitter post from the National Weather Service, this storm is the worst L.A. has seen since 1989, and only the second blizzard warning ever on record for the area. Residents should take extra precaution in or around the mountain ranges that skirt the city, according to an L.A. Times article. The National Weather Service advises little to limited travel in the affected areas of the storm warning, particularly on Friday and Saturday.\n\nDespite the cold temperatures, gusty wind and heavy rain, here are some ways Trojans can make the most of this stormy weekend!\n\nThings to Watch\n\nNothing says rainy day like your Netflix Watch List. Whether it\u2019s a classic romantic comedy or an action packed thriller, there\u2019s a certain comfort in curling up with a blanket and turning on something to watch and escape the unfortunate weather. So grab some microwave popcorn and watch one of these shows/movies when it feels like there\u2019s nothing to do.\n\n\u201cSex and the City\u201d This romantic comedy-drama tells the story of four female friends living in New York City. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a mindless, funny show that\u2019s easy and comforting,\u201d Lauren Amico, a sophomore studying communication, said. Indeed, funny shows are a great way to relax especially when the weather is gloomy. Jessica Thomas, a freshman studying business administration, recommended \u201cWhite Lotus,\u201d while senior majoring in computer science Matt Leslie said the movie \u201cHot Fuzz\u201d would be good to watch.\n\nFood to Eat\n\nSome foods just made for colder weather. Here\u2019s a list of some of the best comfort foods for you to get this weekend to keep warm and satisfy those cravings.\n\nNorthern Cafe This Chinese restaurant offers an array of dumpling, noodle and fried rice dishes to warm you up. It\u2019s located less than a mile from campus on S. Figueroa Street, making it a convenient option. \u201cI\u2019m away from home and I miss my mom\u2019s cooking, so the closest I can get is Northern Cafe,\u201d said Carol Zhou, a junior majoring in public policy.\n\nK-Town Pho A piping hot bowl of pho, or Vietnamese noodle soup, is always comforting with its spicy and tangy flavors. This highly rated restaurant in Koreatown is a popular choice for the dish. \u201c[Pho] just tastes so good and you can never go wrong with it,\u201d said Nana Fujita, a junior majoring in computer science games. \u201cIt\u2019s just always delicious.\u201d\n\nBaking If you\u2019re just craving a snack, making some baked goods is always an option. Baking can be incredibly fun and relaxing, not to mention you end up with some tasty treats. \u201cI really like baking cookies, especially when the ingredients are pretty close by like at Target,\u201d said Thomas An, a sophomore majoring in communication.\n\nIndoor Activities\n\nJust because you can\u2019t go outside does not mean you can\u2019t have fun or be productive. Whether you are alone, or with friends or roommates, passing the time doesn\u2019t have to be boring.\n\nRead a book No matter the genre, now is a great time to pick up that book you have always been wanting to read. \u201cI like reading when it\u2019s raining,\u201d said Namiha Yasuda, a junior majoring in computer science. \u201cI feel like the vibe is very romantic.\u201d\n\nClean Although cleaning may not seem like the most fun activity, it doesn\u2019t have to be boring either. It is a productive way to pass the time and you can spice it up by putting on music while you clean or even listening to an audio book or podcast. \u201cAny time I\u2019m cleaning or doing anything, I have to listen to stuff,\u201d said Ellen Landrum, a freshman majoring in computer science.\n\nExercise Physical exercise doesn\u2019t always have to be outside. Lauren Amica, a sophomore majoring in communication, enjoys a warm indoor alternative. \u201cHot yoga is indoors and always a nice workout,\u201d Amica said.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Adam Bradford\nFebruary 23, 2023 at 5:59 pm PST\n\nUSC\u2019s bullpen blew a late lead, allowing 3 runs in the top of the eighth inning as the Trojans fell 8-7 to UC Irvine Tuesday night at Dedeaux Field. USC entered the penultimate frame on top 6-5. However, the Anteaters\u2019 sophomore designated hitter Chase Call tied the game with a solo home run off of Trojan redshirt senior relief pitcher Toby Spach. After Spach walked the next two batters, senior righty Kyle Wisch entered the game for USC and allowed a go-ahead 2-run double to junior center fielder Caden Kendle.\n\nThe Trojans cut the deficit to 8-7 in the bottom of the ninth on a sacrifice groundout by redshirt freshman second baseman Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek. However, senior first baseman Nick Lopez subsequently grounded out to shortstop to end the game. It marked USC\u2019s first defeat of the 2023 season.\n\n\u201cI think [the bullpen was] just kind of a little bit off,\u201d USC Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. \u201cWe were good in spurts, but we weren\u2019t good enough to hold it and to be a little more competitive.\u201d\n\nKendle led the Anteaters\u2019 offense throughout the night, going 2-for-5 with 4 RBIs. Junior third baseman Jo Oyama, freshman first baseman Tony Martinez and redshirt sophomore second baseman Will Bermudez also added 2 hits apiece. Sophomore right-hander Finnegan Wall picked up the win for UC Irvine, and freshman righty Max Martin closed things out for the save.\n\nFor USC, freshman center fielder Austin Overn was 2-for-3 with an RBI and a walk. Lopez and junior left fielder Carson Wells also had multi-hit games, while Martin-Grudzielanek drove in 4 of the Trojans\u2019 7 runs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put some good at-bats together, and then we kind of go,\u201d Stankiewicz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. \u201cWe just gotta be more consistent across the board and just really work on trying to put good at-bats together. We had some big swings at times. We found ourselves chasing out of the zone, which is something that we\u2019ve got to work on.\u201d\n\nUSC fell to 3-1 on the year with the loss. The Trojans had opened up the season with a three-game sweep of Marist over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe just gotta keep working. We have a long way to go,\u201d Stankiewicz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. \u201cGood teams win one-run ball games, and so the more we\u2019re in them, the better prepared we are going to be.\u201d\n\nUp next, USC will visit Auburn for a marquee three-game series beginning Friday evening. The series was originally scheduled to be played in Los Angeles, but had to be moved to Auburn, Alabama, due to rain in the weather forecast this weekend.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this article did not properly attribute the quotes from the coach.

Kelly Greco: Seasonal Affective Disorder is a type of clinical depression. Symptoms may come up with the obvious, when the weather changes.\n\nThat was Dr. Kelly Greco, a psychologist and clinical associate professor at USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine. Greco: The first thing that comes to mind is what is your relationship to weather? In terms of how it impacts you, which is how you think about it, how you feel about it, and then the behaviors that come with it. It goes back to \u2018what is your relationship with it?\n\nMai-Yen Fritz is a senior studying neuroscience. She acknowledges the relationship between sunshine and her mood. Mai-Yen Fritz: I think it definitely will change their mood. I think especially if they are weather dependent. So they need sunshine in order to feel a certain way.

Greco: If we\u2019re hearing that we\u2019re going to get bad weather in the next two days, let\u2019s plan ahead and make some decisions on \u2018how do I get to class\u2019 or \u2018how do I get to my internship\u2019 or \u2018where am I going to study\u2019. So I think if you plan ahead and you don\u2019t let the situation take control, you feel more empowered and it\u2019s not controlling you.\n\nWith the upcoming storm, make sure to take Dr. Greco\u2019s advice to plan ahead, and stay safe.\n```"}

The potential blizzard and storms are a result of a massive winter storm that will impact the US West and North regions this weekend. The blizzard warning is only the second blizzard warning ever issued for the Los Angeles area; the first one was issued over three decades ago on Feb. 4, 1989. Between Thursday and Saturday, in some LA and Ventura county mountain areas, snowfall is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches, and at the highest elevations, potentially up to 7 feet. In valley areas and coastal areas in Southern California, which include South LA, flood warnings have been issued as the areas are expected to get 2 to 4 inches of rain.\n\nCliff Mass: Well, it\u2019s unusual, obviously. But I mean... Cliff Mass is a professor at the University of Washington in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences. Mass is an expert in weather prediction and modeling, and believes that the winter storm is actually beneficial to the overall climate of California. Mass: We\u2019re seeing the end of the California drought between what we had earlier this year and now the massive snowpack that\u2019s going to result from this event is going to ensure that California is going to be in pretty good shape when it comes to water resources this coming year. So that is a very, very big positive, really.\n\nHowever, Mass does not believe that the winter storm is a result of climate change whatsoever. Mass: I mean, you know, basically we\u2019re seeing, you know, the restoration of water. This is very typical for California. California goes through several dry years and then it has a period of wetter conditions. So that\u2019s the nature of California weather. You know, it\u2019s very uneven and it has these dry periods followed by wet periods. And so it\u2019s always been like that. So this is really not climate change. It\u2019s really the old fashioned climate of California.\n\nKristen Stewart, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Los Angeles, believes that it\u2019s too soon to determine if the winter storm is a result of climate change. Kristen Stewart: Yeah, it\u2019s hard to tell for now because you need kind of decades and centuries of data to really, you know, indicate any sort of climate change signal. But, you know, weather systems happen all the time. So, you know, this is kind of more of a smaller, short, shorter time period scale of just kind of normal weather patterns.\n\nEven though Sunday is expected to bring some weather relief, make sure to keep your jacket close by for the return of the rain on Monday.\n```"}

We spoke with a USC expert and students to learn their perspectives on Biden\u2019s potential for reelection.\n\nMorley Winograd, a senior fellow at the Annenberg Center for Communication Leadership, has researched the impact of youth voters in elections. He believes that Biden\u2019s ability to banter with opposition during the State of the Union greatly impacted his approval ratings.\n\nMorley Winograd: I think the fact that he was able to do an hour speech to do it on a, you know, in a spontaneous give and take in which he clearly got the better of them and had humor and the right kind of facial expressions about it, I think that went a long way.\n\nAt the midterm elections, young voters had an unprecedented turnout, with many of them voting Democrat. Winograd believes that despite his age, Biden\u2019s focus on abortion rights, climate change and student loan forgiveness will be a motivator for many young voters.\n\nWinograd: His appeal in 2020...occurred when he advocated for things like tuition free college that are very important to younger voters. Probably their number one reason why to vote.\n\nAlexis Valle is a USC student majoring in business and disagrees with Winograd on Biden\u2019s ability to pull through when it comes to those issues.\n\nAlexis Valle: Biden, I feel like he said a lot of things and his actions tried to match what he said, but they weren\u2019t really that 100% about, like student loan relief and stuff like that.\n\nSasha Hussain is the President of Trojan Democrats, and is optimistic about Biden\u2019s chances for reelection following his address. She, like Winograd, thinks Biden\u2019s continued focus on such hot button topics that youth voters consider more important will be key to his success.\n\nSasha Hussain: I think when you look at a lot of issues that Americans care about, he addresses a lot of them and specifically a lot of them for populations like middle class and low income, but also POC, BIPOC communities as well.\n\nOverall, while Hussain would ideally prefer a younger candidate, she believes Biden is the Democrat\u2019s best shot at maintaining the presidency.\n\nHussain: If you want to think strategically, Biden is our best chance because he does appeal to young Americans in many aspects, but also appeals to the older population.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s rising approval ratings with Democrats, his rate are lackluster with independents. In the same poll, just 36% of independents approve of the job Biden has done since he took the presidency.\n\nBiden has still not formally announced his bid for the 2024 nomination, but a second term as President, given his age, would be \u201cunpresidented\u201d.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Matt Chen.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Rebecca S. Gratz)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi\nFebruary 23, 2023 at 5:38 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d is a column by Curran Rastogi about men\u2019s college basketball teams and their journeys to March Madness.\n\nThe Big East Preseason Coaches Poll was released October 18, projecting Marquette to finish ninth in the conference. Someone forgot to tell Marquette\u2019s head coach Shaka Smart. The Golden Eagles are 22-6 overall with a 14-3 conference record and on the inside track to claiming their first regular season Big East title since 2013.\n\nThe first thing you notice about Marquette basketball this year is that they are undeniably a Shaka Smart team. Smart, in his Cinderella Final Four run in 2010 with VCU, employed what is colloquially referred to as \u201chavoc\u201d defense. This on-ball defense suffocates opponents into bad shots and turnovers. While Smart didn\u2019t use it as much at Texas, at Marquette it is clearly back in full force.\n\nMarquette is the clearest example of defense leading an elite offense. While the goal in havoc defense isn\u2019t necessarily to rack up as many steals as possible, Marquette is No. 9 in the nation in steals per game. The frequency to which Marquette\u2019s players accumulate steals allows them to get out in transition to collect easy points. The Golden Eagles are No. 3 in offensive efficiency according to KenPom because of it.\n\nSix players on this team average at least 1 steal a game, with junior guard Tyler Kolek and sophomore guard Stevie Mitchell averaging 1.8 and 1.7 respectively. It\u2019s not just their defense that allows this team to be an elite offensive team. They share the ball well and have an offensive setup that generates very good looks.\n\nKey to their offense is a double screen play, where a ball handler will receive two consecutive screens and drive to the paint where he decides to pass to the rolling big man or take the shot himself. The advantage of this play is that it makes the ball handler\u2019s defender work much harder, as he has to fight through two screens, which frees up the ball handler. It might create a mess in the middle of the court for the guard, but with the play being run for Kolek very often, he has become adept at navigating this traffic.\n\nKolek is a current favorite for Big East Player of the Year, leading the conference in assists per game at 7.6. Though not the leading scorer on the team, his scoring has become instrumental in Marquette\u2019s last two games against No. 16 Xavier and No. 19 Creighton. He scored a go-ahead floater against Creighton over 7-foot-1-inch 2021-2022 Big East Defensive Player of the Year junior center Ryan Kalkbrenner.\n\nKolek is the heart and soul of the team and the type of player that will be key to the Golden Eagles making a run in the NCAA tournament. Come March, two more players stick as players that will elevate the team and add the scoring and defense that becomes necessary. Mitchell and junior forward Oso Ighodaro are the team\u2019s perimeter and frontcourt defensive stoppers.\n\nMitchell regularly gets assigned to the other team\u2019s best guard but can also provide a spark of offense that propels the team going forward. Ighodaro\u2019s pressure on Kalkbrenner was key to the Golden Eagles largely neutralizing during the game, and on offense, he has the basketball acumen to operate a pick and roll at a very high level.\n\nHowever, for Marquette to be a serious team and make a Final Four run, they will need leading scorer sophomore guard Kam Jones to be a more consistent scorer. Jones is a good and capable leading scorer, but this month he\u2019s only put up 10 or more points twice which is simply not good enough for a leading scorer. He led the team with 19 points in their most recent game against Creighton, but it remains to be seen if this game will be the one to break his slump.\n\nAside from Jones\u2019 streaky month, February has been great for Marquette. The Golden Eagles won five of six including two wins against two teams tied for second in the Big East. They currently have a two-game lead in the title race with three games to go against teams already largely eliminated from the NCAA tournament.\n\nMarquette has all the tools necessary to make it back to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2013. Smart has done a remarkable job as head coach after losing his two best scorers to the G-League and should be a shoe-in for Big East Coach of the Year. Maybe next year the Big East coaches will learn their lesson and pick them to finish eighth.\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Jenny Chuang/USC Athletics)\n\nBy Reagan Griffin Jr. February 23, 2023 at 4:13 pm PST\n\nChange is inevitable \u2014 growth, however, is a choice. Alyson Miura, India Otto and Maddie Campbell are no strangers to that idea. Relics of a seemingly ancient past in USC women\u2019s basketball, the trio has seen a great deal of change. From the academic advisors to the training staff, the nutritionists to the sports psychologists, the coaching staff and even the players in the locker room, the Trojan program has undergone a whirlwind of turnover in the last four years. At the eye of the storm, however, stand these three women \u2014 and they are not budging for anything.\n\nIn accepting the head coaching role at USC in 2021, Lindsay Gottlieb knew she had a challenge on her hands \u2014 but along with that challenge came an opportunity. \u201cThis is a blank canvas to do something that\u2019s never been done,\u201d Gottlieb said in her introductory press conference. \u201cThis is a transcendent opportunity to have USC women\u2019s basketball be different than any other program.\u201d\n\nThe starting block was a sub-.500 program, seven years since its last March Madness appearance. The finish line is a national championship. The journey between will undoubtedly be a marathon \u2014 competing in USC\u2019s conference is already a challenge in and of itself. This season, Pac-12 women\u2019s basketball stands among the NCAA\u2019s most competitive landscapes \u2014 from the explosive offensive firepower of Utah to the savvy experience of Arizona, to the sheer star power of schools like UCLA and Stanford, the Conference of Champions is host to powerhouse programs from nearly top to bottom.\n\nIn Gottlieb\u2019s first season, the team struggled to gain its footing against the rest of the Pac, finishing just 5-12 in conference games. This disappointing year was followed by a mass exodus of players to the transfer portal, leaving just Miura, Otto, Campbell and three freshmen remaining on an otherwise decimated roster. The USC program appeared to require a defibrillator \u2014 but what it really needed was an anchor. Or anchors.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2021-22 season, Miura faced the same decision as many of her ex-teammates and friends. Most of them were entering the transfer portal, leaving an air of uncertainty around the futures of both USC women\u2019s basketball and Miura herself. She could follow their lead \u2014 Miura, a knockdown shooter in a game increasingly defined by floor spacing, would undoubtedly have suitors \u2014 or she could step into the unknown. Miura, never one to run from a challenge, doubled down on her commitment to the Trojan program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the idea since I was a freshman, that I would be part of the change,\u201d Miura said. \u201cI really liked the idea of being part of the group that gets [USC] there.\u201d\n\nThe group that she had entered the program with, however, was nearly gone \u2014 all that remained were Miura, Otto and Campbell. And while the trio displayed immense courage in choosing to remain with USC, there was still a lot to fear: How much change was too much change to endure? Were the frustrations of the first season simply growing pains, or a sign of things to come? With the clock ticking on their eligibility, would they have a legitimate opportunity to accomplish their goals at USC?\n\nIn light of the roster purge, however, one question was the most pressing. \u201cAre they going to bring in the right people?\u201d Miura said the three were asking themselves. \u201cThat really had us scared.\u201d\n\nDespite the uncertainty, the timing was kismet \u2014 recent NCAA rule changes allowed athletes entering the transfer portal to have greater flexibility. Instead of having to sit out a season to compete, more transfers would have the opportunity to suit up as soon as they picked a new school. These loosened regulations set the stage for an unprecedented level of player mobility \u2014 a trend that USC would need to effectively capitalize upon.\n\nMiura, Otto and Campbell were as much a part of the recruiting process as anyone \u2014 the trio of seniors could have a decent side hustle as student ambassadors with the number of tours they led over the visiting period. The effort was not without reward, however \u2014 by summer\u2019s end, they were looking at a very new and very different squad. The locker room was a New Orleans-style gumbo of different players \u2014 from national champions to mid-major standouts, Los Angeles residents to native Malians, former Oregon Ducks to Arizona Wildcats, the new look USC roster was one of the most unique in all of college basketball.\n\nThe Trojans certainly had a different feel to them \u2014 one that Miura enjoyed. \u201cI really feel like I can hang out with any single one of my teammates one-on-one,\u201d Miura said. \u201cAnd I feel like that\u2019s hard to come by, especially in college when you don\u2019t necessarily grow up with everyone.\u201d\n\nThe chemistry was strong off the court \u00ad\u2014 but to be competitive, they would need to gel on the court as well. If one were to judge Otto based on stature alone, they would likely conclude her to be fairly unimposing. Spend time around the USC women\u2019s basketball team, however, and you\u2019ll find that she possesses arguably the strongest presence of anyone on the squad. Known off the court for her silly, lighthearted and kind nature, Otto is a gentle soul \u2014 between those lines, however, the former CIF State Champion is a fierce competitor.\n\nDirector of player development Courtney Jaco has seen Otto grow over the course of a decade. Their relationship predates either of their time at USC, as a young Otto used to attend Jaco\u2019s high school basketball games at Windward School. Since that time, Jaco has attended and played for the USC women\u2019s team, played professionally overseas, and now coaches for the program. Arguably, no one on planet Earth has a better perspective on where USC women\u2019s basketball has been \u2014 and where it\u2019s headed \u2014 than Jaco.\n\n\u201cPeople always throw around the word culture,\u201d Jaco said, \u201cbut that\u2019s been our biggest emphasis as a staff, building a winning culture: getting people out of their comfort zones, having the hard conversations, doing the hard things.\u201d\n\nEven for Trojans, however, Rome cannot be built in a day. The growth process would be slow, intentional, even tedious at times \u2014 a day-to-day charge to resist the temptations of complacency. For Otto, this commitment isn\u2019t always easy \u2014 particularly when her role requires her to step up by stepping aside. The competitor in her wants to be on the court for forty minutes a game; the great teammate in her, however, understands that she must defer.\n\n\u201cI understand that there are other people that are going to play ahead of me,\u201d Otto said. \u201cI\u2019m always ready, whether you need two minutes or 10 minutes or no minutes from me. But I understand my role is to be here for everybody and push our team forward.\u201d\n\nOtto may not see the floor as often as her teammates, but don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 a student of the game, she understands what\u2019s going on on the hardwood as well as anyone. In this way, Otto has made her impact felt. Coach Gottlieb\u2019s system isn\u2019t an easy one to comprehend \u2014 influenced by her experience in the NBA, the former Cavaliers assistant emphasizes player movement, live-action reads and 3-point shooting. She challenges and trusts her team to make nuanced plays, which undoubtedly makes for a dynamic offense when run correctly. However, the learning curve has been steeper for some of the players.\n\nKayla Williams was nervous as she took the Galen Center practice court for the first time. Arriving at USC by way of UC Irvine, the Power Five experience was new to her \u2014 she dominated at her mid-major, but now Williams was stepping the floor with national champions and McDonald\u2019s All-American players every day. She knew she belonged, but she yearned to show that she belonged \u2014 and as a point guard, it was difficult to do so without having a strong handle on the offense.\n\n\u201c[Learning the offense] was definitely a struggle, and it affected my confidence at times,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut I know Otto knows her stuff. If I\u2019m ever confused, I know I can go to her.\u201d\n\nIn the preseason, it was Otto\u2019s voice in the post-practice huddle holding Williams and her other teammates accountable for understanding the system. During the season, it has been that same voice which has rung loudest in support from the sideline. The senior guard may not see as much game action as her teammates, but her impact is resounding in a plethora of other areas \u2014 from running scout team during practice, to leading the defense chants during games, to offering a set of ears to listen or a shoulder to cry upon, Otto serves honorably in her role as the glue that keeps them together.\n\n\u201cShe could have done anything with her basketball career,\u201d Jaco said, \u201cbut she wanted to be here, and be part of the culture and legacy here. She\u2019s really made an impact.\u201d\n\nCampbell has played her last basketball game for the Cardinal and Gold. Sidelined by a back injury that has already required two surgeries, Campbell\u2019s concern at this point is her long-term health, not her jump shot. A former Gatorade Player of the Year finalist and McDonald\u2019s All-American nominee, her health concerns have proven disheartening \u2014 that frustration, however, has not kept Campbell from supporting her teammates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Campbell said of her injury issues, \u201cbut I still have a big part in this team. The girls need me.\u201d\n\nAt the start of every USC game, you can find Campbell in front of the Trojan bench, ready to greet each of the starters with an individualized handshake. During the game, you can find her at the end of the bench, infusing energy into her team with her enduring positive energy \u2014 a spirit that has helped the Trojans to surge to their best season in nearly a decade. A smile never leaves Campbell\u2019s face \u2014 even though in her heart of hearts, she wishes it was her on that court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re injured,\u201d Jaco said. \u201cYou\u2019re still trying to figure out how to be a part of the team and what that looks like. Her role has changed.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s 19-8 start is a strong turnaround for a team that finished last season with just twelve wins. The team has already accomplished a great deal this year, from beating national powerhouse Stanford to ascending to the AP Top 25 rankings for the first time since 2016. With the tournament play just around the corner, however, the true test is yet to come. As the Trojans finish their regular season this weekend against Washington and Washington State, the program looks ahead to the Pac-12 tournament and potentially \u2014 hopefully \u2014 March Madness.\n\nPerhaps it will be a good thing to have Campbell \u2014 whom many consider to be like a parent in the locker room \u2014 around the team during such a trying period.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely like a mom,\u201d Williams said. \u201cShe\u2019s always there, making sure we\u2019re on top of things and helping us out when we need it \u2014 and she\u2019ll be honest when we need it too.\u201d\n\nLike a good parent, Campbell understands that her role is no longer about her. It\u2019s about the family, the Trojan family. So through the mental and physical toll of rehabilitation and the yearning for what could have been with her own career, Campbell is committed to showing up for her teammates.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t leave when it got tough,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI still do have a big part in this team ... I look at it as a challenge every day, to best support my teammates in my senior year.\u201d\n\nWith Coach Gottlieb continuing to gain her footing in the program, talented young players such as Taylor Bigby, Aaliyah Gayles and Rayah Marshall in the fold and even the No. 1 recruit in the nation Juju Watkins on the way, the USC\u2019s women\u2019s basketball program appears poised to make a resurgence to the national spotlight.\n\nAs fun as it may be to look ahead, however, this season\u2019s Trojans are taking things one day at a time, rebuilding their Colosseum brick by brick. In the process, they acknowledge and appreciate the sacrifices made by those who laid the foundation for the future.\n\n\u201c[Miura, Otto and Campbell] have done a really good job at not putting themselves first and putting what the team needs and wants at the root of everything,\u201d Jaco said. \u201c[Staying] was a very difficult choice but I commend them for it.\u201d\n\nThe trio have just about seen it all \u2014 but when asked what their aspirations for the remainder of their time at USC, their focus shifted to one thing that they\u2019ve yet to experience.\n\n\u201cThe tournament,\u201d Otto said.\n\n\u201cMarch Madness,\u201d Campbell said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad if a college hooper goes their whole career and never makes it to the NCAA tournament,\u201d Miura added.\n\nTime can only tell if the Trojan triumvirate will get to check the March Madness tournament off their bucket list. With USC rolling, however, Miura, Otto and Campbell \u2014 the anchors of USC women\u2019s basketball program \u2014 appear to be well on their way.\n```"}

This wasn\u2019t just any set. Oscar had never seen anything like this in his eight years of working in film, \u201cPeople were speaking Spanish. I felt comfortable and at home and seen.\u201d Oscar Ramos is a USC School of Cinematic Arts grad and the Director of Photography for a new project spearheaded by a majority Latine crew.\n\n\u201cTortillas\u201d film is the first production in collaboration with the Latinx Film and Media Association (LatiFam) and is led by Latine writers, producers and directors; a rarity in media. It all began with a memory. Scriptwriter Brandy Hernandez could see a younger self, helping make tortillas with her grandma in Mexico. She remembered not pressing hard enough on the tortilla maker and getting frustrated at the tiny, misshapen tortillas she produced. Despite not being perfect, her late grandpa loved them.\n\n\u201cI like telling stories about real people and real experiences...I always unintentionally add elements of my culture into my scripts,\u201d said Brandy. And, that main focus of cultura is something that was not only seen on screen with an all-Latine cast but also off-screen with filmmakers coming together as a familia to make this memory come to life. Brandy mentioned the importance of representation on screen, emphasizing how seeing yourself in story plots can inspire and make people who often feel invisible, feel seen. The magic of this film, however, was behind the screen, \u201cIt\u2019s the people off screen that have the power\u201d.\n\nHector Martinez, a senior Film and TV production major and producer of \u201cTortillas\u201d has intersecting identities that are often underrepresented in media, being Latino and Gay, he says he often doesn\u2019t see himself in tv or film, on or off screen. That was the main reason Hector wanted to join the project, \u201cWe\u2019re opening the doors for other Latine productions to happen after this.\u201d Hector added, \u201cIt\u2019s nice knowing there\u2019s a community here.\u201d\n\nCommunidad is something director Martha Rodriguez also craved. As a second-year Masters of Fine Arts candidate for Film and TV production, she is the only Latina in her cohort of 60. She\u2019s one of five other Latine candidates. She joined \u201cTortillas\u201d to meet more Latine people and create a community. And what better way to connect than with a story about food? Oscar highlighted how food is a major part of being Latine, \u201ccooking and eating are really ingrained in our culture and it\u2019s how we build memories and connections.\u201d\n\n\u201cTortillas\u201d follows a story of a young girl faced with loss. But, despite experiencing this loss, the memory of making tortillas becomes an inspiration to heal and celebrate the time spent with loved ones. Food being the thing that ties generations together. After fundraising tirelessly for months on Trousdale and overcoming obstacles in finding a place to film, the cast and the crew got together on February 11, 12, and 13 to make this project come to life.\n\nMartha recalls one of the most exciting moments was having a child on set; it was also a great challenge in keeping her attention and keeping the film on track. Oscar, on the other hand, felt at home when the cast was speaking in Spanish, taken aback because this was not a common occurrence in filmmaking. Overall, the sense familia the crew built was the biggest and most important takeaway.\n\nHector surprised Martha with a birthday celebration on set. And, at the end of Sunday\u2019s production, the crew sat together to watch the Super Bowl and bond surrounded by props from Latine culture like an altar and tortilla powder. This was also a space for mentorship; as Martha mentioned, \u201c[we were like a] family that comes together and not only tries to make things like we\u2019re on the same page trying to get this work done, but we\u2019re there having fun learning new things.\u201d\n\nAs the production came to an end, the lights on set dimmed, and the house was put back into its regular state, the project marked a special point for these filmmakers: the beginning of a connection to cultura and communidad that will hopefully inspire future Latine filmmakers. \u201cTortillas\u201d will be shown at the LatiFam Film Festival in April.\n```"}

Hill St. (Photo courtesy of Ed Rudolph)\n\nBy Siara Carpenter and Marco Ramirez\nFebruary 23, 2023 at 3:37 pm PST\n\nHilltop Coffee + Kitchen, made famous by actress Issa Rae\u2019s partnership and flagship store in Inglewood, recently announced a pop up cafe in Downtown Los Angeles. Co-founders Yonnie Hagos and Ajay Relan created Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen in the summer of 2018 as a way to bring new energy to an area of predominantly mom-and-pop shops and fast food. Their Slauson location served as a community-oriented space where locals were hired and taught \u201cleadership and entrepreneurship through entry-level employment,\u201d Relan said.\n\nHaving a Black- and people-of-color-owned business in a predominantly POC area allowed Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen to quickly become a place for local creators, entrepreneurs, and organizers to connect with each other. The co-founders understood this purpose. They made sure \u201cevery design, detail, and menu item was reflective of the community that had lived through there for the past few decades, while also understanding that the demographics of the neighborhoods were changing.\u201d\n\nThe success of Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen comes not only from Hagos and Relan\u2019s background in restaurant management but also from their friendship. The two met when Hagos was a security guard at The Parlor, a sports bar in Hollywood that Relan frequented. The two became friends and eventually bought The Parlor in 2013, creating a culture and brand identity as one of Hollywood\u2019s hotspots. Although The Parlor was closed in February 2022, Hagos and Relan\u2019s mission did not end there.\n\nTheir partnership with SoLa Contemporary allows local artists to show their work at their restaurants to reflect the community around them. As the art travels from their original Slauson location to the rest of L.A., there is a pride in representing L.A. as it is home for Hagos, Relan, and Rae. \u201cThis area is one of the most culturally rich in the country. So we just wanted to intentionally put our roots down there,\u201d said Relan. \u201cAnd it\u2019s amazing to see the reception that we\u2019ve been able to get and the support that we\u2019ve been able to get, not just from the local communities that we\u2019re in, but we\u2019ve really become a destination for people across the city.\u201d\n\nMany USC students frequent the Inglewood location of Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen. The cultural richness and design plan is evident to graduate student David-Earl Russell, who remarked that he frequented the shop for \u201cthe vibe.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be somewhere where you are not comfortable ... The music and what they might have there to eat are tailored to your culture, so it\u2019s not just [going] to a space where you don\u2019t feel comfortable or you\u2019re not represented,\u201d said Russell.\n\nRussell called for attention on Black businesses, even when it is not Black History Month, commenting, \u201cI think [the expansion is] great because a lot of Black-owned businesses don\u2019t really see that much attention unless it\u2019s during this month. And hopefully, this energy can continue on beyond just this time.\u201d\n\nRae stated in the second Hilltop press release that she has personally written her work in coffee shops, so it always disappointed her that there weren\u2019t any that were Black-owned or even POC-owned coffee shops in her neighborhood. Black-owned coffee shops and safe spaces are especially useful for students. Sammy Austin, a senior from Georgia, had never been to a Black-owned coffee shop before Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen. Austin is the president of K\u00f3 Society, a social club for Black women on campus. K\u00f3 Society held a study session at the Inglewood location during finals season, and the atmosphere blew Austin away.\n\n\u201cIt was really neat to walk into a space where everyone else looks like you and no one\u2019s really judging you. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWhen we walked in, some of us ordered food, some didn\u2019t, but it wasn\u2019t like we got bad looks or glares because we weren\u2019t spending money. It was kind of just normal that we were sitting down to do our work.\u201d\n\nKo Society\u2019s time there was to support Black-owned businesses, but Austin is happy about the media\u2019s push of Black-owned businesses, calling it a \u201cstep forward in representation.\u201d\n\nHilltop Coffee + Kitchen has already made a mark on its community, but they are not done. While their new Downtown L.A. pop up will be a temporary fourth location, they are also opening up at Los Angeles International Airport through a partnership with United Airlines. They hope Hilltop will become a national brand rooted in \u201cbringing people together for the right reasons and preserving the richness of the community.\u201d\n\nRelan has a message for aspiring creatives who will do some of their best work at their coffee stop: \u201cCreation is such a beautiful thing, and as long as you create from the heart and it\u2019s something that you\u2019re being sincere about, somebody will take notice of and those are the people that really matter to you and your mission.\u201d\n\nThe pop-up store will be located at 718 S. Hill St. from February 22 through the summer and will be active on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. The Downtown menu will feature favorites like the Bangin\u2019 Breakfast Sandwich, Soul Bowl, and Hilltop \u201cDroptops\u201d; signature drinks like the Matcha Chata and Lavender Latte and locally roasted coffees. The space will have 279 interior seats, 22 reserved for private meetings, and 30 patio seats.\n```"}

The entire undergraduate population of 21,000 are eligible to vote, however, only one-fifth of this number is likely to participate in the voting process.\n\nMultiple students interviewed for the story admitted to their lack of information about USG elections. \u201cI\u2019ve seen all the signs and everything, but I don\u2019t know what it is or what they do or where to vote or why I should vote or anything,\u201d said Dean Woods, a freshman majoring in applied and computational mathematics and computer science.\n\nHowever, Krishnan stressed the magnitude of USG\u2019s role on campus and why voting is necessary, citing USG\u2019s financial responsibility. \u201cThe president, vice president and their cabinet are responsible for setting a $2.5 million budget and allocating that and $350,000 of that budget goes toward [Registered Student Organizations],\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re part of any club on campus, if you\u2019re hoping to be a leader in any of those clubs, funding is a huge way that those clubs are able to exist, and that funding comes from student government.\u201d\n\nUSG has been responsible for implementing and overseeing many programs on campus. This includes advocating for the now-implemented Fall Recess \u2014 an allotted four day break that comes before Thanksgiving Break, the start of the free LAX shuttle service and the planning of Spring Fest and the Welcome Back Concert, according to Krishnan.\n\nNaura Alyabis, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, noticed the voting booths on campus but assumed that they were just for another club. But now that she is aware of what the voting is for, Alybasis said she would consider casting her ballot.\n\nAmong the students that did vote today, some were just as uninformed on the platform of candidates and simply cast their ballot in support of a friend. \u201cMy friend was running for president, so I voted for him,\u201d said Julia Hague, a sophomore majoring in human biology. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about the policies.\u201d\n\nPresident Woodworth emphasized the importance of voting and casting your ballot for the candidates that best suit your ideals. \u201cThis is your way to make your voice heard and ensure that your opinions and values are reflected in our student representation,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important, especially this year, to educate yourselves on the different platforms so that you ensure that the person that you\u2019re voting for actually represents what you think is most important.\u201d\n\nVoting will remain open until Sunday, February 26, with in-person voting booths made available from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day.\n```"}

Becker balances music as both a study and profession as part of the USC Thornton School of Music. Her indie rock music picks up influences from Taylor Swift to Phoebe Bridgers. Her role in music comes with vulnerability, as she uses her real-life to inspire lyrics and song ideas. Her hit song, \u201cKeep it Cool\u201d harnesses the raw feeling of her live-performances.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with Becker to learn more about her inspirations and creative processes while working on \u201cKeep it Cool.\u201d\n\nBecker: Hi, my name is Liz Becker. I am a junior in USC Thornton School of Music. My major is popular music performance with an emphasis in vocals, and I am from the Bay Area, California.\n\nBecker: I love being in Thornton. It\u2019s really cool because it\u2019s like a super small cohort of people. It\u2019s like 30 of us. So we\u2019ve all gotten really close and there\u2019s definitely a good bond between all of us and we all collaborate and are doing music together all the time.\n\nBecker: Yeah, so I am kind of indie rock I would say. Definitely have taken influence from Taylor Swift. She\u2019s probably my biggest inspiration. But then other artists like Lizzy McAlpine and Phoebe Bridgers, that kind of whole realm of artists.\n\nBecker: Honestly, I\u2019ve been singing for, like, as long as I can remember. I think I started when I was like three. I just was always kind of interested in it. I would memorize soundtracks to movies and sing them. And then my parents kind of noticed that that was something I was interested in. So they signed me up for musical theater and I did musical theater for a long time.\n\nBecker: It was just kind of all I really knew growing up because it was just what I wanted to do. And I don\u2019t think I ever really questioned it honestly, until I got to college and I was like, \u2018Oh, this is actually really hard. Like, do I actually want to do this?\u2019 But then I realized that I do.\n\nBecker: I think a lot of the artists that I listen to are pretty lyric heavy. That\u2019s kind of what they\u2019re focused on. So honestly, like Taylor Swift, I get a lot of inspiration from her, but I also read a lot, so I think that probably helps. Most of it is personal experience. Sometimes I\u2019ll write about, you know, I get inspired from watching movies and reading books.\n\nBecker: It was a song that I wrote in high school and I worked with a local producer just in my little hometown. And I just released it. It was called \u201cFor You.\u201d You can\u2019t find it anywhere now. So, but yeah, that was the first one.\n\nBecker: Best memory. Honestly, something that comes to mind. I played a show at The Echo, which is a venue in L.A., and it was just really cool because that was the first time that I played a show with majority of my original songs, because a lot of the time I\u2019ll have a lot of covers in there, but this time it was pretty much a show just showcasing my own music.\n\nBecker: A challenge. Just coming into USC has been\u2013 it\u2019s just like, the best of the best people are here. So it\u2019s like you just like automatically have imposter syndrome. Like the second that you walk in and you see what everyone can do and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, shoot. Like I am not supposed to be here.\u2019\n\nBecker: I wrote this song myself, all the lyrics and the music. And then I collaborated with two producers in Thornton, Evan Pruett and Truman Sinclair, shout out. They were amazing.\n\nBecker: It was a song that I wrote about a person that goes to USC and we kind of were like in a relationship at the beginning of \u2013 or yeah, freshman year and it\u2019s all about him.\n\nBecker: I started writing it. So the line that I wrote, actually, it started out as just that line. \u2018I say I love you to all my friends. So that night I almost slipped up.\u2019\n\nBecker: Because a lot of our projects and stuff for school are music, it\u2019s like, you know, you only have a certain amount of music creative battery in your day. So sometimes I\u2019ll be working on a school project or something or rehearsing for a performance and I\u2019ll get home and be like, \u2018Shoot, I totally want to work on my own music, but I\u2019m also so drained.\u2019\n\nBecker: Yeah, so I have another song. It\u2019s called \u201cAdrenaline,\u201d and we\u2019re almost done with it. We just have to put a couple more finishing touches and then it\u2019ll be done. And I think I\u2019ll be releasing that sometime in the new year in January probably.\n\nBecker: Next semester and leading into senior year it\u2019s going to be a lot of just trying to figure out what I\u2019m doing after college. And I think what I want to do after college is be a songwriter and not just for myself, but try to write for other people.\n\nBecker: I think probably just realizing that I have a following. No matter how big the following is, but just finally being like, \u2018Okay, there\u2019s a group of people who are willing to support me and will come to my shows and not just like my friends that I already have, but just random people.\u2019 And I think once I start to see that grow, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Okay, there\u2019s some momentum.\u2019\n\nBecker: Being a singer-songwriter is a very unique form of art because you\u2019re the one writing it and then also performing it. So I think, I don\u2019t know. I think for me that\u2019s very fulfilling because you get to have the process of creating something, but then also like being like you know, this is me and, and I feel like both sides of it are very vulnerable.\n```"}

Times assistant managing editor and head of the copy desk who died from a sudden and unexpected illness in September. Nearly 400 people joined the celebration at the DoubleTree Hotel ballroom in Little Tokyo to pay their respects to Fuhrmann \u2014 a testament to the number of lives he touched and affected.\n\nGuests watched a retrospective of Fuhrmann\u2019s 65 years \u2013 a collage of images that impressed the audience with the richness of his life in and beyond the workplace. Fuhrmann was a husband, a father of two daughters and two stepchildren, and a loving cat dad.\n\n\u201cHe made everyone feel loved,\u201d said Lindi Dreibelbis, Fuhrmann\u2019s wife. Fuhrmann cared deeply about the relationships in his life and community.\n\n\u201cIf you forced me to name a dozen stories I was proud to be a part of, it would take me some work,\u201d said Fuhrmann in a recorded video. \u201cI can name hundreds of people that I can remember more than the work.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the best dad,\u201d said Angela Fuhrmann, one of Henry\u2019s two daughters. \u201cRegardless of all the work that he was doing, he always showed up.\u201d\n\nElena Fuhrmann said she learned from her father that \u201cyou don\u2019t need to be the loudest person in the room to have your voice be heard,\u201d but instead \u201cto lead with kindness and calmness.\u201d\n\nUSC alum Jessica Doherty, former executive editor of Annenberg Media, remembered working with Fuhrmann in the newsroom. She said the professor would tell her they were equals.\n\n\u201cI always found it so baffling that he always said that we were equals and co-editors ... because he was so well accomplished and so amazing,\u201d Doherty said. She said the professor used to say to her, \u201cYou run the show. This is about you and the team. I\u2019m just here to help.\u201d\n\nDoherty, who overlapped with Fuhrmann for several years, attended the service along with several other alumni.\n\nFuhrmann, a Japanese American journalist, also worked with the Asian American Journalists Association, advocating for representation and diversity in newsrooms. One of his most notable accomplishments was a simple yet immensely important keystroke. The removal of the hyphen from \u201cAsian American,\u201d which Fuhrmann said implied that an individual was not a full American.\n\nWhen used previously in \u201cAsian-American\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d the hyphen implied that someone wasn\u2019t a full citizen of America, but only part American even if they were born and raised in America.\n\n\u201cTo him, that hyphen had to come out,\u201d said Ruthane Salido, L.A. Times employee and Fuhrmann\u2019s ex-wife. \u201cHenry was really determined that hyphenate Americans be regarded as full Americans.\u201d\n\nTo Fuhrmann, hyphens divided while their purpose was to connect. As a result of Fuhrmann\u2019s efforts, the Associated Press Stylebook, the leading style guide in the journalism industry, removed the hyphen from its stylistic guidelines.\n\nFuhrmann is also a core contributor to the Annenberg curriculum and has a permanent footprint in the program\u2019s required modules in which he teaches undergraduate and graduate students how to use language around race with precision.\n\nFuhrmann\u2019s work never took him away from what was really important to him.\n\n\u201cHenry was calm and kind and a listener,\u201d said Don Chomiak, a classmate and friend of Fuhrmann\u2019s at Columbia University. \u201cAlthough he was very mild in his manner, there was steel inside. He was tough when he had to be, but he chose to be kind and to be patient and to be a listener.\u201d\n\nIn the video, his wife recalled how the pair met.\n\n\u201cHenry and I met in a very crowded place: online dating, as most people do,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a 91% match, it seemed like fate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis smile is what caught my attention,\u201d said Dreibelbis, \u201cand then I read his beautifully written profile, of course.\u201d\n\nShe continued to share the memories she made with Fuhrmann.\n\n\u201cOur wedding was really small and he was concerned about the small portions at these eloquent restaurants, so it was his idea to have the party bus to stop at In-N-Out Burger,\u201d said Dreibelbis.\n\nDoherty was astounded when at the end of the service, it was revealed that Fuhrmann played a huge part in planning it himself.\n\n\u201cI thought it was so beautiful as a last parting gift to everyone whose lives he touched, and especially because he was such a community-focused man and reporter and professor,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cIt was really amazing and heartwarming to see that he kind of had one last trick of kindness up his sleeve,\u201d Doherty added. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal to think that, in his final moments of life, he was still thinking of others.\u201d\n\nAs the service concluded, attendees were gifted Fuhrmann\u2019s famous coffee mugs filled with candy.\n\n\u201cIt felt like he was back with us for a minute,\u201d Doherty said.\n\nChace Beech, who earned a master\u2019s in journalism in 2020, fondly remembers when Fuhrmann was her professor.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about Professor Fuhrmann, I think about his pursuit of excellence when it comes to writing and editing. His North Star was excellence in journalism, but he didn\u2019t do it with an iron fist,\u201d she said, \u201che did it with complete gentleness and a real sense of humor and a lightness.\u201d\n\nShe said he taught her to \u201ctake the work seriously, but don\u2019t take yourself too seriously.\u201d\n\nElias Jabbe, a former contributor to Annenberg Media, considered Fuhrmann a longtime mentor.\n\n\u201cHe chose February 19 as the day for his memorial service because it\u2019s the Day of Remembrance for Japanese Americans,\u201d Jabbe said.\n\nAs the video concluded, viewers got to hear words of wisdom from Fuhrmann one last time: \u201cTogether we can do so much that can make a difference and that\u2019s really what it is all about.\u201d\n\nFuhrmann's infamous coffee mug was gifted to all at the conclusion of the service.\n```"}

Shane Dimapanat has the story. Suspended isn\u2019t exactly withdrawing though and Russia says it will still honor the treaty\u2019s limits on warheads and launchers, causing some to wonder why suspend in the first place!\n\nIt\u2019s another indirect form of nuclear saber rattling. And obviously his main priority is the war in Ukraine. He wants to see all the Western support for Ukraine reduced or halted and in a very clumsy way, he\u2019s trying to leverage Russian participation in the New START treaty to get that. That was Robert English, an expert in Russia\u2019s politics and international relations. He says that Russia is obviously the bad guy today, even as Putin blames American aggression and interference in the Ukrainian war for the suspension.\n\nBut English also says the U.S has a hand in the deterioration of Nuclear restrictions today, but not in the way that Putin says. There were many treaties besides the New START Treaty that was signed in 2010 by former Presidents Barrack Obama and Russia\u2019s Dmitry Medvedev that limited each country to 1550 nuclear warheads and 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles and heavy bombers. There was the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile, or ABM treaty which ended in 2001.\n\nThe death of the ABM Treaty was the first major blow to the nuclear arms control regime. And we did it under George W Bush. Nuclear arms control has been deteriorating for a long time, with Bush striking the ABM treaty in 2001 as English says, and Trump with the INF treaty in 2019. And the recent situation with Russia\u2019s suspension exacerbates the issue of nuclear control further.\n\nPeter Carnevale, expert in conflict management, couldn\u2019t give an interview but said the situation is bleak to say the least.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia are not the only nuclear powers and we have two issues ongoing. One is. China after decades of maintaining a very small nuclear force has in recent years been building up from dozens to hundreds of missiles. And potentially moving up into the major leagues, if we can call it that, where the U.S. and Russia aren\u2019t. So that\u2019s already a nuclear arms race. But, the treaty is eroding, and the question is if it will be renewed or extended in 2026.\n\nThe treaty is important because first, it puts concrete limits on weapons. And second, it creates an atmosphere of trust, transparency, and openness. Because when we don\u2019t know what the Russians are up to, we assume the worst and we start building up rapidly. If they don\u2019t know what we\u2019re up to, they assume the worst and it becomes a spiral, an unnecessary spiral.\n\nRegardless of the issue, English says de-escalation is still possible.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, this is Shane Dimapanat.\n```"}

Eric R. Holder Jr., who was convicted last year of fatally shooting Hussle in 2019, is scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2023, in a Los Angeles courtroom. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n\nBy Sana Mahmud and Jacob Wheeler\nFebruary 22, 2023 at 5:36 pm PST\n\nNipsey Hussle\u2019s murderer was sentenced on Wednesday to a 60-year prison term, but around USC, students were more focused on the late rapper\u2019s legacy than on the man who killed him. Eric R. Holder Jr. was found guilty of first-degree murder last summer for fatally shooting the beloved hip-hop artist. Hussle was shot and killed in March 2019 outside a clothing store he owned in South Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the Mount Rushmore figures for me growing up,\u201d Matty Beavers, a graduate student studying film production, said. \u201c[Nipsey] spoke up about real things that were happening and didn\u2019t brag about anything. He just kept it real.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, 2019, Holder gunned down Hussle \u2014 shooting him at least 10 times outside his clothing store, the Marathon, in South L.A. The cold-blooded killing sent shockwaves throughout the country. Xander Izower, a junior from New York studying economics, remembers that fateful day well. He described Hussle as one of the most \u201cquintessential\u201d hip-hop artists.\n\n\u201cWhen the news broke that he was killed, [in] my high school heads were down because he produced a lot of really good music growing up,\u201d Izower said.\n\nHussle\u2019s triumphant studio album Victory Lap earned him a Grammy nomination months before his death. During the 62nd Grammy Awards in 2020, Hollywood honored Hussle with two posthumous Grammy Awards. He won Best Rap/Sung Performance for his feature in DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cHigher\u201d and Best Rap Performance for \u201cRacks in the Middle.\u201d\n\nHussle\u2019s sprawling influence stretches beyond the music industry. He was a father of two, a championed community leader and vocal advocate against gun violence. Months before his passing, the slain rapper planned to meet with L.A. police officers to address gang violence. Hussle\u2019s devotion to community activism lies in his commitment to \u201cgiving solutions and inspiration\u201d for young Black men.\n\nFor Christian Yosef, a graduate student studying film production, Hussle paved the way for people like him. \u201cNipsey is half Eritrean. I got roots from Eritrean, so it\u2019s cool seeing somebody I love \u2014 rap and seeing somebody from my background \u2014 make it,\u201d Yosef said. \u201c[He was] somebody that was doing good for the community. It\u2019s just sad what happened.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1985, Hussle was raised in the Crenshaw District of South L.A. At 14 years old, Hussle joined the Rollin 60\u2032s Neighborhood Crips, a street gang in Los Angeles. In 2002 at the age of 17, Hussle separated from the gang and independently released his first mixtape. From there, a star was born.\n\nIn his rise to fame, Hussle never lost sight of the community that started it all. He invested in Vector 90, an inner city coworking community focused on STEM education and developing underrepresented entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cIt gave comfort knowing that he was from the city,\u201d Kayla Gamble, a freshman studying dental assisting said. \u201cI think a lot of people [saw] him in a gang first, then [saw] what he was actually singing, which was like loyalty, respect [and] family. He\u2019ll be deeply missed.\u201d\n\nSuperior Court Judge H.

So those are things that, you know, the big search engines should keep in mind.\u201d\n\nProfessor Aguilar says, regardless of the engine, the important thing for you to keep in mind is the credibility of the information you are digesting.\n\nAGUILAR: \u201cSome information on TikTok can also be distributed without context, without sources. So, you know, that could be one thing to definitely look at. And it\u2019s really important.

(AP Photo/Hakim Wright Sr. )\n\nBy Jacob Hare February 22, 2023 at  5:22 pm PST\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d is a column by Jacob Hare that discusses offseason football news in the Pac-12 conference. With over 120 transfers joining the Pac-12 next season, it\u2019s almost impossible to know what players will have an immediate impact next season. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 knowing the conference inside and out is my job. In this week\u2019s column, I will break down the Pac-12 transfers with the most guaranteed effects on the conference.\n\nShedeur Sanders, QB: Colorado\nDeion Sanders\u2019 son Shedeur will join him as they go from Jackson State to Colorado. Sanders will be touted as one of the best quarterbacks in the conference even before he steps on the field. Sanders had a remarkable two-year career at Jackson State as he went 21-3, threw for over 6,900 yards and had 70 passing touchdowns. Sanders was even the 2022 Southwestern Athletic Conference Offensive Player of the Year. Now the current knock on him is that he was putting up these numbers against FCS opponents, but that narrative will be squashed early in the season. Sanders has an enormous amount of talent that allows him to be a successful college quarterback. He has the arm strength, athleticism, size and pocket awareness that winning quarterbacks possess. He could get drafted by an NFL team if he has another great season. This transfer was a massive pickup for Colorado, who looks to do better than last season\u2019s dreadful 1-11 record under first-year head coach Deion Sanders.\n\nTravis Hunter, CB/WR: Colorado\nESPN\u2019s No. 1 transfer and the former No. 1 overall recruit in the class of 2022 is moving with Shedeur and Deion Sanders. Last season, Hunter became one of the most electrifying players in the country. Sanders unlocked Hunter\u2019s unique skill set, with the top recruit playing on both sides of the ball. This versatility is rare in the modern era, but Jackson State succeeded immensely as Hunter thrived in his dual-threat role. In addition to being a lockdown corner, he caught 18 passes for 188 yards and 4 touchdowns. The sky\u2019s the limit for Hunter, and I don\u2019t think anyone understands his value as much as Sanders does. Transferring to Colorado was likely the best option for the Hunter. Sanders should have an enormous role in store for Hunter this season, and he will be one of the most vital assets as Colorado looks to compete for a Pac-12 championship.\n\nDorian Singer, WR: USC\nDorian Singer won\u2019t have to travel far as he transfers from Arizona to USC. Singer is a massive pickup for the Trojans \u2014 he was the 2nd leading receiver in the conference last season, hauling in 1,105 yards with 6 touchdowns. After the season, there was a lot of uncertainty about who would replace Jordan Addison after he decided to forgo his senior year with USC and enter the draft. However, those worries can be put to rest as Singer should immediately become the team\u2019s number one wideout. While USC\u2019s wideout room has incredible depth with players such as Mario Williams, Brenden Rice, Kyle Ford and Tahj Washington on the roster, I would argue that Singer is considerably more talented. For instance, he overtook Jacob Cowings for Arizona\u2019s No. 1 wide receiver spot last season, and Cowings was a top-three wide receiver in the Pac-12 last year. That should speak to how influential Singer will be for the Trojans. I expect the offense to catch up as they move to Singer with the loss of Addison.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, QB: Oregon State\nFormer five-star recruit D.J. Uiagalelei entered Clemson with sky-high expectations following in 2021 first-overall pick Trevor Lawrence\u2019s footsteps. However, Uiagalelei could never find his footing at Clemson and now looks to revive his career at Oregon State. Uiagalelei showed flashes of his potential at Clemson, but those moments lasted only a short time and got overshadowed by his countless mistakes. Uiagalelei is a talented quarterback, as he possesses the size and athleticism. While Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney has an incredible track record with quarterbacks, it just didn\u2019t work out between him and Uiagalelei. Now Oregon State Head Coach Jonathan Smith will try his luck at fixing Uiagalelei. This job will be a tall task, but if successful, could put Oregon State in serious Pac-12 title consideration. Oregon State was 9-3 last season, with uncertainty at the quarterback position holding them back the entire season. With a veteran quarterback who can make winning plays for the Beavers, I like their chances to be a sleeping giant in the Pac-12 next season.\n\nJordan Burch, DE: Oregon\nThe former top ten overall recruit in the class of 2020 will look to make an immediate impact for Oregon. Burch had a somewhat disappointing career at South Carolina after coming in with expectations to become a game wrecker for the Gamecocks. He was never able to find consistency, but will look to anchor an Oregon defense that is losing many vital pieces. Burch adds a presence up front that the Ducks desperately need in a conference featuring some of the country\u2019s best dual-threat quarterbacks. I believe Oregon Head Coach Dan Lanning will utilize Burch to his maximum potential and make him the great player everyone thought he would be coming out of high school.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

City ordinance upending restaurants\n\nThe next time you head to your favorite caf\u00e9, outdoor seating may no longer be an option. Viztango Cafe, an Italian restaurant on Figueroa street, lost about 50% of its business during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to owner Tito Rivera.\n\nBy Skye Lee, Spencer Cline, and Devon Lee\nFebruary 22, 2023 at 5:21 pm PST\n\nCovid upended all our lives but the one silver lining was the al-fresco program. USC School of Architecture professor, Valery Augustine explains. AUGUSTINE: There was a specific ordinance enacted that allowed restaurants to do dining outdoors. But now with Covid winding down, city officials are trying to figure out how to keep this pandemic program going. Recently, the LA City Council approved to keep the program but are proposing expensive and time-consuming requirements to maintain it. Many businesses may not be able to meet these demands. This has left some restaurant go-ers like Professor Augustine disappointed.\n\nAUGUSTINE: But I think they should just open it up and allow restaurants to do that. If anything, we\u2019ve also shown that it doesn\u2019t negatively impact the public life or the public right of way to have cafes. And that\u2019s what businesses would like to do but the new proposed ordinance would require restaurants that want to serve outdoors to re-apply again for things like permits and inspections. The cost? Tens of thousands of dollars. For small restaurants that are already struggling to pay the bills, that cost could be a death sentence.\n\nL.A. City Planning chief external affairs officer Yeghig Keshishian says with the emergency order being lifted, the City must comply with current laws and preserve the pre-pandemic al fresco. But Augustine says L.A. is behind the times.\n\nAUGUSTINE: I would say, especially in comparison to other major cities around the world, the sidewalk cafes are standard almost. And if anything, it\u2019s surprising that we don\u2019t have as much of it here in L.A., especially considering our weather. And so when you go to other cities, places where the weather is much less hospitable, you have a lot of outdoor dining. And so I think in a city like L.A., it\u2019s way overdue that we have that we can have more outdoor seating.\n\nEither way, businesses might be left with the decision of having to pay the hefty fees or to shut down their outdoor seating. The planning department has 3 months to streamline the regulations and report back to the City Council, hopefully figuring out a way for businesses to keep their outdoor seating open.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Skye Lee.\n```"}

USC students have begun to direct questions normally reserved for more traditional search engines to the social media platform TikTok. \u201cAlmost 40% of young people, when they\u2019re looking for a place for lunch, they don\u2019t go to Google Maps or Search, they go on Tik Tok or Instagram,\u201d Google Senior Vice President Prabhakar Raghavan said last July at Fortune\u2019s Brainstorm Tech conference. Gen Zers make up more than 40% of TikTok\u2019s users. With this large percentage of the user base, they\u2019re reinventing the app\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\u201cI use TikTok as a means for searching for things I don\u2019t know,\u201d freshman health promotion major Andrew Bui said. \u201cFor example, for Halloween, I used it as a way to look for ideas for a costume.\u201d Since 2018, TikTok has become one of the world\u2019s leading social media platforms. The short-form content app averages more than one billion monthly viewers, more than both Snapchat and Twitter. The app\u2019s boom in popularity and innovative style of content has even inspired Instagram, Facebook and YouTube to adapt their own feeds to mirror TikTok.\n\nThe popularity of the app can be largely attributed to Gen Z, which includes those born between 1997 and 2012. USC students said they will go to the app for a good spot to eat or even what to wear for a job interview. \u201cI feel like it gives me first-hand reviews, versus Yelp, which has a lot of biased reviews that are like, \u2018Oh the waitstaff is terrible. I am going to give it one star,\u2019\u201d senior sociology major Liam Escobar said. \u201cWhere TikTok is more, \u2018Here\u2019s a list of places that are good for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnlike Google or Yahoo, a TikTok video enables the creator to speak directly to its users. For many students, it can feel more genuine than just reading the top result from a Google search. \u201cI feel like I am getting a more personal experience,\u201d freshman human biology major Jared Smith said. \u201cI can see people\u2019s true reactions to things.\u201d\n\nWhen USC students scroll on TikTok, they\u2019re not consuming content written or produced by someone 20 or 30 years older than them. When they\u2019re on the app, students can feel a strong connection to creators, seeing as their demographic is more represented. \u201cYou can actually see where the information is coming from, rather than Google, where it could be middle-aged white guys telling you about the hottest bars in L.A.,\u201d junior music industry major Austin Coven said. Coven said being able to relate to the information makes it much more enjoyable. \u201cI think the people know what they\u2019re talking about more on TikTok because they have no incentive to post,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Google, some people\u2019s job is to write academic or scholarly articles about things that don\u2019t need to be academic or scholarly.\u201d\n```"}

The USC student examined by Tyndall said she was inappropriately touched and asked intrusive questions during a routine medical check-up, according to Townsen. The LAPD detective shared the woman\u2019s experience on her behalf because she was not in attendance.\n\nHer story is one of many shared by investigators in a series of preliminary hearings held in criminal court Tuesday. The graduate student, referred to by the pseudonym \u201cJane Doe 17\u2032\u2032 for the hearing, recounted her uncomfortable experience with the doctor in a series of interviews conducted by Townsen. Townsen has interviewed over 30 alleged victims.\n\nFor 30 years, George Tyndall was the only full-time gynecologist at USC. Complaints of his sexual misconduct began in the 1990s, although Tyndall was not asked to resign until 2017. Over 700 women have come forward with allegations of harassment against Tyndall and he currently faces 35 criminal counts of alleged misconduct between the years of 2009 and 2016, according to the L.A. Times.\n\nThe preliminary hearings initially began in November 2021 when two USC alumni and former patients testified against Tyndall. It resumed in December 2022 with four additional alumni taking the stand and resumed again Tuesday morning. Preliminary hearings are held in felony cases after a defendant enters a non-guilty plea. When the hearing concludes, the judge will decide whether the evidence presented would warrant a full trial for Tyndall. If convicted, Tyndall could face up to 64 years in prison.\n\nDuring the hearing, Townsen testified that he had conducted two interviews with Doe 17 between the months of May and June in 2019. According to Townsen\u2019s report, Doe 17 had one medical visit with Tyndall in February 2011 for a routine gynecological exam, in which she described being \u201cfelt up\u201d and that Tyndall\u2019s actions were conducted in a \u201csexual encounter kind of way.\u201d\n\nAn L.A. Times article from May 2018 influenced Doe to initially speak out against Tyndall, after recognizing him in an image and realizing he was the same doctor she felt uncomfortable with years prior. Townsen\u2019s report revealed that he had also spoken to the victim\u2019s mother, who Doe 17 had called after her encounter with Tyndall. According to Townsen\u2019s report, Doe 17 told her mother she was \u201ccreeped out\u201d and that she considered the experience \u201codd and disturbing, like something just wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nDuring her exam, Doe 17 recalled several questions and comments from Tyndall about her sex life that made her uncomfortable. Townsen shared some of Tyndall\u2019s quotes outloud for the courtroom: \u201cI see you. I see you\u2019ve had a C-section,\u201d Tyndall said.\u201dIt\u2019s nice and tight,\u201d in reference to her vagina. Doe 17 also said Tyndall asked her specifically about blowjobs and anal sex and about her sex life post-birth. She recounted her breast exam lasting several minutes, while others she had previously took seconds. Doe 17 did not recall Tyndall using gloves when examining the inside of her vagina.\n\nTyndall was present in the courthouse and is not currently in detention. A total of 11 people attended the hearing, but Doe 17 was not present. No recordings of the interviews between Townsen and Doe 17 exist. Townsen constantly referred to his reports during the hearing to clarify information and quote his interviewees.\n```"}

GSWOC was created to protect the rights of graduate student workers and help them overcome issues such as high housing costs, low pay and poor health care. As of Friday, the group officially joined United Auto Workers, one of the most well-known labor unions that represents workers both in the United States and Canada.\n\n\u201cWe are so energized by this resounding vote in favor of our union,\u201d said Stepp Mayes, a graduate student in civil and environmental engineering. \u201cThe support for our union keeps growing stronger, and we will be bringing this solidarity and energy to the bargaining table.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident that our union will be good for us and good for USC, and we look forward to meeting them at the table soon to bargain a contract that makes us all stronger,\u201d Mayes added.\n\nAccording to the GSWOC website, the goal of the election was to secure the right to collectively bargain with the USC administration. Given that graduate students voted to form a union, elected graduate student worker representatives will be able to negotiate with USC administration over pay, benefits and workplace protections.\n\nThe decision to unionize passed with a 93% supermajority vote, according to the tally by the National Labor Relations Board.\n\n\u201cThe mobilization that has created the [union] is something that is going to have a positive and long-term impact on [graduate workers\u2019] experience of working at USC,\u201d Kritika Pandey, a fourth-year Ph.d. student active in the organization, said. \u201cNow we have these safe spaces, we have these groups of people that we talk to keep in touch with and definitely makes me at least feel less isolated and much more supported.\u201d\n\nThe vote to unionize will affect 3,000 graduate student workers, according to a press release. Along with several other California schools, including the University of California schools, the \u201cyes\u201d vote for USC graduate student union workers means that they could receive benefits through bargaining.\n\n\u201cWe have specific goals like getting a living wage, getting better health benefits, getting support for international students in terms of visa and immigration issues,\u201d Pandey said. \u201cBut we also have a larger goal of being a part of the larger student worker movement that\u2019s happening in the U.S. right now to create academic spaces that actually embody principles of social justice and equity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pandey and Mayes, the next step for the organization is democratically electing a bargaining team. The bargaining team will be elected by the union and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with USC administration. The organization will also focus on setting up events and sending out surveys to narrow down bargaining demands.\n\n\u201cThe goal is the same thing [as the UC schools], to continue to make improvements and have good contracts, we want this to have like a cultural change at USC,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cI love working here, but sometimes it can be a place where there\u2019s a lack of support for each other, and I think that this can be part of the general shift to workers really caring about each other and supporting each other and feeling supported by the administration.\u201d\n\nMark Woodall, a doctorate candidate in physics at UC Merced, prioritizes proper working conditions for graduate student workers as part of his duties as chair of the UAW campus unit.\n\n\u201cIn other jobs you are still being treated appropriately as an employee,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cThat is what we view as being the necessary condition for U.S. workers and just really for graduate workers everywhere.\u201d\n\nWoodall views USC\u2019s overwhelmingly one-sided election results as something that represents a bigger issue for student workers across the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is important to note that USC is not the only organization that is seeing these kinds of lopsided voting results,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cI think what it tells you is that there is a very urgent need nationwide at universities everywhere to solve these work imbalances.\u201d\n\nWith the results of this election, graduate students at USC can now begin efforts to improve their working experience.\n```"}

In 2020, during the COVID-19 quarantine, she started a food and fitness blog on Instagram called \u201cJordie\u2019s Recipes and Reps.\u201d She soon became a star among family and friends.\n\nBut Roberson\u2019s passion pulled her to keep learning, and she dedicated her free time to watching cooking videos on YouTube channels like \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\u201d and \u201cEpicurious.\u201d \u201cI mean my parents knew how to cook, but I wasn\u2019t really watching them and writing it down,\u201d Roberson said. \u201cIt was really through trying new things, I just like exploring with new food.\u201d\n\nAfter posting for about two years, she finally took the leap to start her business in fall of 2022. It was a nerve wracking process, but she didn\u2019t do it alone. Roberson, along with her three friends, sat in her living room planning everything out for hours. Together, they wrote down recipes, brainstormed when to launch, and created a new Instagram page, \u201cJordie\u2019s Joint,\u201d to get the word out.\n\n\u201cIt was so fun,\u201d Roberson said about the process. \u201cMy friend made the logo, then we worked on the color scale.

(Photo by Grace Galante)\n\nBy Grace Galante\nFebruary 22, 2023 at 9:35 am PST\n\nJust three years ago, Benson Tsai was a senior battery engineer at Elon Musk\u2019s space exploration company, SpaceX. Now, he spends most of his time in a truck on the USC Greek Row handing out pizza to college students with what he likes to call the \u201cdrunchies,\u201d (drunk munchies).\n\nAfter working at SpaceX for five years, Tsai knew he needed a change. He quit his job and decided to build a company from the ground up along with some of his SpaceX co-workers. His startup, Stellar Pizza, uses robotics to make pizzas entirely from scratch. The company received 16.5 million dollars in funding from Jay-Z\u2019s venture capital fund, Marcy Venture Partners, and is one of the many companies looking to further automate the restaurant industry.\n\n\u201cI actually got my chemical engineering degree in food science and food manufacturing, and I really wanted to work on making food at scale,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cI got distracted with a brief stint in electric vehicles and on spaceships, but now I\u2019m here really following my passion.\u201d\n\nIt took more than 30 SpaceX engineers to develop, but now Stellar\u2019s technology can cook a pie from start to finish. First, the machine opens the dough ball and adds sauce, cheese and toppings. Then, the pizza is placed into an oven where it cooks for two minutes. Once it\u2019s done, the pizza travels down a conveyor belt and into the hands of a Stellar employee, who packs it in a box and serves it to the customer. The entire process of cooking a pizza can be tracked on a tablet, and Tsai says it takes 4 1/2 minutes start-to-finish.\n\nWhile the cooking is left primarily to robots, there are still human chefs working in the trucks. Ted Cizma is the director of culinary operations at Stellar Pizza and was previously the executive chef at SpaceX. In his position at Stellar, he works in research and development to determine what types of ingredients are most compatible with the machines. He says he\u2019s nailed down the marinara sauce recipe and is close to perfecting the dough.\n\nAnd though machines have taken over most of his job as chef, he says the cooking process is not entirely automated ... yet.\n\n\u201cIt only really requires a human employee to measure the ingredients and add the dough into the mixing and producing equipment. From there, it\u2019s mixed, it\u2019s divided, it\u2019s rounded and put into trays automatically,\u201d Cizma said. \u201cAt the end of the process, the employees load the trays into the trucks. I could definitely see both of those tasks eventually being automated.\u201d\n\nHowever, he insists that human staff will always be a part of the business model.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to eliminate humans from the process because somebody\u2019s got to taste it. Somebody\u2019s got to teach the robots how to make the pizza. They don\u2019t really know it on their own, right? So there\u2019s always going to be a role for culinary ends in this process, regardless of how automated it becomes,\u201d Cizma said.\n\nHe adds that automating parts of the cooking process can alleviate struggles the hospitality and restaurant industry are facing now with labor shortages. And Stellar isn\u2019t the first company to realize this. Fast-food chains like White Castle and Jack in the Box have used robots as fry cooks in some locations. Additionally, more and more tech companies have arisen, like Miso Robotics, that design technology specifically for restaurants.\n\nDespite these technological advances, according to a study done by Big Red Rooster, 30% of consumers are skeptical of robot chefs preparing their food. Not only do they lack a human touch, but they could also eliminate millions of back-of-the-house jobs in the restaurant industry. As of 2021, 11.2 million people work in the restaurant industry, and nearly 80% of these jobs could eventually get eliminated by automation, according to restaurant consulting firm Aaron Allen & Associates.\n\nOn the flip side, Cizma says that restaurants who don\u2019t embrace automation will be left behind. Because of their automated technology, Stellar\u2019s operation costs are significantly reduced - bringing the cost down for consumers. Plus, Stellar sources, cooks and delivers their products independently, which also contributes to low prices. Currently, a 12-inch cheese pizza from Stellar costs $7.95, compared to $11.99 at Domino\u2019s and $14.49 at Papa John\u2019s.\n\nCizma adds that robotics can help restaurants price competitively, therefore attracting more customers. Additionally, he says that lower prices can help eradicate food deserts, which are prevalent in South Los Angeles, where USC is located.\n\n\u201cWhere we are, it\u2019s pretty much a food desert. So if you\u2019re on a minimal food budget, you know your options are fast food, right? So, yes, we\u2019re serving pizza, but it\u2019s pizza made fresh with very wholesome ingredients and we\u2019re serving it at a price that\u2019s very competitive, if not cheaper than most fast food,\u201d Cizma said.\n\nBoth Tsai and Cizma say that while the food is delicious, Stellar places a huge emphasis on making sure the ingredients are fresh and nutritious. Since the ingredients are made and cooked in-house, this is easier for them to achieve compared to other fast-food restaurants.\n\nIt was these fresh and tasty ingredients that won over USC Student and Stellar Pizza marketing team member Lexi Brandt as a customer. She says the robotics aspect of the business model concerned her at first, but after tasting the pizza and getting to know the company, she believes automation is the future of food service.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always joked about robots taking over our jobs and now that\u2019s actually happening, which is a little bit scary, but it\u2019s also really cool. I think it\u2019s more efficient for the companies working on it,\u201d Brandt said.\n\nRight now, the majority of the pizzas are served from tents at various USC parties or in trucks along the Greek Row or near the USC Village. In fact, Stellar has become well-known to students for serving free pizza at tailgates throughout the semester. It was through these pizza giveaways that Brandt first became acquainted with the company.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking down the road and it\u2019s after a party. I\u2019m so hungry and everything\u2019s closed and I\u2019m about to [order delivery]. Then I see the Stellar Pizza truck and I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, big red truck that\u2019s not a fire truck, that\u2019s interesting,\u2019\u201d Brandt said. \u201cSo I walk over and I see they\u2019re handing out free pizza. But then I get up closer and see what Stellar Pizza is all about ... and basically it\u2019s robots making the pizza.\u201d\n\nThe free pizza giveaways were a large part of the marketing team\u2019s strategy in the beginning of their launch at USC. However, if you want a pizza from Stellar now, you\u2019ll have to pay. Tsai says he came up with this promotional strategy because college students love both late-night food and saving money.\n\n\u201cIn doing my research on the pizza industry, I found that your average American eats pizza once a week at least,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cI think for a college student, it\u2019s about two to three times that. They\u2019re also fairly cost conscious consumers, and we have a product that\u2019s very, very aggressively priced in the modern day environment ... On top of that, we can operate later in the evening compared to some of our competitors because we require much less labor.\u201d\n\nBrandt, who was a Stellar regular before joining the marketing team, seconds this and adds that Stellar is perfect for \u201ccollege students who want their food fast and on a budget.\u201d\n\nPizzas can be ordered on Stellar\u2019s mobile app or in-person at their trucks. Currently, they\u2019re only doing pick-up, but Stellar\u2019s team of engineers are working on self-driving delivery trucks that could bring students freshly-cooked pizza directly to their doorstep.\n\nWhile Stellar Pizza is mainly focused on the USC area for now, they are hoping to expand to other L.A. universities, like UCLA and LMU, in the near future. Eventually, the company hopes to bring their pizzas nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe want to have these trucks roaming the United States, hundreds of these trucks roaming neighborhoods and delivering pizza to people,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cLong term, we want to start looking at other opportunities, maybe in the fried foods categories or even sandwiches.\u201d\n\nOverall, Tsai is grateful to be able to combine his passion for food along with his engineering skills.\n\n\u201cI hope you give us a try. The pizzas are actually good, the robotics are cool, but it\u2019s all in service of the product. We want our pizzas to be consistently good and consistently affordable,\u201d Tsai added.\n```"}

See what each pair said is the crux of their campaign.\n\nBy Megan Duncan and Kaitlin Becenti\nFebruary 22, 2023 at 1:23 am PST\n\nOne of the main policies for candidate Aidan Feighery for president, and running mate, Ashley Ka for vice president is improving USC\u2019s approach to sexual assault prevention and teaching affirmative consent. Amid student protests of greek life and sexual assault in 2021, Feighery and Ka said they were inspired by their fellow students holding its administration accountable and they hope to be a voice for the silenced on campus. They plan to do this by working with USC to create an in-person freshman orientation module/health class that targets this subject and also promotes training for related issues for all organizations holding large parties near campus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a significant amount of my term as Senator working on this issue (sexual assault prevention)\u201d said Feighery. \u201cI ended up passing a resolution calling for more information on disaffiliation from the university. That got me into the room with several USC administrators from Student Affairs who would talk to me about what is and isn\u2019t possible and how we can actually go about solving this problem.\u201d Disaffiliation refers to USC fraternities cutting ties with the university.\n\nFeighery and Ka also proposed a new Fryft policy which would include offering a cap on single rides along with unlimited shared rides. They said this solution would balance USC costs concerns and student discontent with the shared rides program. \u201cOur solution is informed by statistics from the office of USC Transportation stating that students spent an average of $450/month on single rides, resulting in the program exceeding its budget by several times,\u201d says the candidate\u2019s plan. Given the outpouring of student concerns and anecdotes, we believe that our solution balances university cost concerns and student safety/accessibility needs in a way that will be palatable to the university.\u201d\n\nFeighery and Ka have outlined all proposed policies and inclusion acts through their \u201cFeasibility Explained\u201d plan which also details how and why they plan to continue in their specific efforts. The candidates believe that this document is what sets them apart from other races. \u201c(It) explains exactly the work that we\u2019ve already done, outlines the problem, outlines the solution, and talks about why it\u2019s possible to accomplish. Ashley and I are incredibly dedicated to not giving out a wish list that says we want free everything,\u201d said Feighery.\n\nOther policies included in Feighery and Ka\u2019s campaign include \u2018Yellow Jacket Accountability\u2019 after several USC students have reported harassment from the ambassadors according to the candidates. \u201cUSG could accomplish this project on its own by creating a public form asking where the incident occurred and at what time, but we would rather work with the people running the program. We believe gaining their buy-in will result in quicker internal accountability and a safer campus,\u201d according to the Feasibility Explained plan.\n\nAside from individual and community safety policies, Feighery and Ka also plan to keep student advocacy at the front of their campaign by proposing policies like I-20 which would assist create scholarship funding for international students in need and \u2018Red Brick Bubble\u2019 which provides USG funding to support members of the community in outreach projects.\n\nOutside of policies Feighery and Ka also said they plan to address USG\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d office culture, as he calls it, in order to promote student involvement and inclusion within the organization. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to do the greatest good that we can because we don\u2019t get all of the incredible, wonderful people who genuinely want to make good things happen on this campus...USG has an incredible power to do good on this campus, but only when we look internally towards our own problems and start to fix them at the root,\u201d said Feighery.\n\nPresidential candidate Aidan Feighery is a fourth year political science major with a minor in East Asian languages and cultures and currently serves as senator of the Accessibility Committee and previously served as a General Member. While a member of the student government he has authored multiple resolutions and drawn attention to groups in need like those of Armenian students according to his candidate ticket.\n\nAshley Ka, the vice presidential candidate, is a philosophy, politics, and economics major with a minor in computer programming. Ka is also the Director of Membership for the Trojan Debate Squad and has also interned for Senator Maria Cantwell\u2019s office.\n```"}

Their route to achieving these goals starts with transparency.\n\n\u201cWe are just trying to ensure that different budgets are being transparent,\u201d said Ayala. \u201cTransparency lies in how where our funds are being spent, what kind of funds are available, how we can apply for these funds and what are the reasons behind some of them being cut?\u201d\n\nOne of their specific points involved DPS. While this includes making their budget available to the public, Ayala is also concerned with protecting USC students and ensuring the hiring process is transparent and safe for students. Last year, Ayala, who was on the External Affairs Committee, was \u201cactually able to be part of the DPS hiring process for the new chief.\u201d\n\nBut transparency can only go so far. The newly updated shared Lyft program has recently been a hot topic among USC students. For the Ayala-Singh ticket, they want to focus on hearing student voices. Recently, USG released an anecdotal form for students to express their stories and opinions on the matter and Ayala wants to \u201chone\u201d in on this. However, because USG doesn\u2019t control funding for the program, it will be difficult for them to do anything other than advocate for the program to the administration.\n\nAnother action they wish to take is to replace a current USC restaurant with a local/BIPOC restaurant but Ayala was unable to say where the funding for this would come from. Ayala recognizes that the Village contract makes it difficult for local businesses to get a spot in the village due to the high rent prices. However, he believes that \u201cas long as we have a lot of momentum and a lot of student demand, the administration will most likely speak and address certain issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think really emphasizing that we have the experience, that we\u2019re not out of touch with what students want, but we also know that we don\u2019t know everything that students want. That\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to do really tangible things.\u201d```"}

See what each pair said is the crux of their campaign.\n\nPresidential candidate Divya Jakatdar and vice presidential candidate Michelle Lu have built their platform on promises of greater inclusivity and diversity for the student body. Despite that, the candidates have proposed tacking on an additional fee of $200 per semester per student as one possible solution to the shared rides controversy on campus\n\nFor context, a hot topic of interest amongst students is the issue of reverting back to the free Lyft model, or \u201cFryft,\u201d compared to the current model of shared lyfts. During the pandemic, LA County banned the original shared ride model, forcing the USC to adopt a single rider program, which students say it\u2019s safer, faster and more convenient.\n\nThe candidates proposed three potential ideas, one of them being tacking on an additional $200 per semester to students\u2019 tuition, which they claim would fund the costs of Fryfts and free shuttle rides to LAX. \u201cOf course, the concern there is (is) who wants to pay $200 more a semester in fees, [but] at the same time, financial aid packages increase as a percentage,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cSo since it\u2019s a fee, it wouldn\u2019t be that necessarily you would be taking on the whole burden of the $200 per semester.\u201d\n\nStudents who pay full tuition and who are ineligible for financial aid would still pay the full $200 fee. This proposal also depends on financial aid packages increasing for students who are on financial aid.\n\nWhile Jakatdar argued that students will likely not feel the impact of an additional $200 on top of USC\u2019s tuition costs, the university has been called out in the past for its financial aid. Just last year residential assistants went on strike for having their financial aid reduced due to free housing.\n\nJakatdar, a third-year political science student, and Lu, a second-year business administration student are both women of color, with Jakatdar also identifying as a part of the LGBTQ+ community and Lu being a first-generation student. They used these aspects of their identities to promote their campaign values, honing in on advocating for marginalized communities as significant parts of their political campaign.\n\nThe team also plans on integrating the USC ID card onto mobile devices for easier access, an initiative that Lu has been working on for the past two years, where the senator met with administrative officials. According to Lu, the budget is already lined up.\n\nThe two are also working on a venture designed to create a directory that would allow students to compare housing in the area in order to ensure that they are signing onto the ones that fit their needs the most. The two want to enforce this plan with their existing partnership line with USC Housing.\n\nJakatdar is a member of a sorority, and when asked about diversity and equity in Greek life, Jakatdar acknowledged the lack of diversity, stating the panhellenic organizations have \u201ca variety of issues\u201d but failed to provide a cohesive answer when asked what she would do as a USG member to improve the system. Instead, the presidential candidate only focused on the efforts taken by her sorority to improve diversity, equity and inclusivity (DEI), rather than naming the steps she would take as a USG official.\n\nWhen asked about a potential conflict of interest if Jakatdar was to become President as a member of a sorority, she remained staunch in her position to hold individuals accountable for their actions. \u201cI just want to be very clear that my morals are completely always going to be on the side of justice and DEI,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen it came to the issue of transparency, Lu also shared that their campaign aimed to increase transparency for funding issues. \u201cOne of our goals, our platform goals, is to make non-confidential communications with the administration and with the USC publicly available to the general public or student population,\u201d Lu said. \u201cObviously, there are some things we can\u2019t show, but we want to revamp the entire USC website [for] transparency on our projects.\u201d\n\nHand in hand with greater transparency, Jakatdar responded to opinions that USG lacks impactful change by disagreeing with the claims, citing the original Fryft program as an idea that was accomplished through USG. \u201cI get it, though, I don\u2019t think we advertise honestly what we\u2019ve done enough,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the general idea is that we just want to make life easier for our students and doable because some of these projects that appeal to everyone will make it more convenient for some students, but some of these are really going to change the quality of life for a lot of our students, and we\u2019re guided by that goal.\u201d```"}

See what each pair said is the crux of their campaign.\n\nCandidates Miko Mariscal and Andrew Taw\u2019s campaign is all about keeping USG transparent and increasing accessibility for students from underprivileged backgrounds to get involved with services around campus. The pair includes short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals in their campaigning, such as the creation of a Project Tracker, Club and Career Resource guides and a more inclusive Trojan Family Weekend.\n\nWhile Taw recognizes that the team\u2019s campaign points seem less ambitious compared to other candidates, he says the reason for that is that they are confident that all their promises can be done within one year. He believes the pair stands out because they are very transparent and realistic, but still remain focused on serving the USC community.\n\nMariscal believes that their goals are definitely tangible within a year span and encourages students to reach out to them if there is anything else they would like to see in the future.\n\nOne of the ways the pair plans to achieve their goals is through the Project Tracker, an accountability tool that allows the student body to check on what is getting done within the student government. Students would be able to access the progress of newly created programs and projects, review descriptions of the various branches and departments of USG, and even access meeting minutes.\n\nBeing a first generation student herself, Mariscal noted how hard it can be for some to understand what exactly goes on within the student government and get involved if they wish. \u201cI was really interested in getting into university student government because I did it all throughout high school and middle school, but I was extremely confused and felt a little left out in the current conversations of how to make a change on my campus. [The tracker] would serve as a way to communicate to all students,\u201d said Mariscal.\n\nThe pair\u2019s campaign is extremely focused on accessibility, with some of their other goals including creating a Club Resource Guide, where students will have a centralized location for information on all clubs, and a Centralized Career and Professional Development Guide, so that students can easily navigate the opportunities that USC provides.\n\n\u201cThe Club Resource Guide would help a lot of different students. So like commuter students who might not know what time to leave campus, transfer students who are looking into USC and want to see what clubs there are, as well as prospective families and students who oftentimes just feel a little scared to join different communities,\u201d says Taw.\n\nThey note that while there are many resources available to get funding, there is a lack of knowledge within the student body. That\u2019s why the pair plans on creating Funding 101 sessions so that these on-campus organizations can fully understand how to utilize the funding available for them through USG.\n\nAnother major promise Mariscal and Taw campaign for is increasing the accessibility of attending Trojan Family Weekend. The pair plans on creating a more inclusive environment for low-income families to participate in the celebrations with little to no costs.\n\nMarsical says their slogan represents their campaign plans very well. \u201cOur slogan is \u2018We\u2019re All In This Together.\u2019 We essentially chose that, not only because of High School Musical but also because of the point that there (are) so many things on campus that would work better as a community.\u201d\n\nTaw agrees. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re all in this together\u2019 is a very simplistic way to be like, yes, we\u2019re all in this together. We are here to support you. And we want to bring the Trojan family together more,\u201d says Taw.\n\nTaw, already serving as the Director of Media at USG, says that the pair wants to emphasize that they plan to utilize existing clubs and organizations if elected. Both candidates are part of the Student Ambassador Program for the USC Admission Center and believe that their shared background in the program has allowed them to already work as a team in a professional setting.\n\nTaw also serves as the VP of External Affairs for Society 53, which he believes has taught him how to properly create a community by networking within the Student Alumni Association.\n\nMiko Mariscal works as a First-Generation Student Leader in the Admission Center and a Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Peer Educator through the Student Equity and Inclusion Programs (SEIP). She\u2019s also a first generation college student from South Central Los Angeles, which she believes gives her a different perspective on what it\u2019s like for some students to step onto USC\u2019s campus and understand the way USC can affect the South Central area.\n```"}

It\u2019s about time we start acting like it.\u201d\n\nBoth Gillath and Rodriguez are well-seasoned in their roles at USG and have advocated for personal initiatives that are important to them. Gillath has proposed initiatives like facilitating a project to distribute boxes of sunscreens to the homeless population on Skid Row and permanently implementing the dining dollars program where individuals can directly donate their unused dining dollars at the end of the semester.\n\nRodriguez, who currently serves as chair of the External Affairs Committee, has orchestrated projects like the South L.A. restaurant crawl, an initiative that encourages students to venture outside of USC\u2019s campus and try local minority-owned restaurants in the community. She\u2019s also worked alongside DPS and Transportation officials to increase transparency and education for students, according to Rodriguez.\n\nOne major platform point for the candidates is prioritizing mental health services. They\u2019ve proposed the idea of Mental Health Monday, a day dedicated to education and activities promoting student well being, and they hope to expand access to long-term mental health resources as well.\n\nRodriguez said she hopes these programs remind students to take a step back and take care of themselves. When asked about overcoming challenges when working with university officials and USG, Gillath and Rodriguez said they\u2019re prepared to handle any obstacles that come their way.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always pushback when you\u2019re working with USG, whether that\u2019s from administration, or from fellow members,\u201d Gillath said. \u201cI think for us it\u2019s just been about persistence and keeping at it.\u201d\n\nGillath is the founder of Trojans Give Back, a program that uses leftover meal swipes to donate food to unhoused individuals on Skid Row. When USC\u2019s meal plan changed, he pivoted to a pilot program in partnership with USC Basic Needs which has since supported 32 food-insecure students and donated over $41,000 of food.\n\nAs for their plans moving forward, Gillath and Rodriguez hope their work both in USG and in their own communities speaks for themselves. \u201cThere are a lot of candidates; there are a lot of promises,\u201d Gillath said. \u201cWe\u2019re not running on promises, right? We\u2019re running on track records. We have a track record of getting things done and meaningfully helping people. We just want to keep doing that and appreciate the support to do so.\u201d\n```"}

Since its publication in 2019, Hannah-Jones has published a book expanding on the project\u2019s essays and released a six-episode docuseries on Hulu.\n\nHannah-Jones began the speech by sharing her experience of being bussed to school in Waterloo, Iowa, as part of a desegregation program. While she didn\u2019t understand the reasoning at the time, she points to that experience as a pivotal moment in her life.\n\n\u201cI really think I started to realize and understand the literal landscape of inequality through that school window, in that two-hour bus ride where I would notice that everything got nicer,\u201d Hannah-Jones said.\n\nAs one of few Black students at the school, she said she began to question the narrative being told about her community and her people.\n\n\u201cI think it can be so hard to understand what it\u2019s like, how demeaning and degrading it is to never see yourself in the story,\u201d Hannah-Jones said. \u201cYou really believe that teachers are teaching what\u2019s important to know, and so if we\u2019re not in there, we must not have done much to be included.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she took a Black studies elective course that her worldview completely changed.\n\n\u201cMy mind was just blown, and I became really angry that all of this knowledge existed and no one thought it was important for us to learn,\u201d Hannah-Jones said.\n\nThe conversation, moderated by Annenberg professor and Bass Lab founder Allissa V. Richardson, highlighted the stories and motivations behind the ongoing project as it seeks to continue illuminating the legacy of slavery in the United States and placing the contributions of Black Americans at the center of our national rhetoric.\n\nHannah-Jones spoke on the impact of the project by discussing how newsrooms view controversial ideas to societies\u2019 developed norms.\n\n\u201cNewsrooms \u2014 they say that want diversity,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat they really want is phenotype diversity. They want to be able to tick you off a list, but then they don\u2019t actually want the intellect and the perspective that comes with it.\u201d\n\nHannah-Jones wanted to create a piece that allowed for the public to challenge our country\u2019s history with her as she began to do on her two hour bus ride to school. By drawing upon the courage of her ancestors, Hannah-Jones wanted to stand up against those trying to make her insecure and afraid to challenge the narrative that history has created about Black history.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get into journalism to make other people comfortable,\u201d Hannah-Jones said.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt addressed the university\u2019s stance on the current issue of legislation being passed to limit diversity offices which are used to study the past.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that USC will not follow in those steps,\u201d Folt said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to find ways to honor the Black experience and uplift Black voices.\u201d\n\nAlfonso Hedge, a graduate student studying digital social media, felt impassioned by Folt\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cEspecially in this day and age, that\u2019s something people need to know,\u201d Hedge said.\n\nHannah-Jones won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 2020, was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2017, and was tonight\u2019s inaugural co-recipient of the Charlotta Bass Media Trailblazer Award. Darnella Frazier was also recognized as co-recipient of the award for her activism and courage in the recording of George Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nHannah-Jones left the audience with a closing remark about the legacy of Black Americans and her hope for the country moving forward.\n\n\u201cWhen those white men wrote those words of liberty that did not include our people, our people read that and said yes they do,\u201d Hannah-Jones said. \u201cWe have been the ones who have expanded the idea of freedom for every marginalized person in America. This country would not exist as it does without us. One day if we can recognize all of our humanity we can be the country of our greatest ideals, but we have to tell the truth first.\u201d\n```"}

The candidates were questioned on topics ranging from students\u2019 mental health to budget transparency by moderators Nataly Joseph and Charlotte Phillip.  Intermingled with slight jabs at one another\u2019s platforms and a hard-hitting question from the current USG president, each ticket conveyed its top priorities and goals if elected.

Here\u2019s Anthony Slade with the story.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department\u2019s Urban Search and Rescue Team made their return to California last night after a two-week deployment to Turkey. The team was sent in response to the earthquake that ravaged the country and neighboring Syria earlier this month.\n\nChris Allender, the battalion chief of the department, says that they received a warm welcome upon arriving to the site of the quake.\n\n\"But it became very apparent on on our first first day out there that everybody was happy to see us. And they were they knew we were there to help. And they treated us with open arms.\"\n\nThe 7.8 magnitude quake, which devastated the region on February 6, has killed more than 48,000 across the two affected countries.

And hunting they did. The Trojans were quick to shut Ohio State down, beginning the game with a 7-0 run. The attack led the crew to triumph over the Buckeyes 18-10 at McAlister Field Sunday afternoon.\n\nSenior attacker Ella Heaney led the offensive unit. The New York native guided the team with four goals and three assists. \u201cShe\u2019s our most veteran attacker ... She is so dynamic.

Ramsay, the team captain, also tallied 2 goals on the attacking end. Lord also bagged a goal with a give-and-go snipe early in the fourth quarter.

(Photo by Bryson Nihipali)\n\nBy Logan Drone\nFebruary 21, 2023 at 10:12 am PST\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 offense came out scorching hot against Marist, scoring 37 runs on 32 hits over the opening weekend series sweep of the Red Foxes. USC welcomed Marist to Dedeaux Field on Friday to embark on its 2023 season, marking the first matchup between the two programs in history. Friday\u2019s opening night also marked the first game for each manager with their new teams, as Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz made his debut for USC and Lance Ratchford made his coaching debut for Marist.\n\nUSC started off opening day with an 8-6 victory under the lights on Friday night. The Trojans opened the scoring in the second inning after a bunt single by freshman center fielder Austin Overn \u2014 who is also a walk-on wide receiver on the football team \u2014 yielded two runs. After scoring three more runs in the inning, the Trojans took a 5-0 lead.\n\nFollowing a few scoreless innings, Marist\u2019s offense came alive, scoring 6 unanswered runs in the top of the sixth. The Trojans had an opportunity to minimize the damage, but a 2-out error by junior left fielder Carson Wells allowed 3 more runs to score, putting the Trojans behind 6-5. Fortunately for USC, senior right fielder Cole Gabrielson made a superb, full-extension, diving catch to end the inning and stop the bleeding.\n\nThe Trojans wasted no time answering back in the bottom frame. Sophomore designated hitter Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek, a transfer from UCLA, took matters into his own hands, ripping a 2-strike, 2-out home run to left. This marked the first hit of Martin-Grudzielanek\u2019s USC and collegiate career. The scoring didn\u2019t stop there, as senior first baseman Nick Lopez went back-to-back with Martin-Grudzielanek, raising USC\u2019s lead to 8-6 entering the final three innings.\n\nThat was all the run support the Trojans needed, as their pitching staff handled business in the final innings, retiring nine of the last 10 batters to conclude the game. This opening night victory marked the first win of Stankiewicz\u2019s USC career and the fifth straight opening-day victory for the Trojans.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting, it wasn\u2019t pretty, but the boys stuck to the game plan,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe jumped out early, they punched back in a big way and then we were able to just settle in and regroup.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans looked to replicate this success on Saturday night as they took the field wearing their gold alternative uniforms. Marist came out firing, jumping out to an early 3-1 lead after 2 errors by the Trojans yielded 2 unearned runs for the Red Foxes. Similarly to opening night, the Trojans came marching back almost immediately, putting up 5 runs in the bottom of the fourth.\n\nMartin-Grudzielanek started the rally with a 1-out walk, followed by Lopez who drove a double off the wall in right. The Trojans proceeded to score five runs in the inning on 3 walks and 2 errors, capitalizing on Marist\u2019s mistakes to make the score 6-3. Lopez continued his early season success, hitting a 2-run bomb into the parking structure over the right field scoreboard in the bottom of the fifth inning to lengthen the lead.\n\nFollowing hits from junior infielder Ryan Jackson and Overn, redshirt freshman Caiden Huber delivered with an RBI single for his first collegiate hit. After batting through the order for the second inning in a row, the Trojans held a dominating 10-3 lead entering the sixth.\n\nAfter exchanging runs in the next two innings, the Trojans\u2019 offense exploded again in the eighth. Lopez continued his tear, driving in a pair on his third extra-base hit of the day. After a walk by Jackson \u2014 who reached base for the fifth time of the day \u2014 loaded the bases, Overn showcased his speed with a bases-clearing triple, bringing the Trojan lead to 17-4.\n\nThe Trojans entered Sunday\u2019s finale eager for their first opening-series sweep since 2017. Redshirt freshman right-handed pitcher Eric Hammond was lined up for USC on the bump, marking his Trojan debut and first game following Tommy John surgery. Marist jumped out to an early lead, but just as USC did the previous two games when Marist seemed to gain momentum, the Trojans quickly responded.\n\nAfter a fielder\u2019s choice and passed ball scored two runs for USC, Gabrielson came up to the dish with 2 outs and runners in scoring position. Gabrielson, maximizing the opportunity, blasted a 3-run shot to dead center, bringing the Trojans ahead 5-1 and giving them their fourth inning of 5 runs or more in their first three games.\n\nThe offensive outburst didn\u2019t stop there. The next batter, Overn, legged a triple into the left-center gap, scoring on an error by the shortstop. Freshman designated hitter Ethan Hedges followed up with an extra-base hit, ripping a double to deep left. Senior third baseman Johnny Olmstead capped the rally with a 2-run home run to left, running the score to 8-1.\n\nThat was all the offense the Trojans needed, as senior right-handed pitcher Blake Sodersten took control of the Marist lineup, limiting it to just 1 run on 9 strikeouts over five innings after coming in to relieve Hammond. The Trojans held a commanding 8-2 lead entering the seventh.\n\nWanting to join the offensive party, Lopez roped a solo home run to right, his third shot of the season and sixth extra-base hit. Just two batters later, Gabrielson came up to the dish and jacked his second homer of the game. After scoring 2 more in the bottom of the eighth on an error, sophomore right-handed pitcher Josh Blum closed the door for USC by striking out the side, securing the opening-series sweep 12-2.\n\nSunday\u2019s afternoon victory marked the first game of clean baseball for the Trojans, as they had no errors after amassing 6 in the previous two games. Stankiewicz highlighted the importance of defense postgame: \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta commit to being able to play really, really good defense, catch fly balls, field ground balls,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been talking about a lot, and so it\u2019s great when you see a nice defensive performance by the guys.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans start off their season with a 3-0 record for the first time since 2017 when USC finished 21-34. Maintaining this early-season success is pivotal over the long 56-game season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to carry this success through ... it was a good weekend, but it\u2019s over. Now we\u2019ve got a tough Irvine squad coming in Tuesday and then Auburn after them,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some looks cut out for us, but that\u2019s good. We want it to get more and more difficult as we move forward, so we\u2019ve got to get ready to step up to the challenge.\u201d```"}

Before I start my normal spiel of my top college basketball headlines, I would like to formally apologize to the Creighton Blue Jays and their fans for bestowing my curse upon them. For the third week in a row, the team I have picked to win their conference with my utmost confidence, has lost within a week of me saying that I trust them. To quote Taylor Swift, \u201cIt\u2019s me, hi, I\u2019m the problem, it\u2019s me.\u201d So from now on, I promise not to declare any team as my \u201cfavorite\u201d to win their conference. Now let\u2019s jump into this week\u2019s top headlines.\n\nKansas vs. Baylor: A tale of two halves\n\nNo. 9 Baylor vs. No. 5 Kansas was a matchup college basketball fans were looking forward to all week. With the stage set at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas, the audience anticipated for the Jayhawks and Bears to trade blows back and forth all game, but that was not the case. Baylor had three players in the first half combined for 42 of their 45 points: redshirt senior guard Adam Flagler, junior guard LJ Cryer and freshman guard Keyonte George. They rained threes on the Jayhawks as they combined for eight of the Bears\u2019 nine first half threes. Baylor led Kansas by 13 at halftime and it really seemed like it would be an impossible comeback for the Jayhawks, as they had shot 1-for 11-from three in the first half.\n\nKansas, however, did not need the threes to comeback. The Jayhawks completely dominated Baylor from the jump in the second half and could not be stopped offensively. Kansas started the half off on an 11-0 run in the first three minutes alone, and the rest of the game was not much different. Kansas pulled off a 29-point swing from the first half as they ended up winning the game 87-71. At one point in the second half the Jayhawks had outscored Baylor 43-18. They say basketball is a game of runs, and this game more than proved that. In the first half, watching the game was nonstop Baylor scoring, and vice versa in the second half with Kansas going on runs of their own. Kansas just happened to make the bigger and better run.\n\nBoth teams are phenomenal, despite the second half crumble by Baylor both offensively and defensively. Kansas did the exact same thing to North Carolina last year in the national championship \u2013 you just can\u2019t count out Kansas as long as Bill Self is at the helm. I said I would not choose a team  to win their conference, especially in the Big 12 which is by far the best conference in college basketball, but just know the Jayhawks have not missed a beat since last year.\n\nThe Duke Dilemma\n\nUsually at this time of the season we\u2019d be talking about if Duke will win the national championship, not if they would be a first round exit in March Madness or not. Even still, I think I am more impressed with the Blue Devils than the average fan is. Let me make one thing clear, I do not think Duke will win the national championship, nor are they even a Final Four contender. However, I think many people are starting to underestimate them. The Blue Devils are an incredibly underrated defensive team, and I am a big fan of teams who play good defense.\n\nThe statline that jumps out at me the most is the fact that in 24 of their 27 games, the Blue Devils have held their opponent under their average scoring margin. Most recently against Syracuse, Duke held the Orange to only 55 points, which is 20 less points than their average. I think you could argue Duke is in a rebuilding year, as they are for the first time in 44 years not being led by coach Mike Krzyzewski. They still have some of the most talent in college basketball as they had the No. 1 recruiting class in the country and four five-star recruits. But still they really have not had that bad a year.\n\nThe Blue Devils have wins over No. 14 Xavier, No. 16 Miami and Iowa most notably, a controversial loss to No. 7 Virginia. They have a few bad losses including falling to a pretty bad Virginia Tech team, but five of their eight losses are to ranked teams, three of which are to top-10 teams. So is Duke being underrated? I think yes. We as college basketball fans know Duke to be a dominant program who loses a max of four to five regular season games a year, so when we see the Blue Devils lose eight or nine games, we start to doubt if they are legit. The talent is there, they have the potential to be a Cinderella team and they 100% could win the ACC tournament.\n\nNext week, I\u2019m looking forward to Saturday when No. 8 Texas plays No. 9 Baylor and No. 12 Gonzaga plays No. 15 Saint Mary\u2019s, where the winner takes the WCC regular season title. \u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nFebruary 19, 2023 at 11:42 pm PST\n\nUSC had a second chance. As zeroes came across the buzzer, graduate guard Rokia Doumbia was called for illegal contact against Cal\u2019s sophomore guard Jayda Curry. It seemed Curry, who had made all 5 of her free throw attempts up to that point in the game, would be going to the line one last time to break the tie and win the game for the Golden Bears. After a lengthy review, though, the refs decided Doumbia\u2019s foul occurred after the buzzer sounded, sending the game to overtime. But USC could not capitalize on its second life in overtime, losing 81-78 to the Golden Bears.\n\n\u201cCal deserved to win today \u2014 they were really good,\u201d Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cI never felt like we were in control, but credit to our players on a game where we didn\u2019t have all of our best stuff, we were able to battle.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans came out flat defensively, giving up 24 points in the first quarter \u2014 the most points USC has allowed in a first quarter this season. But, despite USC allowing Cal to shoot 60% from the field, the game was tied after the first frame. USC tightened up its defense in the second quarter, only allowing 12 points. Cal\u2019s defense tightened just as much, as it also only allowed 12 points in the quarter and the game was tied 36-36 at halftime.\n\n\u201cWe made minor adjustments here and there on coverages, but really it was about our willingness and ability to lock in and put bodies in front of bodies,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nThe third quarter was reminiscent of the first quarter for USC, with the Trojans giving up 25 points to Cal. However, their offense, led by graduate forward Kadi Sissoko\u2019s 10 points in the quarter, picked it up again to keep the game tied at 61 going into the final frame of regulation.\n\n\u201cI think we can do a better job coming out of halftime and just staying locked in right away,\u201d Sissoko said. \u201cA couple of times we have down times, but we need to pick it up.\u201d\n\nTo complete the perfectly symmetrical game, both teams scored 12 points in the fourth quarter to send it to overtime. All hope seemed lost with 1:22 left in regulation after a defensive rebound by Cal with the game tied at 71. But junior guard Kayla Williams made a great anticipation play to pick off a pass attempt and draw a foul. She made 2 free throws to secure a 2-point lead for USC, which the Trojans quickly squandered on the next Cal possession.\n\n\u201cWe put on our press which forced us into aggression and traps and I felt like it got us back in the game and created some turnovers,\u201d Gottlieb said. But, it was that aggression which cost USC the game, as Cal scored their last 3 points from the free-throw line.\n\nThere were 23 personal fouls called on USC throughout the game, compared to only 10 called on USC in the game against Stanford on Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe game was very physical at Stanford with few whistles, and it was a lot of whistles today,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt took us a while to adjust to that. It was just called a little differently.\u201d\n\nUSC had five players with 3 or more fouls, including graduate forward Okako Adika, who fouled out with 5:09 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nOne of the bright spots for USC was Sissoko, who scored a season-high 30 points for the Trojans. She also scored the 1,000th point of her career in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cDefensively, they gave me the space to play my game, and my teammates were reading the play perfectly and just trying to find me on offense,\u201d Sissoko said.\n\nThis game also saw the return of sophomore forward Rayah Marshall after missing the game against Stanford, a 50-47 loss on Friday night. She played 40 out of a possible 45 minutes, scoring 14 points and securing 9 rebounds.\n\n\u201cIt feels great to play with Rayah,\u201d Sissoko said. \u201cWe missed her a lot against Stanford, so it\u2019s always a good thing to have all of our players back.\u201d\n\nUSC will have two opportunities to get on the right track before the Pac-12 tournament after back-to-back losses. The Trojans play at home against Washington on Thursday, followed up with their last regular season game against Washington State on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt has to make us better, it will make us better,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI believe in the team we have in the locker room and the ability we have to respond.\u201d\n```"}

USC defeated Stanford 85-75. Captains fifth-year guard Drew Peterson and senior guard Boogie Ellis scored 54 points combined.\n\nStanford came out strong with five points early, and USC was behind until Ellis\u2019s first 3-pointer of the game \u2014 a jump shot assisted by sophomore guard Kobe Johnson to tie it at 15-15 with 10:47 left in the first half. From then on, the Trojans took control and never trailed Stanford for the remainder of the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely finding our stride. Everybody is shooting the ball well, [and] we have a lot of great shooters on our team,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI feel like we struggled earlier, but Coach [Andy Enfield] knows that we\u2019re a great shooting team, so we just got to keep going, taking it day by day and having a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nEllis had 15 points after the first half, and Peterson wasn\u2019t far behind with 11 points after just coming off achieving a new career high in scoring 30 against Cal. Stanford let off several offensive rebounds in the first half, which allowed the Trojans to score eight points in second-chance opportunities. USC led by 11 points after the first half with a score of 41-30.\n\nAfter being sidelined for the last four games because of a foot injury, sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters returned to action and had a stand-out game as the third-highest scorer for the Trojans, putting up 12 points. Dixon-Waters also had a strong defensive performance, posting two steals and a block.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being more aggressive on defense and taking advantage of opportunities guarding people,\u201d Dixon-Waters said. \u201cIn practice, I got to guard Boogie, Kobe and Drew and all the rest of the guards on the team, so playing against everybody else, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but I love the challenge.\u201d\n\nRedshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan also sat out for the last four games due to an injury and in his return against the Cardinal he scored four points.\n\nEllis made nine out of 16 shots from the floor, six out of 10 from 3-point range and made each of his nine free throw shots. He reached a new career high with 33 points, a career high in assists with seven and tied his best mark with six 3-pointers.\n\nWhen asked how it felt to reach his new career high in points, Ellis took more pride in one of his other personal bests from the game.\n\n\u201cIt felt good, but I\u2019m more proud of myself with the seven assists [because] I\u2019ve been working on that a lot, watching a lot of film and just trying to become better with my passing,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nEllis wasn\u2019t the only part of the offense that found success. The rest of the team shot a combined 29-for-59 from the field and 13-for-25 from deep.\n\n\u201cWhen you play four guards, they have to do a good job at dribble penetration and draw the defense in and then kick it out at the right time,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I think we got 25 threes up, and we were fortunate to make 13.\u201d\n\nHowever, Stanford outscored the Trojans in the paint 38-22.\n\n\u201cWe have to do a little better job protecting the rim,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of unusual because we\u2019ve been so good with 2-point defense the last four years.\u201d\n\nUSC has four regular season games remaining and is currently sitting in third place in the Pac-12 with a record of 19-8 overall and 11-5 in conference play. The Trojans will travel to play Colorado on Thursday at 6 p.m.\n```"}

This pop-funk crossover act\u2019s performance followed their fifth studio album \u201cLet Yourself Free,\u201d and a TikTok reemergence with songs like \u201cThe Walker\u201d and \u201cHandClap\u201d each having viral moments.\n\nThis Los Angeles-born act started the night with \u201cSway,\u201d their first song in nearly three years. Any crowd member who wasn\u2019t familiar with the Fitz and the Tantrums \u2014 such as the multitude of suburban dads \u2014 would quickly learn of the band\u2019s \u201cAdultz-Bop\u201d appeal.\n\nThere\u2019s something about Noelle Scaggs, the incredible co-vocalist, that is undeniably enticing \u2014 there wasn\u2019t a single soul in the venue who could deny that. With a tambourine in hand, Scaggs thrashed and flung her body into each musical landscape with reckless abandon. It was a feat to behold, and with a matriarchal charisma not too unlike Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine, Scaggs may have been the best thing to happen to The Belasco in a long, long time.\n\nHer rhinestoned microphone stand was but another detail too dazzling to be ignored.\n\nJames King plays the piano during a performance of \u201cComplicated.\u201d King, who also plays the saxophone for the band, co-founded Fitz and The Tantrums with his college friend, Michael Fitzpatrick, in 2008.

This song is the one song that kicked it off for this band \u2014 our very first number one was this song.\u201d\n\nAnd with that introduction, the first chords of \u201cOut of My League\u201d were met with deafening screams from the crowd. If not anything else, Fitz and the Tantrums were good at one thing: playing their hit songs as if it were the first time everyone was hearing them.\n\nThis hit single led to the crowd holding up hand hearts in a gesture of gratitude for a tribute to an age when the band had a greater tendency for funk.\n\nThe MVP of the night was multi-instrumentalist James King, who decorated the night with his stellar saxophone breaks. It\u2019s hard to imagine the show without King, with his ability to bolster even the most basic of the band\u2019s catalog into a groovy, danceable track.\n\nDespite the band\u2019s infinitely-energetic performance, there was a definite sense of intimacy between the performers and the crowd. Waking the crowd from a mid-set slump came \u201cAll the Feels,\u201d the highlight of the show.\n\nLead vocalist Michael \u201cFitz\u201d Fitzpatrick\u2019s voice \u2014 usually more fit for Target ads \u2014 found its earnest voice with the title track of the band\u2019s fifth album. This song worked in multiple ways, with a seamless backing track accompanying a triumphant showing from the band.\n\nA roaring crowd washed over what was a home stretch-like performance from both of the singers.\n\nLead vocalist Michael \u201cFitz\u201d Fitzpatrick talks to the audience. During the concert, he emphasized the importance of perseverance over the course of his musical career, having worked in the music industry for several decades after graduating from college. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\n\u201cThe Walker\u201d marked the end of the set, with a choreographed dance that was surprisingly agile, given the band members\u2019 ages, during a saxophone break. When the last chord rang out, the crowd would\u2019ve been surprised to see that the set had only lasted just over an hour, which was surprising for a band with over five albums.\n\nAn audible sigh of relief could be heard when the band quickly ran back on the stage for the encore.\n\nBefore becoming the lead singer of Fitz and the Tantrums, Fitzpatrick worked a variety of different jobs. Eventually, he decided to pursue music full-time and started Fitz and the Tantrums in 2008, when he was in his mid-30s. Respectable.\n\nYet, one of the most off-putting moments of the night came in the form of a mid-set speech about the beginning stages of his career. \u201cMy dad looked at me goes, \u2018Yo, you got to get a little more realistic. You got to go and get a job.\u2019 And I got that J. O. B.\u201d At this point, the crowd booed in unison. \u201cI was working and working and then one day I was like, \u2018you know what? F*** that.\u2019\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick and co-lead vocalist Noelle Scaggs perform \u201cSpark\u201d from the band\u2019s 2013 album \u201cMore than Just a Dream.\u201d The band is known for their catchy, nostalgic pop songs and high-energy live performances. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nFor this specific act, this was a peculiar sentiment. Who was this message catering to? With the number of dads recording on their phones, the show could\u2019ve doubled as a baseball game. It also couldn\u2019t have been the children of these fathers, as Fitzpatrick didn\u2019t spare himself of profanity; it felt as if you were overhearing a youth pastor murmuring words God would frown at.\n\nAs awkward as it was, this moment quickly passed with the bombastic song \u201cAhhhh,\u201d which told the same story in a much more enticing way: \u201cDon\u2019t think too small, don\u2019t put me in a box / I\u2019m a big deal, I\u2019m a big shot.\u201d\n\nThe encore couldn\u2019t have ended better, with a fantastical rendition of \u201cHandClap.\u201d If the group had played a Taylor Swift-esque 10-minute version of this song, I\u2019m sure the crowd would\u2019ve rocked on.\n\nEven with consideration to the shortcomings and on-stage outbursts of Fitz and the Tantrums, there\u2019s something quite enticing about their enthusiastic performances. If you\u2019re looking for a show for your tweens who have grown out of their Kidz Bop phase, this may be the perfect show to get them all danced out and in bed before curfew.\n```"}

I read the goalie and put the ball low, which is what my coach has been telling me to do all week.\u201d\n\nThe team has high expectations for this season.

Graduate guard Destiny Littleton inbounded the ball, quickly received a behind the back handoff from graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, and put up a corner three as time expired. The shot was an airball, clearing the rim entirely, and USC lost at the buzzer 50-47.\n\nThe missed shot from Littleton was the last of a myriad of frustrating offensive possessions by the Trojans in this game.

USC shot just 22% from the field and 17% in the final three quarters. No Trojan shot better than 40% from the field individually, but the team\u2019s two active leading scorers, Sissoko and Littleton, struggled the most. Littleton was 4-of-20 shooting the basketball, and 1-of-8 on 3-pointers, while Sissoko shot 3-of-15.\n\nIn one stretch from the midway point of the third quarter to the seven-minute mark of the fourth, USC had missed 14 shots in a row. Much of the Trojans\u2019 offensive struggles stemmed from an inability to score in the paint, due in large part to the absence of sophomore forward Rayah Marshall due to injury. Without their tallest starter in the lineup, USC was outscored in the paint by the Cardinal 34-2.\n\n\u201c[The Cardinal] are gigantic,\u201d Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cCameron is such a good shot blocker too; big doesn\u2019t always mean good shot blocking. They clearly were trying to take away the paint in numerous ways ... It made us try to score in different ways, which we did early, and then we cooled off a little bit.\u201d\n\nStanford blocked 9 Trojan shots in the game, 6 coming from junior forward Cameron Brink. Those blocks made history, as Brink surpassed Jayne Appel for the most career blocks by a Stanford Cardinal.\n\nAlthough the Trojans could not find consistent success offensively, they were able to hang in the game with 3-pointers. With Warriors guard Steph Curry in attendance courtside, USC knocked down 8 threes, draining 5 of its first 7. Both graduate forward Okako Adika and junior guard Kayla Williams were 3-of-5 on threes.\n\nThe occasional second half three kept the Trojans within striking distance of Stanford in the second half, but it was their defense that made this a competitive game until the final buzzer. USC appeared to miss Marshall\u2019s paint defense and rebounding in the early going, but improved in both areas late. The Cardinal scored 26 points in the paint in the first half, but just 8 in the second, and while they dominated the offensive glass early, the Trojans finished with more offensive boards for the game with 20.\n\n\u201cWe knew that what Rayah does in impacting the game often goes beyond the stat sheet,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cShe cleans up a lot of people\u2019s mistakes when they don\u2019t box out or they get beat. We had a concerted effort to box out on the defensive end. I\u2019m so proud of [sophomore center] Clarice [Akunwafo] being thrown into a situation where she had to play a ton of minutes, and she was all over the offensive glass ... It\u2019s an effort thing, and you can\u2019t fault our effort tonight.\u201d\n\nDespite the loss, such a dominant defensive performance with Marshall inactive is a major positive for USC. In front of a raucous road crowd of over 6,300 fans, the Trojans held a Stanford offense averaging over 78 points per game to just 50 points, and only 18 in the second half. It was the second lowest scoring output for the Cardinal this season, the lowest being their 46 points in their loss at Galen Center in January.\n\nIn a postseason-style environment against one of the best teams in the country, USC had a chance to win until the clock hit zero. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the way this team fights; I think it\u2019s become a part of our identity,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty, obviously we want to make more shots. But we keep ourselves in games because of the character and who we are. It says everything about the people I get to coach.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the team and the way that we handle situations in the game,\u201d Littleton added. \u201cThey punched us first, but we didn\u2019t fold. I couldn\u2019t have said that in the beginning of the year, but this time of the year, we understand what it means to win big games. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t win this game, but we have another big game on Sunday.\u201d\n\nWith the loss, the Trojans fall to 19-7 on the season, and 9-6 in the Pac-12. They will have less than 48 hours to move past this heartbreaker, as they play their final road game of the regular season on Sunday afternoon against the Cal Golden Bears.\n```"}

Some Trojans have always desired to be here. There are those who come from a long line of Trojans spanning generations. Ones who felt they belonged elsewhere until they finally realized USC was where they wanted to be. Don\u2019t forget the Trojans who had to overcome hurdles and not accept no for an answer landing them here. One way or another, they eventually found where they belong.\n\nFingers are crossed as the deadline for 2023 Fall transfer applications has come to a close, leaving applicants\u2019 future in the hands of USC. Applying to a large university can be daunting when the numbers are so tight. According to the 2022-2023 Transfer Student Profile, there was about a 24% admittance rate for transfer applicants this academic year.\n\nHowever, that didn\u2019t stop first generation applicant, Narlin Chimbo Once, from taking her chances for this upcoming fall. \u201cI would hope to grow my own roots in the community of L.A. but also USC\u2019s community as well,\u201d Chimbo Once said. \u201cI know they have the First Generation Plus Success Center and I would probably frequent there often.\u201d\n\nChimbo Once mentioned that currently being at her local community college, there are very limited resources for success despite their best efforts. The fuel behind her applying was the research that she did herself of the university and felt the abundance of resources and opportunities were too good to pass on.\n\nFor some, USC is their love at first sight. Their years of high school are spent pursuing USC as their end goal; they know that everything leading up to it determines their fate. Unfortunately, not everyone got the fairytale ending they had hoped for on admission decision day, not on the first try at least.\n\nFor Kiley GilBride, a sophomore majoring in theater, it was a rollercoaster ride to become a Trojan. \u201cApril 1 rolls around, I get the email and open it, it says, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to inform you have been rejected.\u2019 I broke, I really did, because I knew I was supposed to be here,\u201d GilBride said.\n\nFurther trying her chances, GilBride appealed her initial rejection hoping for an acceptance. She would later receive another rejection, which sent her on her way to the University of Arizona. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that gut feeling, deep down, that this [University of Arizona] is where I am supposed to be,\u201d GilBride said.\n\nShe took one last leap of faith applying to USC as a transfer student, to which she was successful. GilBride is currently a student ambassador at USC and shared some of her script that she reads to prospective students in regards to the Fight On motto. \u201cI literally fought on to be here, and I don\u2019t know if you want to call it poetic, but it is definitely a testament to the type of people that are here at USC,\u201d she read. \u201cThey really do \u2018fight on\u2019 for everything that they do, including just being here.\u201d\n\nEnsuring that students are perfect for the institution is important, but making sure that the institution is perfect for the student is equally as important. USC can be considered a \u201ctool box,\u201d and it is up to the students to take action and use those tools to maximize success.\n\nFor potential transfer Chimbo Once, it would be using the Keck School of Medicine to further gain experience as both a community advocate and a professional in the healthcare field. Similarly, GilBride was enticed by the Institute for Theater Social Change program to do more with her passion than the glitz and glamor of being on stage.\n\nFormer Loyola Marymount University student Glen Wong found his way to USC as a transfer student later into his college career; Wong sought to pursue his dreams of being a part of cinematic arts in Hollywood. \u201cIt [USC] has a strong [cinematic arts] program, great opportunities, [an] extensive network and it is so beneficial just being on campus,\u201d Wong said.\n\nUSC has a large population of international students who provide global perspectives, Wong being one of those perspectives adding to the university at large. \u201cI am from Hong Kong and I grew up in a very different culture, but also very exposed to American culture as well,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI have approached so many people and have seen so many things, so I feel that I can bring something very fresh and very different [to USC].\u201d\n\nTransfer journeys come in all forms, with paths of triumphs and setbacks, but, to the prospective students, the destination is worth it. Here at USC, Trojans fight on to the end, to the future they want and to the places they plan to reach.\n\nFor transfer students, there are several resources provided by the First Generation Plus Success Center. One is the USC Transfer Student Handbook, which gives tips on how to transition smoothly to USC. It includes answers to frequently asked questions, a guide to understanding the transfer credit report and a financial fitness guide to manage finances.\n\nThe FG+SC also connects transfer students with the Transfer Student Soul Search, a website that connects new students to resources and a network to socialize with other transfers. There is also the Transfer Student Assembly \u2014 a student organization that provides a community for transfer students to help ease the adjustment process.\n\nThere are no guarantees in any student\u2019s future endeavors, but USC could be the place to take you a few steps closer. If you take anything away from these transfer Trojans, let it be to trust your gut and you will find your way.\n```"}

The Chiefs will play against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII on Sunday. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nBy Kamyar Moradi February 17, 2023 at 3:26 pm PST\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d is a satirical sports column by Kamyar Moradi depicting everything and everyone who should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nDear Juju Smith-Schuster,\n\nIf I had a dollar for every TikToker that became an elite NFL wide receiver, I\u2019d be flat-out broke! Social media has been the bane of my existence for a while now, and nobody\u2019s going to tell me otherwise. The destruction it causes greatly outweighs anything positive that it might bring to the table. Social media personifies what it means to be a distracted individual in today\u2019s society, especially someone that\u2019s lost their way.\n\nAt this very moment, as I\u2019m trying to frantically turn this column in before my deadline, I have gone out of my way to scroll mindlessly through my phone on three separate occasions, and we\u2019re only two paragraphs into the column.\n\nI say all this to shed light on someone who needs to get back in the lab and really consider what the sport of football means to them. There needs to be some serious self-evaluation done if this guy ever hopes to be anything more than an honorary member of the Faze Clan.\n\nThis guy is one more dice roll away from hanging up the cleats for good, and when it finally happens, we can all rejoice together.\n\nIn the words of the great A.J. Brown, \u201cYou was on the way out the league before Mahomes resurrected your career on your one-year deal Tik-Tok boy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right, readers, I\u2019m about to go after one of Southern California\u2019s very own Juju \u201con that beat\u201d Smith-Schuster. If you thought this guy was untouchable just because he\u2019s a USC alum and he shouted out the institution during media week, then you all have much to learn, young grasshoppers.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the Trojan family is truly something special, and usually, even I\u2019m not foolish enough to go after one of our own. But something that I\u2019ve believed for a long time is that in life, there\u2019s no such thing as an absolute.\n\nSo buckle up in that Corvette Corvette of yours, Mr. Smith-Schuster, because my outrage knows no bounds.\n\nThe part that disappoints me the most is that I should\u2019ve seen this coming. Your second year into the league, goobers around the NFL were so quick to appoint you this undeserved title of elite wide receiver when I screamed from the mountaintops that it was all a fallacy.\n\nI knew you had no business being regarded as one of the league\u2019s best for the simple fact that a guy by the name of Antonio Brown shared the field with you at all times. If I was on the 2018 Pittsburgh Steelers, there\u2019s a good chance I would make the Pro Bowl too.\n\nYou\u2019re in that rare echelon of wide receivers that are worse at running routes, catching the ball and producing overall in the receiving department than your tight end. How is it that your teammate Travis Kelce, who is listed to be four inches taller and about 40 pounds heavier than you, gets in and out of his breaks quicker and has exponentially more wiggle than you?\n\nSomeone with the title of wide receiver cannot be worse at receiving than a tight end.\n\nAbove all else, Mr. Smith-Schuster, the most egregious part about your entire career goes back to an app that continues to make the world a worse place: TikTok.\n\nI want to make something extremely clear to all of you reading this. I am as far away from the concept of shutting up and dribbling as humanly possible. I am one of the biggest proponents of athletes representing themselves through far more than just the sport they partake in.\n\nThe power and platform athletes around the world have at their disposal to accomplish some incredible things completely unrelated to sports is something I advocate for every hour of every day.\n\nBut with that being said, if you are a starting NFL wide receiver who prioritizes a dance routine on your opponents\u2019 logo more than doing anything of substance in the actual game, everyone in the Milky Way reserves the right to clown you \u201cwith no regard for human life,\u201d as said by NBA announcer Kevin Harlin.\n\nAnd in honor of you, Mr. Smith-Schuster, I\u2019m personally enacting a new rule that should span the test of time. Thee has\u2019t not the licenseth to talketh trash at which hour thee scoreth three times this season.\n\nGet your money up, not your funny up.\n\nSo how about you stop wasting everyone\u2019s time, Juju, and challenge Jake Paul to a fight or something because clearly this whole NFL thing doesn\u2019t seem to be working out.\n\nRespectfully, you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Houston won 83-77. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\n\nBy Michael Fiumefreddo\nFebruary 17, 2023 at 2:29 pm PST\n\n\u201cTourney Talk\u201d is a column by Michael Fiumefreddo about the men\u2019s basketball NCAA tournament. Wednesday marked the eighth time this season that the AP No. 1 ranked team lost. Like their football counterparts, Alabama basketball traveled into Knoxville to take on a highly-ranked Tennessee team, and the Vols held down their fort. One loss usually knocks a team out of the College Football Playoff, but this is basketball season, and Bama has done more than enough to ensure entry into March Madness. Instead, the top teams seek one of the four No. 1 seeds, and Alabama just made that race much more complicated.\n\nA No. 1 seed won the past five NCAA tournaments and eight of the past 10. It makes sense why: One of the top four teams in college basketball should be good enough to win it all. This year, almost the entire AP Top 10 can make a case for the top spot in one of the regions. With just three weekends \u2014 plus conference tournaments \u2014 left before the Big Dance, there\u2019s no telling who will get the honor, but it\u2019s fairly easy to figure out where the minds of the selection committee are looking.\n\nIf the season ended today, Purdue and Alabama would both be No. 1 seeds. But the season is far from over, and it\u2019s actually a blessing in disguise for the Boilermakers. Purdue \u2014 who looked like the unquestioned favorites to win the championship a few weeks ago \u2014 has lost three of its last four. With another loss, the next article in this series will be \u201cIs Purdue a Contender Anymore?\u201d. Luckily for the Boilermakers, this is just a product of the scheduling. Three games on the road, with one against rival Indiana and two against surprise top teams in the conference, all over the course of three weekends. If anyone deserves some slack for a rough stretch of games, it\u2019s Purdue, who has already proven to be a dominant force in a loaded Big Ten and have the chance to avenge their loss against the Hoosiers in one week. They\u2019ll face an Ohio State team with three conference wins tomorrow at home, the perfect time for the Boilermakers to get back on track.\n\nAlabama is Purdue\u2019s polar opposite. Losing on the road to a top-10 conference opponent isn\u2019t detrimental, but that\u2019s the Tide\u2019s fourth loss, matching UCLA, Arizona and Virginia. The Big Ten\u2019s competition is much harder than the SEC, which has just two ranked teams in Tennessee and Alabama. Bama\u2019s North Carolina win no longer looks great. Its losses to UConn and Gonzaga are progressively looking worse. The reasons against Alabama being a number one seed are beginning to stack up. The saving grace is that this is Bama\u2019s spot to lose. They\u2019re on a collision course with Tennessee for the SEC Championship, so if the Tide can beat the Vols on a neutral court, they\u2019ll hold one of the top four spots.\n\nOnly one team has punched their ticket to a No. 1 seed. The Houston Cougars should be atop the AP rankings come Monday, and there\u2019s no threat to the throne in their remaining schedule. On paper, its AAC Schedule looks like a cakewalk; however, Houston\u2019s five toughest games happened in non-conference play, and it went 4-1 with notable wins over then-No. 2 Virginia and St. Mary\u2019s. Houston has beaten every team in their conference except Memphis \u2014 only because they haven\u2019t played yet. The only scenario the committee could consider leaving the Cougars out of the top four is with a detrimental exit from the AAC Tournament, but given their 11-1 performance in conference play thus far, that\u2019s highly unlikely.\n\nBut Houston\u2019s quest to a No. 1 seed as a mid-major is a rare feat unless it\u2019s done by Gonzaga, mainly because the best teams often come from Power 5 conferences and the Big East. The Big 12 is a juggernaut this season, with six teams currently ranked in the top 25 and three in the top 10. Therefore, the Big 12 tournament is a play-in tournament for a No. 1 seed, and Kansas, Texas and Baylor are the frontrunners. All three teams get a scouting report of the other two before the tourney; they play each other in the next three weeks. But the talent of the conference, coupled with the dominance these three have shown, make the champion a no-brainer to lead a region. Even if an outsider such as Kansas State or Iowa State takes the crown, it\u2019s likely the conference\u2019s pedigree this season warrants it a top seed.\n\nThat leaves one spot open should Alabama miss out, and there are three contenders. Arizona and UCLA should easily reach the Pac-12 Tournament championship game, and both have been marching up the top 10 as of late. The winner will have a case for a No. 1 seed. However, like the SEC, the Pac-12 is weak after the top two, and both teams have some losses to potential non-tournament teams that hurt their resume. The fourth spot will end up going to Virginia, who\u2019s quietly won 10 of its last 11. The Cavaliers are still on the outside looking in to enter the top seed conversation, but what better way to do so than knocking off the reigning champions on their home court a week from now. Virginia is surging at the right time, and UNC is in freefall, but name value in the ACC goes a long way. Expect the Cavs to be a top-5 ranked team come conference tournament play, with a tournament win and a blunder from one of the others vaulting them into a No. 1 seed.\n\nTourney Talk runs every Friday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of T-Mobile via AP)\n\nBy John Walker\nFebruary 17, 2023 at 9:53 am PST\n\nArguably one of the best parts of the Super Bowl isn\u2019t the game or the halftime show. It is the ads that run in between. This year featured the Kansas City Chiefs beating the Philadelphia Eagles on a hard-fought 38-35 comeback win and Rihanna knocking the halftime show out of the park. But this year\u2019s ads were sorely lacking.\n\nMost ads hit and go on to live in infamy. Unfortunately, this year\u2019s ads stunk more than Clydesdale\u2019s poop, a time-honored Super Bowl commercial that was missed this year. Luckily, we didn\u2019t get four crypto ads, keeping your one crypto friend quiet. But I would have taken all of those over some of the ads this year.\n\nDunkin\u2019? More like airball\nBeing the first commercial of the game is an important spot as it sets the tone for the rest of the ads. Boston natives Dunkin\u2019 and Ben Affleck should have made a better pairing then Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid. But this commercial came to life in the second half like the Chiefs. It\u2019s a fast food commercial trope to get a celebrity in the drive-through, and you\u2019re telling me that\u2019s the best Affleck could do. He barely interacts with customers and even the small amount of struggling he does isn\u2019t that funny. His best line was saved for the outtakes on YouTube when he tells a customer they\u2019re out of coffee and donuts. Luckily J.Lo comes in at the end to save it. She stole the show.\n\nA Tale of Two ads\nA theme this year was shorter ads spread out throughout the game. The only problem was only one of the pairs usually hit, and it was always the second one: Pepsi and T-Mobile. Pepsi Zero Sugar should have just gone with Steve Martin over Ben Stiller. If you like Stiller\u2019s character in \u201cZoolander,\u201d that\u2019s all you\u2019re getting here. Martin delivered his usual range as a comedic actor, but Stiller delivered the tag better. I still can\u2019t tell if he was acting or not. Bradley Cooper and his mom were cringy in T-Mobile\u2019s first commercial. That is until the end when she jabs Cooper for never winning an Oscar. Yet in the second one, John Travolta and \u201cScrub\u2019s\u201d Zach Braff and Donald Faison outshined with their \u201cSummer Nights\u201d parody about home internet. Pepsi and T-Mobile should have just rolled out one ad this year.\n\nTons of teasers\nGone are the days when the newest trailers debuted during Super Bowl. While there were plenty, most were just okay. The \u201cIndiana Jones,\u201d \u201cFast X\u201d and \u201cTransformers\u201d trailers didn\u2019t do much than get those respective fan bases hyped. But \u201cDungeons and Dragons\u201d was probably the worse by far. The in-theater trailer shows this as an action comedy, while the Super Bowl teaser leaned more towards \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d Very fantasy heavy. But it was \u201cThe Flash\u201d teaser that took the cake. It hit everything we wanted to see from a teaser. We got Micheal Keaton\u2019s Batman, Batmobile and theme. We got multiple universes and characters. And we got great visual effects. The reporting so far from test screenings is \u201cThe Flash\u201d is on the level of \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d I\u2019m still skeptical that it will clear that bar, but that trailer was fantastic.\n\nHellman\u2019s Mayo saves the day\nWho would have thought that Hellman\u2019s Mayo would have the best Super Bowl commercial? I was absolutely floored with Pete Davidson\u2019s breathtaking delivery as he opened the fridge to tell a mini John Hamm and Brie Larson, \u201cI\u2019m gonna eat you guys.\u201d It\u2019s so simple that it just works.\n\nMaya Rudolph\u2019s first M&M\u2019S commercial\nMaya Rudolph\u2019s first commercial replacing the iconic and somehow controversial spokescandies (thanks, Tucker Carlson) was pretty funny. Rudolph kidnapped the spokescandies and launched her own clam bites flavor M&M\u2019S. But red M&M pops out at the end with a \u201chelp\u201d sign which was a treat to see. It was just such a great ad campaign. From using Carlson\u2019s rage to bench the candies to Rudolph\u2019s \u201cMidsommar\u201d feeling commercial, M&M\u2019S keeps delivering great ads. Luckily, they announced the spokescandies are safe and will return.\n\nSpeaking of Tucker Carlson...\nCanada\u2019s own Dave Grohl gave Tucker Carlson plenty of reasons not to invade Canada. For reference, Carlson took a break from whining over \u201cwoke\u201d M&M\u2019S to suggest the U.S. should invade Canada, and now thanks to Carlson, we have another incredibly funny Super Bowl ad. Grohl calls for the thanking Canada for American classics such as peanut butter, basketball and football. Without all the context, it would be a bland commercial. So, thank you, Carlson, for being America\u2019s softest snowflake. What a debut for Crown Royal.\n\nEVs are on the rise\nCar companies used the Super Bowl to roll out their new line of electric vehicles. General Motors, Jeep and Ram all premiered commercials, with General Motors and Jeep blowing Ram out of the water. Ram\u2019s Premature Electrification was just bland. It tried so hard to be funny as an erectile dysfunction parody, but didn\u2019t connect how its new electric truck was better than the competition. It brought up common complaints about other electric trucks like mileage and how much it can tow. However, you\u2019d have to go to the website to see how the truck fixes these problems. But then it wasn\u2019t that much help.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeep showed off its new rugged electric line up perfectly. My favorite car of all time is the Jeep Wrangler. The ad showed it climbing up rocky hills, driving through water and handling sand and mud. It\u2019s the greatest example of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d It was also just a great ad. You saw it do all these adventurous things, unlike Ram, and had dancing animals throughout it. It was a really run commercial that embraced the move towards electric vehicles with the taglines \u201celectric is freedom\u201d and \u201cboogie woogie woogie.\u201d\n\nBut General Motors and Netflix went the extra mile this year. They put Will Ferrell in some of our favorite shows like \u201cBridgerton,\u201d \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and \u201cSquid Games\u201d to promote the pairs news partnership. There wasn\u2019t a bad joke in the entire commercial. They could have easily taken out multiple spots and given each show a chance to shine. But the compilation showing off each car made it so clean.\n\nIt\u2019s a Blue Moon ad?!\nMolson Coors called this year\u2019s ad campaign The High-Stakes Beer Ad, and boy, was it. After over 30 years since their last nationally televised Super Bowl ad, Coors pitted their flagship beers, Coors Light and Miller Light, against each other, and the battle did not disappoint. The social media campaign advertised an epic fight between the two beers in a winner take all Super Bowl ad. But in the end, Blue Moon took the prize. What a great twist. It\u2019s nice to see a slightly smaller beer get the spotlight compared to the two juggernauts. The only knock on the ad is that you had to have been following Molson Coors, Coors Light and or Miller Light on social media to know this was happening.\n\nDoritos flopped\nJack Harlow\u2019s Dorito commercial was just stupid. The idea of him rediscovering the triangle after seeing the perfect Dorito and going on to almost win a \u201cGrammy\u201d off a triangle solo fell flat. The joke wasn\u2019t funny to begin with, and they kept running with it. It\u2019s a disappointment because Doritos Super Bowl commercials are usually really good.\n\nWhile there were highlights, this year\u2019s Super Bowl ads weren\u2019t memorable. It felt like I was watching a regular season\u2019s worth of ads. We\u2019ll see these ads a month from now and not remember them as Super Bowl ads. Just a disappointing group all around.\n```"}

Well, not the entire world. Just college football. Last week, Texas and Oklahoma officially announced that they will leave the Big 12 following the 2023 season for the greener pastures \u2014 in terms of dollar bills, that is \u2014 of the SEC. But that is just one of many changes that will come into the sport beginning in 2024.\n\nThis upcoming season will also mark the final year in the Pac-12 for USC and UCLA before they leave for the Big Ten. It will be the last season of a four-team College Football Playoff before the tournament expands to 12. And, it will be the final season of the SEC on CBS broadcast package \u2014 an institution that a generation of college football fans grew up watching.\n\nNot only that, but 2023 will be the final, or likely final, season of college football for a plethora of star quarterbacks that fans have come to know and love, including USC\u2019s Caleb Williams, Oregon\u2019s Bo Nix, Utah\u2019s Cam Rising, LSU\u2019s Jayden Daniels and Notre Dame\u2019s Sam Hartman.\n\nWhen you combine all of that, college football will essentially look like a completely different sport when the 2024 season kicks off 18 months from now. Hence, 2023 is going to feel like an \u201cend of an era\u201d season of sorts.\n\nInevitably, people are going to complain about all of college football\u2019s changes. They will claim that the sport we have come to know and love is dead, its rich tradition killed by financial greed. But the reality is, change is inevitable. Even the college football of today \u2014 with a four-team playoff, the transfer portal and name, image and likeness \u2014 looks vastly different than the one that we had just a few years ago, let alone a few decades ago.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what the future has in store for college football. But, given that the sport has continued to thrive for well over a century now, it seems safe to say that college football will be okay even after 2024.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s savor every moment we have left with the sport as we have come to know it. Let\u2019s savor the final Bedlam matchup between Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. The final time that USC plays a Pac-12 After Dark matchup with a 10:30 p.m. kickoff on the East Coast. The final Iron Bowl on CBS. The final opportunity for Kansas to beat Texas ... oh wait, they\u2019ve already done that. Twice, actually.\n\nA new era of college football is rapidly approaching. Let\u2019s savor every moment that we have left of the current one.\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Nolan Ezzet\nFebruary 16, 2023 at 11:28 pm PST\n\nUSC men\u2019s basketball soared past Cal 97-60 on Thursday at Galen Center. The 97-point performance is a season-high for the Trojans and brings them to 18-8. The Trojans suffered losses to Oregon and Oregon State last week, but Peterson\u2019s career-high 30-point performance helped them bounce back.\n\nPeterson had a couple of stand-out passes in the first half as well. After his first steal, he went coast-to-coast and tricked the defender by changing direction several times. He then finished the possession with a beautiful no-look assist to sophomore guard Kobe Johnson, who layed it in. Another Peterson steal allowed him to travel the length of the court again, and he topped the possession off with a behind-the-back assist to freshman guard Oziyah Sellers.\n\nPeterson led his Trojans squad to a 50-23 halftime lead that was characterized by excellent ball movement and prolific shooting. USC made seven of 12 3-point attempts in the first half. The game seemed over already.\n\n\u201cReally depended on the first half to get that lead,\u201d Head Coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see some shots go in because last week we didn\u2019t see too many go in.\u201d\n\nPeterson finished with 30 points on 9-of-14 (64.3%) shooting from the field, 4-of-7 (57.1%) shooting from 3-point range, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, 2 steals and 1 block. He also controlled the ball well and only committed 1 turnover.\n\n\u201cI was obviously more happy we took care of business tonight coming off last week\u2019s road trip, but it\u2019s cool to be able to join Boogie in the [30-point] club,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nSenior guard Boogie Ellis was a great second option, racking up 22 points on 6-of-13 (46.2%) shooting, including 4-of-8 (50%) from deep.\n\n\u201cBoogie and Drew were aggressive,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey made great, quicker decisions. They shot when they were open.\u201d\n\nThe biggest defensive contributor was sophomore guard Kobe Johnson, who stole the ball five times and got one block. He also racked up 15 points on 6-of-10 shooting, the third most of his career.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our best defensive player, and he\u2019s, in my opinion, the best defensive player in the Pac-12,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe gets deflections, steals. He guards the other team\u2019s best player, he guards big guys, he guards small guys. He can guard everything. He anticipates, he beats guys over ball screens.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans found success on offense in many ways. They shot 33-for-56 (58.9%) from the field and 12-for-23 (52.2%) from beyond the arc. In the game prior, against Oregon State on Saturday, USC made one of 14 3-point attempts.\n\n\u201cWe need to make our fair share of threes. We need to attempt a good number a game, and then we need to have some go in,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win any Pac-12 game when you make one three like we did on Saturday.\u201d\n\nWhen they weren\u2019t knocking down threes, the Trojans were driving hard to the basket and drawing and-ones.\n\n\u201cOur job instead of taking a poor shot is to try to drive it, make the right play, and then get off the ball, cut and relocate,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI thought our players did a really great job tonight of doing that.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s bench was a major contributor to the win. Sellers scored a career-high 11 points and sophomore forward Harrison Hornery had a season-high 7 points.\n\n\u201c[Sellers] has improved a lot this season, defensively,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was nice for him to make that layup, and then he made those two threes and the pull-up. I thought he played really well tonight.\u201d\n\nUSC only has five regular season games remaining. The Trojans went into the game 63rd in the NCAA\u2019s NET rankings. They will need to make a strong push to secure a spot in the NCAA tournament. USC will face Stanford at Galen Center on Saturday. The Cardinal have won six of their last nine games, including an 88-79 victory against No. 8 Arizona last Saturday.\n```"}

Expand Elzie \"LZ\" Granderson, Bob Glauber, Sam Hoggs, Kysa Washington and Johnathan Franklin sit on a panel to discuss the life and impact of Kenny Washington. (Photo by Eric Lambkins II)  By   Eric Lambkins II February 16, 2023 at  7:50 pm PST \n \nOn Wednesday, the Los Angeles Rams held a private screening of the film \u201cKingFish,\u201d which tells the story of Kenny Washington, the first Black football player to reintegrate into the National Football League (NFL). The screening was held at the Miracle Theater in Inglewood and was attended by front-office personnel, community members and celebrities. The film, directed by the BLK Originals\u2019 Sam Hoggs, stars Inglewood native and rapper D Smoke. It takes viewers on a journey through Washington\u2019s life, from his childhood in L.A. to his time playing football at UCLA, and then his signing that shattered the color-barrier with the Rams in 1946. It\u2019s a powerful and moving story that highlights the triumphs and struggles of a man who helped break down barriers in professional sports. \n\nFor the Rams, the screening of \u201cKingFish\u201d was an opportunity to honor Washington\u2019s legacy and reflect on the team\u2019s history. Every Black football player since Fritz Pollard, until Washington, was denied the opportunity to play in the NFL because of the color of their skin. The Rams were the first NFL team to reintegrate their roster by signing Washington and Woody Strode in 1946 after a gentleman\u2019s agreement by NFL owners to exclude signing Black football players. It was a bold move that helped pave the way for other teams to do the same; a step in breaking down racial barriers in professional sports. \n\n\u201cKenny did something special when he stepped out of his comfort zone, and he was the first,\u201d D Smoke said. \u201cAnytime somebody is brave enough to be the first, that\u2019s giving other people permission and license to just go out there and do something uncharted.\u201d \n\nThe screening is a testament to how far we have to go as a society. Even today, there are still challenges and obstacles that Black athletes face, from unequal access to resources to discrimination and racism. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for teams like the Rams to acknowledge and celebrate their history and use their platform to effect change. The Rams have been active in the community, supporting programs and initiatives that help to promote social justice and equality. The screening of \u201cKingFish\u201d is just another example of their commitment to championing social justice. \n\nFor the attendees, the screening was a chance to learn more about the history of the game they love and to connect with the legacy of those who came before them. It was also a reminder of current NFL players\u2019 responsibility to use their own platform to effect change and help create a more just and equitable society \u2014 like Colin Kaepernick. \n\n\u201cYou have to know where you come from to know where you\u2019re going. That\u2019s what this movie did,\u201d Johnathan Franklin, Rams community affairs and engagement manager, said. \u201cIt reminded us of our history and what we stand for. And it motivates us to do better, to be better, to use our voices and our platforms to make a difference.\u201d \n\nIn many ways, \u201cKingFish\u201d is more than just a movie. It\u2019s an ode to the salience of diversity, equality and social justice. It\u2019s a reminder of the progress we\u2019ve made and the work that remains. It is a charge for all of us to use our platforms to effect change and positively impact the world. The Los Angeles Rams may have been the first NFL team to reintegrate their roster, but they know the work is far from over. By screening \u201cKingFish,\u201d they have shown their commitment to using their platform to make a difference, to honor the legacy of those who came before them, and to inspire the next generation of football players and fans to work toward a more just and equitable future.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Anjali Patel and Dominic Varela\nFebruary 16, 2023 at 7:49 pm PST\n\nA small fire broke out at Parkside Apartments on the morning of February 16. The fire alarm sounded, forcing students to evacuate as the fire department arrived. No injuries were reported. Once they cleared the building, residents were informed of the potential source of the fire: a bottle of hand sanitizer. However, students were still left largely uninformed about the incident.\n\nZiqing Tang, a freshman majoring in political science, said, \u201cI actually didn\u2019t recognize that there was a fire alarm. And also I was like, \u2018Ok, maybe it\u2019s just another mistake,\u2019 because that happens here a lot.\u201d Tang was in her room on the sixth floor, the floor where the fire occurred. She was awoken by the alarm but it took a moment for her to realize what was happening. \u201cSomeone shouted out, \u2018Oh, this is a real fire.\u2019 It was then that I was fully awake,\u201d Tang said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Is this really happening to us?\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce outside, Tang learned of the potential source of the fire. But questions still remained. \u201cI think someone lit the hand sanitizer in the hallway, which caused the fire and then the sprinklers went off,\u201d Tang said.\n\nAn email sent out by the USC Department of Public Safety at 6:48 a.m. alerted everyone to the situation. A follow-up email 11 minutes later stated that the fire had been extinguished. \u201cThe origin of the fire was electrical in nature,\u201d said Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department. \u201cThe specific cause of the fire is under active investigation.\u201d\n\nDespite LAFD extinguishing the fire before 7 a.m., residents were barred from reentry for an extended period of time. \u201cWe were outside for around two hours,\u201d said Olivia Buckler, a freshman majoring in health and human science. \u201cMy mom\u2019s a professor, so we went to her office to stay warm.\u201d\n\nThe sprinklers flooded multiple apartments, forcefully relocating a small portion of sixth-floor residents for an undetermined amount of time. \u201cNine students from five apartments at Parkside Apartments need to be relocated temporarily because of water damage from the sprinkler system,\u201d said Chris Ponsiglione, the Director of USC Housing. \u201cUSC Housing will be using available space in university-owned housing to accommodate these temporary relocations.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur RAs have told us, \u2018If you know anything, let them know or to speak up,\u2019\u201d Buckler said. \u201cBecause they think it was intentional.\u201d Since the cause of fire is still under investigation, questions over accident or arson still remain.\n```"}

Fast forward 58 years and now, the team has a field named after them.\n\nCouncilwoman Monica Rodriguez held an event on Thursday to officially rename the fields at the intersection of Dronfield Ave. and Osborne St. as the North Valley Broncos Square. \u201cToday we\u2019re celebrating this incredible history because it was this team that, not only as a result of the fortitude and insight of their parents to create an environment allowed them to play ball, but this was the team that took it all the way to the World Series,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nThe North Valley Broncos advanced to the finals in New Bedford, Massachusetts after beating the local team in Glendora at the time in the regional competition. In the finals, the North Valley Broncos lost versus a team from Wahouma, Alabama. Although the team did not win the Bronco World Series, their legacy still lives on.\n\nOne player on the team also has USC ties. Anthony Davis, who was a USC running back from 1973 to 1975, is best known for scoring 11 touchdowns in three games against Notre Dame. And Davis played for the Broncos when they made the World Series. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have this park, I don\u2019t go on to be drafted by the Baltimore Orioles, go to USC and play on three national title teams,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI started right here. There\u2019s a lot of kids that started their careers here, right across the street there.\u201d\n\nIn addition to playing for the football team, Davis also played for the USC baseball team, winning three baseball championships on top of his two football national championships. Despite all of the accolades Davis received at USC, he says this one holds a special place in his heart. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of awards in my life as an athlete, but this one I\u2019m going to really cherish because this is where everything started for me,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, little league baseball was still segregated in Pacoima until 1963, when a non-segregated league was created. Despite the Civil Rights Act that was passed in 1964, one year prior to the Bronco World Series, the players on the North Valley Broncos team still endured the segregation laws of the time. Despite racism and segregation, Davis says he and his teammates still found a way to succeed. \u201cWe went and forged our way and became established for Pacoima, California,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe North Valley Broncos originated after fathers of the players came together to lease out the field that is now named after the historic team. This came after their sons were denied access from practicing at baseball fields because of the color of their skin. As Davis spoke to the crowd he took a moment to say just how much the field renaming means to him. \u201cYou see this field behind us. I think the county leased it for like a couple of dollars for the year. And that\u2019s when we all gathered and started honing our skills,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI started right here.\u201d\n```"}

Nearly a quarter of this development\u2019s total units \u2014 184 apartments \u2014 will be dedicated to low-income households. The apartments will also aim to market to senior residents. Affordable and workforce housing will be eligible for Angelenos with Section 8 vouchers from the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), as stated in the press release.\n\nThe HACLA\u2019s Section 8 program, which \u201cprovides rent subsidies to private landlords on behalf of very low-income families/individuals, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities\u201d is financed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. This mixed-use location, referred to as the \u201c5035 Coliseum Plan\u201d by Thrive Living, is near the intersection of La Brea Avenue and Coliseum Street, with proximity to the Metro E Line (Expo) station at Exposition and La Brea.\n\n\u201cMayor Bass has declared a housing emergency in Los Angeles, and we\u2019re answering the call,\u201d said Jordan Brill of Thrive Living in a written statement. On Bass\u2019 first day with the mayoral title in December, she announced homelessness as a state of emergency in Los Angeles. In 2022, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority estimated that there were 69,144 unhoused individuals in L.A. County, a 4.1% rise from 2020. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in L.A. is $2,225 as of this month, according to Apartments.com. As defined by the HACLA, those who classify as low-income make 80% of area median income. For a two-person household, this is $76,250 a year.\n\nMost L.A. apartments require that tenants make a minimum of three times their monthly rent, which leaves many low-income households below the earning requirement after income tax. According to Thrive Living, the company acquires strategically located, underutilized properties in urban markets that are experiencing significant housing affordability gaps. They estimate 400 new jobs will be created in partnership with Costco through a local hire and job training program for residents of Baldwin Village and neighboring communities.\n\n\u201cI think it would be great for bringing jobs to the community as well as additional shopping opportunities with vast resources,\u201d said Paula Brown, an assistant property manager at a nearby apartment community. \u201cI love [Costco]. I have to pace myself when I go there. I love the prices, what they have to offer, the inventory, the gas \u2014 I love all of it, the whole experience.\u201d\n\nThis Costco location will provide fresh produce options for residents and plans to offer optical services, a pharmacy and delivery services to support the needs of local businesses. \u201cUsually it has been the case that when you have a destination shopping area like a Costco, that the immediately adjacent businesses are benefited because people might go to the Costco and then they might go to, you know, a place to eat, or the dentist, whatever the case may be,\u201d Gary Painter, a professor from USC Price School of Public Policy, said.\n\nCJ\u2019s Cafe, a restaurant on South La Brea Avenue neighboring the development\u2019s pending location, hopes to benefit from the increased consumer traffic in the area should the Costco complex be built. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have more customers. Everyone likes to shop at Costco, and people get hungry after that,\u201d CJ\u2019s Cafe manager Jesse Cisneros said. \u201cAnd not everyone wants a hot dog. So, they\u2019ll probably make their way down here.\u201d\n\nWith 75% housing and 25% retail operations near public transport, L.A.\u2019s Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program classifies the mixed-use development as a Tier 3 project. This allots for more overall space than standard zoning rules. Various amenities for the Coliseum Street location are listed on the company\u2019s property description. These include five central interior courtyards and a landscaped walking path, a rooftop pool, a full basketball court and community gardens for residents to grow their own food.\n\nValery Augustin of DNA Architecture + Design Inc. in L.A. expressed that the lure of these amenities is two-fold: they are \u201cvital to creating community\u201d for the residents, but they are also essential from a marketing standpoint for a greater return on investment. \u201cTwenty-three percent of the units are low-income, which means the rest are all near market rate. And the amount of money that they\u2019re putting into this project, I bet you market rate is going to be pretty expensive,\u201d Augustin said. \u201cIt\u2019ll price out a large group of people. And with that comes a desire for certain amenities. The building owner sees that, \u2018Hey, we have people with higher disposable income,\u2019 I\u2019m going to jack up the rent. And it can become a whole cycle.\u201d\n\nThrive Living\u2019s New York based owner, Magnum Real Estate Group, also purchased the Baldwin Hills Shopping Center for $37.3 million in 2022. This property is less than a mile away from the proposed Costco development, and is anchored by a large Ralph\u2019s supermarket. A full application is expected to be filed soon to the City of Los Angeles by the Thrive project team. Thrive Living is currently positioned to invest more than $1 billion in workforce housing in Los Angeles.\n```"}

And, I don\u2019t know, sometimes there\u2019s still that stigma of reaching out for help without being told \u201cOh, you\u2019re just looking for attention.\u201d\n\nDr. April Thames teaches psychiatry at UCLA. She believes that the best way to tackle this tragic trend is to create spaces for people who need to to open up. APRIL THAMES: I think raising awareness and destigmatizing mental health is one road that we sort of need to accomplish first, just to get people to talk about it, because there\u2019s so many girls that are not talking about it and that they\u2019re feeling like they\u2019re the only person. And then finding the appropriate space, you know. It may not be them coming to my office to do one hour of psychotherapy. It may be just connecting with us, an activity in the community, doing team building, friendship circles, talking about peer relationships because that\u2019s so important.\n\nHelp should be more accessible says freshman international relations student Valerie Aronhalt. VALERIE ARONHALT: There\u2019s just a lot of social pressure and people are scared to talk about things. And I think that people are scared to reach out for help. And I think that\u2019s something that we have to work on, to be not scared to talk about our problems because there\u2019s nothing wrong with having struggles and trying to fix them.\n\nThe CDC agrees. They say that increasing access to health services, improving health education and creating a supportive school environment for students will be key to improving the situation for teenage girls.\n```"}

The North Valley Broncos were the first all-Black team from Southern California to make the Bronco World Series back in 1965. The Bronco World Series league is a baseball and softball competition for 11-12 year olds.\n\nThe ceremony included members of the original 1965 North Valley Broncos team. The new \"North Valley Broncos Square\u201d is the place where the team first played in their hometown of Pacoima in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nCouncilwoman Monica Rodriquez spoke during the ceremony about the effort it took to create this field and team.\n\nMonica Rodriquez: The members of the North Valley Broncos were convened as a result of their parents that had to pull together resources to lease the lot that is behind us that enabled an all African-American team to be able to do what every other child so often gets to do that we so often take for granted, and that\u2019s to come together and play baseball. For Black Americans the luxury of playing baseball wherever they wanted to was not something given to them. It wasn\u2019t until 1963 that there were desegregated leagues.\n\nThe team was not even allowed to play at the park across the street, said former 1965 North Valley Bronco member Anthony Davis\n\nAnthony Davis: There\u2019s a lot of kids that started their careers here, and right across the street there. We couldn\u2019t play at that park, if you can believe it or not. That was like a miniature Dodger Stadium, because that was that. It was so groomed. And we always looked at that field, that beautiful grass. We had gophers over here and we had to play with the gophers.

I started right here...But this is something this is very monumental. And matter of fact, I\u2019ve got a lot of awards in my life as an athlete, but this one I\u2019m going to really cherish because this is where everything started for me.\n\nThe legacy of the North Valley Broncos has provided inspirations for generations of youth in baseball today.\n```"}

The culprit? People think it was none other than a hand sanitizer bottle in the hallway. Students and staff at Parkside Apartments say someone lit the hand sanitizer bottle on fire for unknown reasons. This caused smoke to rise and set off the alarm across the freshman residence hall.\n\nA USC Public Safety report on the incident is expected this evening. Students living there had different experiences with the fire. While some thought that it was a small incident, others saw the flames as they rushed out of their doors.\n\nSejal Sharma, a freshman Environmental Engineering student, said: \"So I woke up at six because the alarm went off and I ran outside of the door. I could see the flames and I could see smoke. And then everyone was kind of screaming and running. We all ran down the exits stairs and we like, ran to the bottom. There were fire ambulances and everybody was kind of evacuating.\"\n\nSharma thinks she even saw the cause of the blaze - the flammable hand sanitizer. \"I think when I saw it, it was right when the fire was happening, because it was the hand sanitizer by the elevators.\"\n\nStudents' plans for the morning were disrupted. Freshman Kristen Mayol was going to wake up early this morning to study for a midterm. But then she heard the alarm and tried to find out what was going on. \"Me and my roommate, we were just completely thrown off, but we didn\u2019t really see anyone else texting about the incident. If a fire breaks out at Parkside Apartments and no one is texting about it, did it really happen????\"\n\nMayol said she and her roommate assumed it might be a gas leak near the dining hall and weren't too panicked.\n\nAs of 11 o'clock this morning, getting around in the Parkside Apartments was still limited to the fire escape stairs, said Freshman Leslie Garcia-Sanchez. \"As of now, I don\u2019t think the elevators have been fixed, but I think they\u2019re working on that right now.\"\n\nGarcia-Sanchez said her RA's do a good job of preparing the residents for unexpected events. \"My RA's are very good with communication, and I always feel welcome to, like, message them on GroupMe or to just knock on their door if there\u2019s ever any, like, incident or incidents or, like, you know. So I yeah, I felt prepared.\"\n\nPartly thanks to the preparation, there've been no reports of injuries from the small fire. With the help of the RA's, staff, and firefighters, students were able to evacuate their building safely. And as of this afternoon, the elevators are running again at Parkside Apartments.\n\nCorrection: This story implies that smoke causes fire sprinklers to activate. This is incorrect, as high heat causes sprinklers to activate. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled a source\u2019s name. Annenberg Media regrets this error.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/02/16/why-is-californias-population-declining/", "response": "```\nWhy is California\u2019s population declining?\n\nWe asked USC students why they think people have been fleeing California since COVID-19, and if they will follow this trend after they graduate.\n\nBy MJ Newsom and Paige Shea\nFebruary 16, 2023 at 5:53 pm PST\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau has reported that over 500,000 people have left California between April 2020 and July 2022. California has been seeing a trend in population decline for the past few years, with the COVID pandemic, rising housing costs, and challenges of living in big cities pushing people to move to a simpler lifestyle. In the last year of the two-year timespan, from July 2021 to July 2022, 211,000 people left California, and more than half of that number was from Los Angeles County alone.\n\nWe asked USC students why they thought so many people were leaving the state. The main answer we got were the various costs of living in California, such as high gas prices and housing expenses. Students also shared their plans after graduation.\n\nMarina Earle, a sophomore majoring in film and television production, said that she does not plan on staying in California after college.\n\nMARINA EARLE: I am a film production major, which is kind of an odd choice because you want to be in L.A. and everyone says you have to be in Los Angeles to make it and be in Hollywood. But since I\u2019m from the East Coast, I just I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I really belong here. So I\u2019m thinking about going to New York, maybe. And I culturally, I think I miss a lot of the things from the East Coast.\n\nMichael Vaughan, a sophomore from Newport Beach majoring in political science, said that he will most likely stay in California after graduating, but he has reservations, mostly for long term issues such as family planning and future finances\n\nMICHAEL VAUGHAN: I think I will be staying in California after I graduate college. The only thing that would deter me from it is probably the property taxes here and how expensive the cost of living is. If I were to move somewhere, it would probably be somewhere like Texas or Florida, where it\u2019s a little bit cheaper to live and I probably can start a family off out of college and not have to worry about not having enough money and stuff like that.\n\nVaughan\u2019s desire to move to Texas or Florida is part of a growing trend. While California and New York both lost hundreds of thousands of residents in the past two years, Texas and Florida\u2019s populations have increased substantially. Between the two year time span when California lost over half a million residents, Texas gained about 884,000 new residents and Florida gained about 707,000.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Aorui Pi\nFebruary 16, 2023 at 5:10 pm PST\n\nOver the years, the United States has been crowned the most popular country for international students. Millions of them board flights to the U.S., where they will spend the next few years exploring and experiencing academic life. Here, about one in four students come from another country at USC. However, building a life in the U.S. is difficult for international students. Living in a metropolis like Los Angeles makes it even harder. The ongoing graduate student workers union election calls to help all graduate student workers, including international students. There\u2019s more USC can do to amplify international students\u2019 voices, such as giving the same weight to international students in on-campus jobs.\n\nI\u2019ve been covering international students\u2019 issues and stories for four years. I co-founded a Chinese news media platform during my undergraduate studies at Syracuse University, which covered issues like encountering racism, campus shootings and financial insecurity as an international student. I used to work in the campus cafeteria almost 10 hours a week to save money to travel during the Thanksgiving break when the entire town was buried in snow and no businesses were open. I had a fairly independent upbringing, and yet, I wished for stability and security during my undergraduate years. I had to move from place to place in constant search for a cheaper lease. I walked miles to get groceries. I couldn\u2019t use emergency services because medical bills were not affordable. Even though I don\u2019t miss home as much as other international students might, I can\u2019t beg my parents to pay for the overpriced flight tickets during the winter break. They worked hard to send me abroad. I believe it\u2019s unfair as a capable young adult, to ask them to sponsor me all the time.\n\nThese are just a few examples of what many international students may endure while studying abroad. International students make up a small group among 15.8 million college students. There\u2019s a limited amount of studies about international students, since they are often perceived as \u201coutliers\u201d who won\u2019t stick around for too long. They were never a part of the U.S. student body. My official immigration title changed from \u201cNon-resident Alien\u201d to \u201cResident Alien\u201d after six years in the U.S., during which I moved from a small college town in upstate New York to \u201cthe city of dreams\u201d L.A.\n\nUnlike many U.S. students, international students are ineligible for federal student loans and many other third-party scholarships, as they typically require U.S. citizenship. In some public universities like UCLA, international students have to pay almost double the tuition fees than their domestic, in-state peers. As USC follows suit with a tuition hike of 5% in the 2022-2023 academic year, international students\u2019 families are left to grapple with the increase, in addition to currency exchange rates and global inflation.\n\nFor international students, some ways of making income include finding a part-time job or an internship. Yet off-campus jobs require international students to have an \u201ceducational affiliated\u201d purpose for applying. It has to either be associated with the school\u2019s curriculum or to contractually funded research projects at the graduate level. If you are lucky enough to secure a place, working for 20 hours per week as a full-time student is stressful. Why 20 hours? Because withholding a student visa will be mandatory to enroll in school full-time. Students also cannot be full-time workers, except in the last semester of their program. Therefore, student visa holders can only work under 20 hours per week anywhere on campus. But, many internship opportunities require students to work full-time for a minimum of three months. Even with remote working options international students cannot work for more than 20 hours a week, which sometimes hurts their chances of finding good opportunities.\n\nOn-campus jobs seem more reasonable for students who can\u2019t travel and work outside their curriculum. These also generally have looser restrictions. International students can apply to every student working opportunity on campus except for Federal Work Study positions. Moreover, the ones which international students can apply for are not enough. According to connectSC, there are only 13 open positions for non-work-study student employment. Some of the jobs on campus are not quite welcoming to student visa holders. For example, the website of the Dornsife writing center says, \u201cbecause of visa restrictions, international graduate students with full Teaching/Research Assistantships or fellowships are not eligible for additional on-campus employment.\u201d This position needs prior teaching experience, shutting the door on many undergraduate students. Even for graduate-level students with fellowships, it is not enough to cover all the living expenses in L.A.\n\nAccording to the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism student handbooks, doctoral students\u2019 stipends at Annenberg rose slightly, from $30,000 to $34,000 between 2017 and 2021, due to summer support and inflation relief. Still, the amount does not match the cost of living in L.A. According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a single working adult must make $45,536 a year to earn a living wage in L.A. The current doctoral stipends at Annenberg school is short by about a fourth of the believed livable income. Same as the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, which holds 29 Ph.D. programs at USC.\n\nI\u2019m not asking schools to create specific positions for international students. But acknowledging and prioritizing international student workers will benefit the entire student body, and establish a fair, healthy and thriving campus culture.\n```"}

(AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi\nFebruary 16, 2023 at 4:55 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d is a column by Curran Rastogi about college basketball teams and their journeys to March Madness.\n\nWhat does \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d have in common with the Big 12 Conference? Both are must-see television every week, capturing the eyes of fans everywhere. Over the last three years, the Big 12 has quietly become the best conference in college basketball with down-to-the-wire games and remarkable parity.\n\nThis year, it has become almost impossible to predict what teams will win on a nightly basis, cementing itself as far-and-away the best college basketball conference in the nation. The biggest sign of this parity is as of February 16, no team in the Big 12 had over 10 conference wins. Every other Power 6 conference leader has at least 12. While the Big 12 Conference has the lowest number of member schools, its leaders all have four losses, also the highest number of losses compared to every other Power 6 conference leader.\n\nParity alone doesn\u2019t make the conference the best in the nation; the Big 12 is also the deepest conference by far. According to KenPom, a predictive rating of teams based on their offensive and defensive efficiency, the Big 12\u2032s worst team, Texas Tech, is the No. 61 team in the country. By this metric, Texas Tech would finish around the middle of all other Power 6 conferences.\n\nThis also translates to the NCAA tournament, where eight of the conference\u2019s 10 teams are projected to make it, the highest percentage of any conference in the nation. Lastly, according to the NCAA\u2019s NET Rankings, a ranking of every team based on how well they\u2019ve played over the season, every team in the Big 12 is in the top 65.\n\nWhile the numbers and standing certainly point to the eliteness of the conference, does this reflect the actual basketball played on the court? Yes. The Big 12 led all conferences with six players on the Midseason Watch List for the Wooden Award.\n\nTwo teams stand out as capable of making a Final Four run this season: No. 5 Kansas and No. 9 Baylor. It\u2019s pretty clear why Kansas is an obvious contender for the national championship after winning it last year. The Jayhawks are an experienced squad led by redshirt junior forward Jalen Wilson, a 20-point-per-game three-level scorer likely to be an All-American at the end of the season.\n\nThe Jayhawks also have freshman guard Gradey Dick, a 6-foot-8 guard who shoots 43% from behind the arc and is a matchup nightmare for any team. Kansas is productive on both the offensive and defensive end of the court and has the pedigree to repeat as national champions.\n\nHead Coach Scott Drew has Baylor tied for first in the Big 12 with the best offense in the country according to KenPom. They lead their conference in points per game and are second in both free-throw and 3 point percentage. On offense, freshman guard Keyonte George leads the team in scoring with 16.5 points per game, as a strong finisher at the rim with the potential to explode on a nightly basis.\n\nRedshirt senior guard Adam Flagler and junior guard LJ Cryer complete the three-headed monster the Bears have on offense. One potential red flag for this Baylor team is the defense, which ranks 78th in defensive efficiency. However, the numbers don\u2019t tell the full truth, as Baylor finally has its best defender and last year\u2019s Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, redshirt senior forward Jonathan Tchamwa Tchatchoua, back on the floor after he sustained a bad knee injury.\n\nFortunately for college basketball fans, Baylor plays at Kansas this Saturday in what is guaranteed to be an intense matchup. Baylor won the last matchup in Waco, but Kansas has only lost one game at home. Although Baylor will be underdogs on the road, they will beat the Jayhawks in what is sure to be a close game. Baylor is one of the hottest teams in college basketball and will only improve on the defensive end as Tchamwa Tchatchoua continues to impact the game.\n\nThe Bears are the best team in the Big 12 and will three-peat as Big 12 regular season champions. With all the uncertainty around the future of the Big 12, it looks like its basketball is here to stay. The conference will add Houston, Cincinnati and UCF and reportedly is aggressively pushing to add Gonzaga. If Gonzaga ends up joining the Big 12 like Houston, the conference will have two more incredible programs that will make for even more intense matchups.\n\nThis new Big 12 era could be the best conference in the history of college basketball. \u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

He jumped in his 2011 Toyota Prius and started the engine. Immediately, he knew something was off. \u201cIt was a sound I had never heard before. I couldn\u2019t even go pick my son up because my car sounded like a lawnmower \u2013\u2013 like a loud motorcycle,\u201d Betancourt, of Chatsworth, said.\n\nCatalytic converter theft rates have exploded in recent years, a pesky crime that takes minutes to pull off and not infrequently months to fix. Reported thefts rose from 1,300 in 2018 to more than 52,000 in 2021 \u2014 a 1,215% increase, the National Insurance Crime Bureau said.\n\nCalifornia, the car capital of the nation, is a particular hot spot, officials said. The brazen crime can often come at a high cost for vehicle owners. Many miss work, face transportation headaches and pay thousands out of pocket in expenses.\n\nIn a blink of an eye, Betancourt, a delivery truck driver by trade, was out of a working vehicle. A working vehicle meant he could have a side hustle, driving for rideshare apps such as Uber Eats. Those apps meant extra money. Gone.\n\n\u201cI was just really mad because I worked so hard to have the little things that I have, and just for someone to come steal it was a hit below the belt,\u201d Betancourt said. \u201cI have to walk to work. I\u2019m a single father, so having to meet up with my ex-wife to go see my kid \u2013\u2013 that\u2019s hard, too.\u201d\n\nTo fix that 2011 Prius, a car now 12 years old, will cost Betancourt $3,500. That\u2019s out of his pocket. Due to a nationwide backlog, he won\u2019t receive a replacement for up to 10 more months.\n\nJohn Bitterolf, of Santa Monica, owner of University Tire and Auto Service in downtown LA, said his shop is replacing up to 15 catalytic converters a month. \u201cThey\u2019re stealing them by using a reciprocating saw,\u201d a handheld tool commonly used for demolition or remodeling, \u201cand it can be done very, very quickly, in a matter of a minute or two,\u201d Bitterolf said.\n\nA Palmdale woman on Tuesday ran over and killed a catalytic converter suspect who crawled under her SUV. She woke up from a nap to the sound of a saw, reversed her car and \u201cfelt a bump,\u201d the LA Times said.\n\n\u201cThis catalytic converter theft is really a crisis at this point. The supply can\u2019t keep up with the demand, and there\u2019s just not enough catalytic converters to replace the ones that have been stolen,\u201d Bitterold said.\n\nA catalytic converter is an essential device to a vehicle\u2019s exhaust system, converting toxic exhaust into more environmentally friendly gasses. Individual states set their own emission standards for catalytic converters.\n\nCatalytic converter theft has hit California particularly hard. In an indictment filed last October in Sacramento, federal prosecutors asserted, \u201clast year approximately 1,600 catalytic converters were reportedly stolen in California each month, and California accounts for 37% of all catalytic converter theft claims nationwide.\n\n\u201cWith California\u2019s higher emission standards, our community has become a hotbed for catalytic converter theft.\u201d\n\nIn Irvine, 2022 thefts spiked to 526 from 15 in 2018 \u2013\u2013 a more than 3,000% increase, police said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re arresting people from all over Southern California with different backgrounds,\u201d Kyle Oldoerp, an Irvine Police Department spokesman said. \u201cWhat makes this a unique crime is that not all catalytic converters are the same. Certain models are favored by thieves based on the amount of that precious metal that is in each catalytic converter.\u201d\n\nRhodium, palladium and platinum, metals found in converter parts, can go for $20,000 per ounce, the national crime bureau said. Moreover, catalytic converters lack unique serial numbers and VIN identification numbers, making it difficult to locate lawful owners and leaving many thefts unsolved.\n\nLAPD encourages parking in well-lit spaces, or in garages and, if possible, the engraving of a car\u2019s VIN on its catalytic converter.\n\nReports of rising theft bring back \u201chorrifying\u201d memories going back a decade for Miryam Hernandez, 42, of Lake Forest. One hot summer afternoon, Hernandez, along with her 7-year-old daughter, hopped in their 2004 Toyota Tacoma for a day trip to Venice Beach.\n\n\u201cI was shaking as soon as I heard the noise. I thought it was a bomb or it was going to explode,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nHernandez drove around the corner to an auto shop where mechanics broke the news.\n\n\u201cI never thought it would happen to me because we were in a safe community,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt was our only vehicle, so we were just stuck.\u201d\n\nThieves target specific vehicles with easy access to the converter. The Toyota Prius and Tacoma are among the two most likely vehicles for catalytic converter theft, according to Carfax.\n\nWorking as a paralegal with heavy student loan debt, Hernandez said the theft proved a financial stress. Nobody was arrested.\n\n\u201cIt was more than taking that catalytic converter,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cTaking that catalytic converter was taking my freedom. Taking that little bit of joy that I had away from me and from my daughter.\u201d\n```"}

Cabrera\u2019s team comprises South Central residents aiming to build space for their own community, because residents often can\u2019t access event space in most buildings in their own neighborhoods, she said. \u201cA lot of us are young entrepreneurs, who are also first generation entrepreneurs, who are also breaking cycles of poverty and violence,\u201d Cabrera said.\n\nDiego Deellay, a lifelong resident of South Central, met Cabrera online and came to the market to support local businesses like hers. \u201cI wanted to come, support the community, support the street vendors, support small business owners here in South Central,\u201d Deellay said, \u201cso we can go ahead and keep the money in our community and help each other grow.\u201d\n\nBenitez said the flea market spotlights handcrafted goods and local artists whose work take the time, care and effort customers don\u2019t typically see at corporate or chain stores nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get an object that\u2019s mass produced,\u201d Benitez said. \u201cBut there\u2019s value in folks who make it by hand, because you put sweat, blood and tears into it. \"\n\nDeellay believes the flea market can also inspire younger residents to start their own businesses in the area, helping diminish tired narratives of South Central as \u201ccrime-infested,\u201d he said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s market was the first hosted by Qawal and YJC, and Benitez and Mendoza hope it becomes a regular fixture in local residents\u2019 calendars. \u201cMy goal is to do this market at least once a month and make it reoccurring,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cAnd every single time we do this market, my goal is to bring in different vendors so that everyone gets a chance to be a part of this amazing collaboration.\u201d\n\nMendoza also said that the only way the market can happen again is if people come out and support the local vendors. The next South Central Flea Market is set to be held in April at Chuco\u2019s Justice Center at 7625 S.

Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman announced the program in a briefing, calling it an effort to fight against the country\u2019s ever-present fentanyl crisis.\n\n\u201cOur last estimates [pre-pandemic] are that maybe somewhere around 5% to 10% of undergraduates might be using a combination of either cocaine or other prescription drugs that were not prescribed to them or ecstasy or other things,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a small number, but it\u2019s not zero.\u201d\n\nNaloxone, which comes in the form of a nasal spray, is more commonly known by its brand name NARCAN. Drug overdose by fentanyl is usually accidental, as fentanyl is used to enhance the effect of other drugs such as cocaine, heroin and oxycodone.\n\nThe naloxone kits will be distributed at the Trojan Farmers Market in the McCarthy Quad every Wednesday through April 5. The kits will include test strips that can detect the presence of fentanyl in drugs. After watching a 10-minute training video, taking a short quiz and signing an attestation form, students can pick up their naloxone kits.\n\nVan Orman also mentioned \u201cThe Haven,\u201d an outpatient substance abuse program that partners with USC to help students overcome alcohol and drug addiction. \u201cThey\u2019re really dedicated to treating students and helping students who might be in recovery from a substance use disorder, continue to be in school,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cTheir clinic and their facility is located really close to campus. So that\u2019s another great resource for students.\u201d\n\nVan Orman said it\u2019s important students realize it only takes using a drug one time to overdose on fentanyl. \u201cI think sometimes people think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m just using once or I never use or I don\u2019t have a drug problem, right? I don\u2019t have any addiction concerns or I\u2019m not concerned about my use,\u2019\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cAnd so they may not have the same level of awareness.\u201d\n\nIan Wisecarver, a freshman majoring in aerospace engineering, says that while naloxone \u201csounds like a good thing to have on hand\u201d in the event of an overdose, he is worried about possible side effects of its usage. \u201cIf any side effects happen with the [naloxone] that could obviously be pretty bad, but having it on hand might help save some people,\u201d Wisecarver said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, at least on paper it sounds like a good idea.\u201d\n\nJared Smith, a freshman majoring in human biology, is happy that the university is offering support for students who have a substance abuse issue. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a great resource for those who are struggling with drug abuse,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think that we need to let it be known that those who struggle with drug abuse, they have people there to support them and love them, and this is just a resource that can help them when they\u2019re struggling.\u201d\n\nVan Orman hopes that those who know drug users will familiarize themselves with naloxone and be prepared in the event that it\u2019s needed. She said that even if students are not using drugs, they may know some who do. \u201cSo I encourage those individuals to become familiar with it, to have naloxone, to be comfortable using it, because they might be able to respond in an emergency and really save someone\u2019s life,\u201d Van Orman said.\n```"}

(Photo by Philip Salata)\n\nBy Nora Miller, Nicole Santos and Monica Esquivel\nFebruary 15, 2023 at 6:48 pm PST\n\nEligible graduate student workers at USC are casting their votes to potentially unionize as the Graduate Student Workers Organizing Committee, or GSWOC. Voting took place on Wednesday and will continue into Thursday night at a voting location set up in the Wallis Annenberg Hall. The group\u2019s main goal is to negotiate for higher wages, benefits and workplace protections and to ensure that any improvements are enforced by a legally binding contract, according to the website.\n\n\u201cI feel like graduate student workers deserve a strong union,\u201d said Melissa Ann Chadburn, a Ph.D. student in the creative writing department. \u201cThey deserve bargaining capacities for job security, for finances. I think that we need security, especially in a thriving community like Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nDespite pushback from USC, students like Lauren Kelly, a Ph.D. student in the history department, said they voted yes to forming a union because they need better support through collective bargaining.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to have a union to advocate on our behalf and have a contract that will protect us,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nSome graduate workers said they are feeling optimistic now that they are almost at the last step to form a union. While the voting is still ongoing, they said their hopes are high for better benefits coming from USC, including for international graduate student workers.\n\n\u201cAs an international student, some of the issues that I find important are the fact that [we] have an added precarity of dealing with visa issues, immigration-related issues and also in general with financial insecurity,\u201d Kritika Pandey, a sociology Ph.D student, said.\n\nPandey noted that international students were not eligible for tools like stimulus checks.\n\n\u201cFor many international students, the pandemic was a really hard time in terms of financial precarity,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is not something that I think USC did a lot to support at that time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the GSWOC website, one of their priorities is to create a more equitable learning environment for graduate students. They explained that this issue spans outside of USC, as more institutions are creating unions throughout the country. GSWOC has published articles with more in-depth information about why they are advocating for unionization.\n\nThey said the school administration is partly responsible for the drive to unionize because they ignored or downplayed so many of their concerns.\n\n\u201cThe university is really irregular in how it pays us and sometimes overpays, sometimes underpay,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s really not any transparency about when those issues are happening.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, graduate student workers started the process to finally form a union through United Auto Workers, or UAW, which is one of the largest unions in North America. Chadburn said that affiliation has not sat well with USC.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s been a lot of anti-union rhetoric by email, specifically by the provost who has really tried to appeal to USC\u2019s elitism or something by consistently referencing United Auto Workers,\u201d Chadburn said. \u201cLike, \u2018Do you want the United Auto Workers to represent you?\u2019 If they\u2019re good enough for all the UCs and Harvard, I think they\u2019re good enough for us.\u201d\n\nPandey agreed that the school\u2019s response to the unionization effort was disappointing.\n\n\u201cI had even hoped that it would not go forward and USC would voluntarily recognize our demand to unionize, but that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Pandey said. \u201cI feel like USC\u2019s stance has been very clearly anti-union.\u201d\n\nUSC officials said that the school does \u201cnot believe that bringing in the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative of our graduate students is in the best interest of our students or the university,\u201d according to a statement sent February 3.\n\n\u201cOne of the advantages we have as a private university without a union is that we can be flexible and nimble in responding to individual situations, attempting to meet the needs of students as they arise,\u201d Andrew McConnell Stott, Vice Provost for Academic Programs and Dean of the Graduate School, said in the statement.\n\nAs for some of the issues that are unique to international graduate student workers, Stott said in the statement that USC treats \u201cinternational students equally with domestic students and provides them equal stipends.\u201d\n\nHe continued to note that USC differs from other institutions.\n\n\u201cImportantly, unlike the UAW contract at UC campuses, we provide international students tuition remission fully equal to domestic students,\u201d Stott said.\n\nDespite the growing tension between the school and the graduate student workers, Pandey said the goal \u201cis not to create conflict\u201d and they hope to work with the university \u201cto build a more equitable USC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is here to just demand ... better living wages, better work conditions,\u201d Pandey said. \u201cSo we hope that the USC [administration] will be amenable to that, for sure.\u201d\n```"}

USC shuttles have long been an essential service for inter-campus travelers and commuter students. The extensive route network serves most of North University Park, much of South L.A. and is an integral link between USC\u2019s University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus. These university-sponsored shuttles help to streamline student transport, and provide a vital, around the clock service to the community.\n\nBut drivers at USC see a marked difference in hourly wage compared to those who have unionized at other California universities \u2014 starting at $20 an hour compared to those represented by the SEIU Local 721, who can earn \u201cup to $39.34/hr.\u201d Drivers are \u201cfed up with not having a voice and earning the lowest wages,\u201d according to a flier distributed by SEIU Local 721 to shuttle operators.\n\nTuesday USC Director of Transportation Tony Mazza sent a letter to USC shuttle drivers and dispatchers, acknowledging SEIU\u2019s petition to request a union representation election. In it, Mazza informed drivers that they will have the opportunity to vote on whether they wish to have SEIU represent them. The majority vote will decide whether the entire group is represented by the union. In other words, if SEIU wins the election, they will exclusively represent all USC Transportation drivers.\n\nAmong those voicing concern is newer shuttle driver Chris Harris, who has been driving passengers between Union Station and the UPC and HSC campuses for about six months. \u201cWe are one of the lowest paid companies as far as transportation,\u201d Harris said. According to Harris, it\u2019s been more than a decade since drivers have gotten a cost of living raise, and in the last three years, they haven\u2019t gotten a raise at all. Harris pointed out that senior drivers, who have been driving between 10 to 30 years, have been told by management before that they will not receive their long-overdue raises.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important to me, and a lot of other drivers, is to be heard, to be respected, to get better pay, to renegotiate benefits [and] to be treated fair,\u201d Harris said. At 10 a.m., Harris makes sure his bus is ready for the day. By 10:40 a.m., he hits the road, driving around USC Keck Hospital and picking up passengers. When he\u2019s done for the day, his bus, along with many others, returns to the University Park Campus. Some days run longer than others, especially when he works overtime in the evenings.\n\nMoving forward, Harris expressed the changes that he hopes to see as a result of unionizing. \u201cThe hope that I have is for us to have better pay, for us to be able to go to management and speak with them and actually get things done, and to be able to work more together as a team,\u201d Harris said. Currently, USC shuttle drivers lack the ability to negotiate bonuses, have little to no say on the working conditions of the job or the job itself and \u201ccannot fight back against unjust discipline,\u201d according to the SEIU Local 721 flier.\n\nKrisilda Atiah, a graduate student, uses the shuttle every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to get to her classes at HSC. \u201cI don\u2019t drive, and driving here in L.A. can get expensive and there\u2019s always a lot of traffic,\u201d Atiah said. \u201cI think the majority of people in my master\u2019s program rely on it, some people I know take it four or five times a week.\u201d\n\nArthur Smith, a USC shuttle driver for 17 years, says he\u2019s unsure about the formation of a union, and only \u201csomewhat\u201d supports it. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019ll help us or the students,\u201d Smith said.\n\nPartha Bharadhwaj, a graduate student with classes at HSC, takes the shuttle several times a week in order to get to class and therapy. According to Bharadhwaj, \u201cUnionization would be a fair deal. [The drivers] are always super nice people, and they do a lot for the school. They deserve better representation and pay.\u201d\n\nAtiah concurred, \u201cThey\u2019re always super nice and friendly to me. Sometimes they\u2019ll even wait for you if they see you running after the bus, which is really nice of them.\u201d\n\nThe program is extremely important to Toby Zhou, a graduate student who lives near Keck and has to commute almost every day for his classes at UPC. \u201cI would support a union, but I\u2019m not sure if that is possible. They give us a pretty good service ... and sometimes even tell jokes on the shuttle, but that is something for the school to decide,\u201d Zhou said.\n\nBut it seems that the school is leaving it up to the drivers to decide. Mazza is encouraging all drivers to vote, writing in emboldened letters, \u201cMake your voices heard and do not let others make this important decision for you. Be sure to vote!\u201d The election will be held via a secret ballot. While no further details of the election have been released, Mazza promised to keep drivers informed.\n\n\u201cThis is an important decision that will affect all USC shuttle drivers and dispatchers,\u201d Mazza said.\n\nAfter this story was published, Annenberg Media received a statement from USC Transportation saying that \u201cshuttle drivers received raises in 2021 (there was a 3% merit pool) and in 2022 (there was a 5% merit pool); [and] there was a pause on raises in 2020 for all employees because of the pandemic.\u201d In other words, while every employee received a raise the past two years, not all employees received the same amount.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Stefano Fendrich and Daniel Palmore\nFebruary 15, 2023 at 6:19 pm PST\n\nAverage attendance for USC men\u2019s basketball is down over 13.1% this season while average attendance for women\u2019s basketball is up over 25.5%, according to USC Athletics. This change has been reflected on the court. With the college basketball season well underway, both USC teams are on the edge of making or missing the NCAA Tournament. ESPN\u2019s Bracketology has the USC men\u2019s team as one of the first four teams to miss the tournament but have the women\u2019s teams slotted into an eight seed.\n\n\u201cI feel like women\u2019s basketball in general just doesn\u2019t get as much attention as the men\u2019s do, so I think that\u2019s really cool that they\u2019re doing so well,\u201d sophomore business student Karina Greer said. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting ... [and] if [they] continue to do really well, I\u2019ll go to a few more games down the line.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the men\u2019s team has been more successful than the women\u2019s team, but this year, it is the other way around. The men have made the tournament four of the last six seasons, while the women\u2019s team has not made the tournament in nine years. But the exceeding of expectations, or lack thereof, has contributed to the changes in attendance for home games and overall attention some students give to the respective teams.\n\n\u201cIf the [men\u2019s team] can get into the tournament and do as well as they did last year, that\u2019d be awesome,\u201d senior history student Izzy Goihman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a possibility; I haven\u2019t really been keeping up as much as I did last year, just because they were so much better last year.\u201d\n\nThe men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams have had success at Galen Center this season, with the men posting a 12-1 home record and the women a record of 13-2. Both have had signature home wins this season. In January, the women\u2019s team beat then No. 2 Stanford, snapping the Cardinal\u2019s 14-game winning streak against the Trojans. And the men took down crosstown rivals then No. 8 UCLA by 13 points.\n\nAt USC, students are accustomed to winning championships and seeing their teams blow opponents out of the water. And it makes sense, considering out of every Division I school, USC has the third most NCAA championships, with 111 in school history.\n\nWith attendance numbers decreasing for men\u2019s basketball this season, students feel that the team underachieving may have something to do with it.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been to any games myself,\u201d freshman astronautical engineering student Eli Goldenberg said. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s not advertised as much as it is at other places. I\u2019ve never felt the need to go, and I barely really know when games are going on.\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s basketball currently sits in fourth place in the Pac-12 standings with Utah, Arizona and UCLA in the top three spots. Currently, the Trojans have a 17-8 record and are on a two-game losing streak after losses against Oregon and Oregon State. USC\u2019s loss against Oregon State was particularly disappointing to fans as the Beavers currently have a 10-16 record and are second-to-last in the Pac-12.\n\nCompared to last season, men\u2019s basketball in the 2021-2022 season won the first 13 games of the year and did not lose their first game until January 11 in a close home loss against Stanford.\n\nWith two consecutive home games approaching, USC will prepare for Pac-12 rivals Stanford and Cal as a potential NCAA tournament spot is on the line, with just six regular season games remaining.\n\nOn the other side, women\u2019s basketball is on a roll, as they have won their last two games and are winners of eight out of the last 10 matchups. For students unfamiliar with the women\u2019s previous records, the success of this year\u2019s team has been crucial to increasing attendance numbers.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think it would be pretty crazy to go to the tournament,\u201d junior health promotion and global medicine student John Tran said. \u201cI know next year we\u2019re going to have the number one ranked player come play and I feel like rivalry games will always be big.\u201d\n\nThe Women of Troy will finish this year\u2019s regular season with a winning record for the first time since the 2019-2020 season when the Trojans had a 17-14 record. As attendance for women\u2019s basketball games increases, USC will likely build on their success next year, as the Trojans will welcome the addition of Juju Watkins, the number one ranked player in the high school class of 2023.\n\nAs the regular season comes to a close, both men and women\u2019s basketball will look to secure spots in the NCAA tournament and make a push for a championship.\n```"}

The school\u2019s decision comes amidst a slew of withdrawals from law and medical schools. RISD cited U.S. News\u2019 inability to assess how its students learn as the basis for its change in participation.\n\nThe University of Southern California Rossier school of Education recently came under hot water for reporting incorrect data and has since dropped out of the graduate school rankings. Currently USC undergraduate school ranks 25th on U.S News and World Report\u2019s National Universities list. The school\u2019s reputation has raised questions of how much students factor in prestige when applying to the school.\n\nWhen talking to Sneha, they cited USC\u2019s prestige as a factor when applying. Sneha: I just felt like unless I was going to a highly ranked college, like, I might as well just stay in-state and go to my state college.\n\nThough many high school students do factor in a school\u2019s prestige when applying this is not a belief that is held by all students. Ruby believes that prestige should not be the most important factor when students apply to university. Ruby: I\u2019m actually a third generation USC student, so that\u2019s been in my family for a long time and there was no pressure for me to go to USC at all. But I already kind of knew about the university beforehand and I didn\u2019t necessarily look too much at the rankings while I was applying to schools.\n\nRuby also spoke on the ranking systems inability to assess the strength of a school\u2019s different programs. Ruby: If you\u2019re looking at some of those more specific types of majors, you should look at the schools that are best for you and not just the ones that the news tells you are the best to go to.\n\nCritics of U.S News have also pointed out the rankings\u2019 biases. Crystal Williams, the president of RISD is quoted saying that, \u201cMany of those criteria have been written about in critical terms and publicly questioned, and are unambiguously biased in favor of wealth, privilege and opportunities that are inequitably distributed,\u201d Williams said.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Narayan Pereda.\n```"}

She has a vision for world-class education, the nations priority for police and safety and stopping the surge for drugs and illegal immigration.

The more candidates who run, the better off Trump is. The Republican Party nominates in primaries, many of which are winner take all. So if you are in a fragmented field, then you can get 33% of the vote and you come in first.

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Jacob Hare February 15, 2023 at  4:53 pm PST\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d is a column by Jacob Hare that discusses offseason football news in the Pac-12 conference. The Pac-12 did a tremendous job in terms of recruiting this year. According to ESPN\u2019s top 300 recruits, the conference signed the top two overall players and five players in the top 14. That\u2019s a massive turnaround for a conference that only managed to sign two top 30 players a year ago. These young men all have the potential to do remarkable things for their respective universities. Just as I broke down the coaching hires in my last column, I will be breaking down these freshmen and what they will bring to the conference.\n\nMalachi Nelson, QB: USC\nESPN\u2019s No. 1 recruit comes to USC with the perfect situation. The California native will be able to sit behind and learn from 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams in his first year. Nelson boasts an exceptional skill set. He has a rapid release and can extend plays on the ground. Nelson fits the mold of the new generation of athletic and quick quarterbacks. While Nelson comes to USC with abundant talent, he will have his work cut out for him. Nelson comes in as standing at 6 feet 3 inches tall, but is very thin and only weighs 180 pounds. Nelson will need to bulk up to survive the powerful hits in Division I football. His arm strength is already good, but if he can add weight, his arm will significantly improve. USC Head Coach Lincoln Riley has an extraordinary track record with quarterbacks, so I am confident that Riley will bring the most out of Nelson. USC is in a prime position for the foreseeable future as Williams will likely enter the draft after next season.\n\nDante Moore, QB: UCLA\nESPN\u2019s No. 2 recruit shocked the entire college football nation by switching his commitment from Oregon to UCLA. This change was likely a result of Oregon quarterback Bo Nix opting to return to school after flirting with the NFL draft. UCLA should be a better fit for Moore as he can work with offensive-minded UCLA Head Coach Chip Kelly, rather than defensive-centered Oregon Head Coach Dan Lanning. During his NFL and college career, Kelly has had a successful track record developing quarterbacks, and with Moore\u2019s talent, I like this fit. To run Kelly\u2019s offense to its fullest, you must be brilliant. It\u2019s very complex, so Kelly getting the most pro-ready quarterback in this recruiting cycle feels like a match made in heaven. Moore will likely have an excellent opportunity to start as a true freshman. The No. 2 recruit is a mature and polished player, so starting as a freshman wouldn\u2019t be as outlandish as it sounds. In high school, he displayed a calmness and charisma that most college players don\u2019t even have. Moore has every trait that pro bowl quarterbacks possess: accuracy, anticipation, fast release, athleticism and intelligence. I am excited to see what he does in Westwood over his career.\n\nZachariah Branch, WR: USC\nZachariah Branch, the consensus No. 1 wide receiver recruit, will join his brother, safety Zion Branch, at USC. The Nevada native has drawn multiple comparisons to NFL pro bowl wide receiver Tyreek Hill. While the apparent reason is his blazing speed, it\u2019s more than that. His route running and catch radius are out of this world. Branch will likely be eased into his college career like most freshman wideouts, but I could see him having a critical role as the season progresses for USC. Branch is too good of a talent not to be on the field. Branch has Biletnikoff potential and Lincoln Riley will have a lot of fun calling plays for him.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR: USC\nMakai Lemon will have a familiar face at USC in his high school teammate, Malachi Nelson. Lemon is a playmaker, and it will be dangerous when he and Branch line up on opposite sides of the field for the Trojans. Lemon brings a unique skill set, and it will be interesting to see how USC uses his abilities. Lemon also played cornerback in high school and excelled at the position, which begs the question: Could USC use him on both sides of the ball? Head Coach Deion Sanders did it last season at Jackson State with the 2022 overall No. 1 recruit Travis Hunter, so it\u2019s not out of the question. Regardless of where he plays, Lemon will be an exciting addition to the Trojan roster.\n\nCormani McClain, CB: Colorado\nWho better to learn to play cornerback from than the best cornerback of all time? Deion Sanders flipped McClain from Miami to Colorado, sending significant shockwaves throughout college football. McClain has all the tools to be an elite cornerback: speed, athleticism and size. He fits the new mold of elite cornerbacks in the modern NFL. McClain will also line up on the other side of stud cornerback Travis Hunter, which should take immense pressure off the true freshman. McClain could go down as the best defensive player in this recruiting class if he plays to his full potential.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac Offseason Edition\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

In the past year, I\u2019ve grown especially fond of books geared toward personal growth. Here I\u2019ve identified five solid reads that influenced my mindset. Hopefully, one will speak to you, too.\n\n1. \u201c101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think\u201d by Brianna Wiest\nI went into this read skeptically. I\u2019m not one for books that make life-changing promises \u2014 and the title seemed to do just that. Despite my hesitancy, and while several parts read like typical self-help advice, I still found meaningful takeaways and unique insights. The essays provide short snippets of positive reminders \u2014 just the right amount of material to fit in a few chapters before bed to end the day on a mindful note.\n\n2. \u201c10% Happier\u201d by Dan Harris\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all heard meditation championed as a method to transform your life and mindset completely. While this is exciting, it may seem daunting, impossible and unlikely all together unless your full time and energy are spent on the practice. For that reason, I appreciate Harris\u2019 ability to communicate a realistic take on mindfulness, his own proven tactics and their ability to up happiness by \u201c10%.\u201d Harris shares how he addressed his anxious tendencies in a high-pressure journalism career, inspiring me to do the same as an overwhelmed college student.\n\n3. \u201cWhen Breath Becomes Air\u201d by Paul Kalanithi\nWhile not in the self-help genre, this autobiography provides a beautiful example of a life passionately lived and the reflections that come upon the realization that life is ending too quickly. Neurosurgeon and author Kalanithii splits his writing into two sections \u2014 one that details his early life and intense medical pursuits up to age 36 and the second following his diagnosis of stage four lung cancer. Through his narration, he reveals the values and experiences that defined his life, his story emphasizing the importance of genuine purpose-driven pursuits. This book inspired personal reflection on what matters most to me and how to maximize my time to be a positive influence in the world.\n\n4. \u201cThe Little Book of Hygge: Danish Secrets to Happy Living\u201d by Meik Wiking\nI picked this up as a light read inspired to learn more about Danish culture, given my heritage, and took away a message of finding joy in simplicity. Happiness researcher Wiking details how aspects such as togetherness, minimalism, light (especially candles) and food contribute to Denmark\u2019s recognition as the home of some of the world\u2019s happiest people. I put this food focus into good practice by following the book\u2019s recipe for aebleskivers (Danish pancakes), borrowing the special pan for this dessert from my grandma. This provided a happy morning with my family centered around food and a new experience!\n\n5. \u201cThe Power of Vulnerability\u201d by Bren\u00e9 Brown\nI recommend listening to this book on audio, as it is narrated by Brown herself. Brown shares from a background as a researcher on shame, courage, and vulnerability, but her scientific findings support tangible real-life applications. Her narration reads like the advice of a compassionate friend, and her many New York Times bestsellers are next on my reading list.\n\nKeep these books in mind during your next hunt for a good read with an impactful message!\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Drake Lee\nFebruary 15, 2023 at 3:50 pm PST\n\nAs Stanford put USC\u2019s 2022 season to a close by routing the Trojans 12-5, it also marked the end of an era. During the offseason, USC and then-Head Coach Jason Gill mutually agreed to part ways. A month later, the athletic department hired Andy Stankiewicz, the man who guided Grand Canyon to its first-ever NCAA Division I postseason appearance in 2021. With Stankiewicz, the team hopes to reclaim its reputation of being one of the most prestigious programs in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have to build a ball club that\u2019s competitive, not just against the opponent but ... also inside the program,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cI want to see guys fighting for jobs. If we can do that really well, we feel like we can be competitive against the opponent.\u201d\n\nStankiewicz will be inheriting a squad that is searching for its first winning record in a full season since 2015. Last season, the Trojans went 25-28 and were last in the conference with a Pac-12 record of 8-22. USC was one of just four schools in the Pac-12 with an overall losing record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice being the underdogs coming into the season,\u201d said sophomore infielder Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek. \u201cSo as a group, we\u2019re coming in ready to go, ready to play and ready to prove people wrong.\u201d\n\nMartin-Grudzielanek and other transfers have been brought in to assist USC\u2019s offense. In their conference last season, the Trojans were 10th in batting average, last in on-base percentage and last in runs batted in. One thing the Trojans did well was put the ball in play, as they had the fewest strikeouts in the conference.\n\nOn the pitching side, the team posted an ERA of 5.47 last season, which was ninth in the Pac-12. After the 2022 season, USC replaced Pitching Coach Ted Silva with former Trojan Seth Etherton.\n\n\u201cHaving Coach Etherton on staff means a three-time All-American,\u201d said senior catcher Connor Clift. \u201cHe knows what a national title looks like.\u201d\n\nAlong with the new editions, the Trojans have reliable veterans returning for another season. Junior pitchers Tyler Stromsborg and Jaden Agassi will lead the starting rotation after pitching over 60 innings each last year.\n\n\u201cOver the offseason, I gained weight just to add some strength,\u201d Stromsborg said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been focusing on a slider because I need to do a better job of putting hitters away.\u201d\n\nUSC will be without six of the nine starters in the lineup from last season. However, the Trojans retain senior Adrian Colon-Rosario in the outfield. The Puerto Rico native batted .298 with eight home runs last year. After smashing six home runs with a .363 on-base percentage last season, senior Nick Lopez will be the infield captain.\n\nThe Trojans will face a Pac-12 conference that has four ranked teams in Baseball America\u2019s Top 25 preseason list: No. 4 Stanford, No. 12 UCLA, No. 18 Oregon State and No. 20 Oregon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough conference, we know that,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe can\u2019t try to be somebody we\u2019re not. We have to play really, really good as a team. If we can do that, we\u2019ve got a chance to have success.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will open their season against Marist this Friday at Dedeaux Field at 6:30 p.m.\n```"}

After a COVID hiatus, USC\u2019s Alpha Delta chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. is once again active, and this month, they will be presenting one of their signature events that brings young professionals together to fundraise for their community.\n\nMiss Black and Gold is a scholarship pageant for outstanding young women in each chapter\u2019s community who have supported the chapter. The first Miss Black and Gold Pageant was sponsored by the National Alpha Phi Alpha Convention in New York City in 1976. Alpha Delta\u2019s six contestants will be competing on February 19, 2023 at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom for a grand prize of $3,000. Whichever contestant advances will receive the opportunity to compete at regional level in March, then nationals in June.\n\nThe contestants practice twice a week for the categories of: interview, business, athleisure, talent and evening. The six ladies competing for the crown are as follows:\n\nBrianna Claverie is a senior studying health and human sciences with a minor in health care studies. She is from the wonderful city of New Orleans, Louisiana, and is sad to be missing Mardi Gras for the pageant, but excited to be here with her sisters. She wants to be crowned Miss Black and Gold so she can help the brothers of Alpha Delta coordinate events under their national programs, such as \u201cProject Alpha,\u201d and get others involved in their mission of providing service and advocacy for our communities.\n\nSasha Lawrence is a sophomore from Brooklyn, New York studying psychology with a minor in consumer behavior. Her favorite dessert is creme brulee. If she becomes the next Miss Black and Gold she would like to further Alpha Delta\u2019s community engagement across campus and the greater South Los Angeles area using their initiatives framework. Lawrence hopes to partner with local organizations and improve the quality of life for students in K-12 and beyond, as well as their families.\n\nAaliyah Evans is a junior from the \u201cWindy City\u201d of Chicago, Illinois. Aaliyah majors in psychology, loves making deep fried Oreos and practicing self care. She hopes to use her passion for the youth and her future platform of Miss Black and Gold to further Alpha Phi Alpha\u2019s national program \u201cGo to High School, Go to College\u201d and promote education in her community.\n\nAlexandria Gee is a junior from Chicago, Illinois who studies communication with a minor in comedy performance and product design. Alexandria makes jewelry and art, dances in her free time and hopes to inspire other young women who look like her to showcase their most authentic self and realize their beauty. Gee also wants to work with Alpha Delta in creating programs that work with girls to bridge the gap between Black girls being uncomfortable around Black men. Gee thinks that this is important for children to see positive role models while also having the men show allyship to set the standard for other men to follow suit.\n\nJordan Coffer-Bryant is a junior from Washington, D.C., or \u201cChocolate City,\u201d who loves chocolate ice cream. She hopes to inspire as many young girls as she can, emphasizing that if she can do it, so can they. She wants to teach them how important it is to be comfortable in their skin and be unapologetically you.\n\nSiara Carpenter is a sophomore from Chicago, Illinois who studies journalism with a consumer behavior minor. In her free time, Siara does hair and loves to connect with the Black USC community. If chosen as Miss Black and Gold she would like to further integrate the Alpha Delta chapter into the USC and South Central community through volunteer work and outreach programs. As the author of this piece, social media coordinator and a contestant, Siara has spearheaded the Miss Black and Gold awareness campaign.\n\nThe Miss Black and Gold contestants pose for a photo. From left to right: Brianna Claverie, Sasha Lawrence, Alexandria Gee, Jordan Coffer-Bryant, Siara Carpenter and Aaliyah Evans.\n(Photo courtesy of Ravon Miles)\n\nThis year\u2019s contestants are being coached by Meegan Jumfuoh, the 2010 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign champion who went on to win not only a regional title, but also represented Illinois in the Mid-Western Regional Conference. \u201cThe Miss Black and Gold pageant brought out a level of confidence that I never knew that I had. Not only does it promote self-growth, confidence and exploring your talent, but it also creates and fosters sisterhood, friendship and networking,\u201d Jumfuoh said. \u201cWhen I knew that the Alpha Delta chapter was going to have their Miss Black and Gold pageant, it really was in my heart to reach out, as I wanted to support these young ladies who chose to go on this path for the very same reasons that I embarked on the journey 10 years ago, which was to uplift young Black women so that they can see themselves on a platform in a frame in which they\u2019re not quite used to.\u201d\n\nThe contestants have a lot of love for Jumfuoh. Contestant Brianna Claverie said that she has come more into herself \u2014 Jumfuoh has given her a home away from home. While none of the contestants are from California, they have become each other\u2019s pseudo-family over the nine weeks they have been together. The newfound community amongst the pageant court (the contestants and the brothers of Alpha Delta) means a lot to incumbent Alpha Delta President Justin Powell. \u201cThe Alphas hadn\u2019t really been present at USC for the past couple of years, so we had a lot of work to be done to really spread the message of what our fraternity was about,\u201d Powell said. While no one in the pageant had even participated in a pageant before, Powell is thankful for all of the smiles and dedication that everyone has put in. Powell intends to invest the funds they raised back into the South Central community through the local branch of their national programs.\n\nContestant Sasha Lawrence echoed Claverie\u2019s sentiments of self confidence and overcoming social anxiety in saying, \u201cI\u2019ve gained a lot of confidence and courage and I\u2019ve surprised myself. I\u2019ve shown myself that I have definitely what it takes to not only conquer my fears, but to really rise to the occasion. In the beginning, I was a little bit unsure about doing a pageant, but since doing one, I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve got a lot more courage than I thought.\u201d Lawrence and the other contestants love the sisterhood that has been formed throughout the rehearsal process saying that, \u201cMiss Black and Gold has not only built confidence, but camaraderie.\u201d\n\nMore about Alpha Phi Alpha:\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has a very long history. As the first Black fraternity, founded in 1906 at Cornell University, the seven founding men, fondly known as the seven jewels, decided that they wanted to promote brotherhood on a campus where not many people looked like them. Over the next 117 years, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. expanded into having over 900 chapters and over 290,000 members across the world. Some notable members have been Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Duke Ellington, Lionel Richie and founder W.E.B DuBois. Their colors, black and gold, have been one of the key ways to identify brothers throughout centuries all united under the motto of \u201cFirst of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All.\u201d\n\nNow, why is this important? To me, as an Alpha\u2019s daughter, I have seen the service that the brothers of Alpha Phi Alpha have put into the betterment of their communities. Food, clothes and back to school drives were just some of the things I grew up taking part in with my dad. While they gave back to their communities, I also saw brotherly love between Black men, which is often not shown or appreciated. Brotherly love and support of each other expands into making sure everyone around them is taken care of, which is why their national programs revolve around taking care of elders in the community (Brother\u2019s Keeper), registering members of the Black community to vote (A Voteless People is a Hopeless People), instilling the importance of education in young men (Go to High School, Go to College) and talking about taboo topics such as sexual health (Project Alpha). Being an Alpha Man is a lifetime commitment that starts in one\u2019s college years. The brothers of USC\u2019s Alpha Delta chapter have embodied these principles with help around South Central and USC such as their \u201cPack to School\u201d drive, where they made backpacks for at-risk students.\n\nUnity in the Black community has always been important, and the men of Alpha Phi Alpha have always looked out for their community. You don\u2019t want to miss the first Miss Black and Gold in 8 years. Tickets can be found on Alpha Delta\u2019s Instagram.\n```"}

His all-Spanish performance filled the room with a tropical ambiance as he brought out traditional Puerto Rican folk art.\n\nWhile putting on his scheduled show, the only words seen on screen were \u201csinging in non-English\u201d. Even in his acceptance speech for Best Musica Urbana Album, the closed captioning remained as \u201cspeaking non-English\u201d.\n\nBad Bunny has become the hottest Spanish-speaking sensation. Placing the charts with \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d being a top album in the Billboard 200 for 13 non-consecutive weeks and being named Spotify\u2019s most streamed artist across the globe for the third year in a row. Not only are his records selling, his two world tours in 2022 were the top-grossing tours of the year.\n\nBad Bunny\u2019s impact is global and has made Spanish music heard by everyone. By doing so, he brought recognition to Latine issues and opened doors for many. Focusing a couple of songs on his album on social issues and the current crisis in Puerto Rico. He\u2019s been praised by many for being authentic and sticking to his roots by choosing to always speak and sing in Spanish instead of reaching an American audience by speaking in English.\n\nHowever, despite his indisputable impact on music globally, his efforts have not been fully recognized in the American industry. With three Grammys under his belt and nine nominations, all his awards have been given under the Urban category. Even with his nominations, only two out of the nine have been for global lists.\n\nThe Urban category at the Grammys was said to be made for inclusivity and to highlight urban music for people of color. However, many have expressed their dislike for this category, as it prevents Black and brown artists from being nominated for bigger categories like Song or Album of the Year. Even Tyler the Creator has commented on the issue, \u201cI mean guys that look like me \u2014 do anything that\u2019s genre-bending, they always put it in the rap or urban category\u201d.\n\nThe urban category has been used by award shows to separate the growth between Black and brown artists from the rest and dilute their global impact.\n\nMany USC students also felt strongly after the 2023 Grammys ceremony. When asked about their opinions on the closed captioning provided for Bad Bunny at the 2023 Grammys, Fiorella Sosa, a freshman majoring in business administration, said, \u201cWhat is non-English \u2014 what does that even mean? It\u2019s not like the only existing language is English. I think it\u2019s just rude, disrespectful, and racist.\u201d\n\nUsing the words \u201cspeaking non-English\u201d has caused quite a controversy as it doesn\u2019t highlight \u201cnon-English\u201d speaking artists in an era where diversity should be celebrated. Other USC students expressed how powerful Bad Bunny is for Latinos and his global impact.\n\nGenesis Hernandez, a sophomore studying health and human science, shared her thoughts. \u201cI was so happy that Bad Bunny was performing; he opened the Grammys. It feels so good to get Latino representation. However, them putting that as the closed captions ... it really took us back a few steps when we were doing so good,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nNathalie Ceron, a freshman studying international relations, also spoke about Bad Bunny\u2019s impact in the genre. \u201cBad Bunny has completely transformed the way Reggaeton music is viewed by reaching mass audiences all around the world. To see the Grammys deem him as merely someone who doesn\u2019t speak English feels like they don\u2019t think he\u2019s worthy of their award,\u201d Ceron said.\n\nEven one week after the incident, opinions from other celebrities and even politicians are still rolling out. Rapper 50 Cent was quick to share his strong opinions via Instagram. In a post, he wrote, \u201cBad Bunny is bigger than everybody right now, and you can\u2019t pay for closed captions.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Rep. Robert Garcia, shared his strong opinions to CBS directly with an open letter to President and CEO George Cheeks. \u201cFor too many Spanish-speaking Americans, it felt disrespectful of our place in our shared society and of our contributions to our shared culture. For the hearing-impaired community, this failure was hurtful,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nIn this letter, he also highlighted Bad Bunny\u2019s achievements and the 12% of Latinos in the American media force. After the backlash and several days of rejecting interviews, CBS has finally spoken out. Stating that \u201cregrettably, errors were made\u201d and the efforts the company will now make for Spanish language content. Cheeks openly agreed that a bilingual live captioner should\u2019ve been used during the show, and as of now, correct captioning has been placed on the ceremony reruns.\n```"}

While she had much to say, the headlines all honed in on one topic: Apparently Brad Pitt got Love\u2019s part in \u201cFight Club\u201d rescinded because she wouldn\u2019t sell him the rights to a Kurt Cobain biopic. In hindsight, she both regrets the decision and doubles down on it. Classic Courtney Love.\n\nLove will likely be eternally remembered (read: vilified) as the widow of Kurt Cobain \u2014 but, she is also just kind of a bitch. At least, if you take the words of people she has upset, who synthesized the notion in increasingly unique ways. And after 58 years of life, there are a lot of people who had, or may still have, a grudge against her. There are even some who made art immortalizing her as a result.\n\nSome background first. This \u201cbitch\u201d was born Courtney Michelle Harrison on July 9, 1964 in Sacramento, California to her psychotherapist mother Linda Carroll and father Hank Harrison, who was both a publisher and road manager to the Grateful Dead, which makes a lot of sense if you think about it. In the custody battle following her parents\u2019 separation, her father was accused of dosing the toddler with LSD. He lost that (custody) battle. Carroll towed the young Courtney Michelle up the country to Marcola, Oregon.\n\nIn a 1995 interview with Spin Magazine, she described her upbringing: \u201cThere were hairy, wangly-ass hippies running around naked [doing] Gestalt therapy,\u201d and her mother raised her in a gender-free household with \u201cno dresses, no patent leather shoes, no canopy beds, nothing.\u201d She briefly moved to New Zealand with her mother and her third husband, but she quickly sent Courtney Michelle\u2019s ass back to Portland, Oregon to live with her second husband, who had previously adopted Courtney.\n\nAfter a shoplifting conviction at age 14 and a stint at the Hillcrest Correctional Facility, Courtney fell in love with music as a respite from her troubled life. Having been corrected, she was put in the foster care system for one year before leaving to become a topless dancer in Japan and then (after being deported) a stripper in Portland. Here is where we finally meet Courtney Love, who adopted the pseudonym to protect her anonymity during those years.\n\nLove got off to kind of a rough start with music. Front stage at a 1982 Faith No More show, then backstage at a 1982 Faith No More show, then begging to become the lead singer of Faith No More, then becoming the lead singer of Faith No More, then being quickly fired. But they never wrote any songs about her. The lost gig turned our young Love back to topless dancing, this time in Hong Kong, where she said she used heroin for the first time. Love says that same night she scammed a rich businessman for money to fly back to the U.S., but moving on \u2014 she\u2019s back. This time she continued taking gigs and developing her sense of music and fashion. The girl was just 19 and propulsed only by her desire to make it.\n\n\u201cYou got this thing that / Really makes me hot / You got a lot and more / When you get caught / You got this thing that / Follows me around / You little bitch well / I hope your insides rot\u201d \u2014 \u201cBruise Violet,\u201d Babes in Toyland\n\nWhen Love met Kat Bjelland of Babes in Toyland in 1984, she couldn\u2019t play a single instrument. They started a band anyway, eventually breaking up, but remaining friends ... acquaintances? People who know each other. The outfit was tied through Bjelland to Love, who would later move to Minneapolis where the band were based. The Babes debuted the song \u201cBruise Violet\u201d in 1992. They deny that the song and accompanying video featuring the band dressed in Courtney Love cosplay is about the singer, but I don\u2019t buy it.\n\nAccording to what drummer Lori Barbero told The Current magazine in 2015, Love was not pleasant: \u201cShe lived in my house for a little while. And I guess [Babes in Toyland bassist] Maureen [Herman] took Courtney to the airport after she stole all the money. She stayed and stayed, and then the next day she wanted me to take her to the airport. And so I drove her to the airport. She had just had some weird fight with the guy at the desk, and then she left. She said, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to L.A. and I\u2019m going to get my face done and I\u2019m going to be famous.\u2019 And then she did.\u201d\n\nSo that was kind of a dick move. But that is what is so fantastic about Love. As difficult a life as she led, she committed all of her physical and emotional energy towards one thing and got it. She reached fame and more. She had supporting roles in Alex Cox films such as \u201cSid and Nancy\u201d and \u201cStraight to Hell,\u201d led her band Hole to critical acclaim and four Grammy nominations for \u201cCelebrity Skin,\u201d and she even bagged a Golden Globe for her performance as Althea Leasure in Milo\u0161 Forman\u2019s \u201cThe People vs. Larry Flynt.\u201d She also released several solo albums and a series of manga. A true multi-hyphenate.\n\nUnfortunately, one of those hyphenates was \u201cdeeply problematic woman.\u201d She was a thief, a liar, someone who doesn\u2019t know how not to say something and worst of all, a human. Bummer.\n\n\u201cMy god sits in the back of the limousine / My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane / My god pouts on the cover of the magazine / My god is a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene\u201d \u2014 \u201cStarfuckers Inc.,\u201d Nine Inch Nails\n\nIn Trent Reznor\u2019s defense of the song \u201cStarfuckers Inc.\u201d (penned by Reznor for Nine Inch Nails, allegedly about Love and lyrics altered to play on MTV), in that 1995 Spin Magazine interview, Love said, \u201cDon\u2019t call your band Nine Inch Nails if you have a three inch one.\u201d That doesn\u2019t change the fact that this song\u2019s inclusion on Nine Inch Nails\u2019 1999 album, \u201cThe Fragile,\u201d seems to ride solely on pettiness. Even fans of the band wonder to this day how it fits within the album\u2019s concept. Love and Reznor dated for some time at some point in the 1990s. All that remains clear of their relationship is that it ended bitterly.\n\nIn Love\u2019s defense, I resent that argument about her. Love fought hard for her place in the alternative community. Hole\u2019s success in comparison to the band\u2019s peers is near unparalleled. Her lyrics resonate with the experiences of women who don\u2019t fit in. Love made quality art that is overshadowed by this association between her work and her love life. Dating Billy Corgan never got anyone a Golden Globe.\n\n\u201cShe eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak / I\u2019ve been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks / I\u2019ve been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap / I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\u201d \u2014 \u201cHeart-Shaped Box,\u201d Nirvana\n\nKurt Cobain undoubtedly saw Love for who she was, but he loved her anyway. He says so here, in \u201cHeart Shaped Box,\u201d as he acknowledges her dark side and wishes he could put a stop to it. But what\u2019s implied is that that bitchiness doesn\u2019t define her. Society turned its back on Love the moment that Cobain died, and to a certain extent I can see why she would lose all desire to match its whims as a result. She didn\u2019t even want to before.\n\nThere are many things I can\u2019t defend Courtney Love for, but being a bitch isn\u2019t one of them. What she has done \u2014 as an autistic woman, as a mother, as a widow, as a recovered addict, as any role we choose to stick Love in \u2014 is miraculously impressive. Her legacy will live in the generations of women she taught not to give a fuck. In her own words in Hole\u2019s \u201cMiss World\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m Miss world, watch me break and watch me burn / No one is listening, my friend / Now I\u2019ve made my bed, I\u2019ll lie in it / I\u2019ve made my bed, I\u2019ll die in it\u201d\n```"}

Last week, the very best figure skaters from around the world descended upon Colorado Springs to compete at the 2023 4CC.\n\nKeegan Messing, of Canada, performs in the men's short program at the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships on Thursday, Feb. 9, 2023, in Colorado Springs, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nBy Valerie Fang February 14, 2023 at 7:25 pm PST\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. The 2023 International Skating Union (ISU) Four Continents Championships took place last week at Colorado Springs\u2019 Broadmoor World Arena. As its name suggests, this annual championship features skaters from four of the five continents represented by the Olympic ring: the Americas, Asia, Oceania and Africa. Welcome to the recap of this year\u2019s 4CC.\n\nJapan and South Korea unsurprisingly dominated this year\u2019s game. Miura Kao and Sato Shun snatched the gold and bronze medals in men\u2019s singles. South Korea\u2019s Lee Haein and Kim Yelim took the top two spots in women\u2019s singles when the rising star from Sendai, Chiba Mone, won the bronze, securing her first medal in a major senior competition. The pair of skaters, Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara, also made history by bringing the first ISU Championship Pairs title to Japan.\n\nSimilar to so many other sports, recent years have marked the transition between generations for figure skating. Last week, both veteran skaters and young breakout stars put on memorable programs and even achieved new career heights. Let\u2019s take a look at the three best programs.\n\n3. Watanabe Rinka\u2019s free program (Music: \u201cJin\u201d by Yu Takami, Seiko Nagaoka, Kan Sawada) If it wasn\u2019t for the popped Lutz jump near the beginning, Watanabe probably could have medaled. However, this momentary lack of confidence didn\u2019t undermine the fact that Watanabe is one of the best young female figure skaters from Japan. Her opening triple axel had a stable axis, smooth landing and decent ice coverage, which said a lot about her jumping skills. Watanabe\u2019s choice of music and costume also helped her performance stand out by putting an emphasis on cultural representation. If Watanabe can make her jump combos even more consistent, we can expect her to score higher at Worlds next month.\n\n2. Miura Riku and Kihara Ryuichi\u2019s free skate (Music: \u201cAtlas: Two\u201d by Sleeping At Last) The Japanese pair has remained unbeatable in international competitions this season. Their long program exemplified the merging of artistic presentation and technical prowess. Music was not simply an accompaniment in their performance, rather it remained an integral part that let their hope, love and a shared deep bond shine through. Every movement and element on ice was a perfect fit for the song\u2019s melody and rhythm. What also touched me was what happened right after the end of the program. Due to the thin air in Colorado Springs, the pair collapsed on the ice but lifted each other up moments later. They gave their all and were rightfully rewarded.\n\n1. Keegan Messing\u2019s free program (Music: \u201cHome\u201d by Phillip Phillips) For those four and a half minutes, all the stars aligned and Messing owned the arena. This free skate simply brought me to tears, especially being right behind the boards clearly hearing the crisp sound of his blades gliding across the ice and seeing how his smile grew increasingly contagious as the music reached its climax. Messing channeled his love for both the sport and his family, and he was truly enjoying himself with every fiber of his being. And the authenticity of it all was what made this program emotionally engaging. Combined with his short program on Thursday, this free skate helped him win his first ISU international championship medal in his last season as a competitive figure skater.\n\nWe will see Miura, Kihara and Watanabe again soon at Worlds next month. Messing will also be there for the last competition of his amateur career. The United States\u2019 Ilia Malinin and Isabeau Levito will have their eyes on the prize, but the reigning World Champions, Uno Shoma and Sakamoto Kaori, will put in every effort to defend their titles. In short, Worlds in Saitama will feature the fiercest battles in figure skating, and we will love it.\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Going into February, the Trojans seemed like they were ready to battle. They won three of their last four, with the only loss being against No. 8 Arizona. USC kicked off the month of February with a good win over Washington State, but the Trojans performed progressively worse over the next two weeks, jeopardizing their tournament chances. The Trojans need to improve their passing and 3-point shooting if they want to secure a spot in March. Head coach Andy Enfield loves running four guards, but such a small lineup simply can\u2019t compete if its passing and 3-point shooting is subpar. But when the Trojans have addressed these issues, they\u2019ve amassed tremendous success. Take USC\u2019s 80-70 home win against Washington State, for example. USC shot 9-of-19 (47.4%) from beyond the arc and totaled 14 team assists. If a few of those deep shots didn\u2019t hit, the result would have been very different. Looking at the 80-74 home victory against Washington, USC nearly lost to a mediocre team primarily because of its poor 3-point shooting. The Trojans shot only 4-of-22 (18.2%) from deep, an unacceptable number for such a small team. Fortunately, USC displayed excellent passing and racked up 23 team assists. But against a tournament team, that won\u2019t be enough to bail the Trojans out. Unfortunately, it only gets worse from here. What happens when you combine the horrific shooting numbers seen in the game against Washington with terrible ball movement? An 18-point blowout to an Oregon team that is solid but nothing special. USC shot 4-of-16 (25%) from 3-point range and recorded a grand total of nine team assists. Fifth-year guard Drew Peterson has had games with double-digit assists, so there\u2019s no exception for the whole team to be stuck in dingle-digits Oregon doubled USC\u2019s assist numbers, and it showed on the scoreboard. The Ducks pulled out a 78-60 home victory, but the game was over by halftime when Oregon led 42-27. USC then traveled an hour north to Corvallis to face the then 9-16 Oregon State Beavers. USC was even more inefficient than they were against Washington State; they made just one of 14 (7.1%) 3-point shots and tallied seven team assists. The Trojans were horrendous in almost every way possible. Even though the Beavers struggled to get their offense going, the Trojans found even fewer answers. They lost 61-58 and are now on a two-game losing streak and fighting to make an appearance in March. When the Trojans are hot, they\u2019re fun to watch \u2013 just look at their home victory against UCLA last month. But they are remarkably inconsistent, especially when it comes to ball movement and shooting beyond the arc. And in a tournament in which nearly half the spots (32 of 68) are given to conference winners, it is pivotal that USC begins to prove itself to be a consistent team that is no joke. Currently, USC lies 64th in the NCAA\u2019s NET rankings; the Trojans need to move up this list quickly if they want to be confident in their chances to make the tournament. USC has six remaining chances in the regular season to prove itself worthy of a spot, and even a single loss could extinguish any last glimmer of hope. \u201cSCoop\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Here\u2019s a more lasting contribution you can make as the USC trustee who helped bring an end to the tortuous reign of ex-campus gynecologist George Tyndall, who stands accused of sexually assaulting hundreds of women over more than three decades at the campus health center.\n\nGo ahead and take the heat from your hyper-secretive colleagues on the university\u2019s governing board. Brave the scorn of university lawyers. Do whatever it takes to release the report revealing who is to blame for the unchecked sexual abuse and harassment that damaged so many young women students and cost the university at least $1.1 billion in settlements.\n\nYou and your board colleagues know, of course, that you promised to make the report public when you first became governing board chair. In June 2018, you told Annenberg Media: \u201cThe findings ... are going to be made public, subject to patient rights.\u201d A few months later, you gave an update on the internal investigation undertaken by the law firm, O\u2019Melveny & Myers, and pledged more would be forthcoming.\n\n\u201cThe O\u2019Melveny team has made substantial progress, and to date has interviewed over 100 witnesses and collected 4.5 million documents,\u201d you said to USC. \u201cHowever, more work needs to be done... We will have more to say on their work in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nA few months later, in April 2019, you remained a fan of transparency when asked about the investigation by the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIt\u2019s not done yet,\u201d you said. \u201cMy intent and promise was that the board and university would be transparent and I plan on living up to that promise.\u201d\n\nWhat changed your mind, Rick? In October 2020, as the lawsuits began piling up, you were interviewed under oath for nine hours by a battery of lawyers who sued USC on behalf of Tyndall\u2019s former patients. They grilled you during your deposition. You repeatedly invoked attorney-client privilege, refusing to answer questions about who bears responsibility for the three-decades of trouble at the health center.\n\nYou tried to cast your broken promises in a new light. \u201cI\u2019m sure I was a bit naive and maybe a bit too eager as a new board chair, certainly with the intent of doing the right thing and investigating what had happened and wanting to be as transparent as possible,\u201d you told the lawyers. \u201cI have never been a chair of a university before, so it was uncharted waters for me. What I knew was I wanted to be guided by what was right...And unfortunately I couldn\u2019t fulfill my promise of full transparency the way I had hoped and intended to.\u201d\n\nSounds like you caved to your transparency-averse colleagues and lawyers. (Knock.la posted a full transcript of the deposition.)\n\nYou know the right thing to do. Live up to your promises. Make public the report--and the PowerPoint presentation O\u2019Melveny lawyers gave to the board during a closed-door meeting. Everyone at USC, particularly the victims of George Tyndall, deserve to know who knew what when. We all want to know who blew off the complaints about Tyndall\u2019s behavior. Who authorized the secret payment, first reported by the Los Angeles Times, allowing Tyndall to quietly resign?\n\nYour allegiance and love for the Trojan Family--especially Trojan daughters--demand full disclosure. During your deposition, the victims\u2019 lawyers asked if you would want to see the report if your own daughter had been one of the doctor\u2019s patients. Before your lawyers could keep you from answering, you said yes.\n\n\u201cI think any parent would want to know what happened,\u201d you said, under oath. \u201cI would be no different than any other parent.\u201d\n\nRick, you can redeem yourself this Valentine\u2019s Day. Follow the example of so many other universities faced with similar crises and demand that the investigative reports be released. That\u2019s what UCLA did with its special investigative report on Dr. James Heaps who sexually assaulted patients.\n\nNone of your excuses--or USC\u2019s lawyers\u2019 excuses--stand up to scrutiny. The truth will eventually come out. Heed the advice of my nana, who told all of us growing up, \u201cYou can run with a lie. But you can\u2019t hide from the truth.\u201d```"}

Whether you want the program to generate a 5 page paper on the history of the Peloponnesian War or a quick a guideline for how to break up with a fling over text, with ChatGPT all you have to do is fill in a prompt and minutes later your text is complete. While ChatGPT might seem like a fun tool, educational institutions across the country \u2013 including the New York City Public school system and the Los Angeles Unified School District \u2013 have banned the program.\n\nI spoke with USC professors to get their perspective on use of the viral AI in the classroom. USC writing professor Mark Marino believes that programs like ChatGPT might be unavoidable as a professor.\n\nMARINO: It\u2019s just it\u2019s a reality. It\u2019s a technology that\u2019s out there in the world. And so now now we have to think about how it\u2019s going to change the way writing happens. But instead of rejecting the change, Marino\u2019s philosophy is if you cant beat, join it.\n\nMARINO:   I am interested in exploring where this might take things. In my major seminar about digital writing. I\u2019m interested in how we can use it as a creative tool. Earlier in the semester, Marino invited his students to experiment with Chatbot programs by asking AI to write their first paper of the term and discussing the failures of the program, but overall, Marino has faith in professors  working with \u2013 and not against technology in the classroom.\n\nMARINO: It is also, I think, worth taking a deep breath and being confident in human\u2019s ability to. Find ways to engage technology creatively and critically, and to take that engagement to come up with new things, new kinds of knowledge, new kinds of writing, and ones that that I think we have not yet dreamt\n\nJonathan May, a research associate in the computer science department at USC closely followed the rollout of Chabot programs. He explained that as of right now AI is not a substitute for authentic student work.\n\nMAY: And I guarantee that a well thought out paper that\u2019s coherent and like, you know, is actually trying to get at the heart of whatever is is being evaluated is not something that we\u2019re going to see today or even in the next year. May thinks that professors could potentially alter their curriculum to prevent students from abusing technology like ChatGPT.\n\nMAY: There are cases where you do not want to allow tools when you\u2019re trying to teach a particular skill that the tools are going to to replace. I would want maybe I would want to test that by having people like, write in on hand, you know, in class during a test for that, for that kind of that, that kind of thing. Though overall, like Marino he is optimistic that artificial intelligence can be used as a tool for good.\n\nMAY:   I think having tools to spark ideas is is a good thing a good thing for us to be creative and and if we use them wisely and we use them correctly, like we don\u2019t really have anything to fear about the death of humanity or the death of creativity.

Anthony Clingerman has that story.\n\nCharlotta Bass was the first African American woman to own and operate her own newspaper in the United States and ran for vice presidential candidacy years before Kamala Harris would see election. Her contributions to social progress are now being celebrated with the first \u201cCharlotta Bass Day.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Curren D. Price delivered the formal declaration at Annenberg Hall, and spoke with Annenberg Radio about the significance of Bass\u2019 accomplishments.\n\nPRICE: Well, you know the issues she fought so hard for decades ago are still relevant today. Issues about equity, about fairness, about opportunity - those are the things she was fighting for... for all citizens. Certainly she had a focus on African Americans, but they weren\u2019t the only ones she was focused on - and today we are confronted by many of the same issues and problems. So I think it\u2019s important that we recognize her as a real trailblazer, as a pioneer... as a hero.\n\nPrice also discussed the importance of the new Charlotta Bass Journalism & Justice Lab at USC Annenberg and the need to build upon Bass\u2019s legacy.\n\nPRICE: It\u2019s a way to use these tools in a way that shows how we can be creative, we can be inventive, and we can be persistent. The goals that she fought for, I think, are still important - and the interpretation that young people have on how to achieve those results I think are going to be very exciting. And so we want to encourage our young people to do all they can.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Anthony Clingerman.\n```"}

Here\u2019s how college students express their love despite the distance.\n\nBy Sasha Backus\nFebruary 14, 2023 at 4:59 pm PST\n\nHookup culture is in and commitment is out for many college students this Valentine\u2019s Day, but what about those in long-distance relationships? Do they express their love in an old-school fashion? Looking through the lens of the five love languages: words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time and physical touch, there are many different ways you can still show love for your partner, even with a physical barrier.\n\nWords of Affirmation\nMany couples find that words of affirmation are an essential way to express their love to their partner in a long-distance relationship, as it can be done in various ways. Elysa Hernandez, a freshman at USC, said that her boyfriend and her have \u201cbeen adapting to words of affirmation\u201d as their new love language while being long-distance. She describes communication as extremely important and said that they always give \u201ceach other updates and make time to call at least once a day.\u201d For my girlfriend and me, a gift that includes words of affirmation is sending a Venmo payment with a sweet message. The money could go towards a Valentine\u2019s Day Facetime dinner date, sweet treat or delicious beverage for her to sip on throughout the day. While Venmo payments are our modern way of showing that we are still head over heels for each other, as opposed to sending a handwritten card with cash in the mail, other college students opt for taking the old-school postal route to profess their affections.\n\nGifts\nAh, Valentine\u2019s Day, the commodification of love. Do couples take the cheesy direction or the thoughtful approach? Many couples that I spoke with find that a little bit of both makes the perfect Valentine\u2019s Day gift. Some people find that cliches such as teddy bears, chocolates, and heart necklaces truly depend on the person but oftentimes make a charming gift. Some students turn away from these clich\u00e9s and have found more unique alternatives. Lego flowers compared to live flowers are becoming increasingly popular, but many students have mixed thoughts on which is a better gift to give and receive. While some of my peers find that handcrafted origami flowers serve as an exemplary display of devotion, one student questioned what defines a gift as being \u2018thoughtful.\u2019 Dean Woods, a freshman at USC studying computer science and applied and computational mathematics, pointed out that \u201cit\u2019s more work, so it depends if that equals being more thoughtful,\u201d but also vocalized that he feels \u201creal flowers are nicer.\u201d Sylvie Bass, a freshman studying psychological and brain sciences at UCSB, shared that she believes it is more thoughtful as she \u201chad a friend that made one thousand paper cranes for her boyfriend\u201d and was thoroughly impressed. This may seem like a very high bar to reach when thinking about gifts for your partner, however, any gift that will mean something to your partner will be perfectly thoughtful.\n\nActs of Service\nWhile many couples can find it challenging to perform acts of service while not being in the same physical space, several couples have managed to, despite all odds. Michelle Abruzzese, a freshman studying biology at Clark University, says that making a playlist serves as a vessel of her love for her partner. A playlist of lovey-dovey songs that remind you of your partner is the perfect expression of love, especially if actions speak louder than words for your sweetheart. For all long-distance couples, virtual date nights are essential for maintaining that closeness while being so far apart. Jennah Al-Hachem, a freshman studying biomedical engineering at Tulane, and her boyfriend, Sky Bates, who attends CU Boulder and is studying molecular biology and business, have found that virtual date nights, specifically virtual escape rooms, are very special for them. Taking the time to plan a fun date night, despite being virtual, for your partner is the perfect above-and-beyond act that could make this year\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day extra special.\n\nQuality Time\nThe overall consensus of the couples I spoke to, despite those who are able to see each other in the near future, is that FaceTime or Zoom is the plan for Valentine\u2019s Day. Gaby Malk, a student at UCSB, said that \u201cvirtual dates\u201d are how she connects with her long-distance boyfriend. Bella Wagner, who goes to UCSB, and her boyfriend Elijah Sasevich, who attends the University of Utah, plan to call and play a video game together. Wagner explained that despite not having the physical touch aspect, they both \u201creally appreciate time together.\u201d No matter the form in which the quality time takes place, whether it\u2019s playing games, watching shows or talking on the phone, they manage to feel closeness with each other. Gabe Berger, a student at UCSB, and his girlfriend Sofia Roberts, a student at Arizona State University, sent packages to each other so that on Valentine\u2019s Day, they could open the gifts they sent over FaceTime. Whether it be a video call for dinner, a simple chat about their day, a gaming session or a gift exchange over the phone, these couples can still cherish their time together, even if it is not in person.\n\nPhysical Touch\nPhysical touch is, quite obviously, the most challenging love language to express in a long-distance relationship, according to many couples I spoke to for this story. Hannah Nightingale said that she and her partner, Austin Kingston, \u201care very physically affectionate people\u201d and that they are not able to express that affection for one another when they are almost 3,000 miles apart. Nightingale said that in its place, they have dinner together and send each other letters to help soothe that longing for each other. My girlfriend and I found that plush toys are the solution to all issues related to physical touch. I got us two cat plushies, a pink one for me and a green one for her. Whenever one of us is sad or needs a hug, we tell each other to grab the stuffed animal and give it a squeeze. Despite the cuddly toy not quite comparing to the paradise that is receiving a warm embrace from the person you love most, it truly does come pretty close. If cat stuffies are not your speed, a blanket could also suffice. While declarations of infatuation when it comes to gifts and love languages truly do depend on the couple (and each person specifically), each of the couple\u2019s stories show that distance truly does not make the day any less special. Sylvie Bass said that \u201cevery day with my partner is a holiday,\u201d and through recognizing that, any person in a long-distance relationship can celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day with the most incredible tenderness.\n```"}

If you\u2019re a last-minute planner looking for a budget-friendly outing, you\u2019ve come to the right place!\n\nBy Janey Zhang\nFebruary 14, 2023 at 4:47 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s only 26 days till spring break! From cities to mountains to sunny beaches, USC students are planning out this vacation in full swing. Janey Zhang has the story.\n\nWinter doldrums got you down? Good news! Spring break is approaching sooner than you think. With only several weeks left, USC students have already come up with all kinds of getaways. Let\u2019s first hear what they plan to do over the break.\n\nSpending this one-week vacation back home is definitely the plan for many students. Colonel Rowley, a junior accounting major, is going back home and revisiting all the familiar places.\n\nROWLEY: I\u2019m from Houston, Texas, so I\u2019ll be flying back there for the whole week. Honestly, I try to maximize my time at home, but also I have my car there, so I\u2019ll probably go to all my favorite cafes and just drive around because I don\u2019t have my car here, so I miss it.\n\nSince a lot of college kids are busy with internships or jobs, they might just stay local. Junior Human Bio major Jordan Williams is making the most of her break, working while also taking time off with friends.\n\nWILLIAMS: I have a job here, so I\u2019m just going to be in L.A. and I think a few of my friends are staying around so we might hang out. I like Manhattan Beach a lot because they have a lot of cute cafes and like Santa Monica and Culver City, too. So we might go to there.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t come up with a plan yet, here are three destinations near Los Angeles that are worth exploring. What\u2019s more, totally budget-friendly.\n\nIf you are considering somewhere near, Orange County is the right place for adventure and exploration. Just forty minutes away from LA by car or by train, it is a land of beautiful beaches. You can join watching trips to see the numerous species of whales around the area at Newport Beach, take a walk on the pier along Huntington Beach, or catch an enchanting California sunset at Laguna Beach. The Orange County Museum of Art is also worth paying a visit to. Two new shows will open in February, so take the chance to check them out.\n\nSpring is one of the best times in California because of the mild and sunny weather. Enjoy nature at Bommer Canyon. It is just forty miles away from downtown. Refresh yourself by going on a great and easy two-hour hike. Aside from hiking, trails are also available for mountain biking and horseback riding. Outdoor enthusiasts can always find pleasure in strolling past oak and sycamore groves.\n\nAlready feeling the heat? Then a trip to Mammoth Mountain would be a great escape. The drive time is approximately five hours from Los Angeles. This ski resort has a wide range of tracks to offer, from steep chutes to wide-open bowls. You can find abundant beginner-friendly lifts as well as challenging expert trails here. The Mammoth Pass is an affordable price of 73 dollars.\n\nNo matter how they\u2019re spending their time off, students are counting down the days until March 12th - the start of spring break for USC!\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I am Janey Zhang.\n```"}

The holiday has a connotation as only being for couples, but anyone, single or taken, can celebrate it. This year, as I am happily celebrating a single V-day with my girls, I want to highlight the importance of self-love. I\u2019ve written a list full of tips in the form of a poem. Hopefully, my rhymes offer you solid advice on how to spend your time.\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue, I\u2019m single this Valentine\u2019s Day but I won\u2019t boo hoo. You\u2019ll want to be outside, be sure to wear sunscreen so you don\u2019t fry. Get some paint and set up somewhere quaint. Getting outside is one of the best ways to express self-love. It\u2019ll be warm and sunny so soak in that nice weather. If you\u2019re like me, painting will be the perfect activity to keep you busy. Who doesn\u2019t love creating something that\u2019s all their own?\n\nMy favorite way to celebrate is putting on a cute outfit. Then, all you have to do is walk around and get compliments. Dress in a manner that brings you joy. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have actual Valentine\u2019s Day plans or not. Don yourself in red and pink. I bought the cutest heart-clad sweater and I\u2019m planning on pairing it with my heart bag.\n\nFind yourself a little nook and read a book. I\u2019m currently reading \u201cThe Proposal,\u201d hopefully it has a better ending than the Cotton Bowl. Reading is one of the best ways to take a break from everything that\u2019s going on. You get transported into the world of ink and paper. If you\u2019re into romance and want to support Black authors, I suggest reading books by two of my favorite authors, Jasmine Guillory and Bolu Babalola.\n\nCelebrate with your friends and watch movies until the night ends. This is a Galentine\u2019s Day must. Even though I had a Valentine last year, we both celebrated with our friends. My roommates and I watched \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d and sang along with every single song.\n\nWant to get that heart pumping? Go to the gym and have your music bumping. Spring break is right around the corner so, keep working out and maintaining your physical health goals. Spotify has plenty of energetic workout playlists. My personal favorite is Workout Latino.\n\nBuy yourself a present, it\u2019ll make your day more pleasant. To quote Donna Meagle and Tom Haverford from \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d \u201ctreat yo self.\u201d You deserve it. If you see a cute necklace, treat yo\u2019 self. If those chocolates look good, treat yo\u2019 self. If someone\u2019s selling cute clothes, treat yo\u2019 self. Whatever will make you happy, go ahead and get it. Don\u2019t limit yourself just because you wish someone else bought it for you.\n\nGo to Trader Joe\u2019s and buy some flowers, they\u2019ll smell good for hours. You. Deserve. Your. Flowers. So, get those roses or lilies. They\u2019ll make your space bright and fill you with happiness. And for my imaginative people out there, if you carry around flowers on Valentine\u2019s Day, people will think someone gave them to you.\n\nBake and cook until you\u2019re content, share it with your friends so you don\u2019t lament. Making a meal for yourself and your friends is so fulfilling. There are plenty of recipes out there so feel free to try something new. There\u2019s a reason why Elizabeth Gilbert ate, prayed and loved.\n\nIf you daydream like me, sit in the Village and wait for a cutie. I personally believe that my life is a movie. If you do too, one of the tropes you know is going to happen is that a stranger will notice you from across the room and profess their love for you. Because why wouldn\u2019t they? One of the best places to sit still and look pretty while also being mysterious is the Village. So, make sure you\u2019re wearing that cute fit from #2, it\u2019ll come in handy.\n\nIf your bestie ditches you for their boo, find out where they\u2019re going and crash it too. Homies come first, so it\u2019s my belief that crashing your friends\u2019 date is fine. They\u2019re gonna have to get used to you both being in a package deal. But I will give the boo bonus points if they hang out with the homies afterward. Remember what the iconic Spice Girls said, \u201cif you wanna be my lover / You gotta get with my friends.\u201d\n\nValentine\u2019s Day, Galentine\u2019s Day, February 14th; it\u2019s a day that you can celebrate in many ways.\n```"}

These terms attempt to embrace the various identities of the community, yet ironically divide us more and more as new terms arise. (Illustration by Emanuel Rodriguez)\n\nBy Julia Zara, Maddy Brown, Brooklyn Blasscyk, and Tyler Pak\n\nFebruary 14, 2023 at 12:40 pm PST\n\nThe Latine Student Assembly, formerly known as the Latinx Student Assembly, has ceased using the term \u201cLatinx\u201d in its title. Two student publications on campus, Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media, discuss their policies regarding word usage and inclusion.\n\nMelissa Ayala, the assistant director of LSA, said in an email that the decision to switch the term \u201cLatinx\u201d with \u201cLatine\u201d had been in the works since last semester, after a newsletter sent within the club showed that students felt there was a lack of inclusivity of the Spanish language in the club\u2019s programming.\n\n\u201cWe felt that it was important to be advocates for their voices and concerns,\u201d Ayala said. \u201cStudents also felt that the term Latinx was outdated and left out native Spanish speakers.\u201d\n\nThe LSA is one of 10 cultural student assemblies that operates under the programming branch of the Undergraduate Student Government. An umbrella organization that provides funding and assistance to about 20 other registered clubs, LSA made the shift to better reflect the diversity of the Latinx student community at USC \u2013 which makes up about 15% of the student population.\n\nWhile the name change has yet to be updated on the campus engagement platform EngageSC, the LSA recently changed its Instagram handle to reflect the shift.\n\nAfter the LSA announced its name change, the Daily Trojan followed suit, updating its style guide to reflect the term \u201cLatine,\u201d over \u201cLatinx.\u201d\n\nChristina Chkarboul, an associate managing editor at the Daily Trojan, said that after having a discussion between editors, the student newspaper made an official change to their style guide to reflect LSA\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the campus group that sees itself as representing the Latine student community at USC, if that\u2019s the term that they would prefer to use to represent and identify themselves as,\u201d said Chkarboul, \u201cthen it only made sense that we here at the Daily Trojan also adopt that change.\u201d\n\nMarlize Duncan, the leader of the Annenberg Media Equity Board, said that on Wednesday, the board will be discussing the newsroom\u2019s overall shift in terminology following LSA\u2019s change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just always tended to use the term Latinx because the USC population at large is used to that term,\u201d Duncan said. She added that because Annenberg Media\u2019s policy already includes using the identifier \u201cLatine,\u201d the real change would be telling student journalists to use \u201cLatine\u201d as the main identifying word in the newsroom.\n\nAccording to Annenberg Media\u2019s guide for equitable reporting, \u201cLatinx and Latine are gender-neutral terms that can be used instead of Latina or Latino. Follow the person\u2019s preference. Use a more specific identification when possible, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, Brazilian or Mexican American.\u201d\n\nHence, at Annenberg Media, the Latine Student Assembly will be referred to as such, not the previously known Latinx Student Assembly.\n\nFurther meetings will be held to accurately represent the Latinx community in reporting, including discussions with student editors at D\u00edmelo \u2013 USC\u2019s only Latinx-focused student news outlet. D\u00edmelo often references the Cultural Competence Handbook from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists for additional guidance.\n\nMaria Robles, an editor at D\u00edmelo, said that while she personally didn\u2019t mind using the term \u201cLatinx,\u201d she recognizes LSA\u2019s decision to switch.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the change, I\u2019ve always been neutral when it came to Latinx out of respect for those who identify as the term,\u201d Robles said. \u201cSo I personally don\u2019t mind the change, but I understand that it may make people more comfortable to use Latine over Latinx.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center, about 25% of U.S. adults have heard the term Latinx. Meanwhile, only 3% of them self-identify with the term.\n\nAllan Lopez, an adjunct journalism professor at USC Annenberg and producer at KTLA5, said that the conversations student organizations are having about language and self-identification reflect the nuance of communities themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because not only is the use of language changing, society has changed. We\u2019re also changing as a group, and we\u2019re constantly morphing,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many layers to this topic in general, and it\u2019s important that everyone is heard from and counted and represented.\u201d\n\nHe added that handbooks and style guides are not set in stone.\n\n\u201c[The Annenberg Media] handbook...it\u2019s a living document,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cAs student organizations, we need to adapt, we need to be flexible to move closer to making everyone feel included.

And which closers will remain as reliable sources of saves as the year goes on?\n\nJacob deGrom struck out 102 batters in 64.1 innings last season as New York Mets starting pitcher. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza February 13, 2023 at 8:28 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe Strikeout\u201d is a column by Diego Ynzunza dedicated to all things fantasy baseball. Welcome to week two of The Strikeout. This week, I\u2019ll be discussing some pitchers I\u2019m looking to target in drafts. Keep in mind that starting/relief pitching this year is as volatile as ever, so you want to get as much surefire production as possible.\n\nBeginning with starters, here are my top 10 pitchers that I believe will produce similar results to each other: Jacob DeGrom Corbin Burnes Spencer Strider Sandy Alcantara Gerrit Cole Justin Verlander Aaron Nola Max Scherzer Brandon Woodruff Shohei Ohtani\n\nThe two exceptions would be Jacob DeGrom and Shohei Ohtani. Looking at DeGrom first, I\u2019m ecstatic about the opportunity to get him in drafts this year. His NFC ADP is 31 as of now, and I think that as spring training rolls around and we get reports of him healthy and throwing consistently in the high 90s again, that will only rise. DeGrom is a generational talent. He came back last year and struck out 102 guys in 64.1 innings. His K% of 42.7 was down a bit from 2021, but still above his career norms from 2020 and before.\n\nThe only issue is injuries. If he\u2019s able to stay healthy, he will be the best pitcher in baseball. I worry about his ability to sustain another 200-inning season \u2014 something he hasn\u2019t done since 2019 \u2014 especially with his focus on maintaining a high effort throughout the entirety of his starts. He was in the 99th percentile last year of all MLB pitchers in fastball velocity. In 2019, he averaged 96.9 mph on his fastball, whereas in 2020-2022 he averaged above 98.5.\n\nAgain, I still believe that he has another high percentile outcome in him, and I will be betting in drafts that this will be the year he is able to put it all together and perform at an MVP level as a starting pitcher.\n\nWith Ohtani, the reservations I have are in his workload. I just don\u2019t believe that it is sustainable for him to be hitting and pitching the way he has been. So far, since he\u2019s committed to doing both full-time, he hasn\u2019t sustained any major injuries. However, I have a hard time believing that an injury isn\u2019t in his future.\n\nTo anyone else who is willing to take the risk at his NFC ADP of 9, by all means, I hope he thrives on your team. But if I\u2019m going to take him there as my first pick, I need to have more reassurance that he will safely be able to accumulate stats throughout the year, and I just don\u2019t see that happening \u2014 especially with the news of his rest days being limited even more this year.\n\nLooking into the mid-rounds, three guys I\u2019m looking to target are Zac Gallen, Dustin May and Nick Lodolo. Gallen is a flat-out stud. In 184 innings last year, he struck out 192 guys with a 2.54 ERA. While his xERA (3.17) says that there could be some regression coming, his draft cost of being the 32nd pitcher off the board and 74th overall means that you can wait on a guy like him.\n\nI believe he will have similar production to guys going 15 or more picks earlier, like Shane Bieber and Zach Wheeler. He is also above average in Stuff, Pitching and Location +, according to Eno Sarris\u2019 Stuff + model. I also have full confidence in the D-backs pitching coach, Brent Strom. Strom spent years leading the Astros\u2019 pitching staff, and was at the forefront of transforming the careers of guys like Framber Valdez, Cristian Javier and others.\n\nMay is coming off of Tommy John surgery, but the Dodgers could really use a pitcher like him in their rotation. Currently, he is being drafted as the 62nd pitcher off the board, as an SP3/4. While I think management will handle him with kid gloves to an extent, I believe that if he performs well at the beginning of the season, they will give him a longer leash as the year goes on and can thus return even higher value than SP3/4.\n\nYou can expect one IL stint, especially since he is less than a year removed from returning after his Tommy John. However, when he\u2019s on the mound, May is electric. He has a 115 Stuff + from Sarris\u2019 model and gets nasty movement on all of his pitches. His ERA of 4.50 last year in only 30 innings prompted an xERA of 3.67 \u2014 I expect there to be some improvement in that area.\n\nI also believe there\u2019s an opportunity for May to decrease his sinker usage. It seems that batters are sitting on that pitch, as it\u2019s the one he throws most often. However, it also gets fewer whiffs and gets hit the hardest out of any of his pitches. The xSLG on his sinker last year was .479, as well as an xWOBA of .368 \u2014 numbers that are drastically higher than those of his other pitches.\n\nI think a combination of getting stronger and healthier, having an offseason to prepare, as well as a potential decrease in sinker usage, can lead to May returning SP2 value.\n\nAs you can see, there is a trend in the players I\u2019m talking about today \u2014 they all feature electric stuff. Nick Lodolo is no different. His K% of 29.7 last year was 7 points higher than the MLB average of 22.1. He can get whiffs and will rack up strikeouts for you this year. In 103.1 innings last year, he racked up 131 K\u2019s.\n\nHe sports a 117 Stuff+ from Sarris\u2019 model, and well below the league average in xBA and xSLG last year. With an increased workload, I think he can return close to SP2 value as the 54th pitcher off the board, currently around SP3 value.\n\nThe big problem for Lodolo last year was walks. But when you dig into the numbers, you see that his command only got better as the year went on. In fact, from April to September, his WHIP improved each month. As he gets more comfortable in the big leagues, as well as with another offseason to prepare, I can see him as a prime breakout candidate and someone who could easily be drafted in the top 100 of next year\u2019s draft.\n\nI want to touch a bit on relief pitchers, specifically which guys I\u2019m counting on for reliable saves this year. To start off, just by principle, I\u2019m not touching the players that are going in the top 50 of NFBC drafts. This includes Edwin Diaz, Emmanuel Clase, Josh Hader and Jordan Romano. Relief pitchers are extremely volatile. If I\u2019m going to spend a top-50 pick on a closer, I need every assurance that they will give me 30+ saves and keep their job for the entirety of the season.\n\nI see issues with all four of these guys, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable taking them at their asking price. I have three main players I\u2019m targeting for saves this year \u2014 Felix Bautista, Ryan Helsley and Carlos Est\u00e9vez.\n\nAfter the trade deadline last July, Bautista rattled off 14 saves to end the season. His strikeout numbers are wicked, as he gets whiffs 53.3% of the time he throws it. While he does sport some small walk issues, he will have a long leash, as Baltimore is not expected to be at the top of the AL East.\n\nI see him racking up 25+ saves, with a sub-3 ERA and a number of strikeouts comparable to the guys going in the top 50. Helsley is a flamethrower who I believe will keep the Cardinals\u2019 closer job throughout the year. His xWOBA, xSLG and xERA were all in the top 1% in the league last year.\n\nHe has all the traits of a top closer, including big strikeout numbers. The only issue I could see is if the Cardinals decide to make their closing situation a timeshare with Helsley and fellow flamethrower Giovanny Gallegos. Last year, Helsley got seven of his 19 saves in September, which leads me to believe that they will have more faith in him to be their go-to ninth-inning guy.\n\nAnother guy I would keep an eye out for is Carlos Est\u00e9vez, the new Angels closer. I see Est\u00e9vez really thriving as he is finally able to escape the horrors of Coors Field. The tools he carries with him should help him keep the closer job and rack up saves \u2014 in spite of the Angels\u2019 poor track record of developing pitching.\n\nNext week, The Strikeout will preview the first/third base positions. \u201cThe Strikeout\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

If not, don\u2019t worry \u2014 it seems he missed a lot of us. Valentine\u2019s Day is meant to be filled with love and happiness, but it\u2019s not for everyone. Students around USC have mixed feelings about the holiday. Many see it as a marketing scheme, some question its inclusivity and others simply haven\u2019t secured a boo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love Valentine\u2019s Day if I had a girlfriend. But I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, so I don\u2019t love Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d said freshman Matthew Speier. Opinions on the holiday around campus seem to echo Speier\u2019s.\n\nClaire Kim, a junior majoring in accounting, addresses the role that social media plays in her perception of Valentine\u2019s Day. \u201cI definitely think that social media can push people into more of a negative headspace if that\u2019s where they\u2019re starting from,\u201d said Kim. \u201cIf they\u2019re feeling lonely about missing out on Valentine\u2019s Day, definitely seeing all the people post their flowers and gifts and dates on social media can be a little hurtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a capitalist scam,\u201d said Kim. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure corporations made it so they could sell candy and stuff.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, many students are finding their own meanings for the day. Emmy Li, a junior majoring in psychology, doesn\u2019t prioritize the pursuit of a significant other for Valentine\u2019s Day. Rather, she believes it\u2019s not in the best interest of others to use the holiday solely to find that special someone.\n\n\u201cSome people are actively looking, and I understand this [Valentine\u2019s Day] is a good opportunity to do so,\u201d said Li. \u201cBut honestly, I think if it\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s going to happen, and forcing it isn\u2019t my favorite thing.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, native Floridian, now LA resident, Daniel Harrison, shares many of the same sentiments as Li. To him, this infamous day of love can be highlighted in different ways. \u201cI think our obsession with romance during the holiday maybe doesn\u2019t capture the full scope of all the variants of love that exist. Give some flowers to your mom, call up your friend and just tell them that you love them. That\u2019s still love,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nIf you\u2019re still single come Tuesday, we\u2019re sorry, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Ria Shah, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, explains the value of platonic relationships on Valentine\u2019s Day. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t really see February 14 as a special day, but I know my friends and I mutually appreciate and love each other, and that\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d said Shah.\n\nFreshman Liz Allen said singledom isn\u2019t an obstacle to having fun. She believes Valentine\u2019s Day is for the girls. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Galentine\u2019s,\u201d Allen said, in reference to an adapted Valentine\u2019s celebrating friendship. \u201cYou know, you gotta do something on the day.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a dinner date scheduled and are looking for something to do, there are many Valentine\u2019s Day events being held at and around USC.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anything at all, but if I were to find something, then I would love to know,\u201d Speier said.

Demonstrators stood in solidarity with the people of Iran and rallied against the human rights violations and mistreatment of women occurring in the country.\n\nSarah Kahn has the story. On Saturday, tens of thousands of people gathered outside Los Angeles City Hall to protest the Iranian regime on the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Attendees used the protest as an opportunity to express their distaste for the Iranian government while simultaneously showcasing their solidarity with the people of Iran.\n\nThis demonstration is one of many that has rallied against the Iranian government\u2019s treatment of women. These protests have pushed courageous women to the frontline of the cause. One of these women is Mercedeh, an attendee of the protest who prefers to have her last name redacted for safety reasons. She describes the value of going to the protest and showing support to the Iranian people across the globe.\n\nMercedeh: To me, it was more like just the solidarity, right? The people coming together and letting the people in Iran know that we\u2019re here. We understand what you guys are going through and we\u2019ll support you whatever you guys want, because you\u2019re the one paying the price.\n\nAlthough Mercedeh lives in California, she still holds a strong connection to Iran, explaining that she attended the protest in part due to her strong feelings for the country.\n\nMercedeh: Why I personally was there is because I have a very strong nationalistic feeling towards it. And I feel terrible about the situation that the people of Iran are going through right now.\n\nSepideh, who asked we only use her first name, was another protest attendee. She believes that this solidarity should be focused on pursuing human rights, an ideal she thinks has not been prioritized in recent years. Sepideh sees Iran as a country that once had incredible potential to advance into a first-world country but now has had this potential stripped away.\n\nSepideh: I just think human rights has been kind of pummeled over. I mean I see it over here. Obviously it\u2019s over there. And Iran is considered like a quote unquote third world country. But my goodness, it was so forward thinking. So many people were on their way to really get that country to become a first world country and it was very capable of doing that, being that, it just didn\u2019t happen. So I think human rights is a huge thing and true democracy.\n\nFor Sepideh, the heart of the protest lies in coming together. Her mother, who immigrated to the United States at 19 years old, attended the protest, showing the multi-generational breadth of the cause.\n\nSepideh: It was pretty emotional, I have to say. Like even my mom to came to this, you know, she\u2019s like 77, 78 years old. It was it was powerful.\n\nSaturday\u2019s protest showcases the vast support for the people of Iran across the world. Many have gathered in cities across the United States in recent weeks to make clear their desire for a regime change in Iran. Despite the distance between California and Iran, protesters such as Mercedeh and Sepideh exemplify how far-reaching this movement is.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sara Kahn.\n```"}

Shepard)\n\nBy Jack Smith, Dana Hammerstrom, and Nina Moothedath\nFebruary 13, 2023 at 5:45 pm PST\n\nAs the weather gets warmer, fire season approaches. You would think the unprecedented rain would be a good thing, but it can also mean a more formidable fire season. Dana Hammerstrom spoke with an expert about how California residents and even us students can prepare for wildfire season.\n\nWhile recent rainfall in California may have your worries eased about the upcoming fire season, don\u2019t get too comfortable. Despite the nearly 32 trillion gallons of water dumped on California over a three-week period in January, fire season has the potential to be even more dangerous and damaging this year.\n\nAccording to recent reports from major media outlets, including the LA Times and The Guardian, one product of the storm was an abundance of new vegetation -- vegetation that will turn into match sticks once it dies and dries out in the warmer spring and summer months. Rainy relief in January comes at a cost for California natives, and, according to Cal Fire battalion chief Isaac Sanchez, this is the new reality for our increasingly destroyed environment.\n\nExperts still say that it is too early to predict, however it\u2019s never too early to prepare. Rebecca Miller, an affiliated postdoctoral scholar with the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West, as well as a Triple A fellow with the U.S. Department of State, shared why it is so important to be ready for fire season before it begins.\n\nRebecca Miller: The best time to be thinking about wildfires is always now, before a wildfire comes close to your community. That could involve checking in with your local fire department to better understand what your risk hazards are in your community. It also might involve looking at some of the historic smoke patterns that we\u2019ve seen over just the past few years. But the first priority is understanding what your risk is and then from there, working to mitigate it.\n\nMany of the biggest wildfires that have affected California in recent years have been forest fires, and while Los Angeles county contains a majority of urban areas, residents must prepare for fire season nonetheless.\n\nRebecca Miller: Los Angeles is definitely a lot more urban than some of the other places that we see experiencing some severe wildfires in California... But it\u2019s also important to remember that Los Angeles County has had its fair share of fires, even recently... Fire isn\u2019t something that Los Angeles has never seen before. In fact, its not uncommon to have major wildfires in Los Angeles County or even in the surrounding areas like Ventura or Santa Barbara counties.\n\nDespite not being home or land owners, college students can also do their part to prevent potential wildfire damage.\n\nRebecca Miller: College students are probably going to be most affected by potential smoke, in which case, being prepared, whether that\u2019s with air filters or having access to a clean air facility which will have better air quality... is again going to be your first step towards mitigating that risk.\n\nMore California fire prevention information can be found on www.fire.ca.gov\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Dana Hammerstrom.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File)\n\nBy Alexis Lara February 13, 2023 at 5:01 pm PST\n\nMajor League Baseball\u2019s offseason is spent by teams cleaning house, bulking up rosters and appeasing star players. Now just weeks away from Opening Day, the Dodgers and Angels have each decorated their lineups in hopes of capturing that elusive October ring.\n\nThe Dodgers are no strangers to the blistering heat of spring training in Glendale, Ariz. After a few offseason signings, their already stacked roster just became that much more attractive.\n\nThe first area of focus for the Dodger management was the pitching staff. While Chavez Ravine is home to world-class Cy Young talent, the rotation was under construction this offseason. Right-handed pitcher Walker Buehler was always an arm the Dodgers could count on, but since undergoing Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career, Buehler might not get the chance to step on a mound for the entire 2023 season.\n\nTo hopefully fill the spot of a right-handed starter left open by Buehler, the Dodgers signed Noah Syndergaard to a one-year $13 million contract. Syndergaard, a former pitcher from the Phillies, struggled in 2022, matching the level of his throwing to what it was before his own Tommy John surgery in 2021. Although he had to rely more on the other pitches in his arsenal besides his fastball, Syndergaard still proved to be one of the most competitive pitchers in the MLB.\n\nOnce a force to be reckoned with, Syndergaard has faith the Dodgers will help him return to the pitcher he once was.\n\nIn recent months, the Dodgers re-signed pitchers Clayton Kershaw, Julio Urias and Dustin May to one-year extensions, along with Tony Gonsolin who signed for the next two seasons. Kershaw has held a consistent spot in the starting rotation since his debut in 2008. A player who hasn\u2019t had such a steady rise to success due to injury, May, is expected to finally fill the shoes that were once set for him.\n\nWhile he spent most of the 2021 season recovering from Tommy John surgery, Dodgers have a respectable track record with rehabbing players to their original form. If May can repeat the strong major league starts he showed in 2021 with the 2.74 ERA he once accomplished, the Dodgers pitching rotation will be an absolute terror for batters in the box.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 2020 first round draft pick, Bobby Miller, is a left-handed pitcher flirting with a major league debut. While he was invited to spring training as a non-roster player, Miller has yet to make the starting rotation despite proving his readiness at the 2022 Freeway Series. Miller threw three scoreless innings, retiring the first three batters he faced. Notably, one of the two strikeouts belonged to powerhouse hitter Shohei Ohtani.\n\nDespite having a significantly smaller payroll than their L.A. counterpart, the Angels also made some crucial acquisitions this offseason. Even with having two of the biggest names in baseball on their roster, Mike Trout and Ohtani, the Angels finished the 2022 season third in the AL West. Coming up short of making the postseason for almost a decade now prompted Angels management into some notable offseason signings.\n\nStarting off strong, the Angels signed left-handed pitcher, Tyler Anderson, in November. Anderson is only moving a freeway away from his former team, but his absence is a huge hit to the Dodgers\u2019 pitching rotation. The $39 million three-year deal signed is single-handedly the best decision Angeles management made this offseason. A roster that desperately needed another reliable pitcher found one in Anderson, who is coming off of one of the best seasons of his professional career with a 2.57 ERA.\n\nWith the future of star player Ohtani up in the air in 2024, the clubhouse can at least expect reliable pitching out of Anderson for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother pitching addition for the 2023 Angels comes in the form of reliever and potential closer Carlos Est\u00e9vez. Est\u00e9vez, who finished the 2022 season with two saves and a 3.74 ERA with the Colorado Rockies, signed a two-year $13.5 million contract. When compared to the stats of Ohtani or Anderson, Est\u00e9vez falls short. However, the potential of his arm makes the signing worthwhile for the Angels.\n\nPitchers are not the only movement Angels made to their roster this offseason. Of the over $200 million spent during this record-breaking payroll in the history of the franchise, $39 million was spent on Hunter Renfroe. Former outfielder for the Milwaukee Brewers, Renfroe is a consistent bat in the lineup and a skilled defender. Players who have just as much impact hitting as they do defensively is key in building an Angels roster to break through their postseason drought.\n\nThis week all players, whether they are wearing a new jersey or sticking with the old, will report to spring training to officially start the 2023 season. There will be a slightly different start to this year as players will leave for the World Baseball Classic in March. Once the 29 players the Dodgers and Angels send to the WBC return, teams will begin locking in their starting lineups for the regular season. New additions will look to find a spot in these lineups and prospects will look to prove themselves on the big stage. Only time will tell if each team\u2019s offseason decisions translate into division titles.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Josie Lepe)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nFebruary 13, 2023 at 2:11 pm PST\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest men\u2019s college basketball headlines. In a week which featured No. 6 Tennessee losing on two buzzer-beaters, No. 1 Purdue losing for the second straight week and eight ranked teams losing on Saturday, here are my top headlines.\n\nThe tree topples No. 4 Arizona\n\nAfter a brutal week of watching the Trojans get swept by my home state teams, Oregon and Oregon State, nothing could have consoled me better than watching Stanford take down No. 4 Arizona. The Wildcats went into the weekend second in the Pac-12 but No. 4 in the country, and many still think they are the best team in the Pac-12. However, Saturday showed a different side of Arizona that most of us are not used to.\n\nThe Wildcats held a three-point lead at halftime, up 44-41 on the Cardinal, but in the second half, it was all Stanford, as they outscored Arizona by 12 and went on to win 88-79. Arizona shot an absurd 35 3-point shots, more than their regular field goal attempts, meaning they shot more threes than layups. It\u2019s not like the Wildcats were really red-hot from three either; they shot 14-for-35 and while 14 threes is a lot, there is no reason to shoot 35 3-pointers unless you can\u2019t miss as a team. To put things into perspective, 35 3-point attempts a game is 12 more than the Wildcats\u2019 average of 23 attempts per game.\n\nThe most impressive part of the game to me was how Stanford rendered Arizona\u2019s star player, junior forward Azuolas Tubelis, useless. Tubelis was in foul trouble the whole game so he watched much of the game from the bench, but when he was on, he only scored four points and was unable to grab a single rebound in 17 minutes. Arizona did, however, have four players in double digits, including a 26-point outing from senior guard Courtney Ramey. But Tommy Lloyd\u2019s squad looked a little lost without Tubelis and could not stop the Cardinal.\n\nStanford, on the other hand, played its best game of basketball this year by far. All five starters scored double-digit points, most notably 22 from junior guard Michael O\u2019Connell. Everything \u2014 and I mean everything \u2014 went right for Stanford as they shot an otherworldly 61% from the field and 56% from three, out-dueling Arizona in every single statistical category except for blocks. This loss brought me pure joy, as I do not like to see Arizona succeed, so seeing a team like Stanford knock them off will always bring a smile to my face.\n\nArizona is a funny team, though. They were undefeated coming into conference play with wins over No. 17 San Diego State, No. 10 Creighton, No. 6 Tennessee and No. 14 Indiana. But for some reason these Pac-12 away games are their kryptonite and three of their four losses have come on the road in conference play. When it comes down to it, I still trust them and think they can make a deep run in March.\n\nCreighton is rolling and they are my pick to win the Big East\n\nThe No. 23 Blue Jays started off the season hot, winning six straight including wins over No. 21 Texas Tech and No. 9 Arkansas. Then they hit a rough patch, losing five games in a row, including BYU, Nebraska and Arizona State. However, after everyone wrote them off as just another team with too much preseason hype, Creighton has surged back with eight straight wins including wins over No. 13 Xavier, No. 19 Providence and most recently, No. 21 UConn.\n\nThe Blue Jays have one of the best starting lineups in the entire country, with all starting five averaging double digits. They are led by junior center Ryan Kalkbrenner and sophomore guard Ryan Nembhard, who is clearly a leader on this team despite not always scoring the most.\n\nCreighton sits at second in the Big East, only half a game back from first place No. 10 Marquette. Going forward, the Blue Jays play No. 24 Providence and No. 11 Marquette, both of which will be huge games if Creighton wants to win the Big East.\n\nCreighton is probably the only team I trust in the Big East, because I think it is a mediocre conference. But take that with a grain of salt because the last few teams I said I trust the most (Kansas State and Purdue) have dropped a game within a week of me saying that. At this rate, expect a Creighton loss this week to completely undermine me.\n\nThis week, I\u2019m looking forward to Tuesday when No. 1 Alabama heads to Knoxville to take on No. 10 Tennessee and Saturday when No. 9 Baylor and No. 5 Kansas battle for supremacy in the Big 12.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

The Trojans\u2019 58 total points tied a season-low for the team.\n\n\u201cWe competed.

After a long offseason, opening day had finally arrived. The Trojans made their excitement clear, shouting words of encouragement that echoed in the indoor stadium of Fish Field House. However, at the end of four quarters, the Trojans were all quiet as they lost to Boston College 14-3 on Saturday.\n\nWith the Trojans losing their highest scorer from last season in Kelsey Huff, USC registered its lowest point total in a half since 2018 and its lowest total in an entire game since 2021. The Eagles\u2019 defense limited the Trojans\u2019 attempts on the goal to 18 compared to BC\u2019s 35. The Trojans shot 17% from the field, while the Eagles shot 40%.\n\n\u201cThey dictated our pace and played tight defense,\u201d USC head coach Lindsey Munday said. \u201cThey got us out of our structure.\u201d\n\nBC\u2019s graduate attacker Jenn Medjid led all players with five goals. Her final point in the fourth quarter came at a heavy price. When Medjid rifled the ball with 3:27 left, graduate defender Emma Wightman and Medjid collided, injuring Medjid, who had to be carried off the field. Meanwhile, Wightman earned her second yellow card of the game, leading to her suspension for the remainder of the match.\n\nOverall, the Trojans committed 22 fouls, with six of those being yellow cards. The Eagles recorded ten fouls and just one yellow card.\n\nAfter scoring the third-most goals on the team last season, junior attacker Shelby Tilton led the Trojans\u2019 offensive against BC with two goals.\n\n\u201cShelby is super aggressive,\u201d Munday said. \u201cShe\u2019s a dodger, can play anywhere, and she provided a spark for our offense today.\u201d\n\nSophomore midfielder Christina Gagnon tacked on another goal for USC.\n\nIn the faceoff circle, the Eagles won 13 out of 21 draws, despite being sixth in the ACC in draw control last season. The Trojans won an average of 15 draws per game last season.\n\nDefensively, redshirt senior goalie Kait Devir played the entire game in the arc, recording a .417 save percentage against her former team. The New Jersey native had an average save percentage of .372 last season.\n\n\u201cKait brings a work ethic that is unmatched,\u201d Munday said. \u201cShe\u2019s someone who wants to do everything she can to get better, not only for herself, but for the team.\u201d\n\nGraduate goalie Rachel Hall recorded six saves and had a save percentage of .667 for BC. In the fourth quarter, Hall passed goal duties to freshman Shea Dolce, who picked up the first two saves of her career.\n\nUSC falls to 1-7 all-time against Boston College, with Saturday\u2019s 11-point margin being the largest in series history. The Trojans will return home to McAlister Field to face off against Ohio State next Sunday. The Buckeyes beat Robert Morris 18-6 on Saturday and went 9-7 overall last season.\n```"}

By  James Donovan February 11, 2023 at 12:54 pm PST\n\nOn February 1, the  Right to Counsel Los Angeles Coalition  hosted a community town hall with 100 in-person attendees and 135 more over Zoom. Councilmembers Nithya Raman, Heather Hutt and Eunisses Hernandez pledged to support legislation that would provide tenants with a lawyer when they want to fight an eviction notice. A Right to Counsel (RTC) ordinance would give all tenants the right to receive legal representation in eviction court.\n\n\u201cWhen tenants receive an eviction notice, they don\u2019t have a lawyer,\u201d said Raman, Councilmember for District 4. \u201cBut who always has a lawyer at court? A landlord.\u201d Even if a tenant cannot afford an attorney, with an RTC ordinance, a lawyer would be provided for them, similar to criminal court. L.A. would not be the first city to implement this right.\n\n\u201cIn New York City, when they passed a Right to Counsel, evictions dropped by 27%,\u201d said Raman. \u201cThat means 70,000 tenants in the city of New York avoided displacement. Imagine how transformative that would be for the city of Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project,  34,388 eviction cases  were filed in L.A. County in 2022. When COVID hit,  Stay Housed LA  (SHLA) \u2014 a partnership program between the city of L.A., L.A. County, community organizations and various legal service providers \u2014 received funding to provide legal representation to tenants facing eviction. However, SHLA was only able to represent 2,000 tenants in L.A. County in 2022. SHLA expects 50,000 eviction cases to be filed in 2023.\n\nStaffers of L.A. County Supervisors Hilda Solis of District 1 and Kathryn Barger of District 5 were also in attendance and said their offices were committed to implementing tenants\u2019 rights protections countywide. A representative of Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez of District 13 explicitly stated that Soto-Martinez will vote for the Right to Counsel ordinance.\n\nEach also promised to work with the L.A. Housing Department to ensure funds from the recently-passed Measure ULA, also known as United to House L.A., would go towards providing eviction counsel and tenants\u2019 rights education.  Measure ULA  was a 2022 ballot measure that imposed a tax on the sale of megamansions. According to  the measure , 10% of the funds generated will go towards \u201ca right-to-counsel program to provide housing-related legal services to Lower Income Household tenants threatened with eviction.\u201d\n\nHowever, City Council must codify RTC separately for this provision to come into effect. The Right to Counsel Los Angeles Coalition (RTC-LA) was formed in June 2018 and includes non-profit law firms and community activist organizations like ACCE (Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment) and SAJE (Strategic Actions for a Just Economy). The main goal of the Coalition is to see an RTC ordinance passed into law.\n\nTenants\u2019 rights activists \u2014 many of whom are a part of RTC-LA \u2014 just enjoyed a huge victory in January after the city council unanimously passed a slate of tenants\u2019 rights protections. Among those protections was Universal Just Cause, which now prevents landlords from evicting a tenant without reason. A landlord must cite one of 14 legally-stipulated just causes for eviction \u2014 and have that reason hold up in court.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the legislation that we recently passed, which are some of the most robust tenant protections that we\u2019ve seen in this country,\u201d Hutt said. After that victory, the current makeup of the city council gives the best chance yet for implementation of an RTC ordinance.\n\nRTC-LA hopes the protections will prevent an eviction-to-homelessness pipeline that would exacerbate the homelessness crisis and put more people on the street. As of now, Raman\u2019s office is drafting the Right to Counsel ordinance. Sergio Vargas, Co-Director of ACCE, estimates the bill should come to the council floor within the month.\n\nRaman said her team had two goals \u201cat the top of their list\u201d when she first took office: \u201cUniversal Just Cause \u2014 which we just won \u2014 and Right to Counsel, which we\u2019re about to win.\u201d Despite her confidence, Raman cautioned against hubris. \u201cThis is not going to be easy. Right to Counsel requires a significant fiscal investment from the city of L.A. for the protection of renters,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have to win more people onto our side,\u201d Raman said, \u201c[and] make the case to them that this is that final piece that\u2019s gonna help us stabilize LA in this suite of tenant protections. That\u2019s really gonna transform this city.\u201d\n\nThe town hall also included testimonies from tenants. \u201cI know the feeling of not knowing what to do next, after getting an eviction notice from a court,\u201d said Alma Rocha, a tenant who could not find an eviction defense lawyer. \u201cThe eviction process is exhausting and devastating to tenants. It took me almost three months to get help.\u201d\n\nRocha believes having an attorney assigned to a tenant would provide crucial assistance in navigating the eviction court process. \u201cTo be at peace knowing that a lawyer is fighting for my rental rights ... would help so much \u2014 to not pick whether to focus on my health or figure out whether I\u2019ll have a roof over my head,\u201d Rocha said.\n```"}

As the Chiefs aim to capture the franchise\u2019s second title, familiar faces including the likes of quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce lead the charge. However, new faces stepped up throughout the season to propel Kansas City to its third Super Bowl in four years, with some changes more surprising than others.\n\nIn an offseason that saw the Chiefs sign big name receiver, USC alumnus Juju Smith-Schuster, one of the biggest boosts came through seventh round pick Isiah Pacheco. In his first year as an NFL pro, Pacheco made a name for himself through his speed and elusiveness. The rookie tallied 830 rushing yards on nearly 5 yards a carry to go with 5 touchdowns.\n\nWhat many don\u2019t know is the root of this success is born out of hardship. Pacheco hails from Vineland, New Jersey. From Puerto Rican descent, Pacheco grew up with his parents and two older siblings. Early on, Pacheco flashed his potential on the football field, even getting voted a team captain his freshman year at Vineland High School. But everything changed in January 2016 when his brother, Travoise Cannon, was killed. Isiah was 16 years old. Only a year later, Isiah also lost his older sister, Celeste Cannon, through tragedy.\n\nReeling from the loss of two important figures in his life, Pacheco channeled that energy onto the football field. During his time at Vineland, Pacheco was a four-year team captain and 3 star recruit that garnered attention from numerous DI programs. However, he decided to stay home and commit to Rutgers University.\n\nAt Rutgers, Pacheco continued his growth into the star the world now sees on national television. During his four years as a Scarlet Knight, he rushed for a total of 2,442 yards and scored 19 touchdowns in 44 games. Combined with his impressive NFL Combine and pro day performances, Pacheco made a name for himself, and the pros took notice.\n\nCome draft day, Pacheco fell to the seventh round. Often, late round picks rarely make an impact in the league, but Pacheco fell into the hands of one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL. Kansas City took Pacheco with the 251st overall pick and little time was needed for him to show his worth. Pacheco became a steady contributor in a Chiefs offense stacked from top to bottom with offensive stars.\n\nIn the Chiefs\u2019 AFC playoff game against the Jacksonville Jaguars that saw Patrick Mahomes battle an ankle injury, Pacheco played his role via a 95-yard rushing contribution to the Chiefs\u2019 27-17 victory.\n\nSunday\u2019s matchup against Philadelphia is a clash of heavyweights. But in a game that sees superstars on both sides, an X factor might just be what one team needs to capture the title. Isiah Pacheco continues to prove his worth on the field in his late siblings\u2019 honor, and he doesn\u2019t plan on stopping this weekend.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 11:05 pm PST\n\nAny sports fan has that one team. It\u2019s that opponent that keeps you up at night, that always causes issues for your own squad, that nothing ever seems to go right against. Year after year, your team just can\u2019t figure them out \u2014 even as players and coaches come in and out, and both teams ebb and flow with success and failure against the rest of the league. Prior to and perhaps even including part of Friday night, that annoyingly frustrating opponent for USC women\u2019s basketball was Oregon. But head coach Lindsay Gottlieb\u2019s program is changing trends this season, starting with breaking a 12-game losing streak to the Ducks.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 56-51 win at Galen Center Friday night should go a long way to ensuring that they reverse another recent historical tendency: reaching their first NCAA Tournament since 2014.\n\n\u201cI think [this win] is as significant in the growth of this team and our program as any we\u2019ve had all year, for a number of reasons,\u201d Gottlieb said postgame. Let\u2019s dive into all of those reasons, which exemplify how the Trojans\u2019 program is turning a corner.\n\nFor starters, USC lost badly earlier this season to the Ducks, falling 73-45 on January 1 while shooting just 23% from the field. Gottlieb and sophomore forward Rayah Marshall both pointed out that the Trojans simply weren\u2019t themselves in that game, but they were confident in the team\u2019s ability to adjust and beat Oregon in the rematch.\n\nAnd like that New Year\u2019s Day matchup in Eugene, Oregon, USC just had nothing going on offense early on in the game. Slow starts have been an issue for the Trojans this season, and they started just 3-for-20 from the field in this game. It didn\u2019t really seem to matter where USC tried to shoot from \u2014 the paint, the corner three, the elbow jumper, the halfcourt logo \u2014 nothing was falling again, even facing a rather unspectacular Ducks defense.\n\nBut the Trojans didn\u2019t quit despite trailing 20-8 after the opening ten minutes, even as the game appeared to be trending in a similar fashion as the previous 12 matchups between these programs.\n\n\u201cBasketball is a game of runs, and they punched us first,\u201d graduate guard Destiny Littleton said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose any confidence ... We knew the past game was in the back of our heads, and we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re not going to go out like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo USC battled, and stayed in the game going into halftime. Marshall, who has to be the frontrunner for Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year by now, continued her dominance with four blocks and two steals in the first half. Despite a subpar night offensively, she affected the game in plenty of other facets, finishing the night with 11 rebounds, seven blocks and three steals.\n\nAdditionally, a 3-pointer by graduate guard Okako Adika late in the second quarter kept the Trojans within striking distance, as they trailed 29-21 heading into the break.\n\n\u201cWe fought our way back, and, credit to our players, it wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThey just found a way.\u201d\n\nGottlieb\u2019s squad continued to surge in the third quarter on both ends of the court. USC was starting to look like themselves again, which is becoming a pretty good team. Gottlieb stuck to her guns, relying on her elite defense. She even doubled down on her offensive scheme, running her \u201cbasic\u201d offensive play out of halftime, regardless of whether Oregon showed a man or zone defense.\n\nAnother major sign of growth and confidence in this team showed itself in the third quarter. The Trojans\u2019 forwards \u2014 Marshall and graduate Kadi Sissoko \u2014 through whom the offense typically runs, were having off nights scoring. Nevertheless, USC was able to find production elsewhere. Adika was a prime example, putting up a season-high 18 points to go with 11 rebounds.\n\n\u201cI came in with a winning mentality,\u201d Adika said, something the Trojans\u2019 program has lacked lately, as evident in that postseason-less streak mentioned earlier. \u201cI knew even in the first game we were a better team, so we just had to prove that.\u201d\n\nThe USC offense also benefited from extra opportunities: Oregon\u2019s six turnovers in the third quarter led to eight Trojan points, and USC\u2019s five offensive rebounds produced seven second-chance points in the period. So, even though both teams shot 50% from the field in the quarter, the Trojans had twice as many field goals, putting them ahead 44-41 heading into the fourth.\n\nFinally, in a game when USC wanted to make a point of playing like themselves, the fourth quarter started exactly how this team likes it: pretty ugly. Just five total points had been scored by the under-5 media timeout of the final period, and 10 combined points in the first 9:23 of the frame. In other words, the Trojans did what they do best \u2014 shutting their opponent down defensively.\n\nThat\u2019s how USC finally snapped its 12-game losing streak against the Ducks, perhaps putting an end to those aforementioned sleepless nights for Trojan fans. Adika especially seemed to want to end that trend \u2014 her fourth 3-pointer of the game with 4:30 remaining put USC up seven.\n\nThe final example of how the Trojans are growing this season: They\u2019re learning to close games. They held on in the fourth quarter to beat Stanford a few weeks ago; they held Washington scoreless in overtime a week later and finished the job tonight against Oregon. USC held the Ducks to just 31 points in the final three quarters, and Oregon went 3-for-17 from the field in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cEach and every day, these girls come in, and there\u2019s no quit,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cWe don\u2019t care if we\u2019re ranked, we don\u2019t care who we\u2019re playing ... We have to come together and play, and I think that\u2019s what my teammates do each and every day.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really important for a team trying to make a name for themselves again and trying to make the tournament,\u201d Littleton added. Littleton would know as well as anyone, too, as a transfer from South Carolina that won a national championship last season.\n\nBut other players can sense the changing tides within the USC program as well.\n\n\u201cThat win felt different,\u201d Marshall said as she exited Galen Center, perhaps summing up everything said by Gottlieb and Littleton.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not hard to see why. USC, now 18-6 overall and 8-5 in the Pac-12, looks to continue its upward trajectory on Sunday, when it hosts Oregon State at noon.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Campbell Donovan\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 10:00 pm PST\n\nAfter recently placing second in the Pac-12\u2032s 2023 preseason coaches\u2019 poll, the USC women\u2019s lacrosse team is coming into the 2023 season hungry for its fourth conference title. The Trojans finished the 2022 season with a loss to UVA in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Furthermore, the team said goodbye to the Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year, Kelsey Huff, who graduated last year. Other recent departures include Lizzy Wagner, Michaela McMahon, Elyse Darcy, Kaleigh Brennan and Finley Ueland.\n\nThe team heads into its 10th season as a program, anchored by head coach Lindsey Munday. Her consistency, longevity and knowledge in the program have guided the Trojans in all of their successes. Katie Ramsay, Shelby Tilton, Danielle Carson and Sloane Murphy are returning to captain the squad. The Trojans also welcomed graduate transfer defender Emma Wightman, who played four seasons at the University of Florida before becoming a Trojan. Along with Wightman, seven freshmen have joined the crew for this upcoming season. Maggie Ramsay, an attacker from Connecticut, is joining her older sister Katie to play together again for one last season. Hollis Mulry also joins Maggie on the attacking end. Defensively, the Trojans added Asjia Roberson to their roster. Kate Gerrity, Lillie Bea Cope, Haley Newton and Hannah Barron round out the newcomers on the midfield line.\n\nWith a strong foundation and solid new additions, the Trojans head into the 2023 season as the IWCLA\u2019s No. 18-ranked team; however, they will quickly be tested. They head to the East Coast to start the season and will face No. 3 Boston College. Other challenges this season for the Trojans are within their conference specifically. Stanford acquired the top recruiting class in the NCAA this past year, and with other threats, such as Colorado and Arizona State, USC expects a demanding schedule.\n\nTwo teammates were recently named ILWomen All-American Honorable Mentions. Wightman and senior defender Olivia Dooley earned this title with a combined 65 turnovers in their respective 2022 seasons. USC finished its 2022 season with a record of 13-5 and a conference record of 8-2. It fell short of Stanford at both meetings in 2022 and plans to squash that streak this upcoming season. Also, after falling to Arizona State in the Pac-12 semifinals, the Trojans expect to give both Stanford and Arizona State a run for their money. Conference play does not begin until March 17; however, they meet the Buckeyes for their home opener on Sunday, February 19, on McAlister Field. The team is anticipating a challenging but successful season.\n```"}

The 57th Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will be held at the State Farm Stadium in Arizona this Sunday. The historic game, which airs on FOX, will be the first Super Bowl to feature two Black starting quarterbacks: Jalen Hurts for the Philadelphia Eagles and Patrick Mahomes for the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nThe Super Bowl is most known for football; however, it\u2019s also become a massive day for entertainment, food and socializing. Students around USC are preparing for the big game in their own ways.\n\nCaitlin Kurzman, a Annenberg master\u2019s student, said she plans to incorporate the game into her studies. \u201cI\u2019m going with a group of masters kids from a Master of Science in Digital Social Media,\u201d Kurzman said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to a restaurant together to watch it because our professor wants us to watch and study the Super Bowl ads.\u201d\n\nA perennial tradition, Kruzman said she\u2019s always enjoyed the advertisements, \u201cI grew up watching the Super Bowl because my family are huge football fans,\u201d Kruzman said. \u201cThe ads are always really unique and brand new.\u201d\n\nThird year doctorate of law student Summer Khatib doesn\u2019t share the same sentiment. \u201cThe Super Bowl is obviously a huge money maker for not only the teams playing, but all the ads airing on TV,\u201d Khatib said. \u201cI think there is a deeper meaning in the sense that it is the perfect opportunity to reach a wide audience to advertise to.\u201d\n\nBobby Gifford, a junior majoring in journalism, echoed a similar message, \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of America,\u201d Gifford said.\u201dLook at the advertising money going into the commercials.\u201d\n\nKhatib is among a myriad of students sporting apprehensive thoughts about the game. Tim Topper, a first year graduate student at Rossier, said his evolving perspective on the NFL sidelined his viewing experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a super corrupt organization that runs as a non-profit, but its investors and owners take home billions of dollars and use fan contributions such as 50/50 raffles and cancer awareness jersey auctions for charity as tax write offs,\u201d Topper said. \u201cThe NFL\u2019s stance on domestic violence, sexual assault, the use of Native mascots and the exploitation of low-income neighborhoods where owners get to put their stadiums is abdominal.\u201d\n\nThe NFL has continued to be rocked by a series of scandals and accidents throughout the season. Damar Hamlin\u2019s onfield cardiac arrest, Cleveland Browns star quarterback Deshaun Watson\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuits, and former Texans coach Lovie Smith\u2019s claims of discrimination against ethnic coaches have all cast a damp shadow over the 2022-2023 season.\n\nDespite this, many are still excited for Sunday. Ryan Peterson, a senior majoring in political science, has his day fully planned in preparation, full of family, friends and traditions. \u201cI was brought up in a household that watches the Super Bowl every February. I love the game,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nAbove all, it\u2019s the fanfare and community that consistently brings Peterson back to the big game every year. \u201cI think that the Super Bowl brings the community together, millions of viewers, celebrities sitting amongst common folk and sports goers. Even though we want different teams to win, we are all focused on the celebration and game itself,\u201d Peterson said.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/02/10/tourney-talk-fitting-the-shoe-on-this-years-cinderellas/", "response": "```\nTourney Talk: Fitting the shoe on this year\u2019s Cinderellas\n\n\u201cTourney Talk\u201d is a column by Michael Fiumefreddo about the men\u2019s basketball NCAA tournament. Unlike any other sports tournament, the best team rarely wins March Madness. To finish on top, a team must win six games, at a neutral site, against a team they probably haven\u2019t seen that year on two-to-three days of preparation. This task is difficult for undefeated teams, former AP No. 1\u2032s and squads loaded with NBA-caliber players. Cinderella teams become the biggest story each tournament. A school nobody\u2019s ever heard of \u2014 written off as a first-round exit \u2014 somehow busts brackets and, in rare cases, cuts down the nets as champions come April.\n\nThe world watched as No. 15 seed St. Peter\u2019s, a school that takes up just one city block in New Jersey, reached the Elite Eight last year. Fans stayed up late to watch UMBC become the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in 2018. Sister Jean and No. 11 seed Loyola Chicago\u2019s Final Four run will never be forgotten that same year. Cinderellas have what it takes to win in March \u2014 and no, this isn\u2019t a clich\u00e9 for heart and determination. There are three keys that all Cinderellas have that make them a threat to win a handful of games in the Big Dance.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean heart and determination aren\u2019t huge factors. In fact, they\u2019re the essential components of the first key: senior-heavy rosters. Typically, the best freshman head to \u201cblue blood\u201d programs as a pit-stop before the NBA. For the rest, their final seasons in college are their last chance at glory. St. Peter\u2019s top six scorers last season were juniors and seniors by a significant margin. The four underclassmen that played for the Peacocks combined for 12.8 points per game, minuscule compared to the 54 points the top six put up nightly. Their biggest win? Against the one-and-done factory Kentucky. The Peacocks were a team playing with purpose; they wanted to be crowned NCAA champions in their last year together, despite the odds being stacked against them.\n\nBut, every team has seniors that want to win. What separates those that actually do is their performance in certain elements of the game, which are the next two keys. Analysts and experts point out the Colgate Raiders year after year as a team that can pull off an early upset. Colgate created a Patriot League dynasty by living and dying by the three-point shot. Get ready for the same story this season, with the Raiders shooting 39.4% from beyond the arc, good for fifth-highest in all of college basketball. The 3-point shot can turn a double-digit deficit into a one-possession game within a matter of seconds. It can also turn a close game into a blowout in just a few minutes of play. Teams built to catch fire and win in March don\u2019t have an off shooting night from beyond the arc.\n\nVirginia\u2019s 2018 team had one of those nights in the first round, shooting 18.2% on threes to become the first No. 1 seed to lose their opening game. The team they lost to, the UMBC Retrievers that shot 38.7% from three that season, lit it up from beyond the arc and hit half their threes to knock off the Cavaliers by 20. The only line on the basketball court that\u2019s just as important as the three-point line, however, is the charity stripe. Late game free throws matter more at the college level than in the NBA for two reasons: most college players are not automatic from the line, and fouls in the bonus go to a one-and-one format rather than two shots. When a good free throw shooting team takes the lead late in a tournament game, they\u2019re in control. The losing team continues to foul with the hope of a few misses and the ball back, but that never comes.\n\nOral Roberts took down two Power 5 teams in 2021 and lost their Sweet 16 matchup by two; an impressive feat for a No. 15 seed. Their strength? The Golden Eagles led the nation in free throw percentage. Coupled with being a top-20 team from three, it\u2019s not hard to see why they pulled off two impressive upsets. This year\u2019s Golden Eagles have the tools to be 2023\u2032s Cinderella team. Their stars from two years ago are now upperclassmen that have only gotten better from three and the free throw line. ESPN\u2019s Bracketology has them slotted as a 12-seed, a convincing sign of their improvement over two seasons.\n\nAlso, keep an eye on the Louisiana Ragin\u2019 Cajuns. It\u2019ll be a fight for them to even make the dance, but if they do, they are a top ten three-point shooting team. But nothing says Cinderella teams are limited to mid-majors. North Carolina opened up the year as the No. 1-ranked team, but their current freefall down the standings could see the Tar Heels end up as a No. 8-11 seed. That\u2019s where they were ranked last season, when they made the Final Four, and UNC retained the same core of junior guard Caleb Love, junior guard RJ Davis and senior forward Armando Bacot. This upperclassmen-heavy Tar Heels team knows how to win in March. If they get there, expect a deep run like last season.\n\nRegardless, no matter how much analysis and research you do, there will always be a team that shocks everyone and becomes the story of the tournament. Everyone will try to predict which team that will be, and most will be wrong. But, instead of taking a shot in the dark, using these three keys will ensure your guess will at least be educated.

(AP Photo/Matthew Hinton)\n\nBy Kamyar Moradi\nFebruary 10, 2023 at 2:42 pm PST\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d is a satirical sports column by Kamyar Moradi depicting everything and everyone who should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nDear Kevin Durant,\n\nFew people or things in this world have caused me more pain than you, Kevin Durant, and I\u2019m here to make sure everyone knows why. It all started back in 2009 as a young fan in my living room. My eyes were glued to the screen as I watched what I believed was the definition of fun on television. The Oklahoma City Thunder was a young, energetic team that ran like stallions, jumped out of the gym, and played a brand of basketball that I had always dreamed about. The raw emotion that you, Russell Westbrook and James Harden poured onto the court after a ferocious dunk or stepback three was infectious. So, from that point forward, this was going to be my team.\n\nThere was never anything you couldn\u2019t do, there was no shot you couldn\u2019t make, there was no defender that you couldn\u2019t shake and bake. At almost seven feet tall with almost a seven-and-a-half-foot wingspan you could \u2014 in the words of Mark Jackson \u2014 \u201cStop on a dime and give you nine cents change.\u201d I worshiped you, Kevin. You meant more to me than any athlete in the world, and you taught me how to believe.\n\nFor those of you reading this column, I really don\u2019t think you have a grasp of my admiration and love for someone who was such a rare specimen that the media coined an entire term around: \u201cunicorn.\u201d Everything about you I wanted to mimic, from how you carried yourself to what I believe is the most heartwarming speech in NBA history. The raw emotion and wholesome energy that was on display in front of a nationally televised audience on May 6, 2014. With the exception of \u201cUp,\u201d I\u2019m usually not somebody that cries during movies. But when I heard, \u201cYou\u2019re the real MVP,\u201d I thought someone started cutting onions.\n\nI would go to war for you, Kevin. Whether it was the lack of experience and youthful ignorance against the Miami Heat\u2019s Big Three, I was there for you. Whether it was an early playoff exit after Patrick Beverley wanted to try his luck at the UFC by taking Russ\u2019s knee out, I was there for you. Whether it was a meltdown of epic proportions against the best team in NBA history, I fired up the excuse machine like Skip Bayless every time LeBron had a game for the ages.\n\nYou were responsible for the worst humiliation of my life when you lost 3-1 to what was considered the best team in NBA history. I remember walking around lunch time at the coveted Kennedy Middle School laughing hysterically in the faces of my peers who claimed they were lifelong Warrior fans when they didn\u2019t even know how to spell Monta Ellis. Then in the blink of an eye, the thrashing I received from what seemed like the entire school took all joy out of my life.\n\nDay in and day out, I heard nincompoops on television talking about how you were the problem. They questioned if you could ever get over the hump and bring a championship to a city and a franchise that adored you just as much as I did. They wondered if you could ever climb out of the goat-sized shadow left behind by someone who now has scored the most points in NBA history.\n\nBut just when I thought things couldn\u2019t get any worse, they did. July 4, 2016, is quite literally one of the worst days in my entire life, regardless of sports. Leading up to that fateful day, more pundits around the country started squawking that you were going to sign with the very team that sent you home packing. I believed none of it. Rumors were stirring left and right about how you were going to leave behind the very franchise that believed in a skinny kid from the DMV who got flack for not even benching his body weight out of college.\n\nThen all of a sudden, it was over. I fell to my knees and screamed to the heavens, asking the basketball gods how they could let this happen. You went to play with Steph, Dray and Klay, ruining the NBA as I knew it. Whether it was the fact that no other team in the league could do anything about to stop you, your two rings that you rubbed my face in or your sudden willingness to finally play defense after nine professional seasons, I was done with you.\n\nAnalysts claimed you were now the best in the league that deserved all this praise when all you did was throw Russell under the bus. And now with this latest Suns escapade, you are officially the biggest flake in NBA history. When the going gets tough, you get going, Kevin. Nothing\u2019s ever good enough for you, even when you handpick two of your best friends to play on the same team as you in the biggest market in the country.\n\nI hope you never win another basketball competition for the rest of your career. Not even a Taco Bell Skills Challenge. Respectfully, you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Both Oklahoma and Alabama fans are trying to say Hurts, who is about to make his Super Bowl debut, is a product of their school.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts speaks during an NFL football Super Bowl team availability, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2023, in Phoenix. The Eagles will face the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 57 Sunday. (AP Photo/Matt York)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson February 10, 2023 at 12:34 pm PST\n\nJanuary 8, 2018 created ripples across the entirety of college football. When Nick Saban benched his starting quarterback for a true freshman at halftime in the National Championship Game, people took notice. Jalen Hurts, who is now preparing to make his Super Bowl debut with the Philadelphia Eagles as their starter, was that quarterback who Saban benched. So how did a guy who was benched in a National Championship Game make it to the Super Bowl? Lincoln Riley and Oklahoma is how.\n\nHurts was a four-star prospect coming out of high school when he committed to Alabama, quickly becoming the starting quarterback as a true freshman in 2016. Hurts was looking like a star, winning SEC Offensive Player of the Year and SEC Freshman of the Year awards. The young quarterback even led his team to the 2016 College Football Playoff but lost against Clemson in the championship.\n\nHurts was still the starting quarterback for his sophomore year, leading the Crimson Tide to an 11-1 regular season record and another CFP berth. In the CFP semifinals that year against Clemson, Hurts was named the MVP of the game. But that\u2019s when Tua Tagovailoa came into the picture. Tagovailoa replaced Hurts in the National Championship Game at halftime after Hurts only completed three passes in the first half of the game. Alabama came back to win because of the play of Tagovailoa, who threw three touchdown passes.\n\nHurts did not transfer after that season and had to be second fiddle, sitting on the bench behind Tagovailoa for the 2018 campaign. That was until the 2018 SEC Championship Game, when Hurts came in off the bench after an injury to Tagovailoa. Hurts led the Crimson Tide to a comeback victory over Georgia to cement a 13-0 season and Alabama\u2019s fifth straight CFP. Despite his stellar performance, Tagovailoa came back for the CFP and Hurts again had to sit on the bench and watch.\n\nHurts\u2019 career seemed over. In the two National Championship Games he started, Hurts played poorly on the biggest stage. With his options dwindling, Hurts entered the transfer portal after graduating from Alabama. Nick Saban recently had an interview where he said Hurts was considering the likes of Maryland and Miami as his transfer destination, but Saban gave him advice. Saban told him to go to Oklahoma because \u201cthey have the best coach to develop you.\u201d\n\nThat coach is current USC head coach Lincoln Riley, when he was still at Oklahoma. After his tumultuous career at Alabama, Hurts transferred to Oklahoma and immediately made an impact, leading the Sooners to a 12-1 regular season record and a CFP berth. That season, Hurts had career highs in passing yards, passing touchdowns, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. Although his team lost in the CFP semifinals, Hurts finished second in the Heisman Trophy race behind Joe Burrow, who arguably had the greatest college football season performance ever.\n\nSo which school gets to claim Hurts as their product? Is it the school who he played with for three seasons but benched him? Or is it the school that rejuvenated his career, even though he only played one year with them? There is an easy answer to that question: Oklahoma. Nick Saban gave Hurts the advice to go to Lincoln Riley because he knew Riley could make Hurts into a better passer, which is exactly what happened.\n\nHurts could have graduated from Alabama and tried to enter the NFL draft, but what NFL team wants to invest significant draft capital into a quarterback who was benched on the biggest stage and played a year as a backup? Hurts would have received some NFL interest, but he was not worth the second round pick that Philadelphia eventually used on him after his time at Alabama. And he would certainly not be the quarterback who recently finished second in MVP voting without Riley\u2019s coaching.\n\nWhile Hurts had a long career with Alabama, throwing for 5,626 yards over three years, the reason he is in the Super Bowl, and even a starter in the NFL, is because of Oklahoma and Lincoln Riley. Nick Saban said it himself. Hurts needed to go to Oklahoma and needed Lincoln Riley to develop him. Riley finished Hurts\u2019 development and made him into the quarterback millions of fans will see this upcoming Sunday.\n\nFans of both schools, and the schools themselves, will try to claim Hurts as their own. They will continue to do so until the end of time. Ohio State fans do it with Joe Burrow. But there is only one answer as to who made the Eagles quarterback into an MVP candidate.\n\nOklahoma, or more accurately Lincoln Riley, is the one who gets to claim Jalen Hurts.\n```"}

He sort of gave us that with \u201cSOUL!\u201d, which in 1968 was revolutionary, audacious [and] bold for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love the fact that he always showed Black people at their best.\u201d Tavares-Rance said, before explaining how Haizlip\u2019s work reflected a need for more Black storytelling \u2014 and how that need drives which content is shown at the Martha\u2019s Vineyard African-American Film Festival. \u201cHe showed Black love, Black art.\u201d\n\n\u201c[In 2023], there has been a lot of progress trying to make sure our value is reflected in the mediums and the spaces that we deserve; not because we\u2019re special, but because we are human and we are part of this existence in the country and globally.\u201d Brock Akil said.\n\nOne key element of getting your stories told is to \u201cstay fresh\u201d, according to Nagenda. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very competitive business overall, but in terms of wanting to tell stories ... [it] is just a continual evolvement and a commitment to being forward. It\u2019s great what you did yesterday, but it\u2019s nowhere near as good as what you\u2019ll do tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThroughout the event, panelists emphasized the importance of advocating for the creatives who bring these stories to life when securing support for projects. When making \u201cThe Harder They Fall,\u201d Nagenda took a chance on first-time writer-director Jeymes Samuel. \u201cI was like, \u2018This guy should get the budget that he needs to make the film properly even though he\u2019s never made a film before ... Netflix, which is a microcosm of the industry in general, wouldn\u2019t quite understand that.\u201d\n\nThe streaming giant bristled at the idea of casting a then-unknown Jonathan Majors in the lead role and suggested a more well known alternative. \u201cSo it was like, \u2018We\u2019ll make it for a little bit less if you can get Michael B. Jordan.\u2019 Michael is not doing the film and also, we can\u2019t get every person to star in a movie about Black people from Black Panther.\u201d\n\nNagenda, who at the time was the Vice President of Original Film at Netflix, ultimately had to take a stand. \u201cI [ended up] just saying, \u2018I\u2019ll put my job on the line, you know what I mean? If I\u2019m wrong, you can get rid of me.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn many cases, Black women specifically act as the support that empowers these sacrifices \u2014 often at their own expense. Haizlip and Brock Akil during the panel. (Photo by Tomoki Chien)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re typically the first ones to understand the vision. We are visionary. But because we are in this country, we often have to be at the entry level in order to make movement,\u201d Brock Akil said. \u201cSome Black women, unfortunately, are the ones who were there at the beginning and they build the value and the need, then it goes on and [they get] left behind.\u201d\n\nCreating in the digital age has presented a new obstacle for creatives: data-driven storytelling. \u201cData is backward-looking, so it can tell you what has succeeded but it can\u2019t tell you what will succeed,\u201d Nagenda said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many trails to blaze that if you only kind of follow the data and you\u2019re iterating on things done before and perhaps getting them better and entertaining, it\u2019s not necessarily galvanizing. This is convenient for me to say as a producer, but sometimes the thing that the data is telling me not to do might be the way to go, right? You know, nobody was telling Jim Cameron to make a movie about blue people for $400 million in 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that ... white men in our industry get to do is that they get to try out the new thing. They get to try to test what data cannot measure,\u201d Brock Akil added. \u201cThe only thing that can go against data is your persistence and your passion for telling it. Sometimes that does mean putting a story on the shelf.\u201d\n\nThe rebuttal to data, according to Brock Akil, is simple: generating excitement. \u201cThat is challenging because, where is the new measurement that excites everybody that can combat data, you know? The only thing it is are people and passion; the thing you see down the street, you see a line? Everybody\u2019s turning, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 You have to create that,\u201d Brock Akil said.\n\nFor audiences looking to start some buzz about upcoming projects, these panelists have several. Brock Akil is currently producing a \u201creimagining\u201d of Judy Blume\u2019s controversial 1975 novel \u201cForever\u201d for Black teenagers, while Nagenda is set to co-produce Book of Clarence, which will come out later this year. The film will star Lakeith Stanfield, Benedict Cumberbatch and Omar Sy. Jeymes Samuel will direct. Additionally, Tarvares-Rance\u2019s African-American Film Festival will return to Martha\u2019s Vineyard from August 4 through August 12. Haizlip is juggling several upcoming projects, including a four-part Steph Curry series, a four-part Netflix miniseries about women in hip-hop, a collaboration with LeBron James that aims to change the way we view reparations and finally, Mr. Soul, the Broadway musical.\n```"}

All night, the Oregon Ducks exploited the inexperienced USC frontcourt to dominate the paint and defend their home court in a 78-60 win Thursday night.\n\nRedshirt junior Joshua Morgan missed his second consecutive game after injuring his ankle a week prior. Freshman forward Vince Iwuchukwu started for the second time in his career in Morgan\u2019s place, but after allowing 2 quick scores and recording a foul, he was quickly replaced by freshman forward Iaroslav Niagu. As a matter of fact, Iwuchukwu only played three minutes in the first half, being called for 4 fouls.\n\nRegardless of who was in at forward, Oregon continuously took advantage of the shorthanded Trojans in the paint. Senior center N\u2019Faly Dante was the biggest beneficiary, leading the Ducks with 17 points on 8-for-11 shooting. USC just had no answer for Dante\u2019s presence in the low post, and the Ducks continued to feed him early for easy buckets. Oregon outscored the Trojans 20-8 in the paint in the first half and 38-20 in the game.\n\n\u201c[Oregon] started off going inside, and they got some easy baskets,\u201d Head Coach Andy Enfield said after the game. \u201cDefensively, we were not on our game tonight. We certainly missed Joshua Morgan ... Our five freshmen do not have this kind of experience on the road defensively. We looked like a young team at times.\u201d\n\nIn addition to their success in the low post, the Ducks\u2019 guards constantly attacked the basket and did a great job getting to the free throw line. Oregon made 16 of its 18 free throw attempts, including 11-of-12 in the second half. Senior guard Will Richardson and redshirt senior guard Jermaine Couisnard both scored in double figures, with 16 and 13 points, respectively. The starting guard duo combined to shoot 9-for-15 from the field, as the Ducks shot a staggering 65% from 2-point range against the usually stingy Trojan defense.\n\nOregon\u2019s 78 points were the most that USC had allowed against an unranked opponent since its January 1 game against Washington State. The Ducks\u2019 54% shooting percentage was the highest by any USC opponent all season.\n\n\u201cJosh is our best defender, by far, as a big guy,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cJosh is a big part of our interior defense with his anticipation and shot blocking ... [The Ducks] are very mature and a very old, experienced team, and they played like it tonight. They came out with a mission, and they just outplayed us.\u201d\n\nWhen the Trojans had the ball on offense, the mismatch down low was no less glaring. The trio of Iwuchukwu, Niagu and freshman forward Kijani Wright combined for just 10 points in their combined 41 minutes on the floor, all coming in the second half with the game already out of reach. The USC guards were reluctant to pass the ball down low, and when they did, Dante held his own regardless of matchup. Dante recorded a game-high 3 blocked shots, more than the entire Trojans roster combined.\n\n\u201cOur bigs need to do a better job of catching the ball,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cOur guards got some balls tipped; they did try to pass the ball when transitioning into the half court, and the balls got tipped or deflected. That\u2019s not the big guys\u2019 fault \u2014 that\u2019s the guards\u2019 fault.\u201d\n\nBecause of the hesitation by the Trojans to score in the post, the offense depended heavily on isolation, meaning they needed their guards to make shots from midrange. Fifth year guard Drew Peterson did a good job of that early, making his first two shot attempts while Oregon feasted in the paint to keep the game competitive. However, the shots stopped falling for USC about seven minutes into the game. With Oregon leading by just a point with 13:09 remaining in the first half, the Trojans missed 7 consecutive shots from the field in a period spanning nearly six minutes of game time. During that slump, the Ducks ripped off an 18-1 run to turn an 11-10 game into a 29-11 game, a lead that would prove insurmountable for USC.\n\nThe offensive bright spot for the Trojans was senior guard Boogie Ellis, who led all players in scoring with 19 points. Ellis put the USC offense on his back in the second half, as he was the only Trojan whose jump shot was consistently falling. He was 7-for-15 from the floor, made a game-high three 3-pointers, and even hauled in two offensive rebounds on one possession to finally set up a basket. Whenever Ellis was able to make some offense happen for USC, Oregon always had a response \u2014 the Trojans could never go on a significant second half run to make the game interesting.\n\nThe Ducks entered the second half with a 15-point lead, and never led by fewer than 14 in the final 20 minutes. USC\u2019s best chance to get back in it would have been to make Oregon pay for its eight second-half giveaways, but the Trojans only scored 3 points off turnovers in the entire game. By comparison, the Ducks scored 17 points off of USC\u2019s 12 turnovers.\n\nThe loss drops the Trojans to 17-7 on the season and 9-4 in Pac-12 play. They will try to bounce back on Saturday afternoon, when they face the Oregon State Beavers in Corvallis to wrap up their two-game Oregon road trip.\n```"}

Partnering with the Turkish Trojan Association (TTA), USC TGSA held the fundraising event from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Trousdale entrance to raise funds and donation items to help rescue and aid efforts in Turkey and Syria. The rain and cold weather have slowed down rescue efforts. Over 20,000 people are confirmed dead.\n\nTGSA is asking for donations such as blankets, winter hats, canned foods and medical supplies. \u201cThose [items] will be the help that we can get right now. But that\u2019s kind of short [term] like for a month. For the long way fund based donations will be much more helpful,\u201d Orkun Bednir, a volunteer with TGSA said.\n\nTGSA and TTA are asking for funds to be donated to @usc_tgsa on Venmo. All proceeds will go to AHBAP, a Turkish fundraising organization collecting donations for earthquake relief efforts. Melis Olcay, a member of TTA, said the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson will match donations 2 to 1.\n\nThe President of TTA, Belis Saran, explained the importance of donating a single dollar. \u201cThe undergraduate student population is roughly 20,000 people. If everyone donated a dollar ... we [could] make a difference,\u201d Saran said. She explained that because of the currency exchange rate, the group could raise about 400,000 Turkish lira.\n\nJonathan D. Aronson, a professor of communication at USC, said there are a number of questions that still need to be answered, such as who is collecting funds and how those funds are distributed. That\u2019s what TTA and TGSA hopes to combat. All proceeds will be donated to Turkish organizations who directly assist with relief efforts and the affected communities.\n\nThe destruction path is roughly the distance between New York City and Philadelphia. So far, more than 5,700 buildings have collapsed, according to the Turkish disaster agency. The current death toll is sitting at about 16,546 people, on track to quickly hit 20,000.

Faculty and students share concerns and tips for surviving \u201cThe Big One.\u201d\n\nViews of Los Angeles on March 14, 2022. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Claire Sures, Matthew Tsai and Hunter Deniaud February 09, 2023 at 7:55 pm PST\n\nToday, the death toll for the Turkey-Syria earthquake hit 20,000. The devastating quake acts as an ominous reminder for Californians. \u201cThe Big One\u201d looms in the distance, but how far? \u201cWe cannot predict earthquakes,\u201d said USC professor of earth sciences Yehuda Ben-Zion. \u201cWe are never fully prepared.\u201d Yet the level of damage is calculable. A 2008 study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that a 7.8 magnitude earthquake, like the one that hit Turkey-Syria, would lead to thousands of deaths and injuries and $200 billion in damage here in Southern California.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not so much lack of knowledge of what needs to be done,\u201d Ben-Zion said. \u201cBut it comes with a price tag. So it\u2019s a political decision.\u201d In October 2015, California began regulating seismic protocols among 14,000 projects spread throughout California in an effort to ensure that homes, buildings and skyscrapers would be able to stand tall throughout a high magnitude quake. Large earthquakes are also a catalyst for landslides, tsunamis and ground ruptures, all of which can liquefy soil and break gas lines. Liquefaction can cause buildings to sink or collapse while broken gas lines can start fires, both further complicating the rescue and recovery process.\n\nBen-Zion said that California has better infrastructure, one that is more equipped to withstand earthquakes and the damage they cause, when compared to Turkey or Syria. However, there is still a lot to do. Strengthening structures, educating citizens and developing prediction technology are just a few of his suggestions. USC is taking heed. Each year, USC officials take part in \u201cThe Great Shakeout,\u201d a nationwide event promoting earthquake preparedness. This ensures that authorities know what to do in the event of an emergency and also keeps the USC earthquake preparedness policy up to date.\n\nSteve Goldfarb, the director of fire safety, emergency management and business continuity at USC, said that the department practices year-round preparedness. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of elements to our plan,\u201d Goldfarb said. \u201cPracticing drop, cover and hold on, our teams practicing their response, checking all of our supplies and equipment.\u201d Preparation in areas near a fault are especially crucial. Major earthquakes along the San Andreas fault happen every 200 to 300 years. The last big shock hit the fault in 1857. Los Angeles isn\u2019t directly on the fault line. San Andreas runs through Palmdale and San Bernandino \u2014 37 miles from L.A. But that might not leave L.A. in the clear.\n\nBen-Zion said that the Turkey-Syria earthquake occurred on a system of complex fault lines, very similar to the San Andreas fault. That means a quake at the fault can leave disastrous conditions that ripple far beyond the epicenter. The catastrophe can stretch for miles. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told that since [we were] kids and having gone through two earthquakes that have been quite large, I can say it is scary,\u201d Michelle Mendoza, a freshman from the Central Valley, said. \u201cIf I\u2019m inside my [Birnkrant] dorm, I would die because that place is so unsafe. The exits are bad, and we can\u2019t even use the stairs.\u201d\n\nFor students who have never felt an earthquake before, fear is distant. \u201cComing from New Jersey where we don\u2019t have earthquakes, [it] is something that I never thought or worried about,\u201d said sophomore Olivia Omelczuk. The USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning website has the most information on the school\u2019s plan. It details steps for students to take during the earthquake, aftershock, aftermath and evacuation. Goldfarb preached the necessity of students knowing what to do in emergency situations. \u201cWe\u2019re in Southern California, where earthquakes happen,\u201d Goldfarb said. \u201cWe know it, so we prepare for it.\u201d\n```"}

The 83 units can house up to 161 residents. The three year project represents a step forward to help the unhoused in L.A. Volunteers of America is a non-profit organization committed to serving people in need, strengthening families and building communities.\n\nToday\u2019s event unveiled Branford Village Tiny Homes \u2014 a partnership effort that also involved Los Angeles\u2019 6th District and Mayor Karen Bass.

Branford Village took a year to build. Disabled, high risk and 6th District residents take priority on the 125-person waiting list. The Branford Village was developed on a former unhoused encampment that is being transformed into a shelter with water, heat and food.\n\nThe leaders of this program aim to cultivate a family among clients and staff members through movie and game nights. Program coordinator Desiree Martin stated that, \u201cThere will be people coming on site to help those with substance abuse.\u201d Alexis Wesson, the Chief of Staff for the 6th District, said that her goal is to get shelter for as many unhoused neighbors as possible and provide wraparound services for them.\n\nWesson said they aim to take care of different needs, from \u201cmental health services, drug addiction services,\u201d to \u201cgetting a driver\u2019s license or an ID card.\u201d In addition, services like the Department of Motor Vehicles will be offered to the residents.\n\nThere were some challenges with building the site. The nearby train tracks spark noise and safety concerns. But Aura Garcia, a member of the Board of Public Works Commission, plans on \u201cbuilding out any type of temporary bridge to homes or any affordable long term permanent housing.\u201d\n\nWhile Garcia acknowledges that these are temporary homes that take time to construct, she thinks that these are important steps in the right direction. Empathy is the focus for the tiny home community. \u201cI know people experiencing homelessness. There\u2019s some trauma there,\u201d Martin said. She wants her staff to have amazing customer service and make sure all residents feel taken care of after experiencing this trauma. She reiterated, \u201cOur goal for everybody is permanent housing.\u201d\n\nResidents of Branford Village will be able to move in as soon as next week.\n```"}

In a conference call with investors yesterday, returning Disney CEO Bob Iger who had previously led the company from 2005 to 2020, announced a new structural plan for the company that aims to cut more than $5 billion in costs. He hopes to offset losses from Disney\u2019s streaming division of about 1 Billion dollars this past quarter. Disclosure: Mr. Iger is married to Willlow Bay the Dean of USC\u2019s Annenberg School.\n\nPart of Iger\u2019s plan is to lay off 7,000 Disney employees. That\u2019s about 4% of its global workforce. This, despite quarterly profit and revenue at Disney from all divisions except streaming. Overall profits last year exceeded the expectations of analysts. For example, Disney\u2019s U.S. theme parks reported slightly more than $2 billion dollars in profit last quarter. 36% higher than during the same quarter a year ago.\n\nIger also announced that Disney will reorganized into three divisions: Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and a Parks, Experience, and Products division. The Disney Entertainment division will consolidate content production and distribution of film and TV, which includes its streaming services. The two departments were previously separate.\n\nDavid Craig teaches Communications at Annenberg. He sees this restructuring as a return to basics. David Craig: So in a way, this was Iger returning to what has always been the core of Disney success, which is around creating intellectual property that can be monetized across all of their services and divisions.\n\nDisney\u2019s current top film executive, along with the current entertainment and television chief will join forces to lead the new Disney Entertainment division. They\u2019ll be tasked with quickly turning it around to bring the company more profit at a time when new players -- including tech companies with huge bankrolls are entering the streaming entertainment game.\n\nCraig believes that this is a reflection of the struggle between Hollywood and tech companies. David Craig: So that\u2019s what I mean by Silicon Valley has now not only entered into Hollywood and disrupted Hollywood, but by virtue of having massive capital and deep pockets as means to compete and swallow up Hollywood, not to erase Hollywood. So it\u2019s become a very competitive landscape now. We no longer live in the age of five or six media conglomerates. In fact, none of the media conglomerates even compare to those tech firms from Silicon Valley.\n\nOn the phone call with investors on Wednesday CEO Bob Iger said, \u201cWe will take a very hard look at the cost of everything we make across television and film.\u201d\n```"}

From renditions of melodic, soulful songs to energizing hard-hitting rap, the two artists delivered a dynamic performance while accompanied by a star-studded lineup of fellow musicians.\n\nThe two artists announced their co-headlining \u201cLuv is 4Ever\u201d tour back in early October, with all 32 stops sold out by the beginning of the tour. The news came on the heels of the release of J.I.D\u2019s widely acclaimed third studio album \u201cThe Forever Story\u201d in August, with Smino\u2019s third album \u201cLuv 4 Rent\u201d arriving about two weeks after the initial announcement.\n\nJ.I.D\u2019s return to the solo stage was particularly anticipated, since this is his first headlining tour since his \u201cCatch Me If You Can Tour\u201d in 2019.\n\nAtlanta-based rapper SwaVay was the first to perform and opened the show with a short set. Alternative R&B musician Schenay Mosley followed next, performing a few of her original songs.\n\nSmino then took to the stage with an energetic rendition of songs such as \u201cCurtains\u201d and the bouncy \u201cZ4L.\u201d A display screen made of two hearts switched between clips of him performing live and scenes from his music video for \u201cLee and Lovie\u201d from \u201cLuv 4 Rent,\u201d adding to the grooviness of the tracks.\n\nThe passion in his studio versions was just as present in his live performance, particularly the crooning at the beginning and end of \u201c90 Proof.\u201d Each track was accompanied by a live band, and the saxophonist and guitarist helped bring the jazz and neo-soul influences to life.\n\nFollowing several songs from \u201cLuv 4 Rent\u201d and \u201cNoir,\u201d Smino took it back to his roots with a slower-paced performance of \u201cWild Irish Roses,\u201d one of the most popular singles from his debut album \u201cblkswn.\u201d He and Mosley, who had provided backing vocals throughout the set, harmonized with low and high notes throughout the performance.\n\nSmino then amped up the energy of the set with an unreleased song that features Honorable C. Note and \u201cPro Freak,\u201d and he brought out rapper Doechii to perform her verse of the song. He showed off some of his quicker rapping abilities, and Doechii\u2019s spirited delivery elevated the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm.\n\nSmino neared the end of his set with \u201cAnita,\u201d another one of his top tracks from \u201cblkswn.\u201d The performance of \u201cAnita\u201d came as a welcome surprise, as he had not done it at previous shows, and the crowd cheered as soon as the familiar introductory beats played. Mosley\u2019s vocals particularly shined in this song, adding a soulful and feminine feel in tune with the spirit of the track, which is a tribute to Black women.\n\nThe last song of the set, \u201cNo L\u2019s\u201d from \u201cLuv 4 Rent,\u201d ended the performance on a high note. Smino\u2019s high energy and collected delivery prompted the crowd to bob their heads and jump up and down, preparing them for J.I.D\u2019s set.\n\nThe heart-shaped screens flashed red and blue, indicating J.I.D\u2019s soon-to-be entrance. J.I.D began his set on a more introspective note, starting with \u201cGalaxy,\u201d the introduction to \u201cThe Forever Story.\u201d He maintained a collected demeanor, making sure to hype up the audience while showcasing his signature flow in \u201cNever.\u201d\n\nMembers of the crowd cheer for Smino\u2019s performance.\n\nJ.I.D then transitioned to a more mellow section of his set, delivering an emotional performance of \u201cKody Blue 31\u2032\u2032 as the crowd waved their hands to the lyrics \u201cSwang on, swang on.\u201d J.I.D emphasized that the song was an important moment in the show.\n\nTo keep with the reflective theme of the middle of his performance, J.I.D brought out his first surprise guest of the night, English musician James Blake. After the two artists performed a song together, J.I.D stepped to the side of the stage and asked Blake to perform one of his favorite tracks. The audience waited in anticipation, cheering as soon as they heard the familiar humming of Blake\u2019s \u201cRetrograde.\u201d\n\nAs Blake continued the song, a rapture fell over the crowd. Despite the size of the venue, J.I.D preserved the intimacy of his earlier solo shows by leaning in towards his audience and bringing the emotions of his tracks to life with his powerful stage presence.\n\nHe performed songs from his previous two albums \u201cDiCaprio 2\u2032\u2032 and \u201cThe Never Story\u201d with a passion that elevated them beyond their already well-produced recorded versions.\n\nAs he began the first few verses of \u201cStars,\u201d white lights beamed up from below the stage and sparkling deep blue skies appeared on the display screens. A blanket of soft pinkish-red light drifted over the audience, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere to finish this part of the show.\n\nJ.I.D pauses during a performance of \u201c2007,\u201d during which he narrated several of his memories and struggles in the preliminary stages of his career.\n\nOf course, J.I.D had to end his set with some of his characteristic lyrical, hard-hitting rap tracks. He announced to the crowd that the show was going to go from 9 to 10 with the next song. During \u201cOff Deez,\u201d a song that features legendary rapper J. Cole, whose label Dreamville Records he is signed to, J.I.D showed off his fast rapping abilities and elevated up the tempo and energy of the concert even more.\n\nSpeaking of Dreamville Records, J.I.D surprised the crowd again by bringing out long-time collaborators EARTHGANG, who he met when they were both students at Hampton University. The musicians are part of an artist collective called Spillage Village and have released several joint projects in the past several years.\n\nThis time, they performed \u201cMeditate\u201d from EARTHGANG\u2019s 2017 EP \u201cRags.\u201d They followed this up with a guest appearance by Bas, another Dreamville artist. The crowd bounced up and down as the four rappers performed \u201cDown Bad,\u201d a single from the 2019 Dreamville collaborative album \u201cRevenge of the Dreamers III.\u201d\n\nAfter J.I.D continued the show with \u201cSurround Sound,\u201d another high energy track from \u201cThe Forever Story,\u201d he indicated that he would be stepping into the crowd and asked audience members in the first few rows to support him. Mosh pits had already formed before the iconic trumpet notes of \u201cStick\u201d blasted through the venue, and the crowd roared as they chanted the chorus.\n\nEARTHGANG, who had briefly gone back to the wings, came back on stage, and encouraged the crowd even more. \u201cStick\u201d featured an intense electric guitar interlude and extended drum solo.\n\nJ.I.D had taken the crowd through a rollercoaster of emotions, finishing up on the highest note possible. As the crowd came down from the post-mosh energy surge and made their way out of the venue, many said that this was the best show they had ever been to.\n\nWith the dynamism and stage presences of both Smino and J.I.D, coupled with complimentary visuals and surprise guests, the first LA show of the duo\u2019s tour was a night to remember \u201c4ever.\u201d```"}

The California Shakeout scenario shows that California\u2019s earthquake-centered infrastructure may prevent losses, but Angelinos should still stay prepared.\n\nBy Spencer Cline and Hali Mecklin February 09, 2023 at 5:51 pm PST\n\nLast week\u2019s 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey has worried Californians who acknowledge that things like In-n-Out, Hollywood celebrities, and yearlong beach weather come at the cost of living on one of the most active sets of fault lines in the world. As of today, over 20,000 people have died in the earthquake that hit Turkey and Northern Syria, with that number still expanding each day. The rescue and aid efforts by other nations are still ongoing, and are expected to last for months.\n\nBut that still leaves the question on a lot of people\u2019s minds: What would an earthquake the magnitude of the one experienced in Turkey look like in the state of California? In other words, what will be the aftermath of \u201cThe Big One\u201d? In 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey published a study called the ShakeOut Scenario. It tells the story on what would happen if a 7.8 earthquake hit Southern California on the San Andreas Fault.\n\nThe simulation played out as the most fatal natural disaster in American history with over 1,800 dead and 50,000 injured. Los Angeles County would suffer the most fatalities with over 1,000 dead, followed by Orange County with 350 dead. Trans-state infrastructure including the 15 and the 10 freeways could be destroyed, and nearly 1 million people could be displaced from their homes. Those who do still have a house standing may not have power, gas or even cell service. It\u2019s estimated the damages would total $200 billion.\n\nThe initial shaking would only last about a minute in the earliest hit areas, but it would bring with it tens of thousands of aftershocks that would last months after the quake. The first major aftershock, only 17 hours after the earthquake, would have a massive impact with an estimated 7.2 magnitude; Almost as bad as the first one.\n\nSince this simulation has ran, Californian schools have participated in the great ShakeOut drill in preparation for an event like this, and buildings have been built to withstand high magnitude earthquakes- Turkey\u2019s infrastructure was not earthquake-proofed, which has contributed to the disastrous death toll.\n\nThe purpose of the ShakeOut Scenario isn\u2019t just to fearmonger, but to prepare Californians for an incident that may be just around the corner.\n```"}

According to the group, the former director of admissions has significantly contributed to diversifying the program and the field itself.\n\nAt USC, Anvarizadeh (or Dr. A, as she is called by students in the division) was dedicated to diversifying the program and creating a more equitable space, members of the collective say. With her no longer directing, students feel her efforts in diversity are also gone.\n\nIn the seven months since the announcement, USC occupational therapy students and faculty have organized and rallied to reinstate Anvarizadeh as director of admissions. On February 1, the collective launched its Instagram account with the intention of creating a space for people to express their frustrations at Anvarizadeh\u2019s demotion and calling faculty to action. The account had over 700 followers, as of the publication of this article.\n\n\u201cJustice for Dr. Anvarizadeh,\u201d the collective wrote in their first post. \u201cAfter bringing in the most diverse class of students in USC Chan history, Dr. Arameh Anvarizadeh was unilaterally removed (by Associate Dean and Chair Grace Baranek & Associate Chair for Curriculum and Faculty Julie McLaughlin Gray) from her role as [d]irector of [a]dmissions, while on protected medical leave after maternity leave. This decision has brought concerns about systemic racism, gender oppression, and ableism to the forefront at USC Chan, the \u2018#1\u2032 Occupational Therapy school in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe post had over 3,000 likes as of the publication of this story. Anvarizadeh is not part of the collective and she chose not to comment when asked by Annenberg Media.\n\nThe collective listed four demands in a post on their Instagram, in what they believe is the pursuit of \u201cgenuine accountability and justice\u201d for Anvarizadeh. They demand the resignation of associate dean and chair Grace Baranek & associate chair for curriculum and faculty Julie McLaughlin Gray, which the collective says were the ones who made the decision to remove Anvarizadeh as director.\n\nThe collective also asks for a public apology from Baranek and McLaughlin and for the reinstatement of Anvarizadeh as director of admissions, if she wants the position back. In the case that she doesn\u2019t they ask that she should oversee the process of appointing a new director.\n\nThe collective argues that her role in diversity can be best described by her actions. Outside of her role at USC, Anvarizadeh is the co-founder and chair of the Coalition of Occupational Therapy Advocates for Diversity (COTAD), a non-profit that teaches leaders in occupational therapy to use practices that increase diversity, equity, inclusion, justice and anti-oppression.\n\nAnvarizadeh is also the youngest and first Black and Iranian woman to become vice president of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA).\n\nDuring her time as director of admissions, Anvarizadeh set out to establish a more holistic admissions process, she said in a 2020 USC Chan Youtube video. \u201c[Hollistic admissions is] just not looking at your test scores, your GRE ... but [it\u2019s] looking at other aspects of who you are. That\u2019s looking at your core values, your thoughts about diversity, equity, inclusion. Your thoughts about healthcare related issues on the systemic level, your thoughts [on] your leadership,\u201d Anvarizadeh said. \u201cWe want to know all of you and we want to know all factors of you that make you a great OT.\u201d\n\nOne of the elements added to USC\u2019s application process during Anvarizadeh\u2019s time as director was a personal video statement, where applicants had the opportunity to \u201cpresent themselves holistically in front of a camera,\u201d Anvarizadeh said in the video. \u201cYou\u2019ll also have the opportunity to write, but you also have the opportunity to show who you are.\u201d\n\nFor the new admissions cycle for fall of 2023, USC Chan removed the personal video statement, which they say is due to a switch to rolling admissions.\n\nThis effort to make admissions more holistic is one of the main reasons students and faculty are rallying to reinstate Anvarizadeh, they say.\n\nDejaney Clark, an occupational therapy master\u2019s student, was one of the students who sought further information about Anvarizadeh\u2019s demotion. In the fall 2022 semester, she was part of a group of students who wrote an open letter to the occupational therapy division, expressing their concerns about the change in leadership.\n\n\u201cAs students who were admitted through the holistic admissions process, spearheaded by Dr. Arameh Anvarizadeh, we are invested in continuing the efforts to increase diversity both within the Division and in the profession at large,\u201d the letter read.\n\nThe Division of Occupational Therapy\u2019s faculty took a month to reply, according to the collective. \u201cWe really wanted to have a dialogue. We wanted to know more. We wanted to understand why this was happening?\u201d Clark said.\n\nIn November 2022, the Division held a student forum so students could express their concerns and the university could respond. Around 100 students were there, according to assistant professor of clinical occupational therapy Janis Yue.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just how many students felt impacted by it,\u201d Yue said.\n\nMost university students probably don\u2019t know who their director of admissions is, but occupational therapy masters and Ph.D. at USC students are the exceptions, the collective says.\n\n\u201cI think about the leadership team [at USC], and I don\u2019t know them. They don\u2019t know me. They don\u2019t know the students,\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut how can you lead a student body and not know the student body? I think that\u2019s very problematic.\u201d\n\nBut that does not apply to Anvarizadeh, Clark says. \u201cThe one thing about Dr. Anvarizadeh that was different is the fact that she knew us. She knew every single one of us. Even when I was applying to the program, she took the time to meet with me over and over and over again, answer my questions [and] make me feel comfortable,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThose conversations are honestly the only reason why I\u2019m at USC in the first place.\u201d\n\nClark is not the only one with this type of story. Before Yue joined the faculty last year, she was a graduate student at USC, where she also completed her undergraduate studies.\n\n\u201cI think, on the one hand, it\u2019s really a testament to how many genuine relationships Dr. A has really built with students,\u201d Yue said. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve gotten involved in this cause and really learned about a lot more students\u2019 stories, so many students have told me, \u2018Dr. A was the person that I talk to,\u2019 \u2018I asked questions when I was applying to this program and she always made time for me and never made me feel like I was a burden.\u2019 And she just really created [a] safe environment for students.\u201d\n\nBoth Yue and Clark argued this type of commitment allowed for a more diverse class of occupational therapy students under Anvarizadeh. Yue attended the OT program as a student from 2018 to 2021 and Anvarizadeh joined the admissions team in 2019. Yue said her class of 145, admitted before Anvarizadeh took over as director of admissions, only had two Black students.\n\nYue believes since Anvarizadeh has been gone, there\u2019s been a visible decrease in diversity among admitted students. Clark shares a similar view. Clark believes that before she started her program there was a notable jump in the number of Black students.\n\n\u201cObviously, there was a big jump because Dr. Anvarizadeh put in the work to make sure that we felt comfortable to be here and we felt like we belonged,\u201d Clark said.\n\nAlthough Clark noticed the diversity in the occupational therapy student body when she first arrived at USC, she also noticed it fall once Anvarizadeh was gone.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Black students that we saw. It was all identities. It was the LGBT community. It was Latinx students, it was disabled students, it was veterans. It was all identities represented in my class,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd literally the year after, when she was on maternity leave and there [were] other people doing admissions, it was, I think, all the way down to maybe eight Black students. And I think that that pattern is probably just going to continue and go back down.\u201d\n\nIn a statement made by the USC Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy regarding the claims made by the collective, the Division said: \u201cThe USC Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy cherishes diversity in both its workforce and student body. We have met with faculty, staff, and students to hear their concerns, and will continue discussing with them how the school can build on its efforts to advance equity, inclusion, and diversity. The university must respect its employees\u2019 privacy rights and we therefore cannot discuss individual personnel matters.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Media requested data on the demographics of admitted and current students of the occupational therapy program multiple times, but USC was not able to provide any information and responded by sending university-wide demographics which do not specifically reflect the student body of the occupational therapy program.\n\nClark argues that within occupational therapy, the discussion of diversity cannot only be about diversity in the classroom because a lack of diversity in the classroom also means a lack of diversity in healthcare.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t allow students of diverse backgrounds into these programs, then we can no longer be practitioners. And then that means there\u2019s fewer practitioners in hospitals and in outpatient settings who can actually be there for a diverse group of patients and make a difference in the field,\u201d Clark said.\n\nThe occupational therapy professional field is predominantly white, as the group represents 82.5% of all OTs, according to a 2022 report from the American Journal of Occupational Therapy.\n\n\u201cI have grandparents who have been mistreated in health care systems because of their income status and because of their ethnicities, and it hurt.,\u201d Clark said. \" That\u2019s why I went into the field in the first place of occupational therapy because I am very passionate about all individuals having access to health care and a quality lifestyle. \"\n\nMore information on the collective\u2019s demands can be found in their group\u2019s public petition.\n```"}
