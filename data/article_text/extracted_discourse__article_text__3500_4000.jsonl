(AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi\nFebruary 09, 2023 at 3:59 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d is a column by Curran Rastogi about college basketball teams and their journeys to March Madness.\n\nIf you look up the word \u201cunderachieving\u201d in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, you\u2019ll find the last seven years of Indiana University\u2019s men\u2019s basketball program. The Hoosiers, a \u2018blue blood\u2019 of college basketball, watched the NCAA tournament from their couches for six of the last seven years. Last year in their appearance at the Big Dance, they got embarrassed, losing by 29 to Saint Mary\u2019s.\n\nHowever, the Hoosiers are coming off a five-point win against bitter in-state rivals: the No. 1 Purdue Boilermakers. The Hoosiers are on the precipice of changing the trajectory of their program.\n\nRedshirt junior forward Trayce Jackson-Davis is back and better than ever, having a consensus All-American season averaging almost 19.8 points per game and 11 rebounds per game. Jackson-Davis\u2019 supporting cast has stepped up as well this year, and the Hoosiers are playing at a completely different level.\n\nLast season, the team\u2019s offense was completely flat, ranking 95th in the nation in offensive efficiency according to KenPom and shooting 43% from the field, good for 11th in the Big Ten. The team was also 11th in points per game and shot 32% from behind the arc.\n\nHowever, this year they score the second most points in the Big Ten and shoot 47.6% from the field. Their offense ranks 18th in the nation.\n\nNo one epitomizes this offensive remontada than redshirt senior forward Miller Kopp. Kopp transferred from Northwestern to provide Indiana with much-needed three point shooting; he struggled most of last year shooting 36% from three, but this year he\u2019s up to 44%.\n\nTo pair with Kopp, three Hoosier guards in the rotation shoot over 40% from three: freshman Jalen Hood-Schifino, sophomore Tamar Bates and redshirt sophomore Trey Galloway.\n\nThe other big key to their improvement this year is their recruiting class. Hood-Schifino, freshmen forwards Malik Reneu and Kaleb Banks headlined the No. 10 recruiting class in the nation according to 247Sports composite. Hood-Schifino and Reneu have become key cogs in the machine with Hood-Schifino becoming the team\u2019s primary playmaker in absence of redshirt senior guard Xavier Johnson.\n\nHood-Schifino is a gifted scorer as well, with 33 points against Northwestern and 24 against Ohio State. He can be a legitimate second option for the Hoosiers and prevent opposing teams from devoting all their resources to stopping Jackson-Davis.\n\nThe Hoosiers\u2019 biggest obstacle for the rest of the year will be shaking off inconsistency. This has been a problem in recent years where good stretches have not translated into success in March. This is also partly due to the nature of the Big Ten. The conference is the most physical in the nation, with players constantly driving into contact against some of the best interior defenders in the nation.\n\nThis can leave teams exhausted during March after going through the gauntlet, including playing in some very hostile environments. It remains to be seen how the Hoosiers will play in March and whether or not they continue the trend of the Big Ten\u2019s lackluster performance in the Big Dance.\n\nHowever, head coach Mike Woodson seems to understand the physicality the Big Ten brings and the need to bring it on a consistent basis. In December, Woodson took his red-hot team, fresh off a victory against North Carolina, to Piscataway to face Rutgers. The team was flat and Woodson said after the game, \u201cWe just got out-toughed tonight.\u201d\n\nWhen the Scarlet Knicks came to Bloomington, how did Indiana respond? They \u2018out-toughed\u2019 them right back. Jackson-Davis racked up 18 rebounds including six on the offensive glass and Indiana held two of Rutgers\u2019s best players to two points each.\n\nIn a game where the Hoosiers could have capitulated, they were strong, ending a six-game losing streak. The Hoosiers do have everything needed to make a run in March \u2014 an All-American to be relied upon, a legitimate second option, good shooters around the team and a strong defense.\n\nCurrently projected as a fifth seed, the Hoosiers are on the opposite side of where they were one year ago and can feel confident about earning an NCAA tournament bid. If they manage to avoid the fifth-seed upset that has become commonplace in March Madness, an Elite Eight run is very likely.\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

To most, it is fantasy. But to Kait Devir, it is a reality, one that started as a hobby in middle school.\n\nUsing her middle school allowance, Devir scrounged together enough money to buy a GoPro. In high school, her passion for editing overlapped with the sport she played since the fifth grade: lacrosse.\n\n\u201cI started using video editing \u2014 it was this app called \u2018Sprongo\u2019 \u2014 for ski-racing,\u201d Devir said. \u201cAs I was exposed to watching video of my sport, I got really interested in just filming more.\u201d\n\nIn ninth grade, she tried out for STEPS Elite, one of the most recognized programs in New Jersey. Her first task was to choose her position.\n\n\u201cI ended up choosing goalie that day, and I\u2019m thankful that I did,\u201d Devir said. \u201cThat club team was what made me fall in love with the sport. Having that first-hand, I knew that I needed that at the next level.\u201d\n\nAfter a successful career at Ridgewood High School, where she recorded over 100 saves, Devir was recruited by Boston College to play in one of the most prestigious lacrosse programs in the country.\n\nAt Boston College, Devir put her camera to work at The Heights, Boston College\u2019s student-run newspaper. Halfway through her freshman year, the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the world. Almost every aspect of college was shut down. Classes moved to the digital realm. Athletes played sports in empty venues. But Devir saw an opportunity.\n\nShe saw the empty stadiums as a place to build her portfolio and photograph several sports no one else on the paper wanted to do.\n\n\u201cI would go shoot tennis, I would go shoot soccer, I would go shoot baseball,\u201d Devir said. \u201cI would shoot all the other sports that [the editors] didn\u2019t want to shoot. I think that\u2019s what made me so dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic also cut her freshmen season short. But in 2021, Devir appeared in two games and made a save against Fairfield University in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. When she wasn\u2019t playing, Devir documented her team\u2019s journey to the NCAA Lacrosse National Championship from Media Day to the team\u2019s final victory over Syracuse.\n\n\u201cJust about every other travel weekend, I was vlogging,\u201d Devir said. While on the road, \u201cI learned a lot, I picked a lot of brains with social media managers and creative directors.\u201d\n\nDevir joined Athletes Unlimited, a women\u2019s sports league, and propelled the company to new levels of exposure online. During Devir\u2019s tenure, the company gained 40,000 new followers across Instagram and Twitter in eight months.\n\nDevir\u2019s rapid rise leading up to her junior year led her to a more favorable market. Devir\u2019s destination would be USC, a school she dreamt to be at ever since she picked up her goalie stick.\n\n\u201cI visited USC back in the summer of eighth grade before they even had a village,\u201d Devir said. \u201cI always dreamed of going to the USC film school. I think that GoPro, Sprongo, ski-racing kid always wanted the USC film school. The ability to be in Los Angeles and be a content creator is so important for me. Just being here, I\u2019ve grown so much as a content creator.\u201d\n\nAt USC, she continues to vlog her life with the lacrosse team, posting game-day recaps, gear hauls and other behind-the-scenes content.\n\nDevir also grew as a lacrosse player. In her junior year, Devir started in all but one game, ranked 26th in the NCAA with a Goals Against Average of 10.98 and earned two Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week honors.\n\n\u201cShe brings the energy,\u201d said Devir\u2019s teammate Ella Heaney. \u201cShe\u2019s the most hardworking person on our team.\u201d\n\nThis season, she has high expectations for her team and herself.\n\n\u201cI want our team to literally be the best us,\u201d Devir said. \u201cWe have an insane amount of talent on this team, and people don\u2019t talk about it much. For me, being an upperclassman, playing in that role of leadership is really big for me.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the future hold for Devir? She says she wants to continue promoting women\u2019s sports. But other than that, anything is fair game.\n\n\u201cYes, I want to work for the NFL, but I also want to take the freelancer route and shoot a little bit of everything,\u201d Devir said. \u201cI also want to travel, and I have crazy fitness goals where I want to do Ironmans and Ultra Marathons. There\u2019s not really much I don\u2019t want to do. I\u2019m just ambitious, and I want to fulfill the most out of my life.\u201d\n```"}

It\u2019s a Shakespearean tragedy that plays on the century old curse of star crossed lovers. But, before there was Juliet, there was Do\u00f1a Carmen, Vanushka and many more protagonists from Latin America that star in love-lore. For this Valentine\u2019s Day, here are some of the most infamous love stories from across Latin America that still live on today through landmarks and storytelling:\n\nEl Callej\u00f3n del Beso Guanajuato, Mexico\nThere is a beautiful alleyway in the heart of Guanajuato where lovers visit and must kiss on the third step so their love could last forever. The reason for this superstition stems from the story of Do\u00f1a Carmen and her lover, Don Luis. Carmen was an only child to a greedy father that wanted to marry her to someone rich, but she fell in love with a poor miner named Luis. Carmen and Luis would meet in secret until her father caught them and locked her up in her room, waiting to marry her off to a Spanish nobleman. Luis, in agony, would walk around Carmen\u2019s home, and that\u2019s when he noticed her window was a mere few inches from a window across the street. He gave up all his life savings and bought the house next to Carmen\u2019s and would regularly court Carmen through the window. One night, however, her father found them kissing, and in a rage, put a dagger in his daughter\u2019s chest, killing her. Luis, before jumping off the building and dying, gave Carmen one last kiss on the hand. Thus, a legend began.\n\nStory of Vanushka Quetzaltenango, Guatemala\nThere is a tomb in Guatemala where people visit and leave flowers and a note, with the hopes that the offering will reunite the person with their lover. The name on the tomb is Vanushka. Vanushka moved from Eastern Europe to Guatemala to perform in the circus and make money. During one of her performances, a wealthy man named Javier became entranced by her beauty. After the show they began to court each other, which lasted several weeks; however, Javier\u2019s family did not approve. Javier was forced to leave for university in Spain. In the absence of her lover, Vanushka became ill and died of a broken heart. Her tomb became a famous spot since then.\n\nLegend of Bibosi and Motac\u00fa Santa Cruz, Bolivia\nDeep in the Bolivian forest, there is a type of tree which grows and twists around other trees, killing them, called bibosi. But the origin story of these trees is what captures many tourists. A long time ago, a hard working man fell in love with a beautiful girl, and they began to see each other. When her parents found out, they arranged for the girl to marry someone else. On their last night together, the star-crossed couple met in the middle of the night to talk one last time and cry. During their final embrace, they cried and hugged so strongly that they died intertwined in each other. Locals say that the first bibosi and motach\u00fa grew intertwined on the spot where the couple died.\n\nThe love story of Huascar\u00e1n and Huandoy mountains Ancash, Peru\nThe story begins with the expansion of the Cusco people during the Inca Empire. The chief of the tribe, who inhabited the land at the time, went to negotiate peace and came back with Cusque\u00f1o warrior Hu\u00e1scar. During his stay with the peaceful tribe, Hu\u00e1scar met a beautiful woman who happened to be the daughter of the chief, whose name was Huandy. They ran away, knowing they could never be together, due to their tribal conflicts. The chief ordered their capture and imprisoned them. He tied them to wooden logs where they could watch each other die. They cried until they both were dry. The tears of Hunday created Lake Chinancocha and the tears of Hu\u00e1scar created Lake Orcococha. The sun god, Inti, observed their pain and sent storms to the area so that their bodies would be covered, eventually forming the snow-covered mountains Huascar\u00e1n (Hu\u00e1scar) and Huandoy (Huandy).\n\nSo although the most famous star-crossed lovers story may be Romeo and Juliet, there were many predecessors that were crucial to the folklore and establishment of Latin American traditions.\n```"}

In light of this tragedy, the USC Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly held a community check-in at their lounge on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOur community continues to stay invisible,\u201d said Anthony Khoory, a senior sociology major and co-executive director of MENASA whose family is from southern Turkey and northern Syria. Khoory expressed his frustration with what he considers to be the university\u2019s minimal response and support to students, many of whom are grieving family, friends and communities that were lost in the disaster.\n\nThe community check-in was intended for students to gather and seek strength from each other, according to Khoory. He sees MENASA\u2019s programs as essential for students who are struggling during this time. The organization works closely with Turkish and Syrian students to determine the best organizations to aid their families and friends in crisis.\n\nThe Office of International Affairs sent an email to international students from Syria and Turkey with resources and support on Monday. Turkish American and Syrian American students were left in the dark, exposing a larger problem.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have data on who is Middle Eastern. They just put us in the white category and forget about us,\u201d Khoory said. Khoory is not surprised. \u201cHow are they supposed to help when they\u2019re so disconnected?\u201d Khoory said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know about our people. They don\u2019t know about our region. They\u2019re not necessarily asking.\u201d\n\nThis absence of data has made it exceedingly harder for MENASA to reach all those in their community. Co-executive director of MENASA Nour Myra Geha spoke to her frustration about that lack.\n\n\u201cWe have no way of reaching out to these students, specifically who are American citizens, because in the census we\u2019re still considered white,\u201d Geha said. While they are imploring the university to provide more sufficient support, MENASA\u2019s mission to give their members a support system and community has become even more vital.\n\nGeha said MENASA will be a community that you can rely on in USC\u2019s absence. \u201cWe lack the most essential thing for the MENA community on campus, which is specialized therapies,\u201d Geha said. Khoory echoed this sentiment and desire for Keck to offer a therapist of Middle Eastern and North African descent for students. He expressed the importance of having someone to talk to who truly understands the region and can support students when crises occur.\n\nWith death tolls rising and more information about the destruction of the Turkey-Syria region being released, the directors of MENASA are calling on USC to issue a more significant response such as a statement, a donation or something that would reach the entire student body.\n\n\u201cI know so many students on campus that haven\u2019t even heard about this gigantic earthquake that took more than 2000 lives,\u201d Geha said. Omer Serbetci, a graduate student and member of the Turkish Graduate Student Association, is from the region where the earthquake struck. Although he received an email from the university, he wishes it has been sent to the whole USC community and is actively trying to get in contact with USC, sending several emails pleading with the university to spread awareness on the severity of the devastations and deaths.\n\n\u201cAny help is important,\u201d Serbetci said. \u201cImmediate action is very urgent.\u201d The earthquake struck in the middle of an exceptionally harsh winter, leaving many to bear the weather without water or electricity. Serbetci hopes to see leadership within the university do something bigger and support their students who are most vulnerable to this type of emotional stress.\n\nWhen asked about the grievances expressed by MENASA, the Office of International Services provided Annenberg with the following statement: \u201cOn Monday, the Office of International Services contacted F-1 and J-1 international students and scholars from Turkey and Syria with a message of support and condolence and provided a list of campus resources available to assist students needing additional support, including counseling services through Student Health and support from Campus Support and Intervention.\u201d\n\nTo support MENASA and those impacted by the tragedy, keep an eye out for their fundraiser later this week.\n```"}

From winners, to nominees, to presenters, the Trojan family was all over.\n\nTwo current Trojan students in particular, sophomore Thornton student Jade Bacon and USC Annenberg student Roy Gantz, presented Grammys to winners such as Best New Artist recipient Samara Joy and recent EGOT recipient Viola Davis. Bacon and Gantz are a part of GrammyU, a program that the Recording Academy created for current college-students that are interested in breaking into the industry. Gantz is a campus ambassador for GrammyU while Bacon is the Los Angeles student representative.\n\nThe program has a multitude of events that expose its members to elements of the industry that include business, technology and the creative process. Nationally, the group is managed by Jessie Allen and the students who make up the program are all called GrammyU representatives.\n\n\u201cGrammyU really was really just a program that represented itself as the perfect way to get into the music industry,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cMy professors freshman year advised me to do it along with other mentors I had, so that\u2019s what really pushed me to join.\u201d\n\nBacon, a jazz voice major at USC Thornton, presented actress and producer Viola Davis with her Grammy for Best Audiobook, making her an EGOT. This honor is given to an artist who has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award. EGOT status has only been given out 18 times with past recipients including singer-songwriter John Legend, actress Audrey Hepburn and actor Mel Brooks.\n\nAlong with contributing to the Grammys, Bacon has other responsibilities that include attending various events for the Los Angeles chapter of the Recording Academy. \u201cWe do everything from sound checks to industry panels, and meeting with Recording Academy board members,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cWe also have a mentorship program that I facilitate where people can sign up to be mentored by the official Recording Academy members of their chapter.\u201d\n\nGantz, a public relations major at USC Annenberg, discovered the program online and wanted to get involved. He cherished the opportunity to award 23-year-old Samara Joy her first career Grammy award, he said.\n\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s like God on a mountain,\u201d Gantz said, \u201cbut when you see a person, like a real person in front of you, win an award like that and react how I would react, you know, it\u2019s just like such a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nBeing at the Grammys also gave Gantz an opportunity to get an up-close-and-personal experience seeing Joy\u2019s reaction to winning her first Grammy. \u201cWe go backstage after and she just collapsed and she\u2019s like, \u2018What is life? How did I just do this?\u2019 And that was so humanizing,\u201d Gantz said. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s in front of you just gives you this different level of understanding of what this is.\u201d\n\nAnastazja Ball, a sophomore studying media arts and practice, has been able to come across new opportunities through GrammyU to help her in pursuing her career as a DJ. Being able to DJ at the recent GrammyU event allowed Ball to step out of her comfort zone and come into her own as a DJ. \u201cI was playing a lot of Grammy nominated songs, but I almost took that as a challenge,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIt was really fun to see a different group of people and talk to a new crowd.\u201d\n\nGantz and Bacon weren\u2019t the only Trojans showing out at the Grammys, many current professors and alumni were nominated and even came home with some awards. Jazz faculty member Vice Mendoza won his eighth Grammy this year for Best Arrangement for instruments and vocals for \u201cSongbird\u201d with Christine McVie. Mendoza has been nominated for awards 35 times.\n\nUSC alum Bijon Watson won his first ever Grammy, winning for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album as a part of the Generation Gap Jazz Orchestra.\n\nThose at the awards ceremony witnessed a few memorable moments such as Harry Styles\u2019 album \u201cHarry\u2019s House\u201d winning album of the year and Beyonc\u00e9 winning four Grammys. With 32 Grammys over the span of her career, she broke the record for most Grammys won by any artist, previously held by classical conductor Georg Solti.\n```"}

What was the first thing your father said to you after his assault? What would your father think of the state of today\u2019s world?\u201d she asked.\n\nEach question was followed with an in-depth response by the virtual Lora King.\n\nThe concept is inspired by the work of the Dimensions in Testimony exhibit, a USC Shoah Foundation project through which visitors can virtually interact with Holocaust survivors with the use of advanced recording and display technology.\n\nIn response to a lack of information and data about police brutality following the Rodney King beating, Allissa Richardson, founder of the Charlotta Bass Journalism and Justice Lab at USC, said she aimed to highlight frontline testimonies of Black social justice leaders and their families, including King and her father\u2019s impact on propelling the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nWhile developing the project, Richardson, Myah Genung, chief program officer of the lab and members from the USC Digital Repository flew out to Florida and spoke with Lora King for more than six hours.\n\nKing painstakingly recounted the traumatic day of her father\u2019s beating on March 3, 1991, and explained how it affected her then 8-year-old self and the rest of the world.\n\nEstella Norris, director of operations for the Black and veteran-owned nonprofit organization Inglewood 2nd Call, expressed her gratitude for the impact that can be made from events like \u201cVoices of a Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAwareness is everything, so this was a great opportunity,\u201d Norris said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s going to be more opportunities for people to grow and understand what took place on that specific day.\u201d\n\nGenung pointed to the recent police beating and killing of Tyre Nichols by Memphis Police Department officers on January 7; she said that although the LAPD beating took place over 30 years ago, racial policing and state violence persist to this day.\n\n\u201c[We] are not all removed from the systemic injustices that claimed the lived experiences of Black America,\u201d Genung said.\n\nKing emphasized the importance of \u201cThe Second Draft Project\u201d as a way to convey who her father actually was, rather than the racialized stereotype of an aggressive substance abuser the mainstream media made him out to be.\n\nKing also expressed that these racialized narratives, in conjunction with increasingly common and deadly incidents of police brutality, should have been relics of a distant past.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not downplaying what happened to my dad, but to me, it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d King said. \u201cWe should not still be here.

Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, \u201cwhich is the largest naming donation for the School of Pharmacy of California,\u201d Folt said. Another $80 million will be used to support the USC Alfred E. Mann Institute as it accelerates biomedical technology and creates commercially successful medical products, according to the letter.\n\nThis endowment will further enable the School of Pharmacy to continue its tradition of innovative research, programming, collaboration and to support pharmaceutical students\u2019 growth. \u201cUSC had given me countless opportunities that exceeded all of my expectations as a first-generation college student and as a first-generation immigrant,\u201d Renita Moradian, a fourth-year doctor of pharmacy candidate, said at the ceremony. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know at the time is the extent to which I would continue to change and grow.\u201d\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s ceremony, Folt told the crowd about Mann\u2019s belief in USC and how the school has rewarded that faith with years of success. \u201cThese are very special moments,\u201d Folt said. \u201cWhat stands out to me is that we had a gift from an amazing innovator. [Mann was] probably the leading person in Southern California way ahead of his time. And he bet on USC and we\u2019re able to take that amazing bet and make it even more relevant for today.\u201d\n\nThe renaming of the now USC Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences marks a new stage to keep innovating and creating new opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry that helps so many people in the world. \u201cOur new name, I think, opens up the next chapter for us, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to do even more than what we\u2019ve already been doing for our students,\u201d Moradian said. \u201cI\u2019m just really excited to see the future of the school just because they\u2019ve already done so much.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Philip Salata)\n\nBy Samuel Spitz, Jacob Wheeler, and Jane Walgren\nFebruary 08, 2023 at 6:18 pm PST\n\nLast week, legendary groundhog Punxsutawney Phil declared six more weeks of winter. Southern California appears to have ignored his forecast. California winters are typically more mild than in colder regions, but January stunned residents with turbulent winter weather. Gusty winds, record rainfall and deadly flooding killed 22 people up and down the Golden State, the L.A. Times said. However, at the flip of the calendar month, February has offered a glimpse of the spring season. Blooming trees and rays of sunshine have unleashed a sense of spring fever.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling than walking outside to a sunny day.\u201d said Ben Meyers, a freshman studying business administration. Meyers, who is originally from Philadelphia, said he was shocked by the wave of beautiful weather, especially in February. \u201cIn Philly, it\u2019s most likely just going to be bitterly cold and probably not even going to snow that much,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be brutal.\u201d\n\nStudents said that one of the most charming appeals about USC is its location and the sunny Southern California weather. For freshman engineering major Monira Alkidim, who journeyed to USC from Kuwait, the sunshine reminds her of home. \u201cBecause we have harsh winters and harsh summers,\u201d Alkidim said. \u201cSo this is like in the middle \u2014 it\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nWestern New York, currently under a high wind warning, stands out as one of the coldest places during winter. Elisa Xia, a junior studying communication from New York, said she loves the sunny weather. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m looking for housing. I\u2019m always looking for a spot that has good sunlight because it just energizes me,\u201d Xia said. \u201cI used to live in a Gateway \u2014 there was never any sunlight coming in because my unit was facing the parking structure, so I felt like I was living in a dungeon.\u201d\n\nSitting outside on a beautiful day, to many, is medicine for the soul. Just being outside can be extremely refreshing, boosting one\u2019s mood significantly according to the American Psychological Association. Sunshine likely links to increased serotonin, the neurotransmitter associated with happiness and satisfaction, according to the National Library of Medicine. Extreme heat, however, correlates with acts of aggressive behavior, acts of domestic violence and the development of unhealthy coping mechanisms, according to the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nThe February sunshine seems to be having a positive effect. \u201cWhen I get out of class in the afternoon, it\u2019s nice to be able to lay on campus. It makes me more inclined to be on campus, than stuck in my apartment,\u201d Ella Bittman, a junior studying public relations, said. \u201cWhenever I call [my parents], they\u2019re very jealous that I get to be in the sun all day long.\u201d\n\nRainy days seem to shock Southern California residents. That\u2019s because nine out of 10 days in Los Angeles are dry. On average, Downtown L.A. only sees 36 days of wet weather a year, according to the Weather Channel. In contrast, rain puddles form three to four times more frequently in places like Chicago and New York. Temperatures have dropped to the low 20s in parts of Idaho and Wyoming. Southern states join California in relishing the sunshine. Temperatures in Atlanta today clocked in at 70 degrees. Birmingham, Alabama residents are enjoying a 73-degree day.\n\nBack on campus, temperatures do make a difference for students. \u201cI\u2019m a person that the weather affects me a lot, and it being sunny makes me really happy,\u201d Maggie Hedera, a sophomore studying public relations, said. \u201cIt makes me want to be outside. I love just sitting on campus and it gets my day going.\u201d\n```"}

Many Jordan fans took to defending their favorite player, as the debate over which player is truly the greatest of all time was reignited. \u201cHonestly, I hate LeBron,\u201d freshman biological sciences major Jude Kim said. \u201cBut you know, congratulations to him.\u201d Before the game, James was only 36 points away from being the NBA\u2019s leading scorer. Averaging 30 points per game, James fans expected the legend to break the record in Tuesday\u2019s game. James surpassed the 39-year standing record set by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1984 \u2013 the same year James was born \u2013 in the Tuesday night game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. With only 10.9 seconds left in the third quarter, James scored his 36th point of the game and the record-breaking 38,388th of his career that began in Cleveland. Jack Hallinan, a sophomore journalism major and Cleveland native, was one of the many ecstatic Cleveland fans watching James make history. \u201cI think that the city is just so tremendously proud of him,\u201d Hallinan said. \u201cObviously, we wish he did it in a Cavs uniform instead of a Lakers uniform.\u201d After scoring the record-breaking point, fans erupted and a ceremony commenced mid-game. While the \u201cGOAT\u201d title is up for debate, James undoubtedly made history last night. The 38-year-old is one of seven players to score over 30,000 career points and is the youngest player in NBA history to do so. Now the king has another NBA jewel to add to his already impressive crown. \u201cIt was one of the greatest moments of my life,\u201d said Bryan Phillips, freshman and self-proclaimed LeBron superfan. \u201cIt was just exhilarating.\u201d Business major Cybelle Calleung thinks the record is well deserved for an \u201ciconic figure in basketball that a lot of people look up to.\u201d \u201cThe fact that he was able to catch up to [the record] during his career is incredible,\u201d Calleung said. \u201cI assume he\u2019s just going to keep going from there.

Entire villages and buildings crumbled in a matter of only a couple of minutes, and many are wondering what is there to expect if something similar were to happen in California. It\u2019s common knowledge for Angelenos and Californians that the state has not just one, but multiple means fault lines that ride through the state. At any moment, any one of them could shift, causing an earthquake in analogous to the one recently seen in Turkey.\n\nProfessor John Vidale is a seismologist at the University of Southern California. He says that the last time something akin to a large quake happened in California, was over 100 years ago, and managed to break an 8.0 magnitude on the Richter scale.\n\nJOHN VIDALE: \u201cSo, you know, the true story here was a big earthquake that ran right through a lot of towns. And I guess the secondary factor is, you know, the buildings were not adequate. And it\u2019s hard to make buildings that can stand up to that kind of earthquake.\u201d\n\nBut that is not to say that all hope is lost. Vidale claims that the reasoning that the fatalities in Turkey are so high can be due to the lack or resources the country has to restructure its buildings. Something California has steadily prepared itself for.\n\nVIDALE: \u201cBut in Turkey, you know, they don\u2019t have the resources to identify the buildings with prayer rooms and to fix them. So that was probably a factor of the old buildings. And then, you know, third factor is whenever you have 10,000 buildings shaking, a few of them are going to be made wrong. So, you know, either through sloppiness or cost cutting. Some of those buildings are probably deficient.\u201d\n\nThe process began after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 when a number of older buildings completed with old masonry tactics tended to be the ones with the most damage. There is really no way to be truly prepared, but the matter is depending upon building a city from the ground up, which to many just seems unrealistic.\n\nVIDALE: \u201cBut, you know, the real challenges, the problems are hard to predict. So we don\u2019t really know how prepared we are. We know there are a lot of things we should do, but many are tremendously expensive.\u201d\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Spencer Cline\n```"}

He focused on topics like healthcare and the economy. His calls for bipartisanship and goals for police reform and gun control were delivered with a sense of hope that proved to be the theme of the address.\n\nJOE BIDEN: \u201cBecause the soul of this nation is strong. The backbone of this nation is strong. Because the people of this nation are strong. The state of the union is strong.\u201d\n\nBut that didn\u2019t sit well with some Republican\u2019s. There were moments President Biden was met with heckles from Republicans yelling things like \u201cliar\u201d from the seats of their chamber. The GOP\u2019s response was delivered by Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders who criticized the \u201ccraziness\u201d of Democratic policies.\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: \u201cThe Democrats have failed you.

And he says the response Biden provoked amongst the Republicans was one of the best components of his speech.\n\nWINOGRAD: \u201cIt was a classic six pack working Joe Biden from Scranton, Pennsylvania, speech with a lot of focus on what working class people have experienced, a lot of sympathy for it.\u201d\n\nMorley predicts the speech will result in a temporary 5 point boost in approval ratings bumping it up as high as 50% but in fact, it\u2019s even higher. The CNN Flash Poll has his approval rating sitting at 72%. Though this number will likely fall, it will provide a target for the 2024 Biden campaign.\n\nWINOGRAD: \u201cThey seem to be convinced that they have found their political lodestar. And there\u2019s nothing in the fact that they keep losing elections and that their candidates are not successful and don\u2019t win when they should. None of that has moved them off that position.\u201d\n\nWith the primaries on the horizon, Democrats may look to ride the momentum from Biden\u2019s speech into a possible successful re-election campaign.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Alexa Hernandez Diaz\n```"}

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nBy Jacob Hare February 08, 2023 at 5:06 pm PST\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pack Offseason Edition\u201d is a column by Jacob Hare that discusses offseason football news in the Pac-12 conference. During the Pac-12 regular season, I wrote a weekly column, \u201cUnpack the Pac,\u201d which broke down every game and team. And when it became time for the offseason, I didn\u2019t want to stop writing about the Pac-12. Even though games aren\u2019t being played, there is always Pac-12 news to write about. College football is a 365-day-a-year news cycle, and the Pac-12 has been making waves in the college football landscape this offseason. Between recruiting, NIL, the transfer portal, new coaches and an abundance of rumors, there is much to talk about during the off-season.\n\nBut let\u2019s start with the new coaches at the conference. Did Deion Sanders make Colorado relevant again? The biggest news, not only in the Pac-12 but all of college football, was Deion Sanders being hired as the head coach of Colorado. The NFL Hall of Famer and former MLB player did a tremendous job in his first collegiate head coach position at Jackson State, where he brought the FCS school to back-to-back SWAC titles and ultimately to national prominence. Sanders was also able to bring top recruits to Jackson State \u2014 he even flipped 2022 No. 1 overall recruit Travis Hunter from Florida State to Jackson State. This was one of the most historic moments in recent memory for college football, as Hunter was the highest ranked player to ever commit to an HBCU.\n\nSanders has continued his hot recruiting streak, bringing some star Jackson State players to Colorado via the transfer portal. Following Sanders are his two best players from Jackson State, cornerback Travis Hunter along with his son and 2022 SWAC offensive player of the year quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Sanders also signed the 2023 number-one cornerback Cormani McClain, who flipped his commitment from Miami to Colorado. Coach Prime was able to piece together a top-21 recruiting class in under two months at a school with one win in the 2022 season. He even has Colorado ranked higher in recruiting than schools such as UCLA, Oregon State and Washington \u2014 all three of whom played in bowl games last season. Sanders has begun to shift the culture at Colorado, now earning the label of one of the most elite recruiters in the country. The Pac-12 should stay on high alert as Colorado could emerge as a real threat shortly to compete for the Pac-12 title.\n\nWhat about the other two new head coaches, Stanford\u2019s Troy Taylor and Arizona State\u2019s Kenny Dillingham? What do they bring to the table? While these two men are not as flashy and noteworthy as Sanders, they certainly both have much to offer. Let\u2019s start with Troy Taylor, who, like Sanders, is jumping from FCS to FBS. He played quarterback in the NFL for a bit, so he clearly has a ton of offensive knowledge. Taylor also entirely turned Sacramento State into one of the biggest threats in the FCS in just four years, going 30-8. Taylor looks to bring the offensive sorcery he brought to Sacramento State to the once prominent and dominant Stanford offense that has not been displayed for almost five years. It will be a tall task for a roster that needs more talent, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Stanford fans will need to give Taylor time to develop, as this will be his first stint on such a large stage.\n\nNew Arizona State head coach and alumnus Kenny Dillingham looks to fix former head coach Herm Edwards\u2019s gigantic mess he left behind. Dillingham will be the youngest coach in Power Five at 32. Dillingham fits the mold of the coach everyone is looking for at any level of football: a young offensive genius with a track record of running a high-powered offense. Dillingham has already started his recruiting trail with a fantastic start by signing elite 2023 4-star quarterback Jaden Rashada. Dillingham and Rashada could be one of the best head coach and quarterback duos in the Pac-12 if Arizona State can build a talented roster around Rashada. Just look at what Dillingham did as he was the offensive coordinator for Oregon last year. He helped turn Bo Nix into one of the most elite quarterbacks in the country. If Dillingham can bring over the successful formula he found at Oregon, then this will prove to be a home run hire for the Sun Devils.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pack Offseason Edition\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

Fans have been buzzing about Harry Styles\u2019 shocking Album of the Year win and Beyonc\u00e9's history-making win that gave her the title of the most decorated artist in Grammys history. Just as fun as watching the show itself, however, is analyzing which outfits won and lost on the red carpet before the awards were even handed out. Below are just some of the best and worst fits of the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nBest\n\n1. Cardi B\nCardi B blessed the red carpet in her stunning royal blue dress. The custom dress was inspired by South Asian fashion and was designed by Gaurav Gupta, who produced the dress as a part of his newest collection. The designer is known for his \u201csculptural silhouettes\u201d and his fashion attempts to combine futuristic techniques with his love for Indian culture.\n\n2. Taylor Swift\nInspired by her most recent album \u201cMidnights,\u201d Swift arrived on the carpet in a midnight blue custom Roberto Cavalli dress. The two-piece sparkly number was paired with a large pair of silver and midnight blue diamond-shaped earrings. Of course, Swift finished the look with her classic red lip.\n\n3. Doja Cat\nMatching with her new jet-black bob, Doja Cat wore an all-black, single-strap vinyl dress. The long leather train fanned out behind her and matched with her long black leather gloves. The artist captured two completely different looks in one night with a wig and outfit change to a blonde messy bun and a brown corset outfit for her award show look.\n\n4. H.E.R\nH.E.R.\u2019s two-piece black outfit was composed of a velvet black mini dress and a maxi sheer skirt with a velvet spiral, both a part of Bach Mai\u2019s new 2023 collection. Her snazzy sunglasses rested above gorgeous Swarovski crystal necklaces. The entire fit \u2013 simple and classic.\n\n5. Kelsea Ballerini\nKelsea Ballerini walked down the red carpet in a bright sunshine-yellow dress and matching heels. Her dress was defined by its side cut-outs and long flared train that followed her. Ballerini was also rocking the \u201cclean girl\u201d slick-back bun and Brilliant Earth Jewelry.\n\n6. Beyonc\u00e9\nBeyonc\u00e9 made Grammy history on Sunday night, as she now has the most Grammy Awards of any solo artist in history. Just as impressive as her achievement was her outfit. Her two-toned nude and metallic custom Gucci dress absolutely slayed on the carpet.\n\nWorst\n\n1. Olivia Rodrigo\nOlivia Rodrigo, known for her colorful, interesting looks, walked the carpet in a boring black slip dress. The outfit was an attempt to do a goth version of the \u201cnaked\u201d dress look. The dress, designed by Miu Miu, was accompanied by a Tiffany black bean necklace. This dull look, however, was not entirely her fault as it was rumored that her actual dress ripped right before the show, and her red carpet look was a last-minute change.\n\n2. Lizzo\nLizzo\u2019s red carpet looks have always been known for her large and loud outfit designs \u2013 and this one is arguably the biggest of them all. Her bright orange Dolce & Gabbana rose-covered dress likely took up the entire red carpet and not in a good way.\n\n3. Shania Twain\nShania Twain\u2019s black and white cow print suit was adorned in sequins. To add on to the misfortune of this design, the outfit came with a matching top hat sitting directly above her bright red wig. Sorry Shania, but the outfit reminds viewers of their 12-year-old Justice mistakes.\n\n4. Sam Smith\nSam Smith did not come alone to the red carpet on Sunday night. Smith\u2019s team, including their co-star on their hit single \u201cUnholy,\u201d Kim Petras, wore matching red outfits to compliment Smith\u2019s fiery red dress and top hat. Unfortunately, the red madness was not what Smith intended it to be, because fans are now calling their performance and aesthetic \u201csatanic.\u201d\n\n5. Harry Styles\nHarry Styles\u2019 rainbow jumpsuit reminded his fans of exactly what he would wear to his \u201cLove On Tour\u201d shows, deeming it not red carpet worthy. His stylist, Harry Lambert, was critiqued for not designing a classic Styles suit fans are used to for big events. Styles impressed viewers by winning the biggest award in music, Album of the Year, but left fashion lovers entirely unimpressed.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Jack Waterman and Veronique Louis-Jacques\nFebruary 07, 2023 at 11:04 pm PST\n\nCampus food can get old, especially when we remember the cultural hub of Los Angeles that USC resides in. With this, comes a city teeming with food and restaurants from all different cultures. So, we asked USC students to share some of their favorite spots to eat off campus and why.\n\nFor some people it wasn\u2019t so much whether they were close, but that they had the right atmosphere. Lindsay Huerta, a junior studying social science, loves Cafe Mak, a small cafe in Koreatown. \u201cIt\u2019s very aesthetic and very warm,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThe furniture is really, really lovely. It\u2019s all mismatched and so it gives a very comforting, homey feel.\u201d\n\nOthers share the same sentiment. Bengy Mitchell, a senior studying public policy, had some very specific things to say about his favorite off-campus spot, Roscoe\u2019s Chicken and Waffles. Mitchell says this is the kind of place he would take a \u201csuper close friend or your family or your mom when she\u2019s in town.\u201d However, when your mom isn\u2019t in town, Mitchell praises how \u201cbangin\u2019\u201d the food is and that the atmosphere is \u201cjust super authentic and very comfortable.\u201d\n\nFor some, a good atmosphere doesn\u2019t have to be anything crazy. Jenna Peterson, a junior studying journalism and political science, loves Thai by Trio, a Thai restaurant on Figueroa Street. \u201cWhen you\u2019re inside, it feels like you\u2019re in a place off campus, more so than eating in the Village or something like that,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nFor others, the atmosphere is more than just good vibes. Instead, especially for those who aren\u2019t from the area, places that remind them of home are their favorite. Jake Wisnik, a senior majoring in international relations, says his favorite place is the famous Canter\u2019s Deli, a Jewish Deli in the Fairfax District. Wisnik is from the East Coast of New York and says that Canter\u2019s has \u201cthe most amazing, classic Jewish foods.\u201d Whenever he goes, he always gets food like matzo ball soup or a pastrami sandwich, which makes him feel right at home. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It just has the atmosphere of being a very East Coast, kind of warm, homey spot,\u201d Wisnik said.\n\nKylie Leung feels the same. A sophomore studying sociology and communication, Leung also loves Thai by Trio for their pad thai as well as Northern Cafe. She explained that Northern Cafe, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a place that I think brings comfort to a lot of international students from China, just because there aren\u2019t a lot of Chinese restaurants around campus.\u201d Although Leung isn\u2019t an international student, Northern Cafe reminds her of her \u201cChinese American community and family back home.\u201d\n\nHowever, some are just looking for convenience. Although Huerta and Leung appreciate a good environment at a restaurant, some of their favorite places are some of the easiest to get to. For Heurta, Wingstop, a crosswalk away from the USC Marshall School of Business, \u201c[It] is definitely up there. It\u2019s very close, very convenient.\u201d Leung, on the other hand, loves a restaurant in Little Tokyo called Marugame Udon \u201cbecause it\u2019s convenient and you can get there by Metro.\u201d\n\nAnd choosing convenience doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing experience all the time, according to Sydney Wood, a sophomore studying cognitive science. She likes a place called Ebaes, located on South Hoover Street. because it \u201cgives the experience of going out to dinner without having to go far and it is pretty convenient.\u201d\n\nWhether it is within walking distance or on a small trip, the previous restaurants provide a good alternative to food found at USC.\n```"}

His address was characterized by appeals to both sides of the aisle, beginning with his opening remarks towards Republicans in the House chamber. \u201cTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well,\u201d Biden said. \u201cFighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere. That\u2019s always been my vision of our country and I know it\u2019s many of yours.\u201d \n\nFrom job creation to lifting the debt ceiling, Biden touched on a number of topics during his 73-minute speech, but healthcare, policing, infrastructure and the economy took priority. At one point, Biden accused Republicans of threatening Social Security and Medicare\u2014an assertion met with pushback by outspoken GOP members. He also called on Congress to extend a $35 price cap on Insulin as well as to make premium savings on the Affordable Care Act health plans permanent.\n\nWhile many remarks failed to muster a response from Republicans, Biden hoped that his Unity Agenda, a four-part plan highlighting areas where members of both parties could come together, would be able to reach across the aisle. These four issues included ending cancer, supporting veterans, tackling the mental health crisis and beating the opioid crisis.\n\nAmong the attendees were the family of Tyre Nichols, a Black man who was killed by Memphis police officers in early January, and Brandon Tsay, who disarmed the gunman in the Monterey Park shooting. RowVaugh and Rodney Wells, the parents of Nichols, were met with overwhelming applause as Biden touched on the shared values for public safety across the chamber. \u201cJust as every cop who pins on that badge in the morning has the right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often. We have to do better. Give law enforcement the real training they need. Hold on to higher standards. Help them succeed in keeping us safe.\u201d\n\nBiden wanted to remind listeners, \u201cThe story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.\u201d Since Biden has been in office he has created a record of 12 million new jobs and has signed over 200 bipartisan laws to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Biden briefly touched on inflation and took a moment to recognize the decreasing gas and food prices, coupled with an increase in take home pay. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act were passed to ensure the inflation rise the country saw does not happen again.\n\nBiden stressed that to remain the strongest economy in the world, the nation\u2019s infrastructure needs to be the best in the world. He said it has fallen from No. 1 to No. 13 worldwide. \u201cJobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAs with any State of the Union address, Biden left the chamber on a hopeful note. \u201cBecause the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.\u201d\n```"}

Although she is often reminded that not dropping out and graduating should be the next step for her, she describes staying in college as a challenge. \u201c[My boss] talks of my plan and (about) what\u2019s my next step... She tells me not to drop out. She tells me to graduate, even though I tell her it\u2019s really challenging. I just feel like the program here it\u2019s really unorganized, but I\u2019m trying to hold through. I\u2019m just trying to figure out my options because I do want to get my cosmetology license,\u201d said Clarkson.\n\nCommunity college students consistently face challenges in the transfer process to four-year institutions as there is a lack of resources and guidance provided to the students which continues to affect transfer rates negatively, according to the Aspen Institute. Although almost 2 million students enroll at community colleges in California every year with many having intentions of transferring to four-year institutions, fewer than one-third of the hopeful transfers actually succeed after six years, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nTania LaViolet, the director of the College Excellence Program at the Aspen Institute, credits the broken transfer system as one of the primary hurdles community college students face when attempting to transfer to a four-year institution. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really complex and possibly needlessly complex process... I think it\u2019s something like 48 or 50% of students who intend to transfer don\u2019t access transfer advising while in community college,\u201d said LaViolet. \u201cThe pathways are not clear and then the guidance isn\u2019t there for students to get the support to navigate those complex pathways. And so together, those things amount to an incredibly complex process that gets in the way of success for many deserving students.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the flawed transfer system, the pandemic served as an exacerbating factor worsening the problems community college students faced when attempting to transfer. Of those students, those from low-income backgrounds faced disproportionate impacts with low transfer rates since community colleges historically act as a gateway to higher education for these students. \u201cWhat we know from the data is that lower-income students are the ones that are hardest hit by the broken transfer systems...So while I think the pandemic has driven attention to transfer, I hope it\u2019s not momentary, because I think that fixing these systems over the long term will have (a) lasting and positive impact on communities across the country, particularly communities of color in lower-income communities,\u201d said LaViolet.\n\nUSC facilitates the transfer process through programs like the Trojan Transfer Program and the Transfer Student Assembly with a reported 52% of transfer students in 2020-2021 enrolling in the university from community colleges. \u201cBeing in the Trojan Transfer Program helped a lot because of the counselor that they [USC] provided... because the community college like counselors didn\u2019t really do anything. But I think just staying on top of your workload and knowing the classes that you have to take. It is kind of up to you. So self-discipline helped a lot in that process,\u201d said Cassidy Idenoshita.\n\nAfter attending Pasadena City College and The American University in Paris, Idenoshita transferred to USC during her sophomore year. \u201cJust jumping into a four-year university was a little bit of a struggle, especially meeting people, and then the workload was a little bit heavier than the community college and the school in Paris. So I think there was a little bit of a struggle there, but I think throughout the years, using the USC community helped a lot to adjust to the new environment,\u201d said Idenoshita.\n```"}

One of the biggest controversies of the night was Harry Styles\u2019 win for Album of the Year with \u201cHarry\u2019s House.\u201d The British singer-songwriter shared the nomination with artists such as Beyonc\u00e9, ABBA, Lizzo, Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny. According to sources like Billboard and TIME, Beyonc\u00e9's \u201cRenaissance\u201d was favored and deserved to win.\n\nStyles triggered an onslaught of backlash online when he said, \u201cThis is really, really kind. I\u2019m so grateful. This doesn\u2019t happen to people like me very often,\u201d during his acceptance speech. Some were quick to point out that a vast majority of the other nominees for Album of the Year were artists of color, and Styles is a white man.\n\nWhat do USC students think about Harry Styles\u2019 win and acceptance speech? Christina Chkarboul, a sophomore studying global studies and earth sciences, said that she didn\u2019t like Styles\u2019 work. \u201cI personally did not like his album,\u201d Chkarboul said. \u201cI think that \u2018As It Was\u2019 was very overplayed, and I am not a fan of his work just generally.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment was generally shared among other USC students. Christina Fazio, a first-year graduate student studying marriage and family therapy, explained that although she enjoyed \u201cHarry\u2019s House,\u201d there were better contenders that should\u2019ve won. \u201cI do think compared to the other albums that were up, it ... wasn\u2019t the best album,\u201d Fazio said. \u201cJust because of how monumental it was, \u2018Un Verano Sin Ti\u2019 was what I thought should have won.\u201d\n\nMaleah Allen, a freshman studying human biology, echoed Fazio\u2019s response in terms of other artists who were more deserving: \u201cJust because I have listened to Kendrick\u2019s album and a couple of the others \u2014 I feel like they were actually talking about things that mattered.\u201d\n\nIn terms of his acceptance speech, consensus of questioned USC students was that Styles made a pretty noticeable and insensitive error. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really use the correct terminology, especially because he\u2019s a white man,\u201d Allen said. Bennie Andon, a sophomore also studying human biology, agreed with Allen\u2019s response. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, especially when ... all these POC artists are going up. And the thing is, it\u2019s not the first time that has happened.\u201d\n\nAlthough most of the students hadn\u2019t watched the Grammys on Sunday night when it aired, they had caught wind of the backlash on social media. \u201cI\u2019ve read some contextualizing information about maybe he grew up in a low-income family, and that\u2019s kind of what he meant by that,\u201d said Patrick Warren, a senior majoring in journalism. \u201cI\u2019m not going to assume that he meant anything malicious by it, but I do understand people\u2019s reactions.\u201d\n\nThe Grammys, and large-scale award shows in general, have received hefty criticism within the past few years because of their lack of minority representation, as well as their continuous selection of white artists over those of color.\n```"}

(Photo by Hyunwoo Daniel Park)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nFebruary 07, 2023 at 9:29 pm PST\n\nUSC men\u2019s basketball over the last four games has vaulted into a position just on the cusp of the NCAA tournament. Much of that success is due to the whole team playing together and better basketball in general, however the main reason the Trojans have been on a tear the past two weeks has been because of senior guard Boogie Ellis.\n\nEllis is having a career year averaging 16.5 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game and has already been named one of the four finalists for Pac-12 Player of the Year. Beyond having the best year of his career so far statistically, why should Ellis win Player of the Year?\n\nHe\u2019s best when the lights are brightest\nIn big games this year, Ellis has been at the top of his game. In November\u2019s Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, Ellis averaged 21 points against some of the nations best, including a 27-point game versus BYU and a 21-point game on No. 6 Tennessee. Back in December when the Trojans took on then-ranked Auburn, Ellis scored an extremely efficient 28 points on 60% shooting. And of course most recently, at home against UCLA, Ellis cashed in a career-high 31 points, 27 of which came in the second half of a comeback win against the Bruins.\n\nEllis has shown time and time again that when the Trojans need him, he will step up, which is what makes him such a dangerous player. Against ranked teams this season, Ellis is averaging a whopping 20.2 points. Just know, when the going gets tough, Ellis will be the man the Trojans call on to make the big plays.\n\nHe is more than just a scorer\nDespite everything I just said about how important he is on his scoring ability alone, he is a lot more than that. On Saturday, when the Trojans faced off against Washington in the Galen Center, Ellis just couldn\u2019t get going on the scoring side. However, something that couldn\u2019t be measured by any stats was the leadership he displayed on the court. Though the shots weren\u2019t falling, Ellis\u2019 leadership was present as always as he tried to put guys in the right position during a play. He made sure everyone stayed level-headed in a game which had many ticky tacky fouls called by the refs.\n\nMany star players often get frustrated with themselves or their team when their shots aren\u2019t going in \u2013 not Boogie. Ellis kept his head high and did what was best for the team. The veteran helped get players like sophomore forward Kobe Johnson and freshman guard Tre White in positions to score and make plays, which worked beautifully as the pair dropped 21 and 22 to go along with phenomenal shooting percentages.\n\nEllis affects the game so much more beyond the stat sheet. He is a fantastic teammate and leader who deserves more recognition for his leadership skills.\n\nWe are about halfway through Pac-12 regular season play, and Ellis will have some stiff competition to win the award. If I were him, I would be circling March 2 on my calendar to get revenge against No. 4 Arizona at home. Not only is it a chance to show out on a national level and redeem the Trojans of their loss in Tucson, but it is also a chance to outplay his biggest competition for Pac-12 player of the year. Junior forward Azuolas Tubelis is averaging a monstrous 20.8 points and 9.5rebounds per game.\n\nI firmly believe that the Pac-12 player of the year award will go to the best player on the best team, so the Trojans have a bit of ground to make up. Even still, I 100% believe that it is possible for USC to win the Pac-12 regular season and tournament. If that happens, there is no question that Boogie Ellis should be the Pac-12 Player of the Year.\n\nWith all that being said, to the Pac-12 coaches and media, I strongly encourage you to vote Boogie Ellis for the Pac-12 men\u2019s basketball Player of the Year.\n```"}

In the coming months, USC\u2019s chapter of Dear Asian Youth (DAY) will attempt to do that through their first ever art exhibition called \u201cCulture Wars.\u201d Founded by 16-year-old Stephanie Hu in 2020, DAY started as a poetry blog about Asian hate in America and the feelings of grief, anger, and healing that surround it. Finding that her words resonated with many, DAY soon evolved into a literary magazine, before becoming a full-fledged nonprofit organization complete with international chapters and over 104,000 followers on Instagram. Today, the club has over 150 chapters worldwide, one at the University of Southern California.\n\nYi-Ann Li, who Hu inspired, brought the non-profit\u2019s goals to USC\u2019s campus in September 2020. \u201cDear Asian Youth USC is a space for anyone who identifies as Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) to share their stories and voice \u2014 to talk about their triumphs, their struggles, what makes up their world and identity,\u201d said Li, who is the current co-president of the USC chapter. \u201cDAY USC is an inclusive space striving to uplift marginalized communities through writing, art and various forms of creative expression.\u201d\n\nThe chapter holds events such as weekend socials and movie nights, as well as hosting guest speakers. This March, they will have a member from the National Asian Pacific American Women\u2019s Forum come and speak for Women\u2019s History Month in March. As for the upcoming exhibition, it\u2019s all about using art to discuss cultural conflicts. As Lily Muscarella, Lead Curator for DAY USC, said, \u201cUltimately, this exhibit will serve as a window into the cultural issues of today, both educating and raising awareness.\u201d\n\nFor DAY USC, many of these conversations revolve around an issue close to their heart and behind the founding of the organization \u2014 Asian hate in America. \u201cThe culture wars are a constant discourse within American popular culture; however, we do see notably contentious periods of cultural dissents, such as today.\u201d \u201cCulture wars,\u201d according to Muscarella, refers to the ways in which art serves as a mirror of society, as explored in the exhibition context. For the group, it is a way to engage art with identity, politics, and economics.\n\nRecently, DAY USC has brought light to a variety of these issues ranging from the Queen of England\u2019s recent death and her relationship with colonialism, all the way to the representation in this year\u2019s Oscar nominations.\n\nHowever, this exhibition isn\u2019t specifically intended for professional and world-renowned artists to display their work. Instead, it\u2019s all about young and under-represented artists getting exposure. \u201cThe idea of a student-led exhibition of this scale largely stemmed from the lack of accessibility for emerging artists to showcase their work to the world,\u201d said Mindy Dang, DAY USC Director of Programming. \u201cIn an increasingly polarizing and violent America, our curation team recognizes an urgent need for a safe space to stimulate conversations free from the narration that the media doles out.\u201d\n\nAnd, DAY USC doesn\u2019t shy away from conflict. \u201cThis exhibition is essentially an invitation for conflict \u2014 and I love it,\u201d Dang said. \u201cNo longer hiding behind screens, we bring the issues onto the table and prepare the community to come together to educate their friends and be educated by their foes.\u201d\n\nStudents interested can submit art about their own experiences. Submissions can range across all art forms for the exhibition, including film, painting and sculpture, and are due by March 17.\n```"}

What does it mean for figure skating? The recent statement issued by the IOC again raises the question of just how politicized this sport can be.\n\nAlexandra Trusova, of the Russian Olympic Committee, competes in the women's free skate program during the figure skating competition at the 2022 Winter Olympics, Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022, in Beijing. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\n\nBy Valerie Fang February 07, 2023 at  6:48 pm PST\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. Nearly a year ago, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Belarus\u2019 aid in the operation prompted a number of sports governing bodies, including the International Skating Union (ISU), to ban athletes representing these two countries from participating in most of the international competitions. For figure skating, it means that the ISU has revoked Russia\u2019s privilege to host any Grand Prix events and that the Russian skaters have mainly competed in domestic competitions since last season\u2019s Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nWell, times have changed. According to a recent statement released by the International Olympics Committee (IOC) titled, \u201c Statement on solidarity with Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and Belarus, and the status of athletes from these countries ,\u201d it is most likely that Russian and Belarusian athletes will make a comeback at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. The two additional requirements are that the athletes can\u2019t have any prior experience of supporting the war in Ukraine and must agree to compete under a neutral flag.\n\nThe statement explicitly mentions that a vast majority of the decision makers believe that \u201cno athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport.\u201d Although technically the discussion is still in the works and the IOC has not made the official announcement yet, a return for the Russian and Belarusian athletes is likely to be the final decision.\n\nWhat does all of this mean for figure skating? As we know, even before the sanctions placed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, Russia had already been banned from competing in international sporting events due to the country\u2019s persistent doping scandals. Russian athletes, including their figure skaters, were only allowed to compete as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) under the neutral Olympic flag. However, this has been just a difference in name, and Russia has enjoyed pretty much the same glory as other countries have whenever a Russian athlete brought medals back to their homeland.\n\nIn figure skating, such as during the Beijing Olympics last year, the ROC was allowed to participate in the Team Event where countries, instead of individual or pairs of figure skaters, compete against each other. The question for the IOC is how will this time be different? Will they implement different rules for Russian athletes so there can be a clearer distinction between the athletes and their country? Or will they just let everything go back to the way it was?\n\nAnother challenge for the IOC is how practical it would be for the Russian team to appear politically neutral. In this case, we need to consider not only the athletes, but also their coaches who usually stand right beside the boards while their athletes are competing on the rink, accompany them to Kiss & Cry and wait for the scores next to the athletes. The coaches often get a considerable amount of media exposure.\n\nIn light of this, should the IOC put additional rules regarding the behaviors of Russian coaches as well? Let\u2019s assume that the IOC finally decides to allow Russian figure skaters to compete at Milan 2026. It is almost a certainty that athletes coached by Eteri Tutberidze and Evgeni Plushenko, two of the most famous Russian figure skating coaches in the world, will participate in the games. Both of them have trained Alexandra Trusova, the Beijing Olympics silver medalist. Tutberidze has also coached the Olympic champions from PyeongChang 2018 and Beijing 2022, Alina Zagitova and Anna Shcherbakova.\n\nHowever, both coaches\u2019 political stances came into question when  Plushenko received  a 50-million rubles grant from Putin for his pro-war in Ukraine ice show last summer and when Tutberidze was just  awarded  one of the nation\u2019s highest honors on Monday. What will the subtext be when, according to traditions, these coaches are given media attention and have a major presence at the competitions?\n\nAllowing athletes from Russia and Belarus to return to the rink might pose more challenges than any of us could imagine. As much as we may not want sports to be politicized, it seems like things tend to go the other way. \u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

The event was set to introduce King\u2019s Virtual Human interview experience, and audience members heard a first-hand account of Rodney King\u2019s legacy in the aftermath of the uprising.\n\nLORA KING: I\u2019m Lora King, middle child of the late great Rodney King in 1991. My father was the first victim of police brutality to have his assault captured on TV, and it changed the world. I\u2019m also the CEO and founder of the Rodney King Foundation.\n\nWhat you just heard wasn\u2019t actually Lora King, at least not today. The Virtual Human Experience is actually an artificial intelligence program that analyzes the viewer\u2019s question and converts it into an interview prompt. Mike Jones is the Director of Web and Automation Technologies at the USC Libraries.\n\nMIKE JONES: So we\u2019ve created these interactive interviews within the USC libraries and the USC digital repository. The concept is finding a way to make engaging and interactive conversations with consequential stories and oral histories. I think one of the things that\u2019s really empowering about this type of technology is that it allows each and every user to interact with the story and with the person sharing their story in their own way.\n\nMembers of Lora King\u2019s family were also in attendance for the event and sampled the interview technology first-hand after King\u2019s speech was complete. Jaylyn Norwood is Lora King\u2019s daughter and was surprised at the breadth of the experience.\n\nJAYLYN NORWOOD: I never thought you can even interact with things like museums or even like AI, I think that\u2019s crazy. It also grabs attention, just how cool it is. It can also make other people excited to see it and want to learn more about the things that my mom is talking about.\n\nThe Lora King Virtual Human interview experience will be available on the second floor of Annenberg Hall until this Thursday. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Anthony Clingerman.\n```"}

Special guests include Tyre Nichols\u2019 parents and the Monterey Park hero.\n\nPresident Joe Biden (Photo courtesy of whitehouse.gov)\n\nBy Anthony Slade February 07, 2023 at  4:38 pm PST\n\nCongress will convene tonight to listen as President Biden delivers his second State of the Union Address at the Capitol. With political, economic and social tensions running high across the nation, all eyes will be on the President to deliver a unifying speech. Here\u2019s Anthony Slade with the story.\n\nPresident Biden is preparing to address Congress tonight in D.C. for his second State of the Union Address since his inauguration in 2021. According to the White House website, his speech will expand his four-part Unity Agenda which will prioritize bipartisan efforts. These goals include finding a cure for cancer; honoring veterans; tackling the mental health crisis; and beating the opioid and overdose epidemic.\n\nTodd Belt, professor and director of political management at George Washington University, sees the address as an opportunity for Biden to appeal to both sides of the aisle.\n\nTODD BELT: The State of the Union is a very significant event for the president because it allows the president to really set his legislative agenda with Congress. It allows him to tell members of the House and the Senate, his is what I\u2019d like to see passed.\n\nThe White House has already announced the guest list for the First Lady\u2019s box. In the past, these honored guests have been a good indication of the President\u2019s talking points during the address. This year\u2019s list includes the parents of Tyre Nichols, whose son was tragically killed in an altercation with the Memphis Police Department at the beginning of this year.\n\nHere\u2019s Belt again: BELT: This is going to be an opportunity for the president to talk about police reform. And I think there\u2019s an opportunity for both sides to get involved in terms of legislation for for policing reform.\n\nAlso in attendance will be the U.S. ambassador of Ukraine, advocates for abortion rights and the families of war heroes, cancer survivors and LGBTQ+ activists. Belt says that these guests will provide a segue for the President to discuss the White House\u2019s efforts in the past year.\n\nBELT: I expect he\u2019s going to be talking to a large degree about the policies that were passed in the last Congress, albeit to a much lower dollar figure than he would have liked. And he\u2019s going to talk about their successes.\n\nBiden is also expected to delve into the state of the national economy, a talking point at nearly every State of the Union in the country\u2019s history. Experts anticipate a discussion of the \u201conce in a generation\u201d infrastructure bill that the President signed last year. Also on the docket is the Inflation reduction Act. This bill aims to curb the past year\u2019s inflation rate, which hit a four-decade high in the Summer of last year\n\nDespite these challenges, Colin Seeberger, senior adviser for communications at the Center for American Progress, remains optimistic about Biden\u2019s impact on the economy.\n\nCOLIN SEEBERGER: He\u2019s steered the economy through a number of global headwinds to the lowest unemployment rate we\u2019ve seen in about 54 years. And he led the Democratic Party to a midterm performance that really defied the historical odds.\n\nThe importance of this year\u2019s address is heightened with the 2024 presidential race right around the corner. Although Biden has yet to commit to running, many experts expect his announcement in the coming months. Belt anticipates a calculated attitude from the President with the election on the horizon.\n\nBELT: He\u2019s going to want to also show that he has energy and vigor and is still up to the job of being president, particularly if he wants to run again.\n\nA lot will be discussed tonight, but according to Belt, one thing is for certain:\n\nBELT: He will say what all presidents say, which is the State of the Union, is strong.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Anthony Slade.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nInside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, standing on NASCAR\u2019s temporary quarter-mile track, the USC Formula SAE racing team celebrated its victory. While the race took less than an hour, the efforts behind it were months in the making.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good result that the team deserves,\u201d said team president Jiyu Qian after the race. \u201cWe cannot say this is one person\u2019s resolve because all the 50 team members contributed very highly with our advisors towards this result.\u201d\n\nThe faculty is proud of the team\u2019s accomplishment as well. \u201cThis particular team that we\u2019ve had for almost three years is a unit. They all back each other up,\u201d said senior lab technician and staff advisor William Colvin. \u201cIf one person is doing a project and they\u2019re having trouble with it, it\u2019s rare they ask for help because help just comes in.\u201d\n\nTo Colvin\u2019s point, some of the team members are roommates who spend most of their free time together working on the car.\n\nAlvin Ahn sets his timed lap in the SCR22 on the quarter-mile temporary track at the Coliseum. The race format allowed for both teams to set the best time on the track in order to win the rivalry. (Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nOn Saturday, the team used the race car that competed at Michigan International Speedway last June. As part of the competition, the racing team is required to build a new car each year, putting the team on a tight schedule.\n\nData collection, data validation and composing computer-aided designs take place over the fall semester. By November, the team starts tapering down on the design, which is called \u201cDesign Freeze.\u201d Then, the team moves into a three-month manufacturing phase: building everything from scratch except for the engine, the wheels and the shocks. Intensive testing and tuning finish off the process and last all the way before the competition.\n\nLast year, the team didn\u2019t finish designing until the middle of the spring semester, which is 10 to 12 weeks later than they previously did. The rectifier failed and the car battery died during the competition \u2014 which lowered the score for the car\u2019s reliability test.\n\nWith the wrong mentality, building the car could be a daunting process. However, the team has its share of fun through it all. \u201cThe team likes to make some jokes,\u201d said Chief Engineer and Project Manager Amani Ghonim. \u201cWe like to keep it light because we do see each other at least 20 hours a week. Sometimes you get tired of each other.\u201d\n\nAn example of this light-hearted nature was when members started hiding little \u201cAmong Us\u201d icons all over the car. There\u2019s one vinyl printed on the steering wheel, a 3D printed \u201cAmong Us\u201d house hiding inconspicuously inside the corner of the little data acquisition device. They are purposefully scattered throughout the car as a constant reminder of the team spirit.\n\nThe team hid various \u201cAmong Us\u201d icons around the car as an Easter egg to keep the team spirit up. One of them is vinyl printed on the steering wheel itself. (Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBecause of the tight schedule, many car components are made and completed in-house, including layering up for carbon fiber aerodynamic packages, welding, notching of the frames and much more. According to Qian, who is mostly responsible for sponsorship and marketing, a car usually costs the team around $80,000 to build from scratch.\n\nUSC Racing poses for a team photo with the SCR 22 and their championship trophy at the Coliseum.

When he first heard the gunshots, he thought they were the sound of firecrackers set off on the eve of Lunar New Year.\n\nNiu Yi, one of the survivors of the Monterey Park shooting, speaks about his experience during and after the attack. (Photo by Draco Guan)\n\nBy Draco Guan February 07, 2023 at 11:55 am PST\n\nWatch Niu Yi\u2019s story here: \u201cI thought it was firecrackers...\u201d As the sound of gunfire echoed through the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in downtown Monterey Park, California on the eve of Lunar New Year, Niu Yi, a Chinese diaspora living alone in Rosemead, was initially convinced that it was simply the celebratory crackle of firecrackers. As he watched dancers around him drop to the floor, the horrific reality of the situation began to set in. \u201cIt does sound just like fireworks; they even smell the same way,\u201d he said in Mandarin Chinese, repeating the phrase when asked to recount what he sarcastically called \u201ca night of adventure.\u201d\n\nNiu couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of nostalgia that the sound of gunfire initially evoked, memories of how his hometown in rural China celebrated the New Year with fireworks, which ward off evil spirits and usher in good luck for the coming year. In the days that followed, Niu struggled to make sense of the tragedy in the Monterey Park dance studio, where 72-year-old gunman Huu Can Tran, armed with a modified semi-automatic pistol, had fired 42 rounds, leaving 11 dead.\n\nFor Niu and many elderly immigrants who speak limited English, the Star Ballroom Dance Studio serves as a sanctuary, a \u201chome away from home.\u201d It\u2019s a place where Niu spends time with friends, listens to music, and keeps himself active. The Star Ballroom Dance Studio not only serves as a venue for dancing but also provides a sense of community and belonging for people who may feel isolated.\n\nAfter the mass shooting shattered the community, It became a place for people to mourn (Photo by Draco Guan)\n\nDuring Lunar New Year, a festival where family gatherings are important, the dance studio takes on an even greater role, offering a welcoming space for those who may find themselves alone during the holiday. \u201cWhere else can I go? The dance studio is my only place to go,\u201d Niu told Annenberg Media. \u201cI do have friends, but here in the United States, people are so caught up in their own lives, no one will talk with you, no one cares,\u201d Niu said.\n\nDespite having friends, Niu feels isolated from the mainstream. A promotional post on a WeChat group caught Niu\u2019s attention. \u201cChinese New Year Countdown Dance Party on Jan. 21\u2032\u2032. On that chilly Saturday night, the 67-year-old dressed in red, a symbol of good luck, and made his way to the Star Ballroom from the neighboring city of Rosemead. That night, the studio was decorated for the occasion. The photo backdrop was surrounded by red balloon arches. Niu came up to the mirror and asked a dance instructor to teach him a few new moves for line dance, while waiting for the final countdown to the new Lunar Year. But ringing in the new year never happened.\n\nMonterey Park\u2019s celebration is one of California\u2019s largest Lunar New Year events. It got canceled due to heightened safety concerns following the mass shooting. (Photo by Draco Guan)\n\n\u201cI was the closest\u201d \u2013 Narrow escape from gunfire in the land of the free\n\nAround 10:20 p.m, dozens of people were line dancing to the Chinese song \u201cLight Rain in March.\u201d The revelers were so enthralled by the dancing, they didn\u2019t see Tran walk in. \u201cWhen it happened, the gun was right next to me, only about two meters away,\u201d Niu demonstrated the scenario to Annenberg Media. Niu was standing in the front row of the line dance, when Tran entered the studio and began spraying bullets into the crowd. \u201cI was in the first row, and I was wearing a red outfit. It was very obvious.\u201d\n\nDespite being in clear view, Niu managed to escape unscathed. He hid in a tiny 1.5 by 3 foot storage room for a \u201cprolonged period.\u201d Niu was halfway in when several others tried to squeeze in, crawling in and piling on top of Niu. They didn\u2019t dare move. Niu got up when he heard the police arrive, but what he saw was shocking. \u201cEach time I stepped forward, I would find a person on the ground,\u201d Niu said. He saw a man who had been shot in the stomach. As he took a few more steps, Niu saw more injured people on the ground, many of whom were his friends. \u201cThere were bodies and blood everywhere around me. It was bloody, too graphic to look at.\u201d\n\nTran did move on that same night to another dance studio in neighboring Alhambra to carry out another shooting, but that attempt was thwarted by Brandon Tsay, whose family owns the Lai Lai Ballroom and Studio. Tsay disarmed Tran, who was found dead the next day from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Torrance.\n\nThe Annenberg Media interview had light moments, and at one point, Niu burst into laughter, but his face turned pale when he dove into the triggering moment.

(Photo by Draco Guan)\n\nDays after, Niu couldn\u2019t shake the unease and fear that had gripped him that night. He couldn\u2019t sleep or eat, and the thought of returning to the dance studio filled him with dread. \u201cEveryone around me fell, but I was still alive. I was the closest to the gunman at that time\u201d, said Niu quietly. For Niu, the cruelty and fear he experienced may be unimaginable to his friends and family in China where guns are illegal for private citizens, but gun violence is far too common in the U.S.\n\nFor the third straight year, the U.S. in 2022 recorded over 600 mass shootings in which at least four people were killed or injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The U.S. is a nation of gun violence survivors. More people die from gun violence in the U.S. by early February than during an entire calendar year in other high-income countries, according to a recent research. The number continues to rise, as the recent tragedy in Monterey Park stands as one of the deadliest mass shootings in California\u2019s history.\n\nThe impact of gun violence extends far beyond just those who are injured or killed. Take a glimpse of the lives of the families, communities, and individuals who bear the lasting scars of gun violence.\n\nPeople bring candles to remember those who lose their lives in the shooting. (Photo by Draco Guan)\n\nThe attack shattered the dance community of Monterey Park, a storied hub of Southern California\u2019s Chinese community. Niu does not think he will go back to the ballroom on Garvey Avenue. \u201cNever ever would I return for dancing, it\u2019s too scary for me\u201d Niu did not get shot, but the experience still wounds him. The shooting, in his words, forever changed the course of Chinese Lunar New Year for the years to come. \u201cI have a shadow in my heart,\u201d he said, but he\u2019s leaning on his Buddhist faith.\n\nMany of the victims were studio regulars \u2013 longtime dancers, competitors and staff \u2014 united in their passion to dance.

{"key": "/2023/02/07/roadmap-to-resources-how-to-get-mental-health-help-on-campus/", "response": "```\nManaging your mental health can sometimes be a challenge. So, Annenberg Media has created a guide to make finding resources at USC easy. Dr. Broderick Leaks, the director of counseling and mental health at USC, a licensed clinical psychologist and the vice chair for student mental health in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, says there is a multitude of resources available to USC students, and it\u2019s easy to access them. USC recently completely revamped its website to increase user ability of counseling and mental health services. Although Leaks explained that USC is \u201cwell above the national benchmark for students utilizing services,\u201d with about 16 to 20% of its students using counseling and mental health services, USC hopes that number will continue to grow. A recent study found that as many as half of all college students nationwide report mental health distress, but not all of them are seeking help. The process can be overwhelming for students so this step-by-step guide will help them navigate the resources available. \u201cThese resources are trying to provide students with the right service, right place, right time and right person delivering it,\u201d Leaks said. Students can visit USC\u2019s counseling and mental health services website, which has an array of options. Students can also speak to a healthcare professional at 213-740-9355 to discuss service options. Here are some of the options available to people seeking these resources: 1. For students looking for traditional therapy options, start with an individual intake assessment, where counselors are available to talk one-on-one through both telehealth and in-person appointments. From here, you can create a treatment plan, which may include being referred to short-term therapy to work through situations with people working through a similar situation, or weekly group counseling. There are groups for common concerns such as depression, panic disorder, ADHD, social anxiety, eating disorders and more. The addition of embedded counselors also provides clinical support within your specific school. Right now USC offers embedded counseling services for students in Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the School of Architecture, the Gould School of Law, Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the School of Cinematic Arts. These resources also help USC to understand and communicate mental health needs by department. 2. Are you not ready to commit to full-time therapy sessions, but have something you want to talk through? USC has two great options\u2014 Let\u2019s Talk and Solution Sessions. Let\u2019s Talk is a 30-minute session with a Counseling and Mental Health clinician. This is a great \u201cintro to therapy\u201d session where students can work on building resiliency skills and problem solving. Solution Sessions are single 50-minute sessions with a therapist to focus on an unexpected situation that has occurred in a student\u2019s life. For those struggling to balance school, social life and extracurricular activities, a therapist can help provide some perspective during this session. 3. To combat longer waiting times USC partnered with Uwill Therapy as part of their Therapy+ option. This is a telehealth company that focuses on college students, providing students the ability to see their service providers within 24 to 48 hours. 4. Not looking to talk face-to-face with a counselor? As part of Therapy+, USC students have the option to text with a responder through Oasis Chat. Oasis chat is available for all USC students and provides options to chat, learn new skills for stress management or journal with guided prompts and set goals. 5. Interested in working specifically with a BIPOC or LGBTQ+ professional? USC also offers an entire mental health service community for those interested in working specifically with clinicians who are supportive, culturally informed, and have \u201cposture of cultural humility\u201d in their work. While they offer the same services as the traditional clinicians, you have the option to select a clinician with a similar identity. This includes people of Black or African descent, API and Desi Americans, Latinx and/or Chicanx, LGBTQ+, religious services and international services. 6. For students not interested in therapy, but are instead just looking to generally increase their \u201cmental health toolkit,\u201d USC offers a wide variety of workshops such as, \u201cAnxiety Toolbox,\u201d \u201cIncrease your emotional intelligence,\u201d \u201cStress less\u201d and more. Lastly, for those who need immediate help, there is a 24/7 crisis support line that students can call or text. There is also an option to walk into the Engemann Student Health Center on the day of and be seen immediately for emergencies. \n```"}

Hurado believes that the new format would better reflect Hispanic or Latino individuals\u2019 distinct identities in the U.S. \u201cI think [the new categories] would help for further research representing us instead of having it just be broad,\u201d Hurado said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really going to support that demographic of people if you don\u2019t have a specific category for them.\u201d\n\nEvelyn Alstuny, a professor of American Studies and Ethnicity at USC, explained in an emailed statement to Annenberg Media that activists have been pushing for more specific ethnicity options in the U.S. census for decades. \u201cArab American groups, like the Arab American Institute, have been lobbying for Census recognition since the 1990s,\u201d Alstuny said. \u201cWithout a box, we do not have access to federal funding or protection that would allow for more equitable health, education, and political representation.\u201d\n\nIf the proposed \u201cMiddle Eastern or North African\u201d (MENA) checkbox were approved by the Biden Administration, it would change the OMB\u2019s definition of \u201cwhite\u201d established in 1997. The category currently encompasses anybody with origins in Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.\n\nEryn Burnett, a graduate student in the Masters of Healthcare Administration program, said the 1997 definition could incorrectly identify those from the MENA community as white. \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that they were previously included under \u2018white\u2019 because obviously, they\u2019re not white. So it\u2019s very weird to me that that was the original way that it was set up,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cI would support this new change, because I feel like people should be able to say exactly who they are and how they identify themselves \u2014 culturally, racially [and] ethnically,\u201d\n\nAlturney expands on this view, stating that the MENA community is \u201cmade invisible by checking the white box while [they] are racialized as threats to national security.\u201d\n\nLinda Zbinden, a doctoral student of American studies and ethnicity, also believes the proposed changes will result in tangible political and cultural progress for the MENA community. \u201cWe face a lot of systemic, interpersonal and social violence and discrimination,\u201d Zbinden said. \u201cAnd without a census category, there\u2019s no way to track that. There\u2019s no way to track hate crimes after the Muslim ban or after 911. There\u2019s no way to allocate resources to refugees or to working class or poor communities.\u201d\n\nBurnett said she prefers an option to self-select her racial or ethnic identity instead of the census simply expanding to more categories to choose from., \u201cI know that\u2019s not the most efficient, with the way that the programs and the systems are typically created,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cBut, I think that would be really great.\u201d\n\nThe lack of specific racial categories in the U.S. Census affects more than just representation in numbers. According to the U.S. Census website, census results inform how over $675 billion of government funds are distributed every year. The data from sex, ethnicity, age and race influence how government funds are distributed.\n\nA study by the Frontiers in Public Health found that Arab Americans are a historically understudied group in the U.S., and their health needs and risks have been poorly documented due to a lack of documented data by the US census.\n\nIf the Office of Management and Budget implements these changes, people who identify as Middle Eastern, North African, Puerto Rican, Cuban and Colombian will see themselves on the next decennial census form in 2030.\n```"}

County has partnered with telehealth company Hazel Health to offer virtual therapy services to its 1.3 million public K-12 students.\n\nExpand 32nd Street USC Magnet School, a school in the Los Angeles Unified School District, on Oct. 7, 2022. (Photo by Xianhui Huang)\n\nBy Ethan Huang, Peter Makk, Benjamin Papp, and Chuck White February 06, 2023 at 6:38 pm PST\n\nThe Los Angeles County Office of Education announced on Friday that it will be working to develop a virtual therapy program to help tackle the mental health issues among students in local K-12 schools. The program will be made available to the 1.3 million students in public K-12 schools in Los Angeles County and hopes to address the youth mental health crisis that has become more apparent in recent years.\n\nStudents will have access to free virtual therapy sessions with California-licensed therapists both at school and at home. To log in, they can use their personal devices or check out an iPad from their school.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I cannot see [every student],\u201d said Ivonne Moreno, a school psychologist intern at 32nd Street School. \u201cAn extra service would be so amazing for all these kids.\u201d\n\nThe service was made in collaboration with telehealth company Hazel Health and will be funded by the state\u2019s Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program. L.A. Care Health Plan and Health Net will also be supporting the program.\n\nIn a statement made to Annenberg Media, Beatriz Lopez, the senior public relations manager of Health Net, confirmed that they will be setting up to $24 million aside over the next two years to cover all services in the program.\n\nMajor school districts like the L.A. Unified School District and the Compton School District have already signed on, and more are expected to follow in the coming months.\n\nCurrently, many schools are unable to provide mental health services to a majority of their students. Moreno shared that many school psychologists can only come in once a month. They often only have time to meet with students who have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), but Moreno believes there are a lot of children in general education who are not getting the support they need.\n\nAccording to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s Master Plan for Kids\u2019 Mental Health, 66% of California youth with depression go untreated, and this has become heightened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other societal challenges.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, I\u2019ve seen an increase in isolation, a lot of anxiety, and I think it has always existed,\u201d said Moreno. \u201cBut I think that the pandemic has played a role, especially for students who became really isolated, getting back to the routine that they were used to is hard and it gives them anxiety.\n\nIn regard to the virtual nature of the program, Moreno feels there are pros and cons to both in-person and online therapy, so it depends on the students\u2019 preference. She says that many students feel too vulnerable talking to a clinician in the same room as them, and they may be more comfortable talking through a screen or even turning off their camera and communicating through the chat.\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media, Dr. Sonya Smith, the director of student support services for the Los Angeles County Office of Education, and Alicia Garoupa, the chief of well-being and support services for LACOE, brought up how this initiative challenges the inequity of the current mental health programs in schools.\n\nChildren and parents are often directed to providers that have long waitlists and are dependent on children having transportation to get to these clinicians. This is consistent with Beatriz Lopez\u2019s statement for Health Net, in which she said that this model of mental healthcare will be more accessible than ever before, \u201cparticularly for students from economically disadvantaged families.\u201d\n\nHazel Health also has a very diverse group of therapists, including bilingual providers and a demographic more representative of L.A. County.\n\nDr. Smith and Alicia Garoupa stated that this program is \u201cone tool in the toolbox\u201d to address the youth mental health crisis in Los Angeles. It is creating one avenue for students to address their mental health through schools free of cost. It is a major step in the right direction but is not the cure.\n\nThey also pointed to other initiatives in the process of getting funding, such as the youth mental health first aid program which aims to end the stigma among adults, making them more open to addressing children\u2019s needs.\n\nAccording to the LAist, program organizers plan for dozens of other school districts to join the effort, making services available for students city-wide, regardless of their insurance level or health plan.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AngryJulieMonday licensed under CC BY 2.0)\n\nBy Julia Zara, Brooklyn Blasscyk and Maddy Brown\nFebruary 06, 2023 at 6:10 pm PST\n\nOn Saturday, student representatives from USC School of Cinematic Arts, Annenberg, Roski and Kaufman led arts and humanities workshops on campus for nearly 300 elementary school students from South Los Angeles. Called USC Kids News, the event is the sixth of its kind to teach third through sixth graders how to excel in arts journalism and other skills in the humanities.\n\nThe affair featured dance performances from Kaufman students, a yoga intermission from CorePower and a presentation on arts journalism by Oscar Garza, the director of specialized journalism at Annenberg. Participating students learned about the editorial guidelines that oversee informational and news articles, opinion pieces, reviews and profiles.\n\n\u201cFrom what I could tell, they really loved it. I think a lot of times in elementary and middle school, the relationship with writing is pretty negative, so to be able to give them something that\u2019s fun and enjoyable was really cool to see,\u201d said Kole Greene, a sophomore screenwriting major, who helped lead the screenwriting section for the visiting students.\n\nThe event was organized by the USC chapter of PressFriends Inc., an L.A.-based nonprofit created in 2008. The organization visits Title I elementary schools \u2013 schools where children from low-income families make up 40% of the student body \u2013 and helps enhance students\u2019 written communication skills.\n\nJohn Mack Elementary School, situated a mile away from the University Park Campus, was one school that attended the student-led workshops. Silvia Ruiz, a teacher at John Mack, said her fourth and fifth-grade students were thrilled to visit USC. She added that having students physically come to campus greatly boosted morale, especially with USC being \u201cin their backyard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey loved it \u2014 today at school it was all the talk,\u201d she said. \u201cVisiting USC, many of them were comparing it to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nRuiz added that having young adult mentors allows elementary students to make personal connections that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have at school. Every week, members of USC PressFriends visit schools like John Mack to serve as mentors for young aspiring journalists, helping them edit articles and facilitate interviews with scientists, playwrights and even California Supreme Court justices.\n\nCallie McAdams, the co-president of USC PressFriends, said that the organization aims to give young people access to subjects like journalism and screenwriting, which aren\u2019t readily available to students outside prestigious schools like USC. Teaching young students composition and news literacy is of the utmost importance, she said, particularly in the years following the pandemic.\n\n\u201cOne reason why I thought that the focus of this event was so impactful this year is because there was a lapse of access to the arts during COVID for a lot of kids,\u201d Callie said. \u201cWriting is everything. It\u2019s also how we express ourselves. So I think, yes, the focus is on journalism, but it\u2019s also on just having a fun way for these kids to write and get more practice writing outside of their typical school essays.\u201d\n\nDevon Lee, a board member of USC PressFriends, echoes this sentiment: \u201cI think especially with the amount of different forms of media that they\u2019re consuming...it\u2019s really important for them to understand what they\u2019re consuming and how.\u201d\n\nJournalism wasn\u2019t the only skill taught at Saturday\u2019s event. Multiple sectors of the arts were explored by students, including screenwriting, which Callie said isn\u2019t always accessible to students outside of prestigious schools like USC.\n\nGreene said he would love to see more similar events on campus, particularly those that focus on philanthropy and mentorship. \u201cI think giving back is really important, especially given how much USC takes from the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think giving back is a must.\u201d\n\nRuiz said that inviting the students on campus united a highly gentrified South L.A., shortening the distance between nearby neighborhoods and USC. \u201cI think the children visiting USC really makes it seem like it\u2019s something that they can also attain \u2014 it\u2019s a goal that can be reached,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s normalizing the whole. USC is part of our community, and people like us can attend it.\u201d```"}

Expand \"The Strikeout\" column will explore different aspects of fantasy baseball through MLB Opening Day on March 30. (AP Photo/Will Graves, File)  By   Diego Ynzunza February 06, 2023 at  6:07 pm PST \n \n\u201cThe Strikeout\u201d is a column by Diego Ynzunza dedicated to all things fantasy baseball. Welcome to the Strikeout, a new weekly fantasy baseball column. A little about myself: I\u2019m Diego, a freshman at USC. I\u2019ve been playing fantasy baseball for six years and have become a more committed player over the past three. I participate in a yearly friends-and-family Roto league and an NFBC Best Ball league hosted by the Athletic. This year, I hope to expand into more high-stakes NFBC Roto leagues, as that is where the best fantasy players tend to play. For those of you who are unfamiliar with some of the terms that I just used, don\u2019t worry. This week\u2019s column will introduce you to some key fantasy terms, league types and ways of evaluating players. There have been a lot of interesting developments this offseason that have had major ramifications for this year\u2019s fantasy baseball game. First though, I think it would be helpful to introduce the game itself and give some background into how the game works, followed by the different ways that I\u2019m going to be evaluating players. For those who are familiar with fantasy football, fantasy baseball functions in a similar way. You draft or buy a team of players who will accumulate stats for you throughout the season. You compete against the other teams in the league to see who eventually comes out on top. The two main scoring systems are rotisserie and Head-to-Head points. Head-to-Head points is more like fantasy football, in which you compete against a specific opponent each week and get a certain number of points for stats your players accumulate. I will mainly focus on Rotisserie, or Roto for short, which is a more traditional way to play fantasy baseball. Roto is a season-long competition against all the other teams in the league. You accumulate stats throughout the season and each team receives points based on how they finished in a particular category. We usually refer to the Roto scoring as \u201c5 x 5,\u201d as there are typically five hitting categories (runs, home runs, RBIs, batting average and stolen bases) and five pitching categories (wins, saves, strikeouts, ERA and WHIP). For example, if your pitchers have the most wins at the end of the season, you will get the most points in that category. The points are then added up, and the team with the most total points across the board finishes in first place. There are tons of different formats, including league size, draft style and more. For the purposes of this column, I will be referring to a 15-team mixed (full MLB, not just AL or NL) snake draft. I will also be referring to leagues that set their lineups weekly, not daily. This means that after you set your lineup, usually on a Sunday night, you aren\u2019t able to change it for the week. A couple of other terms that would be helpful for you to know are the waiver wire, streamers and sleepers/busts. The waiver wire is the place during the season where you can go to pick up players who aren\u2019t currently on rosters. It can be helpful to pick up a replacement for your roster if there is an injury. That leads into the next term, which is a streamer. When you need more stats from your pitchers for a specific week, you can pick up streamers for a week in which you think they have favorable matchups. Sleepers are players who have been previously undervalued by the rest of the community. Busts are guys who are supposed to perform well, but for whatever reason, we expect them to underperform. As far as the way that I evaluate players, I tend to use three main sources of information. The first is THE BAT X projection systems by Derek Carty on FanGraphs. Some people make the mistake of utilizing the projection systems way too much or too little. For me, I find them to be helpful to give myself a ballpark of how guys\u2019 seasons are projected to play out. They are calculated based on aging trends, past performance and more. Secondly, I am a big fan of the Athletic and Eno Sarris specifically. Eno is one of the leaders in the fantasy baseball community when it comes to evaluating players. For pitchers specifically, Eno has three numbers that I take into account: Pitching +, Command + and Stuff +. A score of 100 for each means that a pitcher is league average in that category. There are tons of factors that decide these numbers, which I can go into more as I start to evaluate pitchers. The big ones are pitch shape, movement, velocity, ability to command the baseball and the ability to manipulate the baseball in a certain way to acquire new movement on pitches. Lastly, specifically when drafting, using the NFBC ADP rankings are helpful to know when to pick the players you want. For example, if you see someone who you rate highly getting drafted low, you can wait a couple of rounds to take him. As far as the sites you can use to play, ESPN, Yahoo and CBS are very popular. However, I\u2019m privy to NFC, which is short for National Fantasy Competition. The NFBC specifically is one of the biggest fantasy sports competitions in America, with thousands of players entering the various leagues that they have available. They have buy-ins ranging from $50, all the way up to thousands of dollars, with a variety of different league types including Roto, Head-to-Head points and Best Ball. That\u2019s a small introduction to the expansive world of fantasy baseball. So whether you\u2019re a seasoned fantasy veteran or just looking to get your start, stay tuned for the coming weeks. \u201cThe Strikeout\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

Tomorrow begins the next phase of the campaign! Expect to see buttons, leaflets and signs. So we spoke with the five presidential candidates about their platforms and how each of them plans to connect with us, the voters. Nataly Lozano reports.\n\nIt\u2019s election season for USC students once again, as the USG presidential candidates begin their physical campaigns on Tuesday. According to the USG Speaker of the Senate Alvaro Flores, voter turnout has been low for recent USG elections. So how are this year\u2019s candidates engaging with USC students and getting them to vote? We asked the five presidential candidates that same question.\n\nWe begin with third-year Sociology major Miko Mariscal and her DEI initiative, which aims to emphasize diversity, equity, and inclusion as a forefront of her platform. Miko Mariscal: These conversations need to be had and they all intersect and flowed down to a lot of our campaign points, whether it be the club resource guide or career career development, as well as our transparency tracker. And then finally, our very large one as Trojan family weekend and our funding goals.\n\nMariscal\u2019s vice presidential candidate, third-year Communication major Andrew Taw, highlights the events the duo has planning to promote their platform this week. Andrew Taw: This upcoming Wednesday, we\u2019re going to be giving out pizza, We\u2019re going to be on Trousdale. We\u2019re hoping that people come talk to us. We\u2019re going to have like a QR code that like links all our platform points. And also we\u2019ve just been meeting with like RSOs, our registered student organizations recently. So we\u2019ve just been excited.\n\nFourth-year Political Science major and presidential candidate Aidan Feighery agrees with the notion that face-to-face communication reigns supreme. Aidan Feighery: I strongly prefer to have an actual conversation with people. I don\u2019t like to just talk at them and assume that they got the message. I prefer to have a conversation with them and hear what they care about and they think is important.\n\nFeighery\u2019s platform focuses on sexual assault prevention at USC. Aidan Feighery: The most important part of our platform focuses on a real solution to sexual assault prevention at USC. We saw in fall of 2021 that we didn\u2019t have enough protections then, and since then we have only had those protections rolled back due to disaffiliation.\n\nIn the same vein, Divya Jakatdar, third year Political Science student and presidential candidate, believes in serving the USC student body in four main ways. Divya Jakatdar: Our goal is really to improve upon four areas of student life, which are accessibility, affordability, community and transparency. And then we basically bucketed our priority projects within this.\n\nJakatdar\u2019s campaigning involves more personal ways to get voters engaged. Divya Jakatdar: We\u2019re making a lot of videos showing, you know, a little bit of lightheartedness, but also just to really engage voters, because I think students often get disengaged with student government.\n\nNavya Singh, 3rd year Business Administration student and vice presidential candidate, also believes in hands-on engagement for voters. Navya Singh: So this upcoming Friday from 11 to 12 we have like professional head shots because I am a Marshall student, but I feel like without Marshall, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten the chance to really like learn the importance of like resumes, of head shots, of networking. So, I really want to try to implement those types of things.\n\nIn terms of her platform, Singh has used her time as a senator to emphasize her qualifications for the job. Navya Singh: So, just try to talk to people on the day-to-day. Whether that\u2019s classes or just anywhere tabling-wise, just to see, like, why it is that people don\u2019t vote, and like, what we can do about that because I think that talking to people \u2014 listening is a very important skill that I learned personally as a Senator and Devon is fantastic at.\n\nAnother candidate who is a current USG senator, 2nd year Political Economy major Yoav Gillath, is using previous experience on his presidential platform. Yoav Gillath: So our three biggest priorities on our platform is community outreach, mental health and restructuring.\n\nYoav Gillath: We also want to keep pushing for the Trojans give back Dining Dollar donation program that I founded that\u2019s been able to donate $55,000 worth of food to unhoused individuals and food insecure students.\n\nGillath\u2019s vice presidential candidate, Quantitative Biology major Monica Rodriguez, is passionate about getting new voters involved this election season. Monica Rodriguez: For some of these people, it\u2019s their first time, like voting in an election and they\u2019re like juniors. And so like that really says a lot about like our campaign and like our intentions to make sure that we\u2019re we\u2019re actively seeking out people who haven\u2019t been historically involved in making sure that, you know, they realize that they\u2019re just as important to us.\n\nAs you\u2019ve heard, this year\u2019s USG candidates look to engage more with the student body. Only time will tell if their efforts pay off in voter turnout. Voting opens February 21st and closes the following Sunday, February 26th. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nataly Lozano.\n```"}

Monday morning, Turkey and Syria were devastated by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake and at least 77 aftershocks that have killed more than 3,000 people.\n\nThe effects have reached beyond Turkey and Syria, with USC students from these countries being affected by the devastation at home.

That would be so great.\n\nNews is constantly coming from Turkey and Syria as casualties are calculated and damage is assessed. Those who want to donate can donate to organizations such as Unicef at unicef.org and Oxfam at give.oxfamamerica.org.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sara Kahn\n\nIf you are interested in helping raise money to support those impacted by the earthquake MENASA, the Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly, is holding an event tomorrow between 1 and 4pm where they will sell Turkish and Syrian desserts. All the money collected will be donated. Keep an eye out for flyers that will be up soon.\n```"}

The singer made it just in time for host Trevor Noah to personally hand her the Grammy so she could celebrate her win.\n\nThis year, Beyonc\u00e9 was nominated for nine awards, three of which are in what music industry professionals refer to as the \u201cbig three\u201d categories. These nominations, which are typically regarded as the most sought-after awards, are for Record of the Year for \u201cBreak My Soul,\u201d Album of the Year for \u201cRenaissance,\u201d and Song of the Year, also for \u201cBreak My Soul.\u201d She ended the night with a total of 32 Grammy wins out of 88 nominations in her career thus far.\n\nWhat shocked viewers (and especially the BeyHive) was Harry Styles taking home the award for Album of the Year for his third album, \u201cHarry\u2019s House.\u201d Even the singer himself looked stunned when his name was announced \u2013 he held his head in his hands and sat in disbelief before he accepted the award. Styles acknowledged the other nominees and his own surprise at the win by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been so, so inspired by every artist in this category with me.\u201d He also added that \u201c...on nights like tonight, it\u2019s obviously important for us to remember that there is no such thing as best in music.\u201d\n\nHis win was a stunning upset, as Beyonc\u00e9 had been expected to win the award after receiving overwhelming critical acclaim for \u201cRenaissance.\u201d Others believed that the award would go to other critics\u2019 and fan favorites in the category, such as Adele or Bad Bunny. Adele has won Album of the Year twice and Bad Bunny had worldwide success with his most recent album \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d for which he won Best M\u00fasica Urbana Album. Styles\u2019 win marks his third Grammy award out of nine nominations in his solo career. He also took home Best Pop Vocal Album for \u201cHarry\u2019s House,\u201d and his album also won in the category of Best Engineered Non-Classical Album. Styles also performed his hit single \u201cAs It Was\u201d at the awards.\n\nBonnie Raitt taking home Song of the Year for \u201cJust Like That\u201d was another surprise from this year\u2019s show. Raitt\u2019s win caught fans by surprise given the huge names that were nominated. She now has had a total of 30 Grammy nominations and 13 wins across her career.\n\nLizzo took home Record of the Year for \u201cAbout Damn Time,\u201d her fourth Grammy win out of 13 nominations. Although Adele was nominated in the \u201cbig three\u201d categories, she took home Best Pop Solo Performance for \u201cEasy On Me.\u201d This year, she earned seven nominations. It was the singer\u2019s first year back as a Grammy nominee since 2017 when she won Album of the Year for \u201c25,\u201d Record of the Year, and Song of the Year for \u201cHello.\u201d Famously, during her Album of the Year acceptance speech, Adele said the award rightfully belonged to Beyonc\u00e9. This marks her 16th career win out of 25 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn another history-making win, Kim Petras became the first transgender woman to win a Grammy award with her win for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category for \u201cUnholy.\u201d Additionally, Viola Davis was upgraded to the legendary \u201cEGOT\u201d (when an artist has won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards) status with her win for Best Spoken Word or Non-musical Album for \u201cFinding Me.\u201d See the complete list of Grammy winners here.\n```"}

Madness continues. One can only pray for Joe Lunardi in his efforts to make his most recent bracketology. In a week that witnessed 15 ranked teams falling and five of the top ten teams following suit, here are my top headlines.\n\nAfter this week, Alabama is the best team in the country The No. 3 Crimson Tide through 23 games of the season only have one more loss than their football team did this year, a pretty incredible feat when you look at Alabama\u2019s football program. With No. 1 Purdue falling to in-state rival No. 21 Indiana on Saturday, it marked the sixth time the No. 1 ranked team has lost this year. Until then, Purdue was the clear-cut No. 1 team in the country, and in the Week 13 AP Top 25 poll, received a unanimous No. 1 ranking. However, in a loss to an extremely inconsistent Indiana team, the door is now wide open for a new team to claim the throne for best team in the country.\n\nThere are a few teams who could make a claim for that title, including Houston, Arizona, Texas and even Purdue. Nonetheless, the Crimson Tide should be the No. 1 team in the country. On ESPN\u2019s College Basketball Power Index, Alabama\u2019s resume ranking is one of the best. The Crimson Tide rank No. 2 in strength of record, No. 12 in total strength of schedule and No. 4 in non-conference strength of schedule. The Crimson Tide\u2019s only losses are to No. 24 UConn, No. 12 Gonzaga and Oklahoma. Against UConn and Oklahoma, Alabama was blown out, which begs the question of how they will face off against the best further down the line. However, the Crimson Tide also have wins over No. 3 Houston, North Carolina, Michigan State and Memphis. While UNC, Michigan State and Memphis are not the cream of the crop, they are all NCAA tournament-caliber teams, who could make deep runs in March.\n\nAlabama is the only Power 6 conference team that is undefeated in league play, and they do not play an easy schedule. Not only that, but when they win, they win big \u2014\u2013 including two 100-point performances in SEC play. I am marking my calendar for February 15 when the Crimson Tide square off against No. 6 Tennessee in Knoxville. If they win that, there should be nobody stopping them from finishing the regular season undefeated in SEC conference play.\n\nGonzaga\u2019s fall from grace\n\nThe No. 16 Zags have been on a slow tumble from the top since their near-perfect season back in the 2020-21 season. Last Saturday, for the second year in a row, Gonzaga\u2019s trip to Moraga, California to play No. 18 Saint Mary\u2019s ended in defeat as the Gaels shocked the Zags in overtime 78-70 and took a two-game lead on the Bulldogs in conference play. This year has been a bit disappointing for Gonzaga. Even though they returned many key players and were No. 2 in the preseason Top 25, they already have more losses in the regular season than they did last year. The Zags also snapped their 75-game winning streak at home when they lost to Loyola Marymount 68-67. Gonzaga has won the West Coast Conference for ten straight years, but it is looking like this year might change that. Even if Gonzaga beats Saint Mary\u2019s when the two play again on February 25, they need the Gaels to lose one more game for a chance at the title.\n\nIt\u2019s about time the Zags had a real conference opponent, so Saint Mary\u2019s being good comes with great joy to me as someone who has called the West Coast Conference a cupcake conference for years now. I\u2019ll give Gonzaga some vindication: They have wins over No. 14 Xavier and No. 4 Alabama, but a loss to Loyola Marymount and tightly contested games with BYU and San Francisco bring much concern. Overall, I do not see the Zags making it far in the NCAA tournament. At best, a Sweet Sixteen appearance could be on the Bulldogs\u2019 horizon, but not much more than that. Who knows, though \u2014 maybe they will undermine this entire column and make it back to the Final Four. It is called March Madness for a reason.\n\nTuesday\u2019s slate of games is what I am most looking forward to this week, with four matchups of ranked teams, including No. 8 Virginia vs. No. 22 NC State and No. 12 Kansas State vs. No. 17 TCU. \u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nFebruary 05, 2023 at 9:29 pm PST\n\nIt was a battle of attrition, but the best car won anyway. Martin Truex Jr. had the fastest car all race. It took time for him to get to the front, but once he did, no one could compete. Truex (No. 19) set the fastest time in practice yesterday and showed pace all day, but he had a rough qualifying that saw him start sixth in the second heat race.\n\nIt\u2019s a sharp contrast to his disastrous race last year, which saw him post the third slowest qualifying time, make no progress in his heat, finish last in his Last Chance Qualifying race and advance to the Clash race on last year\u2019s points, only to spin on the last lap and finish last.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to come here, but it\u2019s a lot more fun to win it,\u201d Truex said. \u201cLast year wasn\u2019t all that fun. This weekend was a blast.\u201d\n\nThe day started with four action-packed heat races won by Aric Almirola (No. 10), Truex, Denny Hamlin (No. 11) and William Byron (No. 24). The two LCQ races were less dramatic \u2014 packs quickly spread out and there wasn\u2019t much passing. Ty Gibbs (No. 54) tried to pass for the lead in the second LCQ, but his efforts were very cautious, not wanting to damage his car ahead of the later race.\n\nThe first half of the final race was a strong advertisement for NASCAR in metropolitan Los Angeles: The few cautions didn\u2019t significantly impact the run time, there were a lot of opportunities to pass and there were interesting strategic decisions and action up front.\n\nThe second half \u2014 the post-Wiz Khalifa era \u2014 was a disaster. Six cautions came out in the first 11 laps. The last 75 laps as a whole featured 11 cautions. That second half came after a 30-minute break in action with the sun going down. By the time cars were running again, the track had cooled significantly.\n\n\u201cThe track is brand new pavement. These tires don\u2019t like to cool off,\u201d Truex said. \u201cYou\u2019re just sliding so bad on restarts that guys would get in the corner and they\u2019re locking the brakes, they can\u2019t turn, can\u2019t get the rear to hook up. So they\u2019re just sliding into each other, and that was, I\u2019m sure, a big factor.\u201d\n\nThe accident frequency was a sharp contrast to last year. \u201cLast year\u2019s show I felt like was relatively clean and good racing \u2014 some bumping, some banging \u2014 but we could run long stretches of green,\u201d third-place finisher Kyle Busch (No. 18) said. \u201cToday was, I would call it a disaster.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for incidents was increased parity, runner-up Austin Dillon (No. 3) said. Last year, the field spread was wider and cars didn\u2019t make contact as frequently. This year, the most reliable way to pass was by ramming the car in front.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, I think it\u2019s a great event. It\u2019s a great atmosphere,\u201d fifth-place finisher Alex Bowman (No. 48) said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough when it takes 45 minutes to make like six laps or whatever that was.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the weekend, there were discussions of turning the Clash into a points race next year to guarantee a Southern California points race with Fontana\u2019s Auto Club Speedway off the schedule for renovations. Drivers were not enthusiastic about that idea.\n\n\u201cWhy would you want to screw it up and make it a points race? It\u2019s like a one-off deal, the Clash,\u201d Truex said. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been doing it, it just kind of got boring, from back in the day when it was just pole winners from last year, then it was champions, and then it was everybody that made the playoffs. It just got all weird, and now this is really cool. It\u2019s got its own identity, fun race, all the way out here in a cool venue that\u2019s got a lot of history.\u201d\n\nThe Clash has not been confirmed to return to Los Angeles next year but without Auto Club, it seems possible that the Coliseum will host NASCAR again.\n```"}

Hearing faint \u201cU of A\u201d chants, Sissoko received the ball from Littleton, with the Trojans down two points. She leaped, trying to tie the game, but failed to make the jumper. A few minutes later, the game was over. Arizona won 81-75 in double overtime on Sunday afternoon at Galen Center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a progression towards March,\u201d said head coach Lindsay Gottlieb. \u201cYou hate to lose a game like that, but I have no doubt that it\u2019s going to help us get where we want to go.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans showed their signature defense in the first two quarters, limiting the Wildcats to a season-low 18 points in the first half. Arizona did not make a three in the entire half. In the last two quarters, the Wildcats broke through in the paint, with fifth-year forward Cate Reese leading the charge. Reese scored 16 of her 33 points in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n\u201cProps to [Reese], she was just a force on the block,\u201d sophomore forward Rayah Marshall said.\n\nThe Wildcats\u2019 offensive momentum carried into overtime, when the Trojans matched them shot for shot until the final minute. From the third quarter onward, Arizona shot 49% from the field. Throughout the season, Reese has combined with fifth-year guard Shaina Pellington, fifth-year guard Jade Loville and senior forward Esmery Martinez to form a quadruple threat. The Trojans were only able to keep Martinez off the board, as the other three scored well above their season averages.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get the critical stop when we needed to,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe made some big shots, but they knocked down the answer when they needed to.\u201d\n\nOn the offensive side, Littleton dropped 21 points for the third straight game. Marshall recorded her 12th double-double of the season, scoring 17 points and snatching 20 rebounds. Sissoko tacked on another 15. However, the biggest surprise of the afternoon was graduate guard Rokia Doumbia, who went 6-for-6 from the field and put up a career-high 17 points.\n\n\u201cI had an opportunity to step up and help the team,\u201d Doumbia said. \u201cAnd I did my best.\u201d\n\nDoumbia\u2019s career night was cut short when she fouled out with 1:20 to go in the first overtime. In the second overtime period, with 43 seconds left, Loville hit a fadeaway jumper to put the Wildcats up 75-73. Sissoko\u2019s final shot missed the basket entirely and sealed the Trojans\u2019 fate.\n\n\u201cThis loss hurts, especially in this moment,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cBut ... we don\u2019t want to ever be stagnant. If the emergence of [Doumbia] can help us down the stretch, that will make everyone else better too.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans moved to 2-1 against ranked teams, 7-5 in the Pac-12 and 17-6 overall. It was just their second loss in Galen Center this season. USC will stay home to face Oregon Friday, followed by Oregon State next Sunday.\n```"}

(Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nFebruary 05, 2023 at 1:45 pm PST\n\nThe Clash at the Coliseum kicks off the 2023 NASCAR Cup season today. With the sport returning to the West Coast, here are a few storylines to look out for.\n\nUnderdogs in front\nJustin Haley won pole position. He qualified third overall last year, putting him on pole for one of the heats, but he\u2019s far from a star driver. Haley drives for Kaulig Racing, only in its second year as a full-time team. His teammate, longtime veteran A.J. Allmendinger, will be starting on the front row of the fourth heat race in his first race as a full-time Cup Series driver since 2018. Both are gifted drivers, but this showing came as a surprise.\n\nPenskes towards the back\nLast year\u2019s winner Joey Logano was the top-qualifying Penske, but he only managed to place 17th. Teammates Austin Cindric and Ryan Blaney qualified 25th and 35th, respectively. Penske is coming off an amazing 2022, with championship wins in both NASCAR (Logano) and IndyCar (Will Power) and a Daytona 500 win from Cindric. This year has not started nearly as well.\n\nAgents of chaos\nTy Gibbs showed good pace in practice with the sixth fastest time. Unfortunately for his prospects today, his car caught on fire yesterday, preventing him from setting a lap time in qualifying. He\u2019s a very aggressive young driver, and it would not be a surprise to see him make risky moves to push for a spot in the final race. If you want to guarantee that you\u2019ll be entertained, watch out for the No. 54 car.\n\nTy Dillon hasn\u2019t shown much pace this weekend and only managed to qualify 33rd, but last year he and Austin Cindric were making moves most other drivers didn\u2019t dare attempt. The No. 77 team needs to dial in their set-up for tomorrow, but Ty Dillon is an aggressive enough driver to create drama regardless of how quick his car is around such a short circuit.\n\nBig names in the mud\nWith the track cooling as qualifying wore on, some very good drivers set very bad times. Chase Elliott, a former Cup Series champion, qualified 30th after putting forward the seventh fastest qualifying time last year. Ryan Blaney has been top 10 in the standings in each of the last six years. Today, he carried too much speed into turn three, bailed on his lap, turned around, drove back to the midway point on the back straightaway, and carried on from there. His lap was disallowed, so he\u2019ll be starting in the back. Interesting strategy there Blaney, let\u2019s see if it pays off...\n\nMartin Truex Jr. and Bubba Wallace were the two fastest cars in practice, but both failed to put forward top-15 times in qualifying. They\u2019ve shown strong daytime pace this weekend but failed to adjust to colder temperatures. Tyler Reddick was leading in last year\u2019s Clash before his driveshaft broke. This year, in his first race as a 23XI driver, he only qualified 19th. All five drivers should make significant progress towards the front in today\u2019s heat races.\n\nProjections:\nHeat 1 Winner: Justin Haley (No. 31) - The first group is likely the weakest of the four heats. With how difficult it was to pass for the lead last year and the track needing to rubber in after last night\u2019s rain, Haley should have a fairly easy path to victory. Last year\u2019s winner, Joey Logano, is the dark horse, starting fifth in the group.\n\nHeat 2 Winner: Kyle Busch (No. 8) - Busch won his heat last year and led for much of the final race. He has pace again this year, which put him on pole for the heat, but faces a tough group with four other former Cup Series champions.\n\nHeat 3 Winner: Denny Hamlin (No. 11) - Heat 3 is more of a toss-up, but I expect Hamlin\u2019s experience to help him to victory in the heat. Polesitter Christopher Bell (No. 20) and the midpack Chase Briscoe (No. 14) have experience in shorter track situations and should figure to compete for the win. Tyler Reddick (No. 45) was also strong last year.\n\nHeat 4 Winner: Bubba Wallace (No. 23) - This may be an overreaction to practice, but Bubba Wallace was lightning quick in daytime running yesterday. He doesn\u2019t start up front, but he may have the pace to work his way up anyway. William Byron (No. 24) should be strong from pole and Ross Chastain (No. 1) will also compete for the win, as his aggressive driving style should help him move forward.\n\nLCQ 1 Winner: Chase Elliott (No. 9) - At least one of the second heat\u2019s former Cup Series champions will have to race their way in through the Last Chance Qualifying rounds. Elliott starts at the back in his heat and could find it hard to make it into the top five.\n\nLCQ 2 Winner: Tyler Reddick (No. 45) - Reddick showed great pace last year before his car failed him. He starts toward the back of a very talented group and could find himself the odd one out, but he should have the pace to compete anyway.\n\nOverall Winner: Kyle Busch (No. 8) - Busch had remarkable pace last year before an untimely caution gave Logano the lead. This year, he will likely start towards the front of the field and should be tough to pass again. Look for Busch to win his inaugural race with Richard Childress Racing and the inaugural race of the 2023 season.\n```"}

White finished with a career-high 22 points in USC's win. (Photo by Jaden Dhaliwal)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nFebruary 04, 2023 at 11:20 pm PST\n\nOn a night where USC\u2019s star veteran guards, fifth year Drew Peterson and senior Boogie Ellis, went a combined 8-for-28 from the field, the Trojans needed someone to step up against the Washington Huskies. In this case, both freshman guard Tre White and sophomore guard Kobe Johnson were able to get the job done, leading the Trojans to a 80-74 win.\n\nJohnson played a complete game, recording a career-high 21 points while adding five assists and four steals. Head coach Andy Enfield gave Johnson high praise after his performance, particularly since he was playing on a hurt ankle.\n\n\u201cKobe Johnson played one of the best games I\u2019ve ever seen a Trojan play,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe looks like a darn all-league player. He played like that the entire game tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans were up by six points with 30 seconds left in the game when Johnson stole the ball from graduate guard Jamal Bey and drew a foul. USC was already in the double bonus, which put Johnson at the free throw line, where he knocked down both of his opportunities to seal the win for the Trojans.\n\nJohnson has averaged over two steals a game this season, which is second in the Pac-12. He credits his success in that facet of his game to his preparation.\n\n\u201cI study the leading scorer and I want to be put on him, I want to lock them down, I want to take them out of the game,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI watched a lot of film to learn what moves [senior forward Keion Brooks Jr.] does, what he likes, what his go-tos are. I just study.\u201d\n\nEven though Johnson scored 21 points, it was White who led the team with a career-high 22 points. USC\u2019s offense was stagnant for much of the first half, leading to a 22-20 deficit with 5:45 left before halftime. That\u2019s when White turned on the jets.\n\nThe Trojans went on a 11-0 scoring run that lasted more than four minutes, with White scoring nine of those points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always just trying to be in the right place at the right time, just playing hard off my teammates,\u201d White said. \u201cUsually I feel like whenever I\u2019m playing hard, doing the little things, the ball is going to find me at the right times.\u201d\n\nEven though Peterson and Ellis had poor shooting nights, they were able to create shooting opportunities for their teammates at pivotal points of the game. The two guards assisted on all but one of the baskets during the 11-0 run. Ellis finished with five assists, and Peterson finished with eight.\n\nThe Trojans needed a big offensive night to counteract their defense giving up 74 points, the most USC has allowed during a Pac-12 win this season. Part of the defensive struggles for the Trojans came from guarding junior center Braxton Meah. Meah was only the third-leading scorer for the Huskies tonight, but he was their most efficient force, scoring 11 points in only 19 minutes of play.\n\nDuring the early parts of the game, Meah was dominant in the pick and roll, scoring five of the first seven Husky points. Luckily for the Trojans, he ran into foul trouble and was pulled from the game with 9:24 left in the first half after his third personal foul. Meah did not return in the first half for the Huskies, but he came back in the second half and fouled out with 8:07 left in the game.\n\nEnfield said it was not their plan to get Meah into foul trouble but credits his offense for doing so.\n\n\u201cWe were aggressive the entire game and put pressure on the defense,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t say it was intentional. He\u2019s a very good defender at the rim \u2014 he\u2019s seven feet tall. So it\u2019s not necessarily that we just want to leave our feet and challenge him and try to draw fouls. We just want to make the smart basketball play.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans were without both sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters and redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan due to injury. Morgan has been in the starting lineup for every game this season, forcing Enfield to change the starting lineup for the first time since USC\u2019s game against Wisconsin Nov. 25. Freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu got the start in place of Morgan, recording 10 minutes and six points.\n\nWith an important road trip coming up, Enfield hopes Dixon-Waters and Morgan return soon.\n\n\u201cI think if we had to play a game tomorrow, neither one of them would play tomorrow,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping by Thursday and Saturday next week, at least one of them will be available.\u201d\n\nThat road trip will take the Trojans up north, playing Oregon Feb. 9 and Oregon State Feb. 11.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/02/03/sissoko-littleton-both-score-over-20-as-usc-womens-basketball-rolls-past-arizona-state/", "response": "```\nFacing off against an Arizona State team that has yet to win a conference game this season due to its offensive woes, the USC women\u2019s basketball team did what it does best: shut down its opponent for 40 minutes. For the 12th time this season, the Trojans held their opponent to under 50 points, cruising to a 64-49 victory over the Sun Devils on Friday night at Galen Center.\n\nFrom the very early stages of the game, USC\u2019s size on the defensive side of the basketball was often too much for Arizona State to handle. Players trying to make plays down low were swarmed by sophomore forward Rayah Marshall and graduate forward Kadi Sissoko in the post, leading to miss after miss. Sissoko and Marshall both had their timing down on defense in the post, combining to record 5 of the team\u2019s 6 blocked shots.\n\n\u201cWe know we have the ability to put good ball pressure on and good rim protection,\u201d said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb after the game. \u201cKadi is a very difficult defensive matchup for people, and [junior guard Treasure] Hunt is so important to them, so we did some good things there and forced them into some tough shots.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Devils did not have much luck shooting the ball from distance either, shooting 32% from the field in the game, including 3-for-12 from beyond the arc. The Trojans\u2019 best defense came early in the game, but the results dissipated somewhat as the contest wore on. While Arizona State shot a dismal 26% from the floor in the first quarter, the Sun Devils improved steadily from there, shooting 6-for-14 in the fourth.\n\n\u201cWe have a really good defense, but today we really didn\u2019t show up with our energy,\u201d Sissoko said. \u201cWe got away with it because we\u2019re good enough. Against other teams, no disrespect to Arizona State, it\u2019s gonna be harder for us if we keep playing this way.\u201d\n\nOffensively, Sissoko led USC in the first 20 minutes, scoring 13 of the Trojans\u2019 27 first-half points. On a night where many of USC\u2019s players struggled to find their jump shot in the early going, Sissoko served as its slump-buster. She hit shots from all over the floor, including a huge 3-pointer in the waning seconds of the first quarter, as the shot clock was expiring. With the game tied at the time, that shot ensured that her team exited the frame with the lead.\n\nWhen the first half was over, Sissoko was 6-for-12 from the field, while her teammates were a combined 5-for-17. She finished as the game\u2019s leading scorer with 23 points. 8 more points from Sissoko in the third quarter and more offensive struggles from the Sun Devils helped the Trojans go on a 14-2 run out of the halftime break, ballooning their lead from 5 to 17.\n\nHowever, as the game seemed to be getting out of reach, Sissoko and Marshall got a breather in the final two minutes of the third. During that span, Arizona State ripped off 9 straight points in 1:47 by relentlessly attacking the rim for driving layups. With momentum seeming to slip away from USC, graduate guard Destiny Littleton swiped it right back. She hit a 3-pointer from way beyond the arc as time expired in the third, bringing the Trojan lead back to double digits.\n\nLittleton would use that massive shot as momentum for the remainder of the game, draining two more triples in the fourth quarter to keep her team comfortably ahead. She finished with 21 points on 5-for-9 shooting, with 10 of those points coming in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cObviously that was a big one for me, I hadn\u2019t hit one all game,\u201d Littleton said about her buzzer beater. \u201cIt gave us the momentum to go into the fourth quarter, because we needed to pick it up and get the team back together. The shot kind of gave us momentum and gave me the confidence going into the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nWhile Marshall struggled mightily shooting the ball \u2014 scoring 9 points and shooting 4-for-12 \u2014 she did not let her scoring troubles affect the rest of her game. Marshall nearly doubled her average output of 11 rebounds per game, snagging a career-high 21, including 6 offensive boards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown to just expect that of her, to rim protect, block shots and get rebounds,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cShe gets a lot of out of area rebounds, and it\u2019s a weapon for us. We build that into our defense ... She does a good job of that whether or not the shots are falling.\u201d\n\n3 of those offensive boards came on a single possession with three minutes to go, ultimately earning her a trip to the free throw line after she was finally fouled.\n\nMoving forward, USC will look to clean up its turnovers; the Trojans gave away the basketball 15 times in the game, compared to just 10 by the Sun Devils. The win improves USC to 17-5 on the season and 7-4 in Pac-12 play. The Trojans are now 11-1 at Galen Center, and they will look to improve that mark further when they host the Arizona Wildcats on Sunday at noon.\n```"}

Senior Miles Mogush, the Special Events Chair of SCBlack Flea Market majoring in business administration, said this event is very important for \u201cgiving us this opportunity to network while we\u2019re on USC campus [and] to meet each other.\u201d\n\nThe event, which took place from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. at Founders Park, featured live entertainment and over 18 Black-owned businesses selling food, fashion products, art, cosmetic services and more.\n\nKyra Horton is a junior majoring in political science and a vendor at the event. As a spoken word poet, she sold her book of poetry, \u201cCries of A Butterfly,\u201d which became one of the most popular products in today\u2019s flea market.\n\n\u201cI want to share my art. I want to have something that people can connect to or something that I\u2019m proud of to put out into the world,\u201d Horton said.\n\nKai Cayetano, a senior majoring in narrative studies who visited the event said, \u201cI think it helps a lot of students get their business up there or have their business get around.\u201d\n\nThis year, USC\u2019s theme for Black History Month is \u201cReclamation through Resistance, Rebirth through Reconciliation.\u201d People at the flea market shared their thoughts about how the theme is presented through this event.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s highlighting Black businesses and keeping Black dollars within the Black communities, and bringing other money into the Black communities,\u201d Horton said.\n\nSenior Wynton Jones majoring in theatre sold upcycled clothes and accessories at the event. They said that they wanted to bring fashionable products with affordable prices to this event because of rising costs in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201c[There is] such an inflation of price, you have to pay so much just to give you stuff,\u201d Jones said.\n\nBlack families will suffer the worst effects of rising inflation due to disparities between Black and white households in income, wealth, financial savings and home ownership, according to a study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in 2022.\n\nMakayla Howard, a senior majoring in fine arts selling her abstract art printmakings said that the wealth gap makes this event important.\n\n\u201cBlack people are empowered to sell their work and to create businesses,\u201d Howard said.\n\nA student majoring in human biology, Maleah Allen, bought a handmade bracelet in the flea market.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to bring empowerment because people really don\u2019t appreciate the things we do very well,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThe SCBlack Flea Market is one of the first events held at USC to celebrate Black History Month.

(Google)\n\nBy Marco Ramirez, Matthew Dutrisac, Siara Carpenter, and Nicholas Dinh\nFebruary 03, 2023 at 3:13 pm PST\n\nOn January 17, the Los Angeles City Council passed a motion 12-1 to appeal the South LA Planning Commission\u2019s decision to deny a permit for the construction of a new hotel. Since the passing, many local residents are left concerned as to how the possible new project will affect their lives. Many community members argue that the land should remain public. They say this lot can be used to build affordable housing. Additionally, there has been no initiative from the city to provide jobs for local community members through this project.\n\nThe lot used to be a cherished community library; however, in 2010 the library closed, leaving the lot empty for 13 years. In 2019, the City Council took action, entering into a controversial agreement with a developer to build a Marriott hotel on the site. This would cause even more traffic and pollution in a predominantly Black and brown area, which has led many people to call out Marriott for gentrifying the area.\n\nMembers of United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement, or UNIDAD, have outwardly rejected the \u201cHotel Project,\u201d as their mission is \u201cto reverse these harms by promoting healthy and equitable neighborhoods through planning and land use that is rooted in community.\u201d UNIDAD wrote in their January 2023 letter to the L.A. City Council that the hotel would take up space in the community that could otherwise be used as affordable housing. In the letter they state, \u201cDespite repeated promises from the City that the land would be used for affordable housing and other community serving purposes, the City abruptly reversed course with no explanation in 2019 when it selected the current developer, Henry Fan of Bethune Hotel Ventures, LLC (\u201dthe Developer\u201d), to build the Hotel Project.\u201d\n\nMaria Pati\u00f1o Gutierrez, Director of Policy and Research Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, stated in conjunction with UNIDAD that, \u201cThe main issue that we have is the use of public land. A hotel being built on public land when we\u2019re in a housing crisis ... There\u2019s a preschool directly next door to the proposed hotel ... It literally shares a fence. They always make us have to choose [between jobs or housing]. We don\u2019t think it should be that way. However, there is no clear indication about the process for a local like if there will be local hiring.\u201d\n\nGutierrez said that the use of public land to build hotels in order to help non-Angelenos during the 2028 Summer Olympics, which is being held at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum, ignores the long term impacts on displacement in the community. There are also concerns about the nature of the site as the Los Angeles Sanitation Department published that the lot was a former gas station before it was redeveloped into the Bethune Library. The Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) is to conduct a Phase II ESA to determine if contamination is present. Future redevelopment use would have been affordable housing with retail and commercial use. While this is no longer being used for affordable housing, Gutierrez fears the contamination will create extra pollution in the community. \u201dThe developer said, \u2018Oh, we just have to take out a certain layer of dirt,\u2019\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\nAmongst all of these concerns, Katie McKeon, staff attorney for Public Counsel, said that the biggest issue is the city\u2019s handling of this proposed project. \u201cI think the biggest concern is that this city is choosing to sell it to a private developer who will be operating a hotel that caters to tourists and not to local residents,\u201d McKeon said. \u201cWe have a massive housing crisis in our city right now, and we need to use all of the available tools that we have in order to make a dent in that housing crisis. Publicly owned land that the city controls and can get affordable housing development built on quickly is really, really important to making a dent in that housing crisis.\u201d\n\nThe council took a final vote today near 11:30 a.m. in a city council meeting inside the John Ferraro Council Chamber. After moving the topic to a special vote and a series of public hearings with numerous stakeholders and community members about the impact the hotel will have within the eighth district, the council voted 10 to 1 to approve the development of a Marriott Hotel on Vermont Avenue.\n\nThe majority of speakers spoke in favor of the construction of the hotel. They expressed the economic benefits that surrounding small businesses will receive as a result of the foot traffic that Marriott estimates the hotel will bring. One native from the area commented during the public hearings that the hotel is a step into the right direction of improvement and that several jobs will be created as a result, a benefit especially for younger generations. Although the debate about the intentions of the developers have been questioned, speakers stressed that these developers are \u201cnot outsiders\u201d and they have been role models for the community \u2014 actively teaching business classes and donating computers to schools.\n\nThe hotel is set to dedicate the first two floors to communal usage with 7,000 square feet of recreational space open to the public, according to information from the Council meeting. A few of the remaining speakers however, disagreed and argued that affordable housing should be prioritized in South L.A., rejecting the notion of a construction for primarily commercial purposes. Despite the possibility for jobs, opposing speakers rebutted that the near minimum wage salary would not be enough to sustain a proper living for those workers and their families residing nearby.\n\nNow that the development has been approved, the Marriott will be located right next to USC at 3685 Vermont Ave. The size of the hotel will cover 34,000 square feet and stand seven stories tall.\n```"}

Ullman is now the Senior Vice President of Production and Talent Development at Fox Sports, who will broadcast the race on Sunday. Between Ullman\u2019s travels from L.A. to Glendale, Arizona, for Super Bowl LVII, Ullman shared his journey of success at USC and what happens behind the scenes of the iconic Clash race.\n\nThis is NASCAR\u2019s second year to host the sprint in the historic venue, but the site came about on a whim in 2022. \u201cThere is an executive at NASCAR, Ben Kennedy, who was looking for cool and unique places to do races.\u201d Ullman said. \u201cHe was in Los Angeles for some meetings and he was driving down the freeway and saw it, and just had this amazing idea that came to mind.\u201d\n\nNASCAR fans could have some reluctance validating the race, coming in at one-fourth of a mile; this track is by the smallest of the season. However, NASCAR will be in Daytona in two weeks, where the track is two and a half miles, clearly giving a bit more distance for the drivers, \u201cIt\u2019s [Coliseum track] very unorthodox, and credit to NASCAR for wanting to try it,\u201d Ullman said.\n\nThe Fox Sports exec values the sprint more because it is half a mile from his alma mater. \u201cIt\u2019s a blending of all new worlds, right? NASCAR [and] the Coliseum where I grew up going to football games, so it was great, and I think they really leaned on me and that relationship that I have,\u201d Ullman stated.\n\nAlthough NASCAR will host another race in Southern California at the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana this season, Fox Sports and NASCAR found it imperative the upcoming sprint at the Coliseum embody the atmosphere and culture of L.A. \u201cRob Lowe is the Grand Marshal [of the race]. I mean, getting a Hollywood star like Rob Lowe to come to the L.A. Coliseum is a lot easier than saying \u2018you gotta go a lot of miles east to Fontana,\u2019\u201d Ullman explained. \u201cThis year we have Wiz Khalifa and Cypress Hill performing \u2014 it\u2019s L.A. There\u2019s a huge difference between being in southern California versus being in Downtown Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nUllman expressed his passion and pride for being a Trojan. He carries the distinction as a badge of honor, making it known from whence he came. He envisioned being in the sports industry but was never quite sure where he might land. \u201cI saw an element. My desire to be honest with you was to be a broadcaster and you know, to be a play-by-play announcer,\u201d Ullman said. \u201cSo, I am not that far off from what I envisioned.\u201d\n\nUSC has a star-studded list of alumni who never hesitate to come to the place where their journey began. Ullman is amidst a full circle moment. \u201cIt is wonderful, bizarre and very cool at the same time. My worlds have collided. The fact that this is a big part of my job being here and putting this on is pretty awesome,\u201d Ullman said.\n\nResilience is a universal trait understood by the USC community. For Ullman, that has never faded. \u201cI\u2019m of the belief that if you really want to work in sports, and it is competitive and there\u2019s lots of people who want to do it, if that is what you really want, then I believe you can make a living in this industry,\u201d Ullman said.\n\nCollege days swiftly pass, and it is imperative that every moment is cherished and every opportunity seized. Especially when attending a school in a major urban city such as L.A. and utilizing the tools given by such an established university, it is truly ideal for many with boundless possibilities, according to Ullman. \u201cI would say that, honestly, there\u2019s more opportunity now than there was when I was in their shoes, digital opportunities didn\u2019t exist right?\u201d Ullman said. \u201cEvery team, every league, every sports network has digital reporters and digital hosts \u2014 there are social media jobs, podcasting ... none of those existed [before now].\u201d\n\nIn Ullman\u2019s eyes, nothing in this industry is linear, including each journey. You may see one ending for yourself right now, but in 10 years, you could land a position that is a perfect fit \u2014 and the opposite end of the spectrum from your original aspirations. \u201cIt is not a straight line, there are zigs and there are zags but you figure it out,\u201d Ullman said.\n```"}

Purdue defeated Penn State 80-60. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)\n\nBy Michael Fiumefreddo\nFebruary 03, 2023 at 12:55 pm PST\n\n\u201cTourney Talk\u201d is a column by Michael Fiumefreddo about the men\u2019s basketball NCAA Tournament. March Madness is almost here. In what\u2019s been a wild season, it seems even harder to determine the favorites to win the unpredictable bracket. However, past years and tournaments show an easy way to narrow down the field; we have to travel back in time to Week 6 in order to do so. The March Madness tournament champion was ranked in the top 12 of the Week 6 AP rankings for the past 18 tournaments. In fact, if Syracuse\u2019s Cinderella run in 2003 hadn\u2019t happened, this trend goes back to 1987, so yeah, odds are it happens again. Let\u2019s narrow down the search for the new champion using these rankings and rerank them based on their chances of winning it all.\n\nGroup 1: The Longshots\n12. Arkansas, 11. UConn, 10. Duke\nArkansas and UConn combined for just one loss at the time of these rankings, but both of them have now lost six of their last ten games. They\u2019re struggling in conference play, and if this continues into their respective conference tournaments, they could miss out on the big dance altogether. It\u2019s strange to consider Duke a \u2018longshot\u2019 at the title. But, the post-Coach K Blue Devils are no longer ranked and are trending towards the middle of the ACC. The next two weeks are make or break, welcoming rival North Carolina into Cameron Indoor tomorrow, a trip down to No. 23 Miami on Monday and then No. 6 Virginia next weekend. An impressive showing in those games could propel Duke back into the title contention conversation. With some losses, however, they might suffer the same fate as Arkansas and UConn.\n\nGroup 2: The Big 12 (+2)\n9. Baylor, 8. Texas, 7. Arizona, 6. Kansas, 5. Virginia\nThe Big 12 is a juggernaut this season. The most recent Top 25 featured six teams from the conference. Baylor, Texas and Kansas all suffered the same fate \u2014 a loss to a surging Kansas State \u2014 following the release of these rankings. All three of them had or will have their shot at redemption against the Wildcats in the coming weeks. Kansas was the first to take down their cross-state rival, doing so in convincing fashion. However, the reigning champion Jayhawks did go on a three-game losing streak to ranked Big 12 teams, and there will be five more of those games to find out if Kansas is legit. But, sticking with the theme of history, there has not been a repeat champion since 1973. Outside of the Big 12, Arizona is scoring a whopping 83 points per game, and it is one of two teams in this top 12 ranked in the top 25 nationally in points per game and point differential. The Wildcats\u2019 91-76 win over Oregon Thursday night further validates their claim as one of the best scoring teams in the nation. Then there\u2019s Virginia. The Cavaliers are quietly climbing their way back into the conversation, though, winning nine of their last 10. However, they lead this group for two separate reasons: their top three scorers are all seniors, and they shoot an astounding 38% on threes. Not that the Cavs are Cinderellas, but Cinderella teams that are senior-led and can shoot the three tend to heat up in March. The only difference is that Virginia will be in the hunt for a No. 1 seed.\n\nGroup 3: The favorites\n4. Tennessee, 3. Alabama, 2. Houston, 1. Purdue\nAnalytics lovers might choose the other three teams over the Boilermakers. Houston, Tennessee and Alabama rank higher than Purdue in BPI, a metric used to calculate team success and performance. It\u2019s often regarded as the best way of determining who the best teams are. No. 1 Purdue ranks fifth. Houston, the only mid-major team of the 12, looked like the top team at one point this year, but the Cougars\u2019 cakewalk AAC schedule is a point of concern for a deep run in March. The Cougars went 2-1 against Power 5 teams, and 1-1 against ranked teams. Unfortunately, Houston won\u2019t have a shot at another powerhouse until the Big Dance. The third Saturday in October game between Tennessee and Alabama football felt like a play-in game for the College Football Playoff. The third Wednesday in February game between the Volunteers and Bama basketball will likely determine a No. 1 seed in March Madness. Both teams went through ups and downs this week but in opposite fashion. Oklahoma upset the Tide, but Alabama recovered with a convincing win against Vanderbilt. Tennessee convincingly took down Texas, only to score 8 points in the final nine minutes of a loss to Florida. It\u2019s hard to separate these teams right now, so the February 15 matchup will provide some outlook on where these teams stand. But Purdue was the top team in Week 6, and it is now the unanimous top team in Week 14. Minus a miracle upset to Rutgers, the Boilermakers are undefeated and have won 15 of their 22 games by double digits. Also, having the likely Wooden Award winner in Zach Edey doesn\u2019t hurt their case as the top team.\n\nTourney Talk runs every Friday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)\n\nBy Kamyar Moradi February 03, 2023 at 12:52 pm PST\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d is a satirical sports column by Kamyar Moradi depicting everything and everyone who should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nDear NBA officials,\n\nAs the great philosopher Stephen A. Smith once said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amok and flat out deceived!\u201d\n\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t aware, the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics played last Friday. It was a prime time game on ABC with Mike Breen, Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson on the call. The Lakers have been fighting for their playoff lives, and the Boston Celtics are first place in their conference, so you already know that this game meant everything.\n\nThis was going to be a turning point in the season for my Lakers, but, much more importantly, it was going to be a turning point for my lord and savior LeBron James. And like an episode of The White Lotus, this game was everything that I imagined; the drama was intoxicating.\n\nEverything was shaping up to be one of those King James virtuosos, when he once again proves that the laws of Father Time have no bearing on him whatsoever. The icing on top of this metaphorically delicious, goat-flavored cake was that in the waning seconds of the game, Patrick Beverely aged backwards like Benjamin Button. He couldn\u2019t have jumped that high even if a trampoline was involved.\n\nSo, the Celtics letting a 6-foot, 34-year-old guard have a putback dunk to go up two with 19 seconds left in the game is one of the most shameful things I\u2019ve witnessed in basketball history. Personally, if I was Adam Silver, the Celtics would go straight to the G-League after such a horrendous error.\n\nSoon after, with the game tied up again, the Lakers had one final play drawn up to send every loud-mouthed Harvard-Yard-parking Bostonian fan home with a steaming hot loss fresh out of the oven. Then, I was watching poetry in motion.\n\nThe last time I saw LeBron James catch the ball at the top of the key with a defender that over-pursued, pivot off his right foot, and drove left, he made a buzzer-beater layup that gave the Miami Heat a 1-0 series advantage over Paul George\u2019s Indiana Pacers back in 2013. My mind was racing. My heart was pounding. Everything was going to be perfect, until disaster struck.\n\nI saw the most blatant slap I have ever seen in my life, as the ball failed to reach above the rim and fell into the arms of Jayson Tatum. This slap was so flagrant, you\u2019d think Will Smith had just signed a 10-day contract with the Celtics.\n\nFrom the time that LeBron spent weeping on the court to the end of overtime, I went through each of the five stages of grief. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 officials have missed calls in the past, whether we\u2019re talking about the NBA or any other professional sports league. But to swallow your whistle in that moment is beyond asinine.\n\nPlayers get fined at such a high rate; they can clap their hands together out of frustration, and the technicals start firing off like it\u2019s the Fourth of July. I am so sick and tired of officials not being held accountable for their blown calls and pretending like everything in their world is hunky-dory.\n\nIt\u2019s like how teachers can lose your work or forget to teach an entire lesson just to test you on it later, but none of the onus falls on them, while only hurting their students. This is a one-way street of actions and consequences that places a disproportionate amount of responsibility on the athletes.\n\nSo, the next time there\u2019s another slap heard round the world, and the officials are nowhere to be found, you better believe there is going to be money coming out of their pockets. Officials better start checking their mail for fines and even suspensions handed down from the league office.\n\nNow, despite the blown call and the Lakers\u2019 overall incompetence in games decided by five points or less, that still wasn\u2019t the worst part of all this. If I see one more Last Two Minute Report listing all the ways that the officiating crew cost the Lakers another game, I\u2019m going to boycott all of basketball.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s version of holding themselves accountable is putting out a press release after the game is over, depicting every foul that was incorrectly called or not called in the final two minutes. These players pour their heart and soul onto the court, preparing every waking second they have available to them with the sole intention of winning basketball games.\n\nFor the NBA to have the gall to metaphorically blowtorch all the hardwork and dedication of these players is nothing short of disgraceful. Get it together officials, I\u2019ve had it with all of you. Respectfully, you should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n\n\u201cKamyar is Sick of This Stuff\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

After the tournament, head coach J.T. Higgins explained that the biggest challenges the team faced were their own mental games and the windy weather conditions.\n\n\u201cWe were playing really good golf coming into the tournament, and then once the wind started blowing and the temperature dropped, it got to us a little bit,\u201d Higgins said.\n\nAfter day one of the three-day tournament, USC was sitting in last place after the team score was 12 over par. Meanwhile, No. 20 Texas started off strong, ending the first day at 18 under par.\n\nThe second day concluded with the Trojans still in 12th place, finishing 22 over par to make them 34 over par after 36 holes. Graduate Jack Boulger had a strong finish to the second day with a 74. He was USC\u2019s lowest scorer after two days after a 75 in the first round.\n\nThe third and final day of the tournament was a day of great improvement for the Trojans. USC finished the final day at 1 over par, which was the second-best team score of the entire day.\n\n\u201cThey got in their own heads and really started to doubt themselves, and they didn\u2019t trust their swings and their games,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cBut I think they did a really good job bouncing back on the final day.\u201d\n\nThe progress made in the third round allowed USC to move up two spots on the leaderboard to 10th place, shooting 300-310-289 in total. Texas ended up winning the tournament at 14 under par (270-290-290).\n\nHiggins acknowledged that a great moment from the final day was freshman Mahanth Chirravuri shooting a 69 to end with the best total score for USC at 5 over par.\n\n\u201cThey played with a lot of pride and a lot of heart, and we\u2019re gonna have to play that way all the time if we want to be successful,\u201d Higgins said, adding that Trojans\u2019 best golf is still ahead of them.\n\nDuring their fall season, USC competed in five tournaments, with their best finish being 2nd place and their best team score being 277.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just show up to tournaments and think that we\u2019re gonna turn it on,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cWe have to do a better job with preparation. We have to be tougher mentally, and we have to play with a lot more urgency and pride to reach our goals which are to make it to regionals and compete for the Pac-12 Championship.\u201d\n\nUSC is off to Lihue, Hawaii to compete in the John A.

(Photo by Hyunwoo Daniel Park)\n\nBy Will Camardella February 03, 2023 at 9:26 am PST\n\nEarly in the night, it looked as if Washington State was going to shock USC once again. The Trojans were down 13 points halfway into the first period, they had just lost redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan to injury, and the Cougars\u2019 big man was well on his way to a career scoring night. Despite all these obstacles, USC rallied together as a team and avenged their New Year\u2019s Day loss in Pullman, taking down Washington State at home 80-70 on Thursday night.\n\nThe Cougars entered the game shorthanded, missing five players due to illness, but sophomore forward Mouhamed Gueye wasted no time making his presence felt. In the game\u2019s first seven minutes, Gueye made his first six shots from the floor and scored the first 11 points for WSU. Midway through the first half, he was outscoring the Trojans himself, 16-13. He finished the game with a career-high 31 points and shot 14-for-21 from the floor.\n\nGueye\u2019s dominance in the low post became even more of a concern once Morgan injured his right ankle on a hard fall to the Galen Center floor five minutes into the game. Morgan had been averaging over 24 minutes a game for USC, and head coach Andy Enfield would have to replace those minutes by committee to try and solidify the paint. Sophomore Harrison Hornery and freshmen Kijani Wright and Iaroslav Niagu all got minutes at forward after Morgan\u2019s departure, but the majority of the available minutes went to freshman Vince Iwuchukwu.\n\nIwuchukwu, playing just his sixth collegiate game since suffering cardiac arrest in training camp in July, gave the Trojans a career-high 23 minutes in the frontcourt. He contributed five points in the winning effort, but his biggest contribution was on the defensive side. With USC leading by three points with under two minutes remaining, Iwuchukwu sent back a shot in the low post from junior guard Justin Powell and, after a WSU offensive rebound, ventured all the way out to the 3-point line to reject a triple from junior guard TJ Bamba as the shot clock expired. Those were two of the four blocks Iwuchukwu recorded in the game, another career best.\n\n\u201cVince was terrific, he played very hard,\u201d Enfield said after the game. \u201cHe\u2019s starting to get a good rhythm. It\u2019s so hard for him when you go through what he did. When you don\u2019t play, forget about the medical issue, I\u2019m talking about not playing, we threw him into Pac-12 play in the middle of the season, and it takes a little bit to adjust. I thought he was great defensively.\u201d\n\nOffensively, the Trojans were once again led by both fifth-year guard Drew Peterson and senior guard Boogie Ellis. Peterson was USC\u2019s best source of offense in the first half, getting the Trojans out of an early 5-for-14 shooting slump with his mid-range jump shot. Peterson shot 6-for-9 in the first half and helped USC rip off a 20-4 run after falling behind by 13 points to storm ahead. Peterson did not score quite as often after halftime, but he made one of the biggest shots of the game with an isolation corner three to put the Trojans up by six with 52 seconds remaining. Peterson finished his night with 20 points, shooting 8-for-13.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit messy for 25 seconds,\u201d Peterson joked about his late three. \u201cGive Gueye credit, he was playing some good defense in the second half.... I noticed he was giving me some space, so I kept trying to drive on him. After two attempts of trying to drive him, I just kind of took advantage of a little bit of space, stepped back, and thankfully got the shot to fall down.\n\nWhile Ellis got off to a much slower start than Peterson did, missing his first four shots from the field and finishing 2-for-8 in the first half, his confidence never faltered. Instead, he was willing to shoot from well beyond the 3-point arc, and the shots were falling. Five 3-point makes boosted Ellis to a 23-point effort to lead USC; he has averaged 24 points in his last three games.\n\n\u201cI actually watched this video, it was Gilbert Arenas,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cHe said that if you start the game 0-for-5, and in the second half you go 5-for-5, it\u2019s still a great game. If you start the first half 5-for-5 and you finish 0-for-5, it\u2019s still a great game. At the end of the day, I\u2019m always in the gym and I\u2019m working on my game, so I have extreme confidence even when I\u2019m missing shots. I feel like the younger me would check out of the game if I\u2019m not making shots, but I\u2019m believing in myself and trusting my work.\u201d\n\nAs the Trojans\u2019 starting point guard, Ellis was also instrumental in helping the Trojans protect the basketball. USC only turned the ball over seven times in the game, the second fewest in a game this season.\n\nFinally, the Trojans were able to get to the line at a much higher rate than their opponents, especially in the second half. The Cougars found themselves in foul trouble, and USC was in the double-bonus before the 10-minute mark of the second half. The Trojans shot 22 of their 24 free throws in the second half \u2014 making 17 \u2014 compared to 13 total attempts and eight makes by Washington State. USC\u2019s ability to consistently find points at the charity stripe down the stretch was a crucial factor in keeping the Cougars at bay.\n\nThe win improves the Trojans to 16-6 on the season, and 8-3 in the Pac-12. USC has now won five of its last six games and 11 in a row at Galen Center. The team will wrap up a three-game homestand on Saturday night against the Washington Huskies at 6:30 p.m.\n```"}

Failure to meet these new requirements results in accounts being blocked, ultimately preventing users from sharing passwords as well as losing access to their accounts.\n\nAs the most popular and longest-standing streaming service that originally prided itself on its password-sharing abilities, USC students shared their thoughts on this new strategy.\n\nVictor Aboumrad, a senior majoring in geodesign, says the changes will affect students who share accounts with their family but don\u2019t live in the same location.\n\nVictor Aboumrad: I know that they\u2019re going to do it location-based, and I do not live in the same city or even country as my parents, so that really kind of splits our household in terms of how the location service is being kind of biased because we\u2019re still one household even though we don\u2019t live in the same place. However, I do understand that it\u2019s a business and they do, they got to do what they got to do, but it might lead me away from the service, definitely.\n\nAboumrad is considering other streaming services for better watch options.\n\nVictor Aboumrad: I think I\u2019ll definitely explore some other options. I think my my taste for for watching content has changed in the last couple of years, and I feel like Netflix isn\u2019t providing the kind of content I want and for the price, I could probably go to other services.\n\nEntertainment and technology attorney Jonathan Handel offered his input on the economic standpoint of Netflix password sharing.\n\nJonathan Handel: What Netflix is hoping is that by cutting down on password sharing, but offering a sort of page sharing alternative, that they\u2019ll increase their profits ... The share prices for Netflix and other entertainment companies have dropped dramatically, and there\u2019s an awful lot of concern among companies as to how they can make money off- how streaming itself can make money.

(Photo courtesy of Sam Cunningham)\n\nBy Paige Shea and Jack Waterman\nFebruary 02, 2023 at 9:32 pm PST\n\nEven in the early 1970s, many college football teams were still segregated, including the powerhouse Alabama Crimson Tide. However, this took a turn when the USC Trojans \u2013 with fullback Sam Cunningham \u2013 played the Crimson Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham on September 12, 1970. For many, the game was a crucial turning point that led to desegregation in college football in the South.\n\nFor that legendary game, the Trojans brought a fully integrated roster to Alabama with an all-Black backfield, including quarterback Jimmy Jones, tailback Clarence Davis, and Sam Cunningham. Cunningham \u2013 nicknamed \u201cBam\u201d for his strong running and playing style \u2013 became the unexpected star player of the game, with 135 rushing yards and two touchdowns that resulted in the Trojan\u2019s 42-21 victory over Alabama. It was Cunningham\u2019s first game for the Trojans, and was certainly a memorable one.\n\nOver the years, the game became the subject of legend and hyperbole. A common narrative recounts Alabama\u2019s head coach at the time \u2013 the prolific Bear Bryant \u2013 bringing Cunningham into the Crimson Tide\u2019s locker room and saying to his team: \u201cThis is what a football player looks like.\u201d Many also claim that the game singlehandedly convinced Bryant to recruit Black players, but Alabama had already recruited Wilbur Jackson, a Black running back, at the time of the game. However, as a freshman, Jackson was not allowed to play, and instead watched the game from the stands.\n\nDespite this, it is still undoubtedly true that the game brought about change in southern football integration. Rob Parker, sports anchor for 7 Action News and former member of ESPN\u2019s First Take program, recalled the impact that the game - and Cunningham - had on college football.\n\nRob Parker: It was huge. I mean, it did change college football. USC had an all black backfield and Cunningham was able to excel. And it was one of those moments where I think, you know, the South Alabama, Bear Bryant, they couldn\u2019t deny it anymore. And if they really wanted to compete and win big, they realized that they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it until they integrated. So I think it changed a lot in sports. It was a big moment.\n\nBy 1971, just one year after the Trojans defeated the Crimson Tide in Birmingham, southern college football powerhouses Alabama, Georgia, LSU and Mississippi had Black football players on their team for the first time, and by 1977, Alabama had 17 Black football players on scholarship for the Crimson Tide. It is for this reason that the fabled 1970 USC and Alabama game, for many, draws a before and after line in terms of segregated college football teams in the south.\n```"}

Ron DeSantis announced an initiative that would prohibit programs from teaching diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and critical race theory (CRT) at state colleges and universities on Tuesday. In his attempt at \u201chigher education reform,\u201d DeSantis said in a news conference that DEI and CRT programs would get \u201cno funding\u201d and \u201cwill wither on the vine.\u201d\n\nReacting to the news, USC students worried about the lasting repercussions legislation like this will have on students from the minority communities. \u201cAs a minority myself, I know I wouldn\u2019t feel safe or comfortable in a state if that were to happen to me,\u201d said Halla Ibrahim, a sophomore majoring in biological science.\n\nDeSantis is not alone in his push to restrict the teachings of DEI and CRT. At least 44 states \u201chave introduced bills or taken other steps that would restrict teaching critical race theory or limit how teachers can discuss racism and sexism\u201d since January 2021, according to an Education Week analysis. Eighteen states have enacted these bans and restrictions.\n\nTennessee, one of those states, passed its Prohibited Concepts In Instruction law in May 2021. \u201cThe Tennessee law does indeed have a big impact on how I can plan to teach with honesty and integrity,\u201d said Memphis, Tennessee history teacher Mary McIntosh to Time Magazine. \u201cI think it kind of goes against everything the U.S. is built upon, because the U.S. is basically made up of a bunch of people from all over the world. It\u2019s a melting pot,\u201d said Kelly Ash, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering.\n\nRed states are making a trend of banning topics conservatives don\u2019t like, Ash said. To her, this feels restrictive.\n\nDeSantis\u2019s plans came after he recently blocked the College Board\u2019s new Advanced Placement course, African American Studies. He claimed the curriculum violated Florida\u2019s Parental Rights in Education Act, referred to by critics as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely neglecting to think about racism in the present day, because that would require you to look at issues like Black Lives Matter, reparations, intersectionality and intersectional oppressions ... I think ignoring the present-day scholars who think about race and racism treats racism as if it no longer exists,\u201d said Suneal Kolluri, a UC Riverside urban education policy professor.\n\nThe College Board came under fire for removing many Black scholars related to CRT, queer studies and Black feminism in their revision of the curriculum. \u201cIt\u2019s really troubling to me that they decided to remove those topics. And the College Board is claiming that, you know, they didn\u2019t do it for political reasons,\u201d Kolluri said. \u201cThey did it because they were just revising the curriculum anyway. But it is fishy that they took out the precise topics that DeSantis claimed were an issue.\u201d\n\nLast year, DeSantis signed into law the Individual Freedom Act, commonly referred to as the \u201cStop WOKE Act.\u201d The act amended the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 by specifying that \u201csubjecting any individual\u201d to believe certain DEI and CRT concepts \u201cconstitutes an unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination.\u201d\n\nDeSantis, who was re-elected in November 2022, is expected to make a bid for the White House in the 2024 election.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nBy Adam Bradford February 02, 2023 at 7:08 pm PST\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d is a column by Adam Bradford discussing college football developments during the winter and spring months. Last month, the 2022 college football season came to an end with a whimper, as Georgia demolished TCU 65-7 to win its second consecutive national title. However, it is never too early to start thinking about 2023. After all, we are just 205 days away from the kickoff of the new season. And with the Big 12 and ACC having released their schedules in recent days, we now know the full slate of games that will be waiting for us in the fall.\n\nSo with that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at five college football matchups to get excited for in 2023:\n\nFlorida at Utah (Aug. 31)\nLast year, these two teams opened the college football season with a thriller down in The Swamp. Playing in front of a raucous crowd of over 90,000 fans, the Gators sealed a 29-26 victory over the eventual Pac-12 champions with a late end zone interception of Utah quarterback Cam Rising. This time, however, the Gators have to travel to Salt Lake City and The MUSS, whom Utah has not lost a game in front of since Sept. 2018. After leading the Utes to back-to-back conference titles and Rose Bowl appearances, Rising returns in 2023 looking to lead Utah to its first College Football Playoff berth. Meanwhile, Florida is hoping to bounce back from a disappointing 6-7 campaign in the first year of the Billy Napier era. The Gators also have major questions at quarterback, especially after the loss of blue-chip signee Jaden Rashada to Arizona State over an NIL dispute.\n\nFlorida State at Clemson (Sept. 23)\nAfter a breakthrough 10-win season in year three under Mike Norvell, Florida State will likely enter 2023 as a top 10 team. The Seminoles return nearly everyone from their 2022 campaign, including starting quarterback Jordan Travis and defensive end Jared Verse. If the Seminoles want to take the next step as a program, however, they will have to take down the king of the ACC in Clemson. The Tigers have won seven of the past eight conference titles, and they have not lost to Florida State since 2014. If there is ever a year for the Seminoles to catch Clemson, this may be it. After disappointing offensive outputs the past two seasons, the Tigers will be breaking in a new offensive coordinator in former TCU OC Garrett Riley, as well as a new starting quarterback in rising sophomore Cade Klubnik.\n\nTennessee at Alabama (Oct. 21)\nLast season, Tennessee took down Alabama in a 52-49 instant classic. After Volunteers\u2019 kicker (and former Trojan) Chase McGrath knocked the game-winning field goal through as time expired for their first victory over the Crimson Tide since 2006, Tennessee fans stormed the field, took down the goalposts, carried them to the Tennessee River and threw them in the water\u2014all while trolling Alabama by playing Dixieland Delight. But what is the only thing harder than beating Nick Saban once? Beating him twice. Since Saban became Alabama\u2019s head coach in 2007, only twice has he lost to the same opponent two times in a row. If the Vols want to become the third program to accomplish such a feat, they will have to go on the road and beat the Tide in Tuscaloosa \u2014 where Tennessee has not won a game since 2003. And after the loss to the Vols likely kept them out of the College Football Playoff last season, you can bet that Alabama will come out hungry for revenge.\n\nMichigan at Penn State (Nov. 11)\nAfter going 11-2 with a Rose Bowl victory in 2022, Penn State is a program looking to do one better in 2023 and contend for a College Football Playoff spot. With quarterback Drew Allar taking over the offense and talented running backs Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen returning, expectations are as high in Happy Valley as they have been in many years. Standing in the Nittany Lions\u2019 way, however, is Michigan. The class of the Big Ten for the past two seasons, Michigan is coming off of back-to-back conference titles and College Football Playoff berths. And with quarterback J.J. McCarthy and star running backs Blake Corum and Donovan Edwards coming back, the Wolverines will almost certainly enter 2023 ranked in the top five. Along with Ohio State, these should be two of the top three teams in the Big Ten in 2023. This matchup could very well decide which team goes to Indianapolis in the first weekend of December.\n\nUSC at Oregon (Nov. 11)\nBelieve it or not, this will be USC\u2019s first trip to Eugene since 2015. Just how long ago was that? Well, in that matchup, the Trojans were led by interim head coach Clay Helton, who would not get the full-time job for another nine days. And both starting quarterbacks in the game \u2014 USC\u2019s Cody Kessler and Oregon\u2019s Vernon Adams Jr. \u2014 were born in 1993. This time around, the Trojans will start Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams, while the Ducks will counter with another talented dual-threat QB in Bo Nix. After an 11-win season in year one of the Lincoln Riley era, USC will be looking to take the next step and make the College Football Playoff in 2023. However, the Ducks have proved to be no easy out, with head coach Dan Lanning continuing to build on the success of his predecessor Mario Cristobal. The USC-Oregon rivalry has already been a fairly hostile one over the past two decades. With this being the final meeting between the two programs before USC departs for the Big Ten, you can expect tensions to be at an all-time high on Veterans\u2019 Day in Eugene.\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}

Entirely student-driven, this event was a triumph for those involved in its planning. The planning process offered junior Candace House the chance to mix her passions for marketing and building community. House is the co-executive director of the Black Student Assembly, so she took a lead on recruiting top companies.\n\nCANDACE HOUSE: We really just started cold calling people on LinkedIn, finding who was a USC alumni, reaching out to them, just sending them messages through the free version on LinkedIn. Other marketing efforts were just as creative. Marketing lead Kameron Villafana used multiple platforms to reach as many people as possible.\n\nKAMERON VILLAFANA: I posted a lot of TikToks, a lot of Instagram, and I sent out, I think, every email... for the Black Career Fair. His counterpart, BSA\u2019s programming intern Radiya Ajibade, gave a more revealing insight into Villafana\u2019s marketing tactics.\n\nRADIYA AJIBADE: Our marketing person for TikTok, Kam. He was so good at everything he did and... just watching him do cartwheels and stuff, just to make sure that we were spreading the word that was just so fun to be part of. This joint marketing effort did its job. Turnout among students and companies was impressive, said House.\n\nHOUSE: We had Disney, we had Paramount, we had NFL, McKinsey, Deloitte. Getting these companies to come is one of my biggest accomplishments and the amount of students that we had to come. We had over 550 students registered, which is more than any of our special events that BSA has ever put on. But, the lead-up to the fair was not without its difficulties.\n\nHOUSE: We didn\u2019t know what to expect. We didn\u2019t know all the roles that we needed for our board for setup and clean up. At the end of the day, House and her team\u2019s thriftiness paid off. Ajibade said that students could ask recruiters intimate questions, which normally isn\u2019t possible at traditional career fairs.\n\nAJIBADE: The biggest thing that we wanted to ensure was that all the students could have at least some type of one on one time to actually make connections with professionals that look like them. So, House and her team filled a gap in previous university programming, showing how USC students care for and uplift their community. For Annenberg Media, this is Matt Chen.\n```"}

(Photo by Sullivan Barthel)\n\nBy Sullivan Barthel and Thomas Johnson\nFebruary 02, 2023 at 6:10 pm PST\n\nAt a press conference today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced they were giving Los Angeles a $60 million grant to help unsheltered and rural homelessness. It is the largest available amount to be awarded by HUD in the grant program.\n\n\u201cThese funds will enable the Los Angeles [Continuum of Care] to coordinate street outreach, as well as expand permanent housing options, leading to intensive care management and health services,\u201d said Jason Pu, the HUD Regional Coordinator for California.\n\nIn 2022, there were 69,144 unhoused people in LA County, according to a count done by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.\n\nThe announcement follows a series of state of emergencies on homelessness declared by L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, L.A. City and L.A. County over the past two months. This declaration gave Bass \u201cthe power to lift rules and regulations that slow or prevent the building of permanent and temporary housing for the unhoused,\u201d according to the official L.A. mayoral website.\n\nBass gave an update on her efforts at the press conference. \u201cMy executive directive to reduce the time and cost of building affordable housing and shelter in L.A. is already underway, and we are discovering barriers that have prevented or slowed down the building of housing or placing of individuals,\u201d Bass said. \u201cWe\u2019re identifying these building barriers and we are identifying what we need to cast these barriers aside.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bass\u2019 declaration last year, she established the Inside Safe Initiative, which will attempt to reduce homeless encampments and move unhoused individuals inside. Yesterday, Bass announced launching the initiative in South Los Angeles and continuing on the Westside.\n\nOfficials at the press conference reaffirmed that the only way the initiative can work is if different government agencies collaborate. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to bring L.A.

The city builds, the county provides services.

(AP Photo/Ben McKeown)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi\nFebruary 02, 2023 at  3:33 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe March Towards March\u201d is a column by Curran Rastogi about college basketball teams and their journey to March Madness.\n\nOn June 21, 2021, history was made after Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski announced he\u2019d be retiring from college basketball following the 2021-2022 season, commencing a farewell tour for the ages. His young Duke team made it to the Final Four where they fell in an instant classic to in-state rival North Carolina, ending Coach K\u2019s farewell tour without a championship. For Blue Devil fans, it was a disappointing way to see their beloved coach go out. For Duke\u2019s many haters, it left them with a small sense of satisfaction.\n\nDuke\u2019s success over Krzyzewski\u2019s tenure has provoked a lot of envy from rival fans, leaving the entire college basketball community to wonder what a post-Krzyzewski Duke would look like and the success they\u2019d have.\n\nCoach K was succeeded by one of his former players and associate head coach Jon Scheyer. Scheyer won the 2010 National Championship as Duke\u2019s leading scorer and was revered by Coach K for his basketball IQ. In his first year coaching Duke, Scheyer has the team at 16-6 overall with a 7-4 conference record. Although this may not seem to be the most impressive, this team looks much better than its record shows and deserves more recognition.\n\nScheyer and the Blue Devils started at No. 7 in the preseason AP Poll due to one of their best recruiting classes in recent years. They picked up forward Dariq Whitehead (the No. 2 player in the country), center Dereck Lively II (No. 33), center Kyle Filipowski (No. 4) and forward Mark Mitchell (No. 20), according to 247Sports. They also got transfers guard Jacob Grandison and center Ryan Young, feeding their high expectations.\n\nThe team lived up to these expectations early on with only two losses in non-conference play against Kansas and Purdue and wins against Iowa, Ohio State and Xavier. In conference play however, the team started to slip down rankings and lost by at least 10 points to lesser teams like Wake Forest, NC State and Clemson. However, the Blue Devils have won three of their last four and seem to be on an upward trajectory.\n\nCentral to Duke\u2019s success has been sharing the basketball and rebounding very well on both ends of the floor. They are third in the ACC in assists per game with 15.5, first in offensive rebounds per game with 10.4 and second in total rebounds per game with 34.6. This allows the Blue Devils, who have players who can create scoring opportunities off the dribble all throughout their rotation, to maximize their chances to hit shots. It also makes them a much harder team to defend as any player can lead the team in scoring every night. This setup falls in line with Krzyzewski\u2019s philosophy, who said in a Forbes article that \u201c[he likes] to think of each as a separate finger on the fist. Any one individually is important. But all of them together are unbeatable.\u201d Duke basketball is at its best when its players create scoring opportunities for each other.\n\nOn the defensive end, Duke has allowed the fourth least points per game in the ACC and has the third lowest field goal percentage allowed. Duke\u2019s on-ball defense has allowed them to be the 33rd-best defense in the nation according to KenPom. The team is full of smart, athletic defenders which allows them to switch onto other players to guard if need be. Lively anchors this defense as a defensive stopper; with his height and athleticism, Lively averages two blocks per game, coming off a four-block game where the Blue Devils beat Wake Forest. Lively has not lived up to expectations offensively, averaging 4.4 points per game, but the Blue Devils need to keep him on the floor for his defense and as a lob threat.\n\nFor all their strengths, Duke is still a very inexperienced team that has problems closing out games. However, guard Jeremy Roach and Grandison can provide this team a veteran presence in important situations. Similarly, Filipowski is Duke\u2019s best player who can be called upon in these situations.\n\nCan this team make a deep run in March? Yes. Duke is currently projected to be anywhere from a 5-7 seed by most bracketologists. This team has many important games ahead of them, such as North Carolina at home and away, at No. 23 Miami and at No. 6 Virginia. These games will be telling on how the Blue Devils can hold up in the gauntlet of March Madness and the overall strength of the roster as a whole. If the tournament started today, Duke could very easily make a run to the Elite Eight, but if they want to make a return to the Final Four, these upcoming games will be crucial.\n\n\u201cThe March Towards March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/02/02/vision-boards-and-why-you-should-make-one/", "response": "```\nHealth & Wellness Vision boards and why you should make one The benefits of vision boards for achieving your goals in 2023\n\nPhoto courtesy of Samantha Swift.\n\nBy Samantha Swift February 02, 2023 at 8:17 am PST\n\nSocial media often gets blamed for fueling our anxiety, but it also offers ways to improve our self-care routines. From manifestation techniques on Instagram to hot girl walks on TikTok, now there\u2019s another new way to channel our positive energy \u2013 vision boards that target future goals and aspirations. As we settle into 2023 \u2013 especially as New Year\u2019s resolutions may start to lose traction \u2013 vision boards provide a creative method to refocus energy on personal aspirations.\n\nPlanning Your Process\nYou can create a vision board in a carefully planned evening, or assemble one as a quick homework distraction. In creating my recent vision board I found it helpful to plan first and then create. This process involved thinking about the time period I wanted the board to apply to and which values I wanted it to reflect. These values could even be jotted down through a journaling exercise. For my board, I chose the upcoming month as my time frame with aspirations of adventure, getting outdoors, and embracing a gentler attitude toward myself.\n\nVision boards are an easy solo task, however, vision board parties have evolved as an encouraging and productive get-together. While the process is ultimately personal to you, surrounding yourself with the encouragement and inspiration of others may enforce accountability... Plus, everyone loves a social excuse!\n\nThe Logistics\nIt\u2019s time to return to your middle school Pinterest era (or maybe like me you never really left). Fill a Pinterest board with images that speak to you. To compile them into collage format, use Canva for pre-made templates, or even a Word document for more creative freedom. You can also use digital vision boards as inspirational screensavers or printed to display in your room. If you\u2019re looking for more of a hands-on activity, vision boards can also be assembled onto a poster from magazine photos and newspaper clippings.\n\nImplementing the Vision\nOnce you\u2019ve assembled your art piece, place it in a visible location as a reminder of your future focus. While this activity may encourage goal planning, it acts simply as a starting point. Take the next step by reflecting on specific and measurable ways to incorporate those chosen practices and values into daily life. Bonus points if you can write out a plan or share it with a friend for accountability.\n\nNotes on Aesthetics\nBy nature, vision boards are an aesthetic form of expression, appearing perfectly curated and likely different from what your daily pursuits look like. However, what matters most is how you feel when pursuing these goals, and not if they perfectly match the aesthetic on your board. Personal development is a mental process more than a physical one, and aesthetic composition shouldn\u2019t dictate true success. While vision boards are a fun inspiration, they should be created with a gentle attitude that honors what flexibly fits you without setting unreasonable expectations.\n\nNow go plan your 2023!\n```"}

Community members in Isla Vista, which includes both local residents and UCSB students, alerted police to individuals placing pamphlets around the neighborhood Monday night. More than a hundred bags \u201cfilled with antisemitic rhetoric and conspiracy theories\u201d were scattered across the beachfront neighborhood, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Inside were fliers denying the existence of the Holocaust and connecting Jewish people with racism and pedophilia. Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany slaughtered some six million Jews, wiping out two-thirds of Europe\u2019s Jewish population.\n\n\u201cThe fliers were put into a ziplock or resealable bag, and then weighted down with dry beans, and they were flung from the vehicle,\u201d said Lieutenant Garrett TeSlaa of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cThey don\u2019t appear to have targeted any one specific person or type of persons in terms of where they were dropped.\u201d Leaflets were found on neighborhood front doors, cars, along sidewalks and in front of the UCSB Hillel center.\n\n\u201cThis disgraceful act was carried out only four days after International Holocaust Remembrance Day, reminding us that antisemitism is not a thing of the past, but something that has become disturbingly common,\u201d UC Santa Barbara Hillel said in an online statement. Antisemitic acts hit a record high in 2021, with 2,717 reported incidents, according to the Anti-Defamation League. That averages to more than seven antisemitic incidents per day. In October, demonstrators waved banners over a Los Angeles freeway supporting antisemitic remarks made by rapper Kanye West.\n\n\u201cWe are outraged and saddened by the recent distribution of hateful and hurtful antisemitic propaganda against our Jewish community,\u201d UCSB officials said in a public statement released Wednesday night. \u201cWhat has happened here at home adds to the pain and suffering that we have felt recently with the mass murder of Asian citizens in Monterey Park, and the video release of the brutal beating and murder of a young Black man, Tyre Nichols, by Memphis police officers.\u201d \u201cSuch horror and inhumanity should not exist in our society, and certainly not on our doorsteps,\u201d the university added.\n\nAccording to the statement, the university is also investigating a separate incident involving antisemitic graffiti on a classroom chalkboard. \u201c[Our] student leaders have reached out to their peers in Santa Barbara to express their solidarity, and our team of students and professionals at USC Hillel is on hand to ensure any student seeking support finds a safe, welcoming, and fully accepting home,\u201d USC Hillel said in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cThreatening behavior towards Jews has become stunningly commonplace.\u201d\n\nBack in Santa Barbara, the sheriff\u2019s office worked with the Anti-Defamation League to identify the group behind the antisemitic incidents. The extremist group, which has not been publicly disclosed, aims to generate revenue by directing people to their website, police said. Annenberg Media has chosen not to disclose the identity of the group. \u201cThe group clearly knows the line between free speech and hate speech,\u201d TeSlaa said. \u201cOur initial assessment is that there doesn\u2019t appear to have been a crime that\u2019s enforceable, at least with the information and the evidence that we have.\u201d\n\nIn Isla Vista, frustrations mount over UCSB\u2019s response to the antisemitic incident. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s offensive. And the tropes are nothing that I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d Tessa Veksler, co-president of students supporting Israel at UCSB said. \u201cThis act is so blatant, and so right wing, that of course it gains attention.\u201d Vesker said Jewish students face more subtle microaggressions from left wing antisemitic groups and individuals on a daily basis. She also serves as a senator for Associated Students, an organization that elevates student concerns to UCSB administration. \u201cI believe that the administration is willing and ready to work with us,\u201d Veskler said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfortunate that something so extreme has to happen. And it feels almost more like a reactive measure rather than proactively wanting to help the Jewish community.\u201d\n\nIn their statement, UCSB offered additional mental health resources for students and staff who may be affected by the incident. \u201cWe will continue to work together to nurture an inclusive, welcoming, and secure living and learning environment where each and every community member feels safe and comfortable expressing who we are and what we believe,\u201d UCSB said in the statement. For Jaime Orseck, student board co-president for UCSB Hillel, the latest wave of antisemitism will not stop her community from speaking out against hate. \u201cUCSB has the largest Jewish student population rate out of any of the University of California campuses, which is such an incredibly special thing to say about our campus,\u201d Orseck said. \u201cThis past week, the UCSB Jewish community has shown up loudly and proudly to address these antisemitic incidents.\u201d\n```"}

Al Sharpton and Vice President Kamala Harris also took to the podium. \u201cThis violence was not in pursuit of public safety,\u201d Vice President Harris said in her eulogy Wednesday. \u201c[Nichols] was entitled to the right to be safe.\u201d Harris ended her remarks by demanding that Congress pass the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, saying it is \u201cnon-negotiable.\u201d Her words echo outcries about his death that have reverberated throughout the country, including several protests in the Los Angeles area.\n\nStudents across USC campus have been impacted by Nichols\u2019 death. \u201cI feel like to see someone lose their life before your eyes is not normal and is something that we should stop, that we should stop circulating these videos,\u201d said freshman SCA student Ifedotun Olarewaju. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of become routine to hear about it. This was the first time I chose not to watch the video because I don\u2019t want to further desensitize myself to it.\u201d\n\nNichols\u2019 mother expressed a similar sentiment. \u201cI don\u2019t need a video to show me what they did. I saw the end results. My son is dead,\u201d she said in an interview with BBC.\n\nThe circulation of yet another video of a Black man dying at the hands of police brutality has brought up questions of whether people are becoming more desensitized to the violence. \u201cEvery minute of the day you\u2019re getting beeps on your phone or you\u2019re looking at CNN or there\u2019s breaking news. And, you know, nine times out of ten, it\u2019s always something bad.\u201d said USC Annenberg Professor Miki Turner, the 2022 National Association of Black Journalists\u2019 Journalism Educator of the year. \u201cSo I can see, you know, how students are becoming desensitized,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd I think part of it is a defense mechanism to preserve their mental health.\u201d\n\nStill, Turner said that she hopes students will recognize the weight of what they are exposing themselves to and acknowledge the effects it may have on them later. For some students though, the more things seem to stay the same, the harder it is to process. \u201cI\u2019m just disappointed by the lack of change over the past few decades, despite a lot of people pushing back and trying to collaborate to create change,\u201d senior global health student Rachel Lundstrum said.\n\nAs friends, family and people across the country honored Tyre Nichols this morning in a heartfelt celebration of life, it also sparked calls for police reform and lasting change.\n```"}

Many may not know that it was shot and modeled by team of three Black female creators from USC.\n\nJunior Brianna Brothers is a psychology major with a passion for photography that stemmed from her modeling career. Brothers explains how she became the cover photographer and the importance of Black artists in the entertainment industry.\n\nBRIANNA BROTHERS: One of my best friends, her cousin owns a production company, and his production company works with quite a few different artists and they typically do music videos. He reached out to me back in December and said, Hey, Bri, I need a photographer for this project. Do you want to shoot the project? He needs a cover with two girls with afros.\n\nBrothers hopes to uplift the Black community through her work and inspire other young Black creatives to fully immerse themselves in their passions.\n\nBROTHERS: Yeah, I think it\u2019s extremely important to have Black artists and Black models. I think specifically for me, as a Black female photographer, I\u2019m able to make sure that what I put out there is elevating our culture rather than tearing it down in any way.\n\nAfter reaching out to sophomore Anya Ball about modeling the project, Ball immediately jumped at the opportunity to work with Brothers.\n\nANYA BALL: But it was a very comfortable setting. I really like that. It was a USC student, a Black girl that was able to shoot it and just kind of working in that space was it was nice to see. I think when Brianna was like, \u201cOh, like the song title is two tens,\u201d I was like, Oh that makes me happy that it\u2019s Black women, but looking for afros, looking for just like that, authentic, like big hair. That was like one of my favorite parts of it.\n\nAmid the reactions, Ball was overwhelmed with support from her friends and family although surprised that the album cover had reached such a large audience.\n\nBALL: I knew it was going to be used for the song cover, but I think seeing it, like scrolling through music and seeing my face there was like, wow. I have just had a lot of friends send me screenshots and been like, \u201cIs this you?\u201d I would hope that the creative industry opens up a little bit more to give younger, especially Black women opportunities to do things like that.\n\nAs of right now, the song has been streamed on Spotify more than three million times within the first week of its release on January 25th.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Isa Johnson.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Tatiana Sataua and Samuel Spitz\nFebruary 01, 2023 at 4:38 pm PST\n\nJust over a year ago, Caleb Williams was still enrolled at the University of Oklahoma with zero connection to the USC Trojans. In just one year at USC, he has led the Trojans to a resurgent 11-3 season, appeared in both the Pac-12 Championship and the Cotton Bowl, became a Heisman Trophy winner and even helped cheer on the basketball team to a win over crosstown rival UCLA last week. Williams is even bringing some USC families closer together.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s made it a lot better because it made me connect with my dad more,\u201d said sophomore Quentin Tindell. \u201cMy dad is a very big sports fan, and I\u2019m not. And getting to represent my school and finally understand what he likes sports-wise was really cool. We got to talking and hanging out more and it meant a lot to me.\u201d\n\nSince becoming a Trojan, Williams has proven himself to be a bona fide celebrity in a city that knows a thing or two about celebrities. This weekend, he was named the honorary starter for the NASCAR Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum. But even through his fame, he is often seen walking around campus, living the life of a student and an athlete. Even casual fans recognize the star.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow football too much, but he is famous around here,\u201d freshman Connor McGartland said.\n\nWith all his success in one year, Williams seems destined for NFL stardom, but, due to NFL rules, will return for a second and likely final season with the Trojans. Despite only being at USC for such a short time, his impact on the USC community has been profound, according to USC students.\n\nWhen Williams decided to follow his Oklahoma head coach Lincoln Riley to Los Angeles, his explosiveness and impact was not limited to the gridiron, but the USC campus as a whole. Sophomore Sarah Tupy claimed that there is a very stark difference between students\u2019 connection to the football team this year as opposed to last year.\n\n\u201cI mean, attendance in general was crazy high compared to last year,\u201d Tupy said. \u201cIt was kind of sad having so many empty seats last year.\u201d\n\nTupy attributed the change in attendance directly to Williams, saying, \u201cI know people who aren\u2019t really into football and they buy the season tickets just to see Caleb Williams.\u201d\n\nAnd despite his status on campus, he is still just another student to many.\n\n\u201cI see him around campus and I\u2019ll say hi to him,\u201d said freshman Bennett Patterson. \u201cHe\u2019s just a super nice guy.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of A24)\n\nBy Rajvinder Singh\nFebruary 01, 2023 at 4:30 pm PST\n\nIf you thought a Jesse Eisenberg directorial debut would be as neurotic as the characters he plays, you thought right. \u201cWhen You Finish Saving the World\u201d is an adaptation of Eisenberg\u2019s award-winning audiobook of the same name. Serving a dual purpose, the drama acts as the source and auxiliary material for the filmmaker and audience. Given that the film is only truly faithful to Ziggy Katz\u2019s character, it\u2019s not quite following the footsteps of Stephen Chbosky\u2019s adaptation of his book, \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower,\u201d or Clive Barker\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Hellbound Heart,\u201d the novella that became \u201cHellraiser.\u201d\n\nThink of Eisenberg\u2019s audiobook as mostly the prequel, which separates three key members of the Katz family who take us through a given day of their lives at different points in their lives over roughly five hours. The film has the upper hand on the audiobook by bringing the three together: Evelyn (Julianne Moore), or Rachel in the audiobook; her husband Roger (Jay O. Sanders), named Nathan in the audiobook; and their 15-year-old son Ziggy (Finn Wolfhard).\n\nEisenberg\u2019s decisions are unsurprisingly conventional, but that isn\u2019t entirely irredeemable. He knows the basics \u2014 letting the frame talk, traditional dramatic beats, distinguishable characters \u2014 well enough to hopefully build on them with increasingly ambitious works moving forward.\n\nOccupying most of these familiar dramatic beats are Evelyn and Ziggy navigating their tumultuous relationship. While Evelyn is unable to connect with her son, she looks to a client\u2019s teenage son, Kyle, who is staying at Evelyn\u2019s social services clinic with seemingly greater potential. Ziggy, meanwhile, wants his high school crush, Lila (Alisha Boe), to accept him by any means as he strives for fortune and glory singing mediocre folk rock songs on the Internet.\n\nWolfhard makes a strong case for his comedic chops, often found in his narcissistic tendencies and cringe-worthy moments, such as desperately learning \u201chow to be political\u201d in order to connect with politically-attuned Lila. But he\u2019s just terribly out of touch \u2014 and horny. His masterplan to woo Lisa by turning her poem about the plight of the Marshall Islands into a song for his online followers quickly goes awry when he boasts to her about profiting from politics.\n\nThere\u2019s untapped potential in the way he arrives at this absurd logic. Wolfhard\u2019s ability to translate Eisenberg\u2019s quips and quirks presents an opportunity to shine with comedic heavy hitters Greg Mottola and Evan Goldberg.\n\nZiggy is not the exception to narcissistic tendencies. In an argument with him in the car, Evelyn says that \u201csomething switched\u201d in Ziggy when he grew up, presumably the undoing of puberty, but she\u2019s so infatuated with molding Ziggy into her image of what he should be that she can\u2019t accept this stage of his life.\n\nIn an attempt to not feel like a failure, she tries to mother Kyle \u2014 persuading him to attend college rather than work on cars (which is what he loves), sneaking out of the house to take him unsolicited meals, providing him with chores that he\u2019s willing to do around the clinic \u2014 while he and his own mother are staying there. Evelyn\u2019s gestures increasingly push the limits of their boundaries until Kyle\u2019s mother intervenes \u2014 the worst we can expect to happen.\n\nWhat comes out of Evelyn\u2019s unsuspecting demeanor and morally ambiguous choices, ending in bouts of tears, is Moore delivering a memorably uncomfortable performance.\n\nSaving the world on their terms is what pulls Ziggy and Evelyn apart and pushes them back together when there\u2019s nowhere else to go in the perfunctory conclusion to this dramedy.\n\nIn his unfortunately sparse role as a reserved and defeated father, Roger is caught in the middle of Ziggy and Evelyn\u2019s feud, and sidelined at times. The film undercuts the family\u2019s fascinating exposition offered in the audiobook: Ziggy being called \u201cit\u201d by his father when he was a baby; father and son\u2019s polarizing relationships with an uncle; the immense influence of the mother\u2019s former boyfriend, who dies in war; and the rocky start to parenthood for the parents.\n\nIn more ways than one, Charlotte Wells\u2019 2022 directorial debut, \u201cAftersun,\u201d is a vastly different film than \u201cWhen You Finish.\u201d Both are releases from A24, a distributor known for its niche yet growing cinematic appeal. What\u2019s especially concerning is that Wells, a non-actor with mostly short film credits, takes more creative risks (with a payoff) in her debut than Eisenberg \u2014 an Academy Award-nominated actor with David Fincher, M. Night Shyamalan and countless other directors on his credits.\n\nBut the films can be two sides of the same A24 coin. \u201cAftersun\u201d doesn\u2019t allude to much between the young father and his daughter for most of the film, but it doesn\u2019t completely expose its hand when it does hint at his inner struggles. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t Eisenberg\u2019s intention to use this mysterious and ominous quality to elevate the most dramatic points of \u201cWhen You Finish.\u201d\n\nBut his withholding hints of the richer exposition from his own audiobook prevents the audience from considering that there\u2019s more than meets the eye compared to what unfolds on screen.\n\n\u201cWhen You Finish Saving the World\u201d is a cautious dance between story and direction that makes for a mostly simple picture. You come for the allure of a directorial debut, but stay for the friction between Wolfhard and Moore.\n```"}

I was new to the area and convinced a co-worker to join me at the midnight performance, offering to pay her cover. I told her we were attending for research; I was what you\u2019d call a \u201cbaby gay,\u201d having just discovered I was a queer woman two years prior, and needed to survey the LGBTQ+ scene in my new home (I had moved there for a job). Arkansas wasn\u2019t exactly highlighted for its gay inclusivity, at least online, so I opted to search for hidden rainbow corners of the red state.\n\nDiscovery Nightclub (which the locals call \u201cDisco\u201d) was split into three rooms \u2014 a Latin room, the main dance floor, and bar and a drag room, complete with a mock proscenium arch and a stage protruding in the audience at three places. The show had already begun by the time we arrived, so in the dark room lit by phone screens and the back glow of a spotlight following one of the performers, we sat at a small round table. An ashtray was placed on every table; smoking was allowed indoors. The smell of cigarettes never bothered me \u2014 I grew up with a mom and grandmother who were pack-a-day smokers, and despite their best efforts to keep the habit away from me, secondhand smoke subconsciously became a comfort throughout my childhood. So in a very loose and objectively unhealthy way, the club already felt like home.\n\nI had no reason to expect the spectacle that was laid before me in the often forgotten Southern capitol. But the moment fog machines erupted as a drag queen named Princess entered the room \u2014 wearing over-the-knee leather boots, a black bodysuit and the largest fabric boa I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 I was entranced. I had no idea how captivating a lip-synched performance to Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cMonster\u201d could be. The audience cheered as Princess worked the stage with alluring dance moves and an invisible lasso that pulled tippers towards her. Excitement overcame me as I rushed from my seat waving a dollar bill that joined a pool of 5s, 10s and 20s floating in the air before the queen could grab them. When I returned to my table mid-performance, even my unwitting co-worker was hooping and hollering. We were having a blast.\n\nThe crowd took a minute to settle after Princess performed, giving the night\u2019s emcee \u2014 who was also a drag queen \u2014 a chance to walk on stage and make an announcement. \u201cWho in here likes Cher?\u201d she asked. The host was greeted with a room full of hands and eager fans. \u201cWe are going to give away two tickets to Cher\u2019s farewell tour to whoever can perform the best lip-synch to one of her songs. I need six audience volunteers to come on stage and compete.\u201d As electric as I felt at that moment, I still didn\u2019t raise my hand. So the queen picked five strangers to perform, and I watched them climb onstage with jealousy, but not enough confidence to actually take action. Before picking the final performer, the emcee asked for a lesbian to volunteer. My co-worker \u2014 bless her supportive heart \u2014 insisted I go up. Unbeknownst to her, I wasn\u2019t actually sure I\u2019d use the term \u201clesbian\u201d to label my sexuality at the time, but with Cher tickets on the line, details of the inner conflict regarding my orientation would have to wait.\n\nLittle did I know then just how many opportunities I\u2019d have to explore that inner conflict within supportive LGBTQ+ spaces over the next two years. That night\u2019s performance at Disco was the first of dozens of fabulous drag shows I attended in Central and Northwest areas of the state \u2014 shows that made me laugh, shows that made me cry, shows embedded in the foundation of some of my closest friendships, shows I saw on dates, shows I\u2019ll never forget, and shows I only remember through context clues strung together from blurry photos and videos in my Snapchat camera roll.\n\nThat night at Disco afforded me opportunities to befriend the men behind the wigs and waistcoats \u2014 fathers, politicians and businessmen who are as talented at the intricate art of drag as they are spirited leaders to all Arkansans, not just the LGBTQ+ community. One of my fondest memories was serving as the only female judge for the 2021 Miss Gay Arkansas America competition and crowning MD Hunter \u2014 whose stage name is Athena Sinclair \u2014 one day, then watching him lead Black Lives Matter rallies the next. Hunter later became a top 10 finalist for the 2022 Miss Gay America competition.\n\nThat night at Disco was also my introduction to Arkansas\u2019 surprisingly involved queer history. The natural state (a nickname for Arkansas) is home to the very first Miss Gay America competition winner, Norman Jones, whose stage name is Norma Kristie. Jones was crowned female impersonation victor in 1973 and later became the owner of the illustrious Discovery Nightclub. Additionally, Arkansas set a reformist example as one of the only Southern states to strike down legislation attacking queer individuals in the early 2000s, before the Supreme Court federally declared sodomy law unconstitutional in the landmark 2003 Lawrence v. Texas ruling.\n\nArkansas proved itself to not only be home to the dynamic queer community I was searching for, but to the queer community I needed to fully embrace this part of myself. It\u2019s the home state of a woman I met who is now my best friend and partner, and it\u2019s the first place that taught me the importance of queer and intersectional representation in a place stigmatized by a white, heteronormative paragon.\n\nI think that\u2019s why I feel so guilty watching state leaders burn it to the ground from the comfort of the Los Angeles bubble I\u2019ve been living in for the past eight months. While I bask in a state that has championed queer liberation since the 1970s, my queer family in Arkansas is fighting two of the most damning pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation introduced in the United States. HB1156, a bill complicating transgender students\u2019 ability to attend some school-sponsored events, is one of the latest legal write-ups placing a target on the back of children who just want to exist comfortably in their bodies without politicians breathing down their necks. Meanwhile, SB43, a bill redefining drag performance as an \u201cadult-oriented business,\u201d is a cover for a much broader attack on transgender, non-binary and gender-nonconforming individuals, as well as drag performers.\n\nWhile I\u2019m invited to attend sapphic art openings, drag brunches and queer event after queer event in L.A., some of my closest friends who are drag queens, artists, allies, sex educators and students are rallying at the Arkansas state capitol. They\u2019re waving pride flags with desperation and shouting reasons why queer existence should be valued in hopes to defer the enactment of harmful statues such as the incorrectly labeled \u201canti-drag\u201d bill, which passed through Senate and House floors with little effort. And Arkansas isn\u2019t alone. While I write for a publication that reaches audiences who value my queer voice, the ACLU is tracking 184 anti-LGBTQ+ bills designed to silence queer individuals in 28 states.\n\nI want to brood in the guilt I feel from leaving behind the community that shaped my queer identity, but I recognize the privilege I\u2019ve gained by living somewhere queer people are celebrated. So instead of sulking, I\u2019m searching for ways that I and anyone who lives in progressive corners of the country can show up for our LGBTQ+ family, even when we can\u2019t stand with them in person. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come up with so far:\n\nThe greatest weapon we have is our voice \u2014 publish articles, post on social media, make TikToks and spread the word about the active persecution of LGBTQ+ people in various parts of the country. The more people talk about the issues at hand, the closer we are to finding ways to stop the abuse. If you have the financial means, donate to organizations that support the LGBTQ+ community under attack. In Arkansas, Intransitive and Lucie\u2019s Place are two organizations dedicated to queer youth. Both organizations have been active in the fight against HB1156 and SB43. If you\u2019re comfortable with it, open your home to LGBTQ+ individuals seeking refuge or make it a safe place to have gender-affirming medications delivered that you can later mail to them. If all else fails, be a compassionate ear for loved ones facing anti-LGBTQ+ campaigns. Let them know they have advocates far and wide.\n\nI believe the only reason I was picked to lip-sync that first night at Disco was how unsuspecting I looked wearing ripped jeans, a hoodie and a ball cap. But I put my years of unused high school theatre training to work, and my performance to \u201cBelieve\u201d won me the crowd and the Cher tickets. Looking back at the video I have of the event on my phone reminds me that the COVID pandemic robbed me from ever actually attending the concert, but I ended up gaining so much more than a live rendition of \u201cWoman\u2019s World\u201d that night.\n\nMy introduction to drag ultimately led me to the fiercest queer family, one that fostered a safe place to embrace the queer parts of myself and offered a home unlike any other place I\u2019ve ever been. The Arkansas LGBTQ+ community instilled in me a devotion to stand against nonsensical anti-queer legislation, such as HB1156 and SB43 and the other 182 bills attacking a group that doesn\u2019t deserve such treatment.\n\nSo to my Arkansas queers: I may not be with you, but I\u2019m with you. Until I\u2019m home, I\u2019ll do whatever I can, from wherever I can, to help.\n```"}

Notable individuals set to speak at the event include U.S. Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove and USC football linebacker Shane Lee.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just USC\u2019s administration that\u2019s initiating upcoming large-scale events\u2014Alexandria Gee, a junior majoring in communications and a cultural ambassador for the Center for Black Culture and Student Affairs (CBCSA) and a leader for the club initiative Siblings in Solidarity, explained what organizations like hers are doing to celebrate Black history.\n\n\u201cThis semester we\u2019re getting really into it...We\u2019re having the Black Career Fair, the first one ever; it\u2019s held by BSA [Black Student Assembly],\u201d said Gee. BSA, CBCSA, as well as other prolific Black clubs and organizations are hosting a plethora of events. For example, FRO Fest, which stands for \u2018films representing ourselves,\u2019 is holding discussions about Black identity and Black history. Other events include yard shows, a Divine Nine\u2014historically Black fraternities and sororities\u2014performance at half-time for an upcoming basketball game, and even a pageant hosted by Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity (a Black fraternity) called the \u201cBlack and Gold Scholarship Pageant.\u201d\n\nStudents on campus are also preparing for the list of events and opportunities that are set to be hosted. Christian Bipat, a sophomore studying business administration and a member of the Black Student Assembly and the USC organization Brothers Breaking Bread (BBB)\u2014a group designated for Black men\u2014talked about the importance of USC taking the initiative to celebrate Black History Month.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s important because we don\u2019t often see our race represented on campus that much,\u201d said Bipat. \u201cI don\u2019t often see Black people that much in my classes or on campus except for at the BSA room.\u201d According to a report released by the school, the Fall 2022 undergraduate class had a \u2018Black/African American\u2019 population of less than 6%.\n\nThere are other non-Black student organizations that are also launching new aspects for the month. The Daily Trojan, USC\u2019s student-run newspaper, has a special issue set to come out this Friday.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we\u2019re going to be doing across all the sections is focusing our coverage on Black organizations, Black movements, Black students and Black art,\u201d said Sage Wheeler, a junior studying chemical engineering and English literature and the paper\u2019s Editor-in-Chief. \u201cWe\u2019re also going to be platforming a little bit more intentionally some of our Black staffers. That includes staff writers, but then also photographers and artists.\u201d\n\nStudents should look out for upcoming emails, newsletters, newspaper copies and press coverage for the upcoming Black student events that are soon to take center stage.\n```"}

Students share their favorite study spots on campus and it\u2019s not the library. \n\nA USC student sits by the Hoose Library of Philosophy while studying for midterms. (Photo by Daniel Hahm). \n\nBy Cierra Morgan, Kaitlin Becenti, Tony Fajardo and Veronique Louis-Jacques January 31, 2023 at 9:53 pm PST\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t like Leavey [Library], it feels like a hospital to me, so I\u2019m not really in for that,\u201d said Jeremi Orlowski, a sophomore majoring in business administration. For many USC students like Orlowski, study spots such as Leavey and Doheny just don\u2019t cut it. Students weigh in on their favorite places to study on campus.\n\nSchool of Cinematic Arts Many students can be found studying in the SCA courtyard, seated near Coffee Bean, completing their work with a cup of coffee by their side. In addition to the popular cafe, students pointed out why they enjoy the atmosphere of the SCA courtyard. \u201cSCA has a nice vibe, and I\u2019m a screenwriting minor, so it\u2019s good for the creativity there,\u201d said Orlowski.\n\nRonald Tutor Center An outdoor area bustling with students is a great alternative for students looking for a more lively spot to study. Students can sit outside under the sun at couches and tables or opt for a seat inside where they can grab lunch from the Ronald Tutor Center. \u201cTTC on the fourth floor, right next to where you used to go on the balconies before they got locked just back by that red wall,\u201d said Emmy Li, a junior majoring in psychology. \u201cI feel like usually, people don\u2019t pass by it too much, so it\u2019s pretty quiet if I need to get work done, but it\u2019s also not dead silent.\u201d\n\nWallis Annenberg Hall (New Annenberg) A popular study space among students, Wallis Annenberg Hall houses Cafe Annenberg and five floors with plenty of seating arrangements. Students can be found hovering over their laptops on the steps to the lower level or on booths on the fourth floor. The building is not known for being the quietest area to study, but for those who enjoy a more active environment, this just might be it. \u201cFinals week of last semester, I studied in New Annenberg every single day for like 8 hours,\u201d said Virginia Richardson, a sophomore majoring in acting for the stage, screen and new media. \u201cFor some reason, it just has the best vibe. It\u2019s open, but it\u2019s modern. I love the screen on the TV. Sometimes people watch soccer in there, and you\u2019ll just hear screams every 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nOlivia Li, a sophomore studying computer engineering and computer science, enjoys the Annenberg Digital Lounge as a quiet alternative to the typical hustle and bustle of the building. \u201cIt\u2019s a very quiet study spot, just like Doheny,\u201d said Li. \u201c[It] really gives you the study vibe.\u201d\n\nOld Annenberg The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism building, typically referred as \u201cOld Annenberg,\u201d carries a completely opposite atmosphere than \u201cNew Annenberg.\u201d \u201cI like it because I feel like it\u2019s pretty quiet, and they\u2019re not spots that people are crowding all the time,\u201d said Sam Nicholson, a senior studying music industry. \u201cIt feels a little secluded so I can focus better.\u201d Few people are usually found there, making it a perfect place to study without many distractions. Tables are located in the east and west wing, and an outdoor patio can be found on the second floor.\n\nMinjee Park, a senior American studies and ethnicity major, enjoys studying in a spot in \u201cOld Annenberg\u201d that many USC students might be unaware of. \u201cMy favorite study spot is that pit, right next to the old Annenberg building with the tables,\u201d said Park. \u201cI really like that place because it\u2019s a little more secluded because I don\u2019t see a lot of people come by that area.\u201d\n\nCPA Classrooms Some students prefer study areas with absolute privacy. Barivure Yorka, a sophomore studying health promotion and disease promotion, describes how she uses the classrooms in the Center for International and Public Affairs to her full advantage. \u201cThere\u2019s usually always an empty room I could just go into,\u201d said Yorka. \u201cYou can also connect your laptops or digital device to their screens in there. I like to just watch shows, maybe to distract me or also just to play Spotify on a bigger screen.\u201d\n\nThe CPA classrooms are the place to go for students who want to be by themselves but still feel like they are on campus studying rather than in their bedrooms. They serve as a perfect study room until ITS kicks you out.\n\nMinistry of Coffee Right off the USC Village in the Caruso Center is an indoor and outdoor study spot called the Ministry of Coffee. Students can enjoy the area for a multitude of reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s like, really, funky,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cAll the decorations are really cute. They have really good coffee and tea, and it\u2019s just a vibe.\u201d\n\nHonorable Mentions A few other hidden gems that students touched upon were the House Library of Philosophy and Jack and Jill Fertitta Cafe. \u201cMy favorite study spot is this little area outside the philosophy library and it kind of looks like a Harry Potter garden,\u201d said Carlos Gonzalez, a freshman majoring in astrophysics. \u201cFertitta is probably the nicest building on campus, in my opinion, so it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory, plus they have a cafe,\u201d said Orlowski.\n```"}

The New York City Department of Education has already blocked the language processor across school networks and devices, and the Los Angeles Unified School District has followed suit, implementing similar restrictions in fear of student plagiarism.\n\nAs university administrators across the country debate the ethics of artificial intelligence in the classroom, ChatGPT has continued to gain traction on college campuses, with many USC students already using the technology to their advantage. \u201cI think it\u2019s a resource for sure,\u201d said neuroscience major, Saanjhi Shahdadpuri. I\u2019ve definitely used it a couple of times, not to just use what it gives me, but to get some ideas for assignments.\u201d\n\nHer friend, psychology student Emily Orman, echoed the assessment: \u201cIt\u2019s really impressive to see what artificial intelligence software thinks about what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Others are more hesitant to use the groundbreaking technology, like master\u2019s of digital social media student, Trinity Gomez. \u201cI think that it\u2019s really cool but also really dangerous in terms of students using it for their assignments, for papers, for things like that,\u201d said Gomez. \u201cI think the technology is really cool and it\u2019s awesome that we\u2019re getting into that, but I also think that professors might run into students kind of taking advantage of it for their projects.\u201d\n\nEunice Dulalia, a global health student, had mixed feelings about the software. She was introduced to the chatbot when her friends asked it to write a whole script for their screenwriting class. \u201cIt was really nice\u2014really well done and I thought it was super cool,\u201d said Dulalia. \u201cBut then when I thought about it for a second, it was like, I just hope it doesn\u2019t take away from the creativity that people actually have in terms of writing, especially in the creative fields.\u201d\n\nMusic majors Josh Grossman and Rachel Barton had similar concerns about the technology, sharing that their professor had demonstrated one of its potential downsides in class. \u201cOur music teacher was actually just saying this morning that you can put into one of them: \u2018write a song about cupcakes in the style of Lady Gaga\u2019 and it gave them a lyric,\u201d said Grossman. \u201cWe\u2019re songwriters so that\u2019s going to put us out of business,\u201d joked Barton. Grossman added his general concerns about the technology outside of his personal career goals. \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone who used that, but I definitely have heard a lot of discourse about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think that if it gets much more prevalent in society than it is right now that there could definitely be a lot of issues posed with plagiarism, and in general, just kind of taking over the place of humans.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if they would personally use it in the classroom, students still seemed a bit hesitant. \u201cI think it\u2019s funny when my friends put everyone\u2019s names in it and ask it to make up a story, but I don\u2019t think I would personally use it,\u201d sociology major Miko Mariscal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little scary how good it is.\u201d \u201cMy professors have told us, \u2018don\u2019t use ChatGPT\u2019 so I feel like I\u2019m too scared because they\u2019re definitely able to tell,\u201d Dulalia added.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/01/31/scoop-trojans-turn-on-the-jets-as-march-approaches/", "response": "```\n\u201cSCoop\u201d is a column by Nolan Ezzet about USC\u2019s sports teams. USC has had a tough schedule the last two weeks, playing No. 11 Arizona and No. 8 UCLA in addition to a competitive Arizona State team. USC was hot going into these games after just nearly taking down UCLA and successfully securing two big conference wins against Colorado and Utah. Over the course of the following three games, the Trojans proved their validity as a respectable tournament team.\n\nThe tough three-game stretch began with USC\u2019s road matchup against Arizona. Senior guard Boogie Ellis had one of the worst games of his season, shooting 2-for-11 from the field and giving up four turnovers. His partner in crime, fifth year guard Drew Peterson, wasn\u2019t much help as he shot 5-of-14 while turning the ball over twice. As a team, the Trojans shot 24-of-65 from the field and 4-of-17 from 3-point range. Their offense lacked proper ball movement, and the team totaled only seven assists. Meanwhile, Arizona shot 28-for-58 from the field and an electric 12-for-24 from deep. The Wildcats\u2019 offense was flowing the whole game, and they racked up 18 assists as a team. This game seemed to be over from the start. At halftime, Arizona boasted a 41-26 lead. USC couldn\u2019t fight back, and Arizona took home an 81-66 victory.\n\nGoing into their matchup against ASU, the Trojans had to make drastic improvements \u2014 and they did just that. USC locked up on defense and prevented the Sun Devils from shooting even close to as efficiently as the Wildcats. ASU shot 25-of-65 from the field and went just 5-for-22 from deep. USC, however, shot very efficiently, going 28-for-57 from the field and 7-for-18 from behind the arc. Peterson led this effort, as he racked up 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Ellis also had a bounce-back performance, as he scored 18 points on 7-of-16 shooting. Freshman guard Tre White and freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu were also integral to the win. Both scored 12 points, with White shooting 5-for-10 and Iwuchukwu shooting 5-for-8. Although most Trojan fans were happy with USC\u2019s 77-69 road win, head coach Andy Enfield was disappointed. His team had a 20-point lead with four minutes remaining but let the Sun Devils chip half of that lead away. \u201cThe last four minutes was one of the worst four minutes of basketball I\u2019ve ever been a part of,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nNonetheless, the Trojans took home the victory and now had their eyes set on their next opponent: UCLA. Enfield knew exactly what he wanted to see from his team. \u201cWe have to play like we did for 36 minutes [against Arizona State]. Pretty simple,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIf we play like that, we\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll have a great home crowd advantage. We\u2019re very good at home.\u201d And boy, did his team match \u2014 and even exceed \u2014 his expectations. Galen Center was packed with fans, and the line for students to enter wrapped around the block. People camped out for several hours before the game just to watch the Trojans exact revenge on their crosstown rival.\n\nThe Trojans started out hot and got off to an early 12-6 lead. Midway through the half, however, UCLA regained the lead, and the Bruins kept the momentum for the rest of the half. They led 37-25 at halftime. Whatever Enfield told his players during halftime, however, changed the entire course of the game. Ellis, who scored just four points in the first half, put on an electric performance. He hit step-back three after step-back three and had one of his best defensive outings as well. He recorded one block and one steal without giving up any turnovers of his own, and he was a lockdown defender even when the statsheet didn\u2019t record anything. Ellis finished the game with a career-high 31 points on 9-of-17 shooting and was easily the best player on the court. Peterson also shot well, going 6-for-10 from the field, good for 16 points. However, his five turnovers frustrated many fans; he was best when used as a catch-and-shoot or iso player. Sophomore guard Kobe Johnson scored 10 points on 2-of-8 shooting but also provided his usual elite defense, which aided in stopping an efficient Bruin offense. He recorded three steals and one block.\n\nUSC retook its lead midway through the second half and ran away with it. The Trojans took down UCLA 77-64, although the game was closer than the final score suggests. USC is now 15-6 overall and sits third in the Pac-12. Although USC played poorly against Arizona, the Trojans bounced back against ASU and looked incredible on both sides of the ball against an elite UCLA team. Ellis proved himself as a threat capable of single-handedly taking down any opponent when he performs his best. Some minor adjustments still need to be made, including Peterson\u2019s turnover problem. If Enfield can get the most out of this team, USC won\u2019t just be a playoff team; the Trojans could make a solid run in March. SCoop runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

This is part of an effort to expand the event\u2019s appeal to a major metropolitan area. The sports car is a promotional collaboration to encourage students to attend the Busch Light auto racing event happening on February 5 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n\nUSC graduate student and Annenberg Photo Desk contributor, Bryce Dechert, said the collaboration came about after a chance meeting with several people from the NASCAR marketing team at a previous Coliseum event. \u201cMyself and another contributor at Annenberg were at this event and we ended up linking up with NASCAR\u2019s marketing team and he said, \u2018hey, how about bringing a NASCAR on campus?\u2019\u201d said Dechert.\n\nUSC\u2019S PRSSA team then helped with permissions and communication between the university and NASCAR to secure the event. \u201cThere are a lot of logistical things that are required into making this event happen...It\u2019s been a really incredible experience for us as well, just because we\u2019re a public relations focused (organization) and this would be sort of our first very hands-on experience at hosting a PR stunt,\u201d said President of PRSSA Daphne Zhu.\n\nStudents gathered on campus with the car while the PRSSA team held a raffle for two free undergraduate and graduate tickets to the event this weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you get to sit on top of a car and take pictures with it, let alone get this close to it. I mean, you pretty much only see these cars on television or in pictures and things of that nature. So to actually have it here in person and we get to touch it and take pictures with it like it\u2019s an unbelievable experience,\u201d said USC junior Ryan Christian.\n\nOther students expressed their excitement at the event. \u201cI thought it was super random, but also really cool that we have this opportunity on campus. Like I was walking to class, had no idea I\u2019d be walking next to a NASCAR race car, like totally out of the blue. But it\u2019s just the magic of USC.\u201d said USC junior Madeline Bryant.\n\nThese student reactions are the reason USC PRSSA organized the event. \u201cIt\u2019s been very fun watching the people\u2019s expressions as they pass by, just because, you know, it\u2019s not every day that you see an extremely large car on campus all colorful and everything,\u201d said Zhu.\n\nPlus, opportunities like the NASCAR collaboration often give USC students the ability to expand professionally. \u201cWe\u2019re a world-renowned educational institution and to have opportunities like this, this is out of this world, honestly. So I think that\u2019s really awesome that NASCAR sees the potential within our school and decided to work with us and vice versa,\u201d said Christian.\n\nThis is the second consecutive year the Busch Light Clash will be held at the Coliseum in an effort to continue to expand to more major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Calif., according to Ben Kennedy, NASCAR\u2019s senior vice president of strategy and innovation, in an interview with The Washington Post. The event will also feature performances from rapper Wiz Khalifa and DJ Cheat Codes with a special performance by Dixie D\u2019Amelio. The event is expected to bring about 60,000 fans to the area.\n\nTickets for the 2023 Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum are $40 for USC students, begin at $65 for adults and are $10 for kids 12 and under.\n```"}

Some students are unaware of the upcoming election.\n\nBy Anthony Clingerman\nJanuary 31, 2023 at 6:20 pm PST\n\nThe USC Undergraduate Student Government has announced the candidates for the annual spring election. Previous voter turnout hasn\u2019t quite met the group\u2019s expectations. Why aren\u2019t students visiting the polls? Anthony Clingerman has the answer.\n\nThe Undergraduate Student Government is a student-run organization who provides advocacy, legislative, programming and funding work. The average election usually receives engagement from only about one-fifth of the undergraduate student body. Last year, 4,451 students participated in the voting.\n\nWhen speaking to students on-campus many weren\u2019t aware of the ongoing election. Luke Rangel is a transfer Computer Science major who hadn\u2019t heard of the USG or their mission statement.\n\nLUKE RANGEL: I think if it was maybe publicized more about what kinds of issues are going on or what kind of things that people are trying to get changed. I mean, right now, I really haven\u2019t heard of, just like anything would make me want to care about it.\n\nThe USG may exist to serve the university\u2019s undergraduate community, but the lack of recognition extends beyond the group\u2019s core demographic. Eduardo Maya is a first year Film Production grad student who also wasn\u2019t aware of the upcoming election.\n\nEDUARDO MAYA: I think for me, the question I have is I\u2019m not exactly sure what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re doing great work, but I don\u2019t know how their work would affect me. And I think similar to, you know, regular elections of politicians, if you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing for you or how they can improve things, it\u2019s kind of hard to be engaged.\n\nLikewise, Antonio Costa, a rising junior studying Business Administration also is unfamiliar with USG\u2019s overall outreach strategy.\n\nANTONIO COSTA: It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about it. I believe there\u2019s no sense of awareness about the USG that\u2019s not advocated enough. So therefore, I\u2019m not even aware that it\u2019s happening. I just believe that it\u2019s not advertised enough. Therefore, you can\u2019t reach the student body. Therefore the student body can\u2019t have interest in it.\n\nUSG voting will take place the week of February 21st and conclude on the 26th.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Anthony Clingerman.\n```"}

Shryft stands for shared Lyft, the new replacement to the free Lyft program. This change is quite the topic of controversy on USC campus, and we spoke with students to get their opinions on the unpopular new change.\n\nUSC announced the rollout of shared Lyft rides that will replace the free Lyft program that was previously adopted due to Covid-19. Now, instead of free access to single Lyft rides, students must use the shared ride feature within the Lyft zone. This change has prompted frustration from some students.\n\nWe spoke with USC student Gavin Duncan, who shared his number one complaint with the new program. \"There's times I get places late at night and making three or four stops just isn\u2019t convenient, so I end up walking, which is not as safe.\"\n\nMany students are frustrated with the possibility of longer wait times for Lyft rides and are concerned about the safety of walking or splitting up friend groups. Student Avery Girouard explained her fears with Shryft. \"From my personal experiences of using it, I\u2019ve just ended up walking because it takes after 20 minutes, I\u2019m like, I can\u2019t wait anymore.\"\n\nOne controversial policy of Shryft is that passengers can only ride in pairs. Girouard said this is unsafe for students traveling in larger groups. \"I know a lot of friends who have been going to parties in groups of three, and so one of them is forced to get a separate lift, which is also extremely dangerous if they\u2019re drunk or going, something\u2019s going on just in emergencies. It\u2019s it\u2019s a very unsafe system.\"\n\nEssence Reynolds thinks riding with strangers is just straight up uncomfortable. \"I\u2019ve actually been kind of avoiding it. I\u2019ve only taken two of them, so, I mean, they weren\u2019t like positive or negative. It was just kind of awkward. It was very awkward.\"\n\nReynold\u2019s fears aren\u2019t only about the potential for awkward social interactions. She also shared her worries about Covid-19 exposure. \"And that also just like causes concern for other people getting in the Lyfts that you weren\u2019t planning on being there.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement of shared Lyft, a student petition opposing the change has gathered nearly 7,500 signatures. It\u2019s safe to say USC students are not stoked on Shryft.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Cami Twomey.\n```"}

Janey Zhang has more on how USC students collaborated with NASCAR to help bring awareness of the event to more students. Some students noticed an eye-catching car with the words \u201cClash at the Coliseum\u201d outside Annenberg Hall this morning. If you were one of them, don\u2019t be alarmed. NASCAR is promoting the Coliseum race on Sunday and this exhibition was a collaboration with USC Public Relations Student Society of America.\n\nDaphne Zhu, a senior majoring in public relations, has been working with NASCAR since winter break. She and another contributor reached out to NASCAR\u2019s marketing team a couple of months ago. Luckily enough, the team was willing to offer a NASCAR stock car on campus. A lot of students came across this site when they passed by Annenberg and they all expressed their interest in the car.

By   jen byers ,  Aadya Chidanand ,  Mya Mariey Vinnett  and  Jason Goode January 31, 2023 at 12:46 pm PST   \n\nPeople took to the streets in Los Angeles Friday and over the weekend following the release of the horrific video showing police beating 29-year-old Tyre Nichols. Annenberg Media was there to document what happened at numerous protests, and the Activism desk has been tracking police killings and the movement for change for months. What follows is a photo essay and details about policing in America.\n\n79 people in 25 days From January 1st to 25th of 2023, U.S.  police killed  at least 79 people. Among them were Tyre Nichols (29, Memphis); Manny \u201cTortuguita\u201d Ter\u00e1n (26, Weelaunee Forest); Keenan Anderson (31, Los Angeles); Oscar Leon Sanchez (35, South LA) and Takar Smith (45, Los Angeles). In response to these killings, protests erupted in  at least 17 cities  across the country. At least five were held in Los Angeles \u2013 some were vigils, some were riots, and some were marches.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be reformed..\u201d On Friday night, grief and rage were palpable in front of the LAPD HQ. A Black mother took the mic to speak but did not give her name. She explained why she came out, after watching the Tyre Nichols video. \u201cI\u2019m ANGRY. I\u2019m TIRED. I sat there and watched this with my mama, and we cried. Once they put on that badge, it becomes a blue wall of silence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be reformed,\u201d  Verneen Mincey  said, at a Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday in Venice. Her brother James Mincey Jr. was killed by LAPD at a traffic stop in 1982. She explained, \u201cFamilies and mothers are still breathing and crying for the same thing. For justice in a system that does not want to give us justice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s shameful that we see our elected officials on national TV talking about what happened to Tyre Nichols, when there\u2019s [so many] people it\u2019s happened to right here in LA...Don\u2019t let our elected officials be silent on that,\u201d a BLM speaker named Auntie Jan  said on Sunday . Since the beginning of 2023, the LAPD has killed at least three people.\n\nRecord-breaking deaths, but smaller protests? In 2022,  the U.S. police killed  a record-breaking 1176 people. Despite the outrage in 2020, recent public protest to police brutality has been more quiet. This decline in public protest may be attributed to a number of reasons: Nationwide, police have increased funding to crack down on civil unrest. In Atlanta, the governor of Georgia  swiftly activated  the National Guard and declared a state of emergency after anti-brutality protests erupted on  January 21 . In advance of the Tyre Nichols video release, police were similarly on call across the country. The officers who beat Tyre Nichols to death were fired, jailed (then  let out on bail ) and put under investigation. The Scorpion Unit they worked for  was disbanded , however other officers from the Scorpion Unit seem to remain employed by the Memphis PD,  according to CNN . U.S. Government officials, including President Biden, have begged the public to \u201c stay peaceful .\u201d At a press conference in Leimert Park on Friday, Najee Ali, Robert Sausedo, and Lora Dene King collectively asked people to \u201cwork together to find solutions,\u201d linking arms with LAPD Deputy Chief Gerald A. Woodyard. In some cities, local marches \u201cpeace policed\u201d themselves, as activists describe it. In Portland, for example, a group of heavily armed protestors brandished firearms at another group of protestors, in an attempt to deradicalize, control and dictate their response to the injustice.\n\nManaging public response? Or seeking change? According to Crimethinc, a legacy anarchist publication and \u201crebel alliance,\u201d responses like President Biden\u2019s are straight out of the \u201ccounter-insurgency playbook.\u201d  On social media , CrimethInc explained, \u201cThis is how they hope to suppress unrest, even in the most egregious cases of police murder. Even if they fire a few officers, they have no intention of diminishing the amount of violence that police employ, nor addressing the disparities that render that violence inevitable. This is obvious because they are focusing on managing the public response to police violence rather than seeking change.\u201d L.A.\u2019s largest gathering drew about 300 people Sunday, as per a crowd count by  journalist Kelly Stuart . This is a significant downturn from the 2020 George Floyd protests, which lasted weeks and brought thousands to the streets. Annenberg Media attended two of the protests in L.A. \u2013 one on Friday night, at the LAPD HQ, and another on Saturday, at Sunset & Vine. Saturday evening\u2019s march was shut down shortly after helicopters began to circle the premises. LAPD confirmed later via Twitter that three protestors were detained, and one was arrested for felony vandalism. (Note: We chose photos that did not include protestors\u2019 faces.

But a few weeks into the new year, people tend to lose motivation and don\u2019t stick to their New Year\u2019s resolutions. It is important to note that you shouldn\u2019t feel any guilt for adjusting your resolutions, if anything, doing so allows you to create a plan that fits into your lifestyle more appropriately.\n\nLet\u2019s say you decided to work out every weekday in 2023 but come to realize that Wednesdays and Fridays are just too busy with classes and club meetings. Now is the perfect time to adjust your goal to three times a week now that you\u2019ve seen what your schedule is like. This way you stay motivated and don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re \u201cfailing,\u201d which is one of the main reasons people give up on their resolutions.\n\nWith the end of the first month of 2023 quickly approaching, here are some steps you can take to ensure you don\u2019t abandon your New Year\u2019s resolutions.\n\nMake sure your goals are specific and not too vague\nMany times New Year\u2019s resolutions are ambiguous goals that provide little concrete direction, think \u201csave money,\u201d \u201close weight,\u201d or \u201cbe more productive\u201d. With goals this large and broad, it is easy to lose motivation, especially if you don\u2019t succeed right away. Instead, try to narrow your resolution down into a more specific, manageable and achievable goal. For example, instead of \u201close weight,\u201d adjust your resolution to \u201cwork out three times a week,\u201d or \u201ccook healthy meals at home on weeknights.\u201d Creating more specific goals makes it easier to manage and keep track of your progress.\n\nDon\u2019t make a bunch of resolutions, stick to one or two\nA new year feels like a new beginning and it is easy to get caught up in the excitement of making an entire list of resolutions. While it is great to want to become the best version of yourself, this is an easy way to burn out. You are more likely to succeed if you choose one or two of those resolutions on your list and create a plan on how to stick to them. With January coming to an end, this is the perfect time to re-evaluate how the first month went and to figure out which resolutions you want to prioritize.\n\nGet a friend to do the buddy system with you, it\u2019s a win-win!\nHaving a support system is so important with anything you do but especially when trying to stick to New Year\u2019s resolutions. A family member or friend can hold you accountable for sticking to your goals, and it\u2019s even better if they join in on them with you. This way you can motivate each other and encourage one another to persevere even when things may get difficult! There are also plenty of clubs and organizations you can join both on campus and online where you are sure to find people with similar goals.\n```"}

Students and faculty were puzzled by an incident that left one Trojan in the hospital.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department responds to a gas leak at the Neely Petroleum Building on Thursday, Jan. 26, 2023. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Nicole Bednar, Maddy Brown, Jinge Li and Jakob Tatoy January 30, 2023 at 6:56 pm PST\n\nUSC students received a puzzling email from the Department of Public Safety on Thursday about a gas leak at the Neely Petroleum Engineering Building that sent one person to the hospital due to an injury sustained from the incident. Between conflicting accounts from USC Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yorstos and DPS Chief David Carlisle, students are still confused about what exactly happened at the building.\n\nThe incident occurred shortly before 4 p.m. DPS Chief Carlisle confirmed the explosion, while Dean Yortsos said it was not an explosion, just a science experiment gone wrong. Seven fire trucks, three paramedic ambulances, two battalion command vehicles and a hazmat vehicle responded to the scene.\n\nAccording to Yortsos, a student was performing an experiment with nitrogen gas before it became pressurized and the container exploded. The student was transported to the hospital following the incident. \u201cHe was stunned, but he was able to walk out on his own,\u201d said Yortsos. \u201cAnd then he went to hospital just to make sure that nothing else was wrong, and he was released. And actually, he was back in the lab the next day.\u201d\n\nEvacuations of Neely and the surrounding four buildings were inexplicably delayed for a few minutes while DPS and the Los Angeles Fire Department gathered information on the incident. Thirty minutes after the purported leak occurred, the USC community was notified via an email from DPS. Sent to all students and staff, the TrojansAlert emergency notification system detailed the gas incident after including an unfilled template DPS uses to deliver incident details.\n\n\u201cIt was just really weird, for a situation like that you\u2019d expect them to have it right,\u201d said USC sophomore Leonel Herrera. Spencer St. Denis, a senior at USC, was at the USC-UCLA basketball game when he received the notifications from DPS. \u201cIt was kind of weird to see that because USC has so many credible people and staff, and then to have that happen, you go, \u2018What really was going on there?\u2019 Like, was this kind of something that could have been prevented?\u201d St. Denis said.\n\nThis is not the first time USC students have received confusing information from DPS. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a templated email, and then two emails later I see the correct email they intended to send,\u201d said Herrera.\n\nAccording to CBS L.A., this is the fourth time LAFD has responded to a hazmat emergency at USC since September and the second time they responded to this specific building While DPS had alerted the USC community of the gas leak via Twitter and TrojansAlert, LAFD did not initially confirm the report. A hazmat team eventually evaluated the building and found no leaks or fires, and the building was promptly reopened.\n\nA press release from LAFD read, \u201cLAFD Hazardous Materials Squad made entry and checked every floor in the building. They found no hazards and confirmed there were no leaks. All air readings (via handheld gas meter) were normal. Only the initial patient (as per first alert) was transported, there were no other injuries reported. Most LAFD resources will be released while one task force remains to oversee the repopulation of the building.\u201d\n\nIn response to criticism of the confusing message, Carlisle said that DPS has a short period of time to assess the dynamic situation, and safety is their primary concern. Herrera noted that DPS should improve its alert system so as to further ensure the safety of the community: \u201cWith a situation of that gravity, it should be done right the first time rather than confuse students.\u201d\n```"}

City Council approves new anti-eviction policies to protect renters\n\nThe updated protections signify a victory for tenants\u2019 rights in L.A.\n\nCommunity members and advocates held signs reading \"Moratorium\" at Tuesday's LA City Council meeting, showing their support for increased protections against rent control. (Photo by Caitlin Myers)\n\nBy Julia Zara, Brandon A. Garcia, Laurie Carrillo, Tyler Pak, and Weiwei Huang\nJanuary 30, 2023 at 6:33 pm PST\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to add more anti-eviction protections for L.A. renters, which will safeguard an additional 400,000 housing units from receiving eviction notices before previous protections implemented at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic expire. According to City News Service, City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto will implement city council recommendations to extend housing measures and eliminate certain eviction rules for L.A. tenants. This includes banning landlords from evicting tenants from single-family homes and instating an eviction grace period for tenants who may fall behind on rent.\n\nJacqueline Burbank, the advocacy and communications manager at Inner City Law Center \u2013 an organization that represents low-income tenants who have been unlawfully evicted \u2013 said that the new measures will provide a buffer period for families facing eviction. \u201cWe are very excited about these changes because tenant protections are oftentimes all that stand between average people and homelessness,\u201d Burbank said. \u201cRents are so high in Los Angeles that oftentimes all it takes is one disaster in your life before you are facing eviction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Burbank, families can now prepare emergency backup plans to avoid living on the streets after eviction. Landlords will also face more responsibility to provide renters with just causes for evictions, rather than sporadic removals. The South Los Angeles Community Plan Implementation Overlay Ordinance said the new protection plan will make rent more affordable and unlawful eviction less likely.\n\nTenants aren\u2019t always notified of these protection plans, though. Maria Pati\u00f1o Gutierrez, the director of policy and research at SAJE \u2013 Strategic Actions for a Just Economy \u2013 said that legal counsel and eviction education is just as important as policy change. Citywide changes must trickle down to local communities. \u201cMore than anything, what\u2019s going to be really important is for organizations like us to be able to inform community members because not everyone knows. Too many people do not know their rights.\u201d\n\nIn the last decade, there have been nearly 500,000 evictions in L.A. county, according to L.A. County superior court records. These figures also indicate that expiring tenant protections implemented at the height of the pandemic dropped yearly evictions to around 13,000 annually.\n\nMar\u00eda Cruz, a South L.A. tenant who lives near USC, said the neighborhood has become dirtier and more dangerous in the past several years. However, moving out is not an option for her \u2013 South L.A. has been her home for 40 years. \u201cI live alone, and I have to pay for everything,\u201d Cruz said. With no one to split the fee with, Cruz said she has to pay $50 per month to have her small amount of trash picked up.\n\nNearly 65% of L.A. households are occupied by renters, while 37% are occupied by owners. A 2022 report by the Los Angeles Homelessness Initiative concluded that L.A. County needs to add nearly 500,000 affordable housing units to meet the demand of renters at or below 50% of the median income in L.A.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a finite amount of land by that amount of space,\u201d said Kenyatta Brazie, a South L.A. tenant just a few blocks from USC. \u201cSometimes when they purchase old properties, tear them down and repurpose them and build new. That kind of displacement does happen.\u201d\n\nWhile the new policy may not decrease the overall rate of homelessness in L.A. \u2013 which stands at nearly 70,000 people according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority \u2013 it could pave the way for additional housing protections in the future. \u201cOne vote won\u2019t be the deciding factor that addresses or fixes homelessness in Los Angeles, but every victory is a step in addressing the problem. It\u2019s an important step,\u201d Burbank said.\n```"}

The private donation from the Los Angeles Police Foundation, a non-profit organization, was approved 4-1, and must now gain approval from the city council itself.\n\nIn their initial grant request on October 27, 2022, the LAPD stated that this technology will increase \u201cofficer safety while at the same time, reducing the likelihood of a violent encounter with armed suspects.\u201d The grant request also stated that fewer violent encounters between police and the community will increase trust between them.\n\nHowever, critics have since raised concerns about the potentially harmful impact of these machines in marginalized communities. \u201cThese [machines] were already rejected in NYC because they were used to aggressively police working-class communities of color,\u2019\u2019 said newly elected councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez in a Twitter thread on Jan. 24. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow this dystopian machine in L.A.\u201d\n\nA singular dog was briefly used in New York City in 2021, prompting concerns from residents about the increased surveillance threat the robot posed. The New York Police Department then terminated its test program lease of their robot in April 2021 following backlash from residents about disproportionate police presence in low-income communities.\n\nThe robot dog is a creation of Boston Dynamics, a manufacturing company that calls their invention \u201cSpot.\u201d The company lists a variety of industries Spot can work in, including manufacturing, construction and entertainment, but its most notable use is in public safety. \u201cSpot is used in public safety applications to keep people out of harm\u2019s way and help first responders assess hazardous situations,\u201d said a Boston Dynamics spokesperson in an emailed statement.\n\nThe statement went on to highlight several examples of police and fire department use of Spot, including rescue operations, suspicious package investigation, and bomb threat detection. This project, which is valued at nearly $300,000, was not budgeted for by the city council but gifted by the Los Angeles Police Foundation \u2014 the largest source of private financial support for the LAPD.\n\nSince the foundation is a private organization, there is no information about the guidelines LAPD would follow if the project is approved. \u201cI think that new equipment, tools, [and] weapons like this should raise question marks about how the agency, in this instance, the LAPD, will put them to use,\u201d Perez added. \u201cAnd I think that means we should be vigilant and members of the community should be vigilant to ensure that the use of this purchase is aligned with the values of the city of Los Angeles and what we want to see from our public safety agencies.\u201d\n\nSome community voices are anxious regarding the use of this technology and are calling against the Public Safety Committee\u2019s decision to vote on these dogs. \u201cI think we understand the Public Safety Committee\u2019s role isn\u2019t to keep us safe,\u201d said Matyos Kidane, a community organizer for the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition. \u201cIf you listened to the Public Safety Committee meeting where they talked about the robot dogs, they only allowed for 40 callers to speak, there were more cued up. 39 of those 40 are opposed to robot dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are animals that we saw used to terrorize...Black people that resisted their own oppression,\u201d said Kidane in reference to the historical significance of K-9 units. K-9 units of police dogs hold ties to Jim Crow-era sheriffs who would use dogs as primary forms of crowd control. In 1991, the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP filed a state court suit against the LAPD for using K-9 dogs with excessive force when deemed unnecessary.\n\nSpot technology could reignite concerns of racial bias depending on their placement. \u201cI would have serious questions about the cost and the benefits here. Whether this is just \u2018toys for boys\u2019 or whether they\u2019re actually gonna be, not only useful but useful in proportion to their cost,\u201d said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of other crying needs that many of our communities have and we don\u2019t want funds diverted from improving communities to super high-tech devices.\u201d\n\nMembers of the community feel that there are better places the local government can focus its attention. \u201cPeople are saying divest from policing, invest in our communities and permanent supportive housing and harm reduction care,\u201d said Kidane. \u201cWe don\u2019t want these robot dogs. It\u2019s incredibly harmful. We don\u2019t want any oversight around them...we just don\u2019t need them at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that any time surveillance exists, this notion of observing somebody, ascribing them of criminality and suspicion, it\u2019s always going to be Black and indigenous people,\u201d said Kidane.\n\nAlthough the Public Safety Committee has approved this project, the L.A.

Once, we threw snowballs at Santa. And, our weapon of choice is called a Philly special \u2013 when you put a battery in the middle of that snowball, so it packs a harder punch. But why? Literally why, are we like this? \n\nLet me break it down for you. \n1. We have mad hometown pride. Because we\u2019re the best! Nah, but seriously, we\u2019re tough. We have great teams. Our mascots are iconic. So we\u2019ll celebrate them any time we can.\n2. Fighting is a love language. Seriously, it\u2019s normal to brawl here. And it\u2019s kind of fun, too.\n3. The city is already full of trash, so... whatever. It\u2019s not our fault the rats have taken over! They\u2019re kind of cute, if you squint your eyes. But for real, there\u2019s so much garbage in the streets at any given time, what\u2019s a little more?\n4. Have you ever climbed a pole? It\u2019s fun! Did you know that the city literally sends people out to grease street poles before a major sports game? Did you know we climb \u2018em anyway? We love a view from the top.\n5. In Philly, we still say hello to each other. So we know our neighbors. This makes it easier to dance in the street with them.\n6. There\u2019s a lot of old homes in Philly, with a lot of lead paint. Apparently, that makes you aggressive. Oops. Not our fault the landlords won\u2019t fix it.\n7. Not to be corny, but the Brotherly Love thing is... kinda true. Philly\u2019s got heart. Philly friends will help you move a body. We love hard, so we can fight hard, so we can party hard.\n\nSo, brace yourselves. The Eagles are going to the Super Bowl, and it\u2019s unclear whether or not the city will survive it.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nJanuary 30, 2023 at 1:02 pm PST\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest men\u2019s college basketball headlines. I began writing this column at approximately 10:30 a.m. PST on Saturday. Since I began writing, there have been seven upsets amongst the Top 25 teams. There is no better representation of this season of college basketball that I can think of than that. This has been one of the wildest seasons to date, with madness occurring far before the month of March.\n\nSo what were the biggest headlines from this week?\n\nWild Big 12-SEC challenge on Saturday\nThe day started off normal, with No. 7 Virginia vanquishing Boston College from Charlottesville. Then, the state of Alabama experienced a rude awakening of real college basketball from the Big 12. I, of course, am referring to West Virginia conquering No. 15 Auburn 80-77 and then Oklahoma putting the Boomer in Boomer Sooner as the Sooners decimated No. 2 Alabama 93-69. It seemed as if the Big 12 was going to steamroll the SEC after the morning slate of games. However, Missouri got revenge for its brothers down south and upset No. 13 Iowa State 78-61. The two conferences went back and forth with heavyweight competitors trading blows, including Mississippi State upsetting No. 11 TCU and No. 17 Baylor narrowly outlasting Arkansas. The battle ended with the headlining matchups of the clash of \u201cgaudy orange\u201d between No. 10 Texas and No. 4 Tennessee where the Volunteers won 82-71 and the battle of Blue Bloods between No. 9 Kansas and Kentucky, where the Jayhawks outlasted the Wildcats 77-68.\n\nTo me, it is clear that these are by far the best two conferences in all of college basketball, and I believe one of the top teams from these conferences will win March Madness. Both conferences are wide open, with some of the top teams from each conference losing games in which they were heavily favored. Realistically, there are about six or seven Big 12 teams who I think could win their conference and about six SEC teams who could win theirs. These teams also are not just playing well because their in-conference opponents are good \u2013 they have played well against the rest of college basketball. If I had to choose right now, I would say Tennessee and Baylor will win their respective conferences, but like I said, it could be any one of them. Don\u2019t be surprised if the Final Four ends up majority SEC or Big 12.\n\nUpsets galore\nThere was an upset five out of the seven days of this past week. I could go in depth on each of the matchups, but that feels redundant as most of them were within Big 12 conference play. The most notable upsets outside of the Big 12-SEC challenge included USC ringing the Victory Bell and taking down No. 8 UCLA, Creighton smacking around a tired No. 13 Xavier and Pitt blowing away the No. 20 Miami Hurricanes. This, however, isn\u2019t the first time there has been this much craziness this year. Two weekends ago there was a period of 24 hours where there were 14 Top-25 losses. Fourteen. So why can\u2019t the Top 25 stay consistent? I think the simplest answer to this question is there has never been a more competitive field in college basketball. With the transfer portal being the deepest it has ever been, there is talent being spread across the country. Seeing top 10 teams drop this year just seems to be a regular occurrence. As someone who has been pushing the narrative that UCLA was overrated, the Trojans\u2019 win on Thursday came as no surprise. However, watching teams in the Big 12 and Big East fight for supremacy within their respective conferences the way they have been is something we have never seen before. Usually, both the Big East and Big 12 are dominated by the blue bloods \u2014 Kansas and Villanova \u2014 but neither team is in prime position to win their conference as of right now.\n\nAll I know is that with six weeks left before conference tournaments start, the race to stay in the Top 25 is heating up and I expect upwards of 10 upsets to happen within the next two weeks. Nobody is safe. The one thing that we can all agree on is that the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee will have its hands full when Selection Sunday comes around on March 12.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

Ana L\u00f3pez, Aramark janitor, entrepreneur, intellectual, and caregiver. (Photo by Natalia Osuna)\n\nBy Natalia Osuna January 30, 2023 at 1:02 pm PST\n\nA family business, a janitorial position, raising her grandchildren, two degrees in public speaking and thanatology, and a working book. On top of that, she also does Zumba every day. Is there anything that Ana can\u2019t do? I asked myself this question after I spent a day with her to learn how she balances these various facets of her life, and what lies behind her Aramark uniform that most don\u2019t see past.\n\nBorn in Guadalajara, Jalisco, M\u00e9xico, Ana Silvia L\u00f3pez was raised in the Tlaquepaque area, a suburb of Guadalajara and one of Mexico\u2019s beautiful pueblos m\u00e1gicos or \u201cmagical towns,\u201d primarily known for its pottery, art galleries, and craftsmanship. Pregnant with her first daughter, in 1987, L\u00f3pez immigrated to the U.S. along with her ex-husband. The couple then settled in San Antonio, TX, where L\u00f3pez began working various jobs, first at the Family Dollar, and then as a waitress at different Mexican restaurants. Afterward, she and her family moved to California, where she worked at the Holiday Inn Hotel, and suffered from a terrible accident that caused her to go through physical rehab for the following eight years.\n\nThat physical rehabilitation led to a vocational one, and pushed her to study decorative arts and open a party supply business, which she still runs with her family today. In 2014, L\u00f3pez began working as a janitor for Aramark at USC. When interviewed, she described that being surrounded by students every day motivated her to complete an associate\u2019s degree in public speaking, and then get a second one in thanatology\u2013\u2013the study of loss, and the social and psychological factors that come with grief. After she concludes her second degree, she is planning on taking a webinar to begin writing a book about her life, experiences, and the loss of her daughter.\n\nShe explained that, although they seem very different, public speaking and thanatology go hand-in-hand as the former helps one navigate how to best communicate directly and concretely with people who have suffered a loss, to then guide and advise them with the latter. One of L\u00f3pez\u2019s greatest driving forces is her love for her grandchildren, two young boys who are under her care. \u201cMy life goal is to view things in a positive light as I have to set an example for my two grandchildren who look up to me,\u201d L\u00f3pez expressed teary-eyed. \u201cIn the future, I want my grandchildren to be able to ask themselves \u2018what did my grandma leave us with?\u2019 and see this great work which will push them to continue their studies, and say \u2018yes\u2019 to life.\u201d\n\nTo balance all facets of her life, L\u00f3pez described that it takes a lot of communication, organization, and support from her husband and family. Every day, she wakes up at 6 a.m. At 7:30 a.m., she leaves the kids at school. From 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., she goes to daily Zumba classes. Then, she returns home and cleans the house so that it is ready for when her grandchildren arrive from school. Afterward, she goes to work at USC from 12 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. After, she ends the day with a family dinner at home.\n\n\u201cI think empathy is a life tool that we all must have to help others, and help ourselves move forward too.\u201d Every day, L\u00f3pez and Maria Batres, another USC janitor and one of L\u00f3pez\u2019s closest friends, eat lunch on the steps of the USC Bookstore. \u201cAna is a great co-worker, friend, and person overall. Even though she is from Mexico and I\u2019m from El Salvador, we get along very well,\u201d Batres fondly said. \u201cI have come to care a lot for Ana, and her entire family.\u201d\n\nBoth share their lunch with each other, talk, and take a breather during their 30-minute break before getting back to work. Tom Norris, Media Supervisor at USC\u2019s Annenberg Media Center, similarly shared his admiration for L\u00f3pez. \u201cEvery time I see Ana, she always has a big smile on her face. She helps me practice my Spanish with her, and I help her practice her English. I try to take time to say hi and she always says hi back, and I encourage others to do the same,\u201d Norris said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hard worker and a really nice lady. She\u2019s worked here for a while, and everybody here [at Annenberg] loves her.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez\u2019s empathy touches all of those who she encounters. \u201cWhen I drive by a graveyard, all I can think to myself is \u2018I hope that all of these people died fulfilled and made their dreams come true.\u201d After asking her what life advice she would give to others, L\u00f3pez explained that she finds it essential to surround herself with good people and live life to the fullest as once we leave this Earth, we will only carry our experiences and who we were as human beings.\n\n\u201cI would say that the best thing to do is to live with an open mind, an open heart, and have faith.\u201d Ana performing an act of kindness as she feeds a squirrel a piece of her lunch while saying that they're \"friendly and harmless\" creatures.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Ethan Shih)\n\nBy Ethan Huang January 30, 2023 at 11:04 am PST\n\nAfter nearly three years of heavy restrictions in light of the COVID-19, several countries, notably in Asia, opened their borders to travel and tourism during the holiday season. While some places began easing regulations as early as October 2022, with countries like Japan even opting to free tourism, Taiwan officially began reducing its general COVID guidelines such as mask mandates at the start of December.\n\nAs travel to Asia becomes the freest it has been since before the pandemic, many students took the opportunity to vacation abroad during their winter break, but for some, the post-pandemic experience was not exactly what they expected.\n\nEthan Shih is a first year student at the University of California, San Diego studying interdisciplinary computing and the arts. He returned to Taiwan with his family for the first time since his freshman year in high school. Upon arrival in the Longtan District, Shih said that he was struck by how prominent masking was in the city.\n\n\u201cIn America, masking is not mandatory, not as prevalent, but in Taiwan \u2014 it\u2019s like everywhere you go, even the car,\u201d Shih said. \u201cThe only time you can really take off your mask is when you\u2019re in your home, and that\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t have any guests around.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is not because of any official mandates, as many of those requirements had been lifted weeks ahead of Shih\u2019s visit. Rather, he believes that it has more to do with culture.\n\n\u201cBecause of how Taiwanese people are, we kind of just prefer to have it in order to keep us safe,\u201d Shih said. \u201cAfter all, [a large number of people] in Taiwan, at least I believe, are mainly elderly, and they try to do their best to not get sick.\u201d\n\nFor Shih, this was largely a positive experience, as it allowed him to feel a bit safer while traveling throughout the island.\n\n\u201cHalf the time when you\u2019re traveling Taiwan, you\u2019re basically walking and all the time on the street, you hear people coughing or like there\u2019s just like some sort of symptom that could be possible sickness,\u201d Shih said. \u201cBecause of the masking, you just feel a bit more safe because the person next to you or in front of you or behind me may be coughing, and I\u2019m like \u2018Well, thank God he\u2019s wearing a mask, thank God I\u2019m wearing a mask.\u2019\u201d\n\nOthers report similar experiences elsewhere in Asia. Ellie Aguirre is a second year student in the World Bachelor in Business program and is currently studying in Hong Kong. During her break, she traveled across Asia, visiting Dubai, India, Thailand, Singapore and Thailand, and laying over in Taiwan before going home to San Francisco ahead of her return to Hong Kong.\n\nAguirre explained while she was in Vietnam, the streets looked similar to that in Taiwan.\n\n\u201cA lot of people did wear masks in Vietnam,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t mandated, but everyone wore one there.\u201d\n\nBut she stayed vigilant when choosing where to travel.\n\n\u201cWhen I was going was when India was increasing in COVID; it was getting really, really bad,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cSo I was scared of going there if I\u2019d catch it when I was there because then I couldn\u2019t continue [my travels].\u201d\n\nThat said, both Shih and Aguirre found the biggest adjustment actually came when they returned to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI was actually totally ready to continue doing the mask thing,\u201d Shih said. \u201cBut then the moment I came back to America actually was what made me feel weird, because even though I don\u2019t have a habit of putting on a mask in America, when I came back I found myself looking for a mask.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was definitely weird,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cFor the first time when I landed, it was weird seeing the Border Patrol not caring because usually I thought they would be more strict about themselves because they\u2019re having so much travel, but just going around here, I honestly haven\u2019t seen COVID at all, because at least in foreign countries, there are signs that say like, \u2018Stay apart,\u2019 or like, \u2018Keep your distance.\u2019\u201d\n\nAguirre feels lifting these restrictions is a positive step towards moving out of the pandemic. With businesses returning to Hong Kong, she believes this can help bolster tourism.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s for the better that those are lifted so more people can travel,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cThere were no tourists when I got [to Hong Kong] and now there\u2019s a lot more ... and also, the locals are really tired. I\u2019ve talked to a lot of locals. They\u2019re just done with the masking and everything.\u201d\n\nShih, on the other hand, feels that having some limited restrictions may be beneficial, even while borders are opening for travel.\n\n\u201cI think it is smart to have COVID precautions in place ... the two weeks quarantine precaution, making sure you have no symptoms before you actually enter the country for both ways so that you can make sure that you don\u2019t accidentally make your loved ones sick or just random strangers overall,\u201d Shih said.\n\nEven with their varying levels of concern, both Shih and Aguirre hope to travel again in the near future.\n\n\u201cI know Macau just opened up, which is across the border, and I think I might take a bus there ... and if [mainland] China ever opens up or is less strict with letting people leave, then that would be really cool,\u201d Aguirre said.\n\n\u201cI really want to travel to Japan or Korea to be a tourist there and just check out the culture, check out the place, check out the food ... and I would love to go back to Taiwan again and visit,\u201d Shih said.\n\nFor better or for worse, a majority of countries in Asia are reopening after years of isolation, which means tourism is back and intrepid travelers can finally get out ... literally.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel January 29, 2023 at 6:28 pm PST\n\nUSC women\u2019s basketball was able to pick up its first ranked win since it downed No. 2 Stanford with a 71-54 victory over Colorado Sunday morning. The Trojans allowed a season-high 83 points to Utah in a tough loss Friday. After the win Sunday, head coach Lindsay Gottlieb emphasized the Trojans\u2019 focus entering the matchup with Colorado was \u201cdefense in general ... knowing that\u2019s our calling card, going back to our identity and making it a priority to get stops.\u201d\n\nThe Pac-12\u2032s top scoring defense bounced back by holding the Buffs to just 54 points on 40% shooting from the field. It was the 17th game this season USC has been able to keep its opponent under the 60-point mark.\n\nUSC was led by a three-headed monster on offense, with graduate forward Kadi Sissoko scoring 18, sophomore forward Rayah Marshall scoring 19 and graduate guard Destiny Littleton leading her team with 21 points on just six made field goals. Marshall and Sissoko also had double-doubles on the day, with 10 and 12 rebounds, respectively.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we could potentially score inside on them,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI thought Kadi and Rayah both delivered on what we feel like the identity of the team can be: to score inside and make threes.\u201d\n\nColorado started out fast, leading 9-4 midway through the first quarter. After a USC timeout, the Trojans finished the period with a 10-0 run to take a 14-9 lead. The game stayed close until halftime, with USC ahead 26-22 at the break.\n\nThe Trojans broke away in the third quarter, matching their combined score from the first half and outscoring the Buffs 26-19. The key to USC\u2019s strong third quarter was how it started. Colorado missed their first two shots from the field and allowed the Trojans to go on a 9-1 run in the first two minutes after halftime.\n\nUSC entered the final period with an 11-point lead and used a pair of and-1 three-point plays from Marshall and Sissoko to grow their advantage to 17 points. From then on, the Trojans utilized a combination of scoring and another nearly three-minute drought from the Buffs to hold their lead until the final buzzer.\n\nThe key for the Trojans was their efficiency from beyond the arc. USC and Colorado shot similarly from the field as a whole \u2014 45% and 40% \u2014 but the Trojans were able to score 27 of their points from three compared to just nine from the Buffs. The No. 1-ranked three-point defense in the Pac-12 proved worthy of the title, forcing Colorado to shoot just 20% from deep.\n\nAnother difference maker was at the free-throw line, where the Trojans improved upon their season-average of 70%. USC knocked down 10 of 12 free throws, while Colorado had a shaky day at the charity stripe, only managing to make 5 of 13.\n\nThe win over Colorado is an important victory for USC after having several ranked wins elude them this season, most notably two losses to crosstown rival UCLA by a combined four points. With their current position on the bubble of the NCAA tournament, USC will need to add more to its resume to finish out the season and secure their spot in March Madness.\n\nThe Trojans will have a prime chance to build their tournament case this coming weekend when they return home and welcome No. 19 Arizona to Galen Center on Feb. 5. First up though, USC must defend its home court against Arizona State at 7 p.m. Friday.\n```"}

Eleven victims were killed inside a Monterey Park dance studio on Saturday and seven others were killed on a farm at Half Moon Bay on Monday. Students, faculty, and alumni gathered to mourn yet another mass shooting attack. The Monterey Park incident is Los Angeles County\u2019s deadliest case of mass shooting in its history. These devastating attacks leave the communities of Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay shattered and in mourning.\n\nKatherine Chan Guevara, Monterey Park native and program specialist at Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, shared her experience mourning the incident over the last few days. \u201cI am a mother who is raising my child in Monterey Park,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a Monterey Park native. It hurts my heart to see such a welcoming and diverse community devastated by the tragedy that unfolded last weekend.\u201d \u201cIn the recent period we\u2019ve been called to protect our elders ... now 11 of our elders are dead and nine more are hospitalized,\u201d she said.\n\nThese attacks are especially devastating due to the timing right before the Lunar New Year celebration, traditionally a time of reunion and family gatherings. Monterey Park is historically known as a tight-knit community for Asian American immigrants, so this attack is disheartening towards the victims and their families. Happening within 72 hours of the Monterey Park shooting, another shooting occurred on a farm in Half Moon Bay in Northern California, killing seven people as a result.\n\nWith the tragedies that unfolded last week, these incidents revive discussion for the increased regulation of gun control laws in the United States. Of the 58 mass shootings in the US that happened this past month, seven of them occurred in California. These shootings further reveal that mass shootings are happening across the country at an alarming rate, and revive discussion on tighter gun reform laws in the United States. Guevara expresses her hope to overcome this tragedy as a community. \u201cMy neighbors and I refuse this tragedy to define us ... Monterey Park is a place of comfort, peace and, most importantly, community.\u201d\n```"}

Instead, 9,605 people witnessed them leave with a Trojan farewell and a defeat. USC senior guard and captain Boogie Ellis poured in a career-high 31 points, 6 assists, and 4 rebounds as the USC men\u2019s basketball team sent the Bruins back to Westwood with a 77-64 loss.\n\nThe intensity between the two schools is no secret as the two teams compete throughout the year, and with each encounter, the tension between the schools builds more intensely than the last. The SoCal sports icons have a combative history dating back to the 1940s. The rivalry began as a simple allegiance to each respected school but quickly escalated to planning pranks to commit to each other\u2019s respective campuses. Over the years, supporters stole pet mascots, splattered paint on revered campus statues and even caught pranksters in the act to capture and send a message back to the other school. Therefore, whenever the Trojans face the Bruins, it is an all-out war between the two Los Angeles schools.\n\nUSC men's basketball head coach Andy Enfield orchestrated a second-half comeback against No. 8 UCLA that puts the Trojans right in the middle of the NCAA Tournament conversation. (Photo by Colin Huang)\n\nThree weeks ago, the UCLA men\u2019s basketball team squeezed out a tightly contested win against USC, winning 60-58. However, the heartbreaking loss only fueled the fire inside the Trojans. In their second match, the men of Troy claimed revenge by doing what they do best \u2014 fighting on.\n\n\u201cEvery single Boogie shot was electric,\u201d USC junior Holden Raffin said. \u201cBoogie didn\u2019t even have the best start but then put the team up on his shoulders so he had the fight on spirit.\u201d\n\nFifth-year guard and captain Drew Peterson rounded out the game with 16 points. Although they trailed at halftime 37-25, USC\u2019s defense remained relentless against the Bruins, resulting in 13 second-half UCLA turnovers. Although the team is unranked, many pundits and prognosticators picked UCLA to win.\n\n\u201cEveryone was going in thinking USC wouldn\u2019t win being unranked, I was in the student section so people were storming the court being [that it was] a big win.\u201d USC sophomore Aleena Amran said. \u201cThe first half UCLA was leading, so the second half was a turning moment and everyone saw it.\u201d\n\nFollowing last night\u2019s win over the Bruins, the Trojan spirit is at an all-time high. Suppose USC can ride the euphoria of this win and parlay that into another victory next weekend against Washington State on Feb. 2. In that case, it may give the selection committee the fodder needed to put the men of Troy into the national championship tournament.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Will Simonds January 27, 2023 at 9:34 pm PST\n\nOn paper, Friday night\u2019s contest in Salt Lake City seemed to involve one of the most intriguing matchups of the Pac-12 women\u2019s basketball season. The Utah offense leads the Pac-12 in offensive efficiency and field goal percentage; the USC defense leads the conference in defensive efficiency and points per game allowed. But in basketball, elite offense usually beats elite defense.\n\nThe No. 9 Utes proved that Friday night, riding an offensive explosion in the first half to beat the Trojans 83-73. For USC, it was a familiar face that caused issues for the Trojans\u2019 stout defense. Junior forward Alissa Pili spent three seasons in Los Angeles, including her Pac-12 Freshman of the Year campaign in 2019-20, before transferring to Utah this past offseason. She easily got the best of her former school with 21 points, five rebounds and four assists.\n\nWith their elite defense, the Trojans typically are at their best when they can muddy games up, as they did to upset Stanford a couple weeks ago. However, Utah plays at one of the fastest paces in the nation, and the Utes continued to play at that high tempo against the Trojans. USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb tried to slow down Utah with a press, but it didn\u2019t do much to disrupt the Utes\u2019 offensive rhythm, who built a nine-point lead after a quarter.\n\nIt got even worse for the Trojans in the second quarter, when Utah shot 11-for-16 from the field to complete a 49-point first half. For context, USC has allowed less than 49 points in a game seven times this season, and its scoring defense that surrenders an average of only 51.4 points per game ranked No. 5 in the nation entering Friday. Utah particularly dominated USC on the interior, winning the first-half points in the paint battle 32-12. Pili made it look especially easy on offense with a 17-point first half on 8-of-9 shooting from the field.\n\nThe Trojan offense remained somewhat stagnant, as it has for much of the season. Despite getting solid looks and taking good care of the ball, shots simply didn\u2019t fall enough for USC to keep up with the high-powered Utes. No Trojans had more than seven points before halftime in a game when they needed someone to really show out offensively.\n\nGottlieb said she spent the whole halftime trying to make defensive adjustments, knowing her team couldn\u2019t keep up with Utah in a shootout. USC did improve defensively in the second half, holding the Utes to just 40% shooting from the field. But the Trojans\u2019 offense still had to make significant improvements to match the Utes\u2019 incessant pace.\n\nSophomore guard Rayah Marshall was a perfect 4-for-4 in the third quarter, along with five rebounds. That helped keep USC in the game, albeit barely, as it still trailed 69-56 after three quarters. Marshall finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds \u2014 her tenth double-double of the season \u2014 and recorded two more blocks and a steal.\n\nSophomore center Clarice Akunwafo also had one of her strongest games as a Trojan, with a career-high 11 points and getting to the line 10 times. Interestingly, against a speedy Utah team, Gottlieb\u2019s most successful lineup was one of the biggest she\u2019s shown this season \u2014 just two guards along with Marshall, Akunwafo and another forward in graduate Kadi Sissoko.\n\nUSC remained within striking defense in the fourth quarter, as its defense continued to improve as the game went on. Consecutive 3-pointers by graduate guards Okako Adika and Destiny Littleton cut the Utah lead to as little as six in the final period. Akunwafo nearly further cut the lead to four with a little over two minutes remaining, but she barely failed to get a putback layup off before the shot clock buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Trojans were unable to get any closer though, as a 3-pointer by sophomore guard Kennady McQueen, her fifth of the game, put the Utes back up by 10 with under a minute left. Still, it was an impressive second-half resurgence by USC to make a top-10 ranked Utah team sweat a little bit.\n\nUSC now heads east across the Rockies to Boulder, where it will look to avoid a weekend sweep against No. 25 Colorado on Sunday at 11 a.m. Currently positioned right on the NCAA Tournament bubble, another ranked win for the Trojans would go a long way to asserting their place in March Madness.\n```"}

(Photo by Colin Huang)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade January 27, 2023 at 7:13 pm PST\n\nUSC was down by 12 at halftime against No. 8 UCLA. It didn\u2019t matter. USC lost by 13 points in its first game of the season to Florida Gulf Coast \u2014 a team that has a losing record in the ASUN. It didn\u2019t matter. Andy Enfield has created something out of nothing. In a remarkable turn of events, the head coach of the Trojans has reversed USC\u2019s course from irrelevance to nearly a lock for the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThere have been flashes of what this team can do all season, but the Trojans are peaking at just the right time. Back in December, USC knocked off now-No. 15 Auburn at Galen Center. It was a win that felt like more of a fluke than anything else, but it\u2019s a formula the Trojans have now used twice against UCLA. And USC nearly came out on top both times.\n\nThe common denominator? Each of these three games started with USC down at halftime. Then, USC did two things: tightened its defense and limited crucial turnovers. Auburn had nine turnovers against USC in the first half. The Tigers had 14 in the second period. UCLA had three and five turnovers in the first half against USC in both of their contests. Then, the Bruins had five and eight turnovers in the second half.\n\nOn the offensive end, USC wasn\u2019t perfect in the second half by any means. But the Trojans managed to reduce the impact of their mistakes. Auburn had 14 points off turnovers in the first half, and then just four after the break. UCLA had 10 in the first half and then just one in the second half during the teams\u2019 first meeting. On Thursday, UCLA had 12 points off turnovers in the first half and only two after halftime.\n\nThese are coaching adjustments Enfield made in the locker room. A team that looked as if it was going to roll over and lose in blowout fashion rose from the ashes to make a game of each of these contests. Performances like senior guard Boogie Ellis\u2019 27-point second half will be the story for the night and deservedly so. But when these comebacks appear to be so regular for this team, it\u2019s hard not to give a lot of the credit to the coach behind everything.\n\nEnfield gets criticized often for how his team performs in the waning minutes, and that feels justified as well. Arizona State\u2019s 16-0 run in the final 4:35 of Saturday\u2019s matchup is all the evidence needed to demonstrate that Enfield still has quite a bit of work to do. But for once this season, let\u2019s put everything into perspective and praise Enfield for how he molded an NCAA Tournament-caliber team out of a roster that was struggling against FGCU and Vermont at the beginning of the year.\n\nFrom that very first loss, everyone was ready to put this season in the trash and hope the signing of No. 1 overall prospect Isaiah Collier could get this program back on track next season \u2014 myself included. But this team has more than just signs of life. This team has a pulse and an identity.\n\nEnfield had the luxury of a dominant start last year, primarily due to the tenacity of Isaiah Mobley. But what Enfield proved this season is he doesn\u2019t need to rely on a star player or a strong start to get his team to where he wants them to be. College basketball media personality Jon Rothstein always says, \u201cHis name is Dana Altman. And he aligns Rubik\u2019s Cubes.\u201d Well, actually, his name is Andy Enfield. And he does just that.\n```"}

(Photo by Rick Scuteri/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Claire Sures, Jack Waterman, Marco Ramirez, Mia Thompson, Siara Carpenter, Samuel Spitz, and Jack Noveck Holmes\nJanuary 27, 2023 at 6:54 pm PST\n\nOn Tuesday, the entertainment company Live Nation appeared at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and were questioned regarding their merger with Ticketmaster back in 2010. The issue? Their unrivaled market power. Following the 2010 merger, government officials are worried about the company being what Sen. Josh Hawley (Republican of Missouri) described as a \u201cmonopoly\u201d in the live entertainment industry.\n\nTicketmaster and Live Nation each had great success in the music and entertainment industry, but the merger may have eliminated any competition \u2014 and even hurt consumers. The merger happened over a decade ago, which begs the question: why sue now? Well, the catalyst could be superstar singer-songwriter, Taylor Swift.\n\nBack in November of 2022, Swift released tickets to her new Eras tour and the world exploded. Countless people flooded Ticketmaster, trying to get their hands on those tickets. Unfortunately, many Swifties were left disappointed as crashes and other issues disrupted the online system.\n\nAmanda Sanchez, a member of the USC Concert Committee and promoter for house shows, said, \u201cThese companies are making it so that artists are shutting their fans out. If you don\u2019t have less dynamic or cheaper options, they\u2019re just going to lose their fanbase.\u201d Sanchez also noted that as a promoter, she feels remorse for the college-aged audience who have to pay the additional Ticketmaster fee for shows.\n\nAt the hearing, Live Nation president and chief financial officer Joe Bertchold, told the committee that much of the trouble fans encountered came from bots and automated programs run by scalpers. Many senators didn\u2019t buy it. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican senator from Tennessee, questioned why the billion-dollar company hadn\u2019t \u201cdeveloped an algorithm to sort out what is a bot and what is a consumer.\u201d\n\nDespite the Eras tour fiasco, Taylor Swift is not the only reason the hearing is being held. The fear of two companies monopolizing an entire industry is the paramount reason. Swift\u2019s lyrics added a hint of ingenuity to some Senators\u2019 arguments. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, emphasized that the importance of competition is something the country knows \u201cAll Too Well,\u2019\u2019 the title of a Swift song. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, quoting Swift\u2019s recent hit \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d said, \u201cmay I suggest, respectfully, that Ticketmaster ought to look in the mirror and say, \u2018I\u2019m the problem. It\u2019s me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile many public figures are upset over Ticketmaster and LiveNation\u2019s monopoly, it is the die-hard fans receiving the short end of the stick. Many fans complained about hours-long wait times, extreme markups on tickets, and a genuine disappointment in the purchasing process.\n\nEmerson College student Ella Weston got a ticket but in a second round of individual releases. Weston stated, \u201cI got a verified fan boost and the person I was going with had a Capital One credit card\u201d. This gave her a queue advantage over other buyers. Despite getting on the website 30 minutes early and waiting in the queue for 10 minutes, she was notified via Twitter that the website had crashed. When she got back on the \u201cfixed website\u201d she waited for an additional hour and a half before seeing that every ticket was sold out. Eventually, Weston received an email with a special link and price range for Taylor Swift tickets. \u201cThe next morning they sent me my tickets, which I got really lucky. I got the floor row, like four or five. So I got really, really lucky.\u201d Weston paid $400 for her coveted seats. Those same seats retailed for $2,600 after bots purchased most of the area.\n\nBack in November, Swift responded to the situation on her Instagram. She expressed empathy to her fans that weren\u2019t so lucky. \u201cAnd to those who didn\u2019t get tickets, all I can say is that my hope is to provide more opportunities for us to all get together and sing these songs.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misspelled Ella Weston\u2019s name as Elle Weston and referred to her as a USC student.\n```"}

Proceed with caution.\n\nThe Memphis Police Department released body camera footage from the beating of Tyre Nichols today at 6 p.m. Central Time, three weeks after Nichols\u2019 death. On the night of Jan. 7, five Memphis police officers from the SCORPION (Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods) Unit stopped 29-year-old father, FedEx employee and skateboarder Tyre Nichols on suspicion of reckless driving. Three days later, Nichols was pronounced dead due to injuries he sustained during a \u201cuse-of-force incident with officers,\u201d according to a statement from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.\n\nTyre Nichols is remembered by friends and family as a \u201cfree spirit.\u201d Nichols was an avid skateboarder, deeply invested in California skate culture, his home state. His mother, RowVaughn Wells, told the press at a conference this morning how Nichols loved sunsets. \u201cHe liked to watch the sunset and take pictures\u2014 that was his thing,\u201d Wells said. \u201cHe loved photography, he loved skateboarding, he was his own person. My son was a beautiful soul, he was a good boy. Nobody is perfect, but he was close.\u201d\n\nUntil today, what exactly occurred on the night of the assault was unclear, the only information given were that there were several altercations, tasers, pepper spray and restraining involved. The five officers involved in the several-minute long beating of Nichols were fired by the Memphis Police Department on Jan. 20 after an internal investigation was conducted. All that the country knew was that, in the words of Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, \u201cI expect our citizens to exercise their First Amendment right to protest, to demand action and results.\u201d\n\nIn the four body cam clips and surveillance footage released, officers are filmed pulling Nichols out of his vehicle and slamming him to the ground. After a failed attempt at tasing Nichols, he then ran from the officers, with backup officers proceeding after him. After a half-mile run, officers caught up to him. Nichols was then kicked repeatedly in his head, had his face yanked up so that pepper spray could hit him directly in his eyes and nose, then pulled to his feet and slapped across the face by an officer. Nichols screamed for his mother multiple times throughout the beating. One body cam was seemingly removed for the beating, but the unblocked footage shows Nichols lying on the ground and convulsing as Memphis officers milled about, laughing and comparing their own injuries. \u201cHe on something,\u201d one officer claimed. \u201cHe\u2019s high,\u201d said another as others on the scene began to ask a disoriented Nichols, who couldn\u2019t even keep his body upright against the vehicle the officers dragged him to \u201csit up.\u201d\n\nLeading up to the release of the video, Nichols\u2019 stepfather Rodney Wells implored the public to remain peaceful in all protests arising from the video\u2019s release. \u201cWe want peace,\u201d Mr. Wells said. \u201cWe need to do this peacefully.\u201d Earlier today, Leimert Park hosted Lora Dene King, the daughter of Rodney King, spoke. The Wells\u2019 family attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci compared the MPD\u2019s attack to the beating of King from 1991.\n\nThis evening, in the wake of the \u201cheinous\u201d footage being released to the public, the community has gathered in Leimert Park in protest. The Los Angeles Police Department released a statement regarding the protests, in the statement, they said they would be \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d the situation and would ensure that the lawful demonstrations are protected. In downtown L.A, as the video was released, LAPD began to stage preparations for the protests according to an Instagram video by Correctional Health Services Los Angeles which are set to be large in scale and in outcry for the end of police violence in the United States.\n\nThis story is ongoing.\n```"}

The collected data will help determine the distribution of funding for temporary and permanent housing, as well as unhoused services, including substance abuse prevention and mental health programs. Populations in South L.A., Downtown L.A., and Antelope Valley were all counted on Thursday night after coordination by the L.A. Homeless Service Authority (LAHSA). On Wednesday, residents scoured West and East L.A., and on Tuesday, both the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, the number of unhoused individuals rose by 4.1% to approximately 69,144 people across L.A. County. Of that population, 41,980 are estimated to call L.A. city home, an increase of 1.7%. Due to COVID-19, the city did not conduct a count in 2021.\n\nThose participating were instructed to enter data into a mobile app and manually in some areas on paper backups. Volunteers estimated the number of people by counting cars, tents, and other makeshift installations. \u201cA better word would be estimate,\u201d said Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission Los Angeles. \u201cAnd it\u2019s true that people drive around town and if they see a tent, they say one person lives in there. They don\u2019t have time to go look inside the tent, nor could they rightly even go look inside the tent.\u201d\n\nData from the count will not be made fully available for several months. Bales also stressed the importance and severity of the homeless issue here in Los Angeles. Since the Great Depression, the city of Los Angeles has continued to host the largest unhoused population in the country. \u201cWe have more people suffering from street homelessness than any other city, any other metropolis in the history of the United States,\u201d Bales said. \u201cIn fact, no other city comes within a 10th of the number of people that we have on the streets.\u201d\n\nBales expects the population to increase yet again. \u201cA recent study by the RAND Corporation suggested that the count could be up as much as 18.5% or even 20%,\u201d Bales said.\n\nThe count sits on the heels of last year\u2019s intensive city mayoral race where the crisis remained a decisive issue. In her first act as mayor last month, Bass declared a state of emergency on homelessness. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018well, what can I do?\u2019 Well, this is an example of what you can do,\u201d Bass said during a press conference last Monday.\n\nNewly appointed LAHSA CEO, Va Lecia Adams Kellum, also called for civic involvement. Formerly the CEO of the St. Joseph Center in Venice, she was also a part of Bass\u2019s mayoral transition team. \u201cTogether, we will transform LAHSA into an instrument of systemic change and a model for addressing homelessness on our streets,\u201d Kellum said in a statement last week. \u201cEach of us knows the time is now for action.\u201d\n```"}

Wallis Annenberg Hall, which houses the school for communication and journalism, briefly lost power at 9:45 p.m. after their primary power generator was abruptly stopped. The primary power malfunction forced the building to resort to an emergency back-up generator through 11 p.m.\n\nIn an email, the Marketing Communications team informed faculty of the outage, clarifying that Wallis Annenberg Hall was not the sole building on campus affected by the malfunction.

And this was the first time I could ever recall the lights going out.\u201d\n\nAfter the sudden outage, the back-up generators started producing electricity about 20 seconds later and restored power throughout the building.

I think the events of the week prior had me on edge. The room got so quiet you could hear a pin drop,\u201d said sophomore journalism major Dana Hammerstrom. \u201cWalking out of the building was silent too \u2014 everyone seemed super wary of what was happening, and I could see people in the media center scrambling.\u201d\n\nThe power was restored Thursday night, and Annenberg resumed its normal operations for Friday classes and events.\n```"}

Ra Oblivion\u2019s outfits change; her hair may be two-toned, blunt cut, put up into geometric buns or blown out like the best beauty queens. But the heels remain high, the corset stays cinched and the confidence never wavers. She has the makings of a monolithic performer, and she doesn\u2019t exist. At least, not without sophomore Saneel Sharma.\n\nWhen Sharma first thought he saw drag, it was as the butt of a joke. On the \u201cKapil Sharma Show,\u201d actor Krushna Abhishek donned a chestnut wig, bright red lipstick and an apron and became Sapna Sharma, a gross caricature of a woman existing solely for ridicule. Sharma said he remembered the character as \u201cditzy and clumsy and stupid.\u201d Abhishek announced his departure in August of this year, but his depiction of women, and \u201cdrag,\u201d sticks with Sharma.\n\nSharma only began to understand drag as a modern art form in his Hayward, California high school art classroom, bedecked with large posters of queens and home to a teacher that allowed him to explore drag free of judgment. From there, Sharma took to practicing his new passion in and out of the classroom, taping his bedroom door shut in his conservative household and practicing new looks alongside queens in Youtube tutorials for hours. Quickly falling in love with the transformative power of powder and gloss, he arrived at school two hours early, despite his countless sleepless nights in between, to don his developing drag persona.\n\n\u201cI actually went in drag my first third day of junior year,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cTeachers were like, \u2018What the fuck are you doing?\u2019 And then some of the teachers are supporting it. Because I couldn\u2019t do it at home, I was trying to find other spaces to practice my drag.\u201d\n\nOnce Sharma moved to Los Angeles to attend the University of Southern California, he says his drag career began to really take shape. The annual drag show put on by USC\u2019s Queer and Ally Student Assembly, the subsequent Pride Fest, and the monthly Queer Asian/Pacific Islander Drag Party hosted by entertainment service Send Noodz are just some of the gigs he has performed in as recently as December 2, 2022. Participating in AAPI drag showcases was especially important to Sharma, who treasures his Indian identity and the representation of the community through drag.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met many other queer, specifically, many other gay Indian people, and they\u2019ve come up to me and they\u2019ve just appreciated how confident I am in my work,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cAnd I want to show that you can be as confident as this too. You can start doing drag too, because many of us Indian kids, we don\u2019t see ourselves being hyper-feminine. We don\u2019t see ourselves expressing our femininity.\u201d\n\nThough trying to find 18+ venues to perform at, since Sharma\u2019s not yet 21, balancing school and drag and handling the overall cost and personal toll that it takes can be difficult, he says the feeling of donning drag and showcasing his art remains unmatched.\n\n\u201cThe drive just comes from me wanting to see myself in drag and how confident or just how amazing I feel in drag and how I feel, a lot of queens say this, but how invincible,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cDrag is almost like an armor. It almost becomes like you have this like presence to you. And we walk into a room all like eyes stare at you and you just have a control over a space and all this power just that I don\u2019t feel out of a drag.\u201d\n\nThough Sharma\u2019s drag is ever-evolving, some of his greatest inspirations come from the popular drag competition series, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Priyanka, the series\u2019s first-ever Indian winner, and Raja, the only Asian-American queen to win the show so far, are some of his biggest inspirations. Their representation even inspired him to envision a drag club for those of all identities to appreciate and find community in the art form.\n\nWhile the legacy of drag stretches back arguably to the 16th and 17th centuries when men would don feminine regalia and perform as women in theater, RPDR has inspired a whole new generation of drag queens, kings and even enthusiasts from its inception in 2009. Now entering its 15th North American season, RPDR has come a long way from the modest runway, and by today\u2019s comparison, the prize money, of its first episodes. While the winner of season one walked away with $20,000, the pot more than quadrupled to $100,000 by season four. Season 14 made history as the first regular season to not only give the winner $150,000 but the runner-up $50,000 as well.\n\nThe awe over the swollen check of season 14 didn\u2019t last long. The seventh season of RPDR All Stars made waves as the first all-star season to feature only winners of previous seasons. The prize money, of course, reflected this, with winner Jinx Monsoon walking away with $200,000 and the title of \u201cQueen of all Queens.\u201d\n\nThe reach of the series stretched just as fast. Over 13 years, RPDR has expanded to include franchises in Thailand, the UK, Canada, Holland, Australia, Spain, Italy, France, the Philippines, Sweden and Belgium. As the popularity of RPDR continues to grow, the contestants themselves are only getting younger. Four of the past five seasons of RPDR have had 21-year-old contestants; RPDR UK\u2019s recent season had one as young as 19, Krystal Versace, walk away with the crown.\n\nRPDR\u2019s contestants have gone on to achieve much beyond the show. All Stars season three winner Trixie Mattel created her own makeup line, Trixie Cosmetics, launched a music career and has made multiple television appearances, including on her own Discovery+ show \u201cTrixie Motel.\u201d Shangela made history this year as the first drag queen to compete on ABC\u2019s \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d after finding success alongside season eight winner Bob the Drag Queen and Eureka O\u2019Hara on HBO Max\u2019s Emmy-winning show \u201cWe\u2019re Here.\u201d\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race show continues to inspire, with some queens like Will Yeaman, who goes by Willconique in drag, beginning at just 18 years old. Yeaman, currently a freshman, was so young when he first began drag that he submitted a tape of himself as Willconique as part of his application to USC\u2019s theater program. Rupaul\u2019s Drag Race was not only Yeaman\u2019s first time being exposed to drag, but, like Sharma, one of his greatest influences.\n\n\u201cI actually really thought it [RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race] was very weird [at first]. Our culture teaches us to fit into these norms of gender. And so seeing these different gender expressions was very foreign to me,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cAnd I realized, oh my God, people do this and this is what I am. And then, since then, we\u2019ve [Yeaman\u2019s and his mother] always watched the show together. It\u2019s kind of like our little tradition, actually. We both bought these kimonos on Amazon, and we would wear them and we would have our drag race nights on Friday when that would air.\u201d\n\nFor Yeaman, making the leap from superfan to drag performer was gradual, starting with his experimentation with hair and drag makeup in his home. Having a background in theater, he had plenty of experience in the cosmetic aspect of drag well before he debuted as Willconique. Willconique\u2019s persona, Yeaman said, came from an elevated version of his authentic self and allowed him to \u201ccome to terms with\u201d aspects of himself that he had fought before. He compared Willconique to other personality queens, or those known for their overall essence rather than fashion or pageantry, like his idol RPDR queen Alyssa Edwards, who he got to meet at her one-woman show that he attended while back home in the Bay Area.\n\n\u201cNow I can say that I\u2019m pretty darn authentically myself, and I think that\u2019s what makes me special, is that I really embraced who I am and that\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cAnd so getting to be that is really important to me, and I think that\u2019s why I look to her [Alyssa Edwards] for inspiration, she\u2019s someone who\u2019s owned who she is.\u201d\n\nOnly recently did Yeaman premiere his drag persona to the world, saying, \u201cdrag is meant to be shared.\u201d Willconique performed for the first time at QUASA\u2019s Pridefest alongside queens like Ra Oblivion. Though he had performing experience to fall back on, Yeaman shared how nervous he was before his very first performance in drag.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s still a sense of vulnerability because it\u2019s this part of your identity that you\u2019re sharing with the world, it\u2019s part of your identity that\u2019s not as well known usually and culturally not as well accepted,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cI had mistakes. Hopefully, no one even noticed. But immediately off the bat, I flipped my hair, my nail flew off and I was like, \u2018Oh, whatever.\u2019 But you keep going, and I wouldn\u2019t have changed my first performance for anything.\u201d\n\nFor now, Yeaman seeks to gain more experience on stage as Willconique, hoping to perform in venues around campus before eventually breaking into the local L.A. drag scene when he feels ready. At the moment, Yeaman says he\u2019s just grateful for the support of not just his immediate family but the drag community that he\u2019s already had the opportunity to be a part of.\n\nBeing a part of the drag community, and the LGBTQIA+ community in general, Yeaman shares in the joys and devastations that come with both identities. He shared his frustration at the demonization of drag, most recently shown in the mass shooting in Colorado Springs LGBTQ+ nightclub, Club Q, where five were killed and 18 injured in the targeted attack. Though Yeaman said he didn\u2019t have enough experience publicly in drag to speak personally on the danger queens face, he wasn\u2019t any less angry about the reality.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019ve been bullied and everything in the book, but I\u2019ve had it pretty easy as an LGBTQ+ individual,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cIt\u2019s [drag] just putting on these clothes and these cultural norms and sharing that with the world and playing with that, playing with gender. And why is that so demonized? It makes no sense.\u201d\n\nPreparations for USC QUASA\u2019s 2023 drag show on January 28, 2023 have already begun, with Yeaman and other student drag queens rehearsing every Sunday for hours leading up to showtime. Though juggling the show, academic commitments, theater productions and extracurriculars takes a lot of time management on Yeaman\u2019s part - he\u2019s still working on punctuality, but getting better, he says - he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\n\u201cI already feel like as a queen and as a person, I\u2019ve grown so much because I\u2019m getting to work with USC drag queens and kings like Daisy Darling and Ra Oblivion,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m at the beginning of my career, but I already feel like I\u2019ve learned so much, and I am so open to continuing to learn and grow. And I really want to inspire people.\u201d\n\nAmong the drag queens and kings that Yeaman met on campus is his \u201cdrag big sister\u201d Daisy Darling, or junior Hannah Gardiner. Gardiner is pushing their own boundaries in drag as a bioqueen or a cisgender woman who participates in drag. While Gardiner uses she and they pronouns, they do identify as a bioqueen.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, an inspiration to Gardiner as well, has also somewhat pushed the idea of what drag can be and who can participate. The first straight, cis-male contestant, Maddy Morphosis, appeared on season 14, as well as five trans contestants: Kerri Colby, Kornbread Jet\u00e9, Bosco, Jasmine Kennedy and Willow Pill. English bioqueen Victoria Scone, previously the first cis woman to ever compete in a RPDR franchise, wore the first drag king ensemble ever on the RPDR runway on RPDR Canada vs. the World in just this month.\n\nFor Gardiner, her Daisy Darling persona represents the hyper-femininity that they like to experiment with. Even their stage name draws inspiration from classic feminine characters like Wendy Darling of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d and Daisy Buchanan of \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Draping themselves in knee-high stockings, pink, lace and other traditional trappings of femininity, Gardiner describes their drag as a Barbie-Esque, cutesy femme fantasy inspired by queens like Violet Chachki.\n\n\u201cHer [Violet Chachki\u2019s] whole thing is that she doesn\u2019t want to be a woman. She wants to be a drawing of a woman,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cAnd I really resonated with that. I was like, I don\u2019t want to be a woman when I\u2019m in drag. I want to be like this hi-femme gender artist.\u201d\n\nThis experimentation with gender is by no means effortless. While their theater background makes performance easier, the preparation and adornment that goes into creating Daisy Darling juggle cost, style and loyalty aesthetic. Gardiner said they typically look to thrift stores, eBay and Depop for new outfits, often struggling with things not fitting correctly or not appearing as they had in photos.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot of work. It\u2019s more fun, though. I can kind of look around for stuff. But then I buy something, like I bought this dress that I was like, it\u2019ll come as a cupcake dress. It was kind of ugly, but in a way that I liked,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cAnd it came in the mail, and I was like, \u2018This does not fit.\u2019\u201d\n\nDaisy Darling also found a stage at the USC QUASA drag show and beyond, including at Ground Zero Cafe, when it still existed, and local bars. However, since they\u2019re under 21 years old, like Sharma, Gardiner finds it difficult to break into the drag scene that orbits gay bars and other over-21 venues. They performed briefly in a bar, but when the venue found out they were underage, they were prevented from doing so again, despite already being fully dressed and made up.\n\nThough that experience was difficult, Gardiner says the community they found in the venue was wonderful while they had it.\n\n\u201cWhen I first performed at that bar, I made so many friends. I met like ten different queens there who were performing, and we all got ready together in the back. And I was like, \u2018This is amazing. I can\u2019t wait to do this again,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cBut I kind of feel like I\u2019m on the outside of that now.\u201d\n\nWhile Gardiner uses their drag to explore femininity, Morgan Roberts leans into their longtime proclivity for a tomboy, masculine aesthetic. As a musician and drag king, under the clever name Robert Morgans, they combine their passion for performing on stage and their love of \u201cgender fuckery,\u201d as they call it. Though they don\u2019t identify with the hyper-feminine portrayal of drag on RPDR, they remain a fan of the show nonetheless.\n\nIntroduced to the show by their high school friend, they saw it as a way to explore queer culture while living in Texas at the time, where they said there were very few opportunities to do so. Upon moving to L.A. to attend USC, Roberts went to live drag shows, only solidifying their appreciation of the art form, but they didn\u2019t see their first drag king performance until artist Chad Chad took to the USC QUASA stage.\n\nRoberts then realized as an underclassman that it was possible to do drag outside of the femininity typically showcased. From there, they scoured Instagram and Youtube for any and all drag kings they could follow as a way to explore the community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always leaned a little more tomboy. Masculine is where I kind of live, and I didn\u2019t want to be hyper-feminizing myself,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI\u2019ve never really wanted that. So it just kind of made a lot more sense for me to go the [drag] king route.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t consider performing as a drag king themselves until 2018 when QUASA announced that Shangela would judge the upcoming drag show.\n\n\u201cI was like, I could probably do drag, that\u2019d be fun, and to perform in front of Shangela, what an opportunity. She [is] from Texas too, she\u2019s the first drag queen I ever saw on TV, thanks to Dance Moms. So I was like, \u2018This feels like a full circle moment,\u2019\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd then I ended up really loving it, finding an entire[ly] new part of myself and a whole different community that I just absolutely adore.\u201d\n\nRoberts began performing at gigs on and off campus, including the QUASA drag show, Akbar, the Nice Jewish Queers show, and under their own production company Femme Fatale Productions, started with their friend Carey Diaz. They even put on their own virtual drag show on Twitch at the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThat was fun for me to be a promoter and to be able to put other talented drag performers on the stage because I really just love the art form of drag. I\u2019m such a fan,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd that was really where I fell in love with the USC drag community, and I was like, \u2018Wow, these are my friends and like my little drag family.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the virtual show, Roberts didn\u2019t return to drag until a year later, having graduated in 2020 only to juggle the pandemic and a time-consuming job. When they did, they realized that their drag persona was not only a \u201cdeep part\u201d of them but that their musical and drag personas, separate up until that point, could be fused together. Once they became more comfortable with allowing more of Robert Morgans into all their performances, they started booking local gigs again using their community of drag kings and queens that they had found over the years.\n\nThough they have lingering insecurities about their drag, the quality of their makeup, for example, their love for the craft outweighs any negative aspects.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just something different about the art form of drag that you really cannot find anywhere else, and I find myself craving that a lot,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much artistry in it, and even though you might be lip-synching words you didn\u2019t write, you can still feel them very deeply, and just conveying that to an audience and them being like, \u2018Oh, I loved I ate that up,\u2019 I love that.\u201d\n\nHaving more experience performing in general, Roberts has faced the danger of drag firsthand. Roberts recently looked into gigs back home in Texas, where they were visiting family, reaching out to local promoters as they would in L.A. In the midst of their search, they heard about a system created by far-right organizations to alert locals of drag shows happening nearby.\n\nCreated by Austin-based right-wing nonprofit the Texas Family Project, the \u201cDefend Texas Kids\u201d alert system not only lets people know about local drag shows but encourages Texas residents to report on those happening nearby.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s not protecting, that\u2019s a target list. And that\u2019s scary, especially [since] we just had another mass shooting at a queer club. I mean, it\u2019s terrifying, it really is,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop me. I love to perform, the queer community is my"}

(Photo by Colin Huang)\n\nBy Will Simonds January 26, 2023 at 9:53 pm PST\n\nWhen USC upset UCLA last season at Galen Center, fifth-year guard Drew Peterson was the star, loading the stat sheet with 27 points, 12 rebounds and plenty more. Meanwhile, now-senior guard Boogie Ellis was held scoreless, going 0-for-7 from the field in just 20 minutes of action. But he didn\u2019t let that performance deter him in the same matchup a year later.\n\nEllis made up for it and more Thursday night at Galen Center with a dominant performance \u2014 made up of a career-high 31 points, six assists and four rebounds \u2014 to lead USC to another upset win over rival No. 8 UCLA, 77-64.\n\n\u201cThis game has highs and lows. Tonight was high,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI definitely beat myself up for that performance, but Drew had it rolling \u2014 that was his night. Tonight was my night.\u201d\n\nPeterson had another big evening against the Bruins, with 16 points and 3-for-4 shooting from behind the arc. Sophomore guard Kobe Johnson also contributed 10 points, five assists and five rebounds.\n\nBut instead of playing out similar to last year\u2019s game at Galen, this contest initially seemed more reminiscent of these teams\u2019 more recent matchup three weeks ago. Arguably the biggest factor that contributed to the Bruins\u2019 60-58 win over USC back on Jan. 5 in Westwood was UCLA\u2019s 16-6 advantage on the offensive boards.\n\nWhen the Bruins gathered multiple offensive rebounds on their very first offensive possession, it appeared the Trojans might be headed for a similar downfall in the rematch. After all, UCLA is No. 30 in the nation in offensive rebound percentage; USC is No. 332 in offensive rebound percentage allowed, according to KenPom.\n\nThose rebounding issues persisted in the first half, with the Bruins bringing in eight offensive boards, including four by freshman forward Adem Bona. UCLA had 10 second-chance points in the opening 20 minutes resulting from those additional opportunities.\n\nOn the other side, USC had a solid offensive start, bolstered by back-to-back corner threes by Johnson and sophomore guard Reese-Dixon Waters to give USC an early 12-6 lead. But that offensive success didn\u2019t last long, as USC soon went on a stretch of over seven scoreless minutes. Failing to get many good looks in the paint, the Trojans were forced to rely on their outside shooting. USC had just two points in the paint at halftime, and over half its first-half field goals were threes.\n\nMeanwhile, UCLA had plenty of success from deep \u2014 it started 6-for-11 from 3-point range \u2014 as it closed the first half strong. Fifth-year guard David Singleton\u2019s three triples helped the Bruins build a 37-25 halftime lead, which again mirrored these teams\u2019 first contest earlier this month; UCLA led 44-26 at the break three weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had to do a better job offensively [in the second half],\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cBoogie was 0-for-5 at halftime from three.... Your best players have to step up in games like this.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened in the second half. Like that previous matchup at Pauley Pavilion, the Trojans again came roaring back out of halftime in the rematch, led by Ellis and Peterson. After Singleton made another 3-pointer to open the half, USC responded with a 25-3 run, undoubtedly its best stretch of basketball this season.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 lights-out defense propelled its offense, as USC scored 17 fast break points in the latter period after none in the first half. Ellis was the primary driving force of the run, as his second-half statline looked like this: 27 points (including 3-for-4 from three and 10-for-10 at the line), three rebounds, three assists, a block and a steal.\n\nAs impressive as Ellis was shooting the ball, he made an equal impact in other facets of the game. As a result, the Galen Center crowd was the loudest it has been since those aforementioned heroics by Peterson a year ago.\n\n\u201cI thought last year\u2019s game and this year\u2019s game [against UCLA] were the two best atmospheres we\u2019ve played in 10 years,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was awesome,\u201d Peterson added. \u201cEspecially coming out with a little bit of a deficit at halftime, the crowd stayed in it, and they just got louder by the point for us.\u201d\n\nThe crowd was probably its loudest when Ellis hit a ridiculous step-back three with under 90 seconds left to put away the Bruins, something USC couldn\u2019t do earlier this month when it failed to cement its comeback against UCLA in Westwood.\n\nEllis would soon walk off the floor late to a massive ovation from the home crowd, after matching UCLA\u2019s 27 second-half points by himself. That dominant finish by the Trojans gives them a fifth straight win at Galen against their rivals, still yet to lose at home to current UCLA head coach Mick Cronin.\n\nIt\u2019s also a ranked win, which is especially important for a USC team currently on the bubble of the March Madness bracket.\n\n\u201cWinning one game versus UCLA is great, great for the rivalry,\u201d Ellis said,\u201d but I still feel like we got more to prove.\u201d\n\nUSC will have another chance to show what it can do next weekend, when it stays home to face the Washington schools, starting with Washington State on Feb. 2 at 8 p.m.\n```"}

This is an average of more than seven incidents per day, the highest number of incidents on record since the civil rights non-governmental organization began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979.\n\n\u201cThe day has taken on additional significance as antisemitism and acts of violence against Jewish people are on the rise across the nation, fueled by social media disinformation, extremist celebrities and athletes, and politicians,\u201d said the university in a news release.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Jewish Life worked throughout the spring 2022 semester to produce its final report. The committee included Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life Varun Soni, Louchheim School for Judaic Studies Director Leah Hochman and Office of Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX Associate Vice President Linda Hoos, as well as several other university officials and experts on antisemitism. Also present on the committee were several leaders from the Jewish community, including 2021-2022 USC Hillel Student President Jacob Miller, 2021-2022 USC Chabad Jewish Center Student President Megan Saghian, and Chabad Jewish Center Director Rabbi Dov Wagner.\n\n\u201cI think one of the things that was most notable about that committee and its work [was that it was] a university committee; it was our campus saying that it cares about this, it\u2019s willing to dedicate really significant resources to it and that it\u2019s not the Jewish community\u2019s problem to solve, that the university has a responsibility to it\u201d said Cohn. \u201cSo to me, that\u2019s very resonant.\u201d\n\nThe committee recommends creating a standing committee to support Jewish life on campus, focusing on definitions of antisemitism in campus dialogue to educate the community, reinforcing university protections against bullying, harassment and intimidation and acknowledging \u201cexplicitly that anti-Zionism can sometimes be experienced as antisemitism in responding to issues and incidents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s recommendations give us tangible direction across nearly every aspect of Jewish life at USC, including experiences of antisemitism, university processes and policies, the Jewish experience on campus, and education and training,\u201d said Folt in the August 23, 2022, announcement.\n\nInternational Holocaust Remembrance Day is an opportunity for secular institutions \u2014 like USC \u2014 to stimulate meaningful allyship that must be continued long after the day\u2019s observance, according to Cohn.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is a day that\u2019s not centered on the Jewish community observing it, but that reflects the wider world\u2019s need to reckon with it,\u201d said Cohn. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s reflective of the fact that our university has shown this commitment.\u201d\n```"}

The \u201cONE USC Safety Vision\u201d aims to make UPC safer.\n\nStudent bikes past USC ONE Safety Vision signage. (Photo by Gus Ruelas)\n\nBy Nicholas Wald, Daniel Palmore, Jane Walgren, and Monica Esquivel\nJanuary 26, 2023 at 7:13 pm PST\n\nTrojans need to keep their eyes out for electric vehicles on campus, according to the university\u2019s Department of Public Safety. A new DPS initiative known as the \u201cONE USC Safety Vision\u201d aims to make campus safer for all by reducing crimes and collisions around University Park Campus. Pedestrians and electric vehicle riders take priority.\n\nDPS estimates that there are around 9,000 to 15,000 bikes on both campuses, and that doesn\u2019t even include the number of skateboards and scooters. According to a statement from the university, UPC saw 157 traffic collisions last year and the majority were caused by e-scooters, skateboards, and bikes.\n\nNew campus signage around traffic-heavy areas urges students to keep their heads up, ride and walk safely, and give way to fellow pedestrians. \u201cIf we could just get ourselves thinking about other people a little bit more, I feel like it would be easier to make decisions to protect other people,\u201d said Paulene Ng Chee, a student leader who helped with the ONE USC campaign.\n\nThere\u2019s real danger in the fact that \u201cthese electric vehicles go so quickly,\u201d said Amelia Horney, a USC Thornton student who suffered a dislocated ankle after being hit by a skateboarder. \u201cI think there should definitely at least be a speed limit. Honestly, I\u2019m kind of leaning towards banning electric vehicles.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Eroll Southers, the Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance for the university, takes a different view. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a culture,\u201d Southers said. \u201cWe want to embrace people here in a way that makes them feel included.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the possible implementation of a campus speed limit and increased DPS patrol, Dr. Southers was quick to point out that, \u201cStopping speeding students who are already in a rush does not translate to an inclusive campus.\u201d He added that stationing DPS officers around high-traffic areas will likely hurt student perceptions of DPS, which is in conflict with the goals of ONE USC.\n\nDr. Southers is adamant that the program be as peer-to-peer as possible, and rely mostly on non-intrusive safety measures. That means conversations with students and participation from those who see the need for change.\n\nOver the recent winter break, DPS repainted bike lane markers throughout campus and brought students on board to design the signage intended to make peers feel more safe. But there are currently no plans to expand bike lane infrastructure.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I was so scared. There was this electric scooter and I was gonna be ran over,\u201d freshman business administration major Zaina Kaibni said. \u201cIt was an intense moment, but other than that I don\u2019t really mind them.\u201d\n\nArushi Pant, a business administration major, said she used to be able to walk around campus and listen to music with AirPods. Now, she is more cautious of her surroundings. \u201cI try to not listen to music while walking for my own safety,\u201d Pant said. \u201cI understand that it is a campus, they should be allowed to skateboard, but maybe like having properly defined lanes for them so that we don\u2019t collide and hurt each other.\u201d\n\nMonique Chavez, a graduate student studying public relations and advertising who was part of the ONE USC campaign, said the aim of the campaign is to be encouraging \u201cand put it into an empathetic point of view and not so much like administration telling you to slow down on your bike.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want students to be looking out for other students and be cautious,\u201d Chavez said.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/01/26/if-protests-are-now-terrorism-what-is-state-brutality-and-surveillance/", "response": "```\nIf protests are now \u201cterrorism,\u201d what is state brutality and surveillance?\n\nWe analyzed the expansion and impact of police surveillance, from 2020 \u2014 the present.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 18, 2023, Georgia State Troopers shot and killed an Indigenous anarchist and forest defender named Tortuguita, who was protesting to stop the construction of a police training facility. Tortuguita was described as \u201ckind,\u201d \u201cfierce\u201d and \u201cattentive to others\u2019 needs.\u201d Over the following weekend, vigils and protests with the cry \u201cStop Cop City\u201d erupted across the country \u2014 from Los Angeles to Hamburg to Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory and more.\n\nIn Atlanta, anti-fascist protestors set a police car on fire and vandalized a bank \u2014 actions which were decried as \u201cterrorism\u201d by Atlanta\u2019s Police Chief Darin Schierbaum. However, activists and forest defenders are rebutting Chief Shiernaum\u2019s declaration, arguing that it is the police shooting that was \u201cterrorism.\u201d They believe the destruction of the forest is \u201cterrorism.\u201d Instead, activists declare that the construction of \u201cCop City,\u201d an 85-acre police training facility that Tortuguita was killed fighting against ... is the true \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nIn attempt to contextualize this debate, we investigated the expansion and impact of police funding and state surveillance technologies, focusing on 2020 \u2014 the present.\n\nIn 2020, in Canarsie, Brooklyn, a gunshot detection technology, called ShotSpotter, reported a gunshot fired. It alerted the NYPD and sent them to a street address. The officers arrived at the location, and a Black man named Fitzroy Gayle happened to be walking past it, on his way home. The officers got out of their cars, targeted and detained him and started hitting him, causing serious injuries to his neck, knee and ankle.\n\nWrongful detentions and arrests are not uncommon after alerts from ShotSpotter and other surveillance technologies, and these misfires seem to disproportionately impact men and boys of color. In 2018, a New York City man was arrested after facial recognition software falsely identified him in a robbery. In 2019, a Black man from New Jersey spent 10 days in jail after being falsely identified by surveillance technology.\n\nCurrently, Michael Williams is suing the city of Chicago for spending almost a year in jail after police, responding to a ShotSpotter alert, arrested him for a murder he says he didn\u2019t commit. In 2021, a 13-year-old Latino boy in Chicago named Adam Toledo was shot and killed by police, who responded to a ShotSpotter alert. He hadn\u2019t fired the gun and was not given due process.\n\nDespite thousands of stories and multiple reports of these technologies leading to undue brutality or dead ends, increased police surveillance and technologies like ShotSpotter are quickly proliferating across the country, largely under the guise of quelling \u201cterrorism.\u201d But what, really, is the impact?\n\nDespite 2020\u2032s resonant calls to Defund the Police, recent polls from 2022 suggest that almost 50% of people support funding the police more. The government has delivered on that; in the past two years, spending on police and counterterrorism has gone up, significantly. Under the Biden administration, political wariness of \u201cterrorism\u201d and radicalism has swelled, too, and the U.S. is currently under a \u201cheightened threat environment.\u201d\n\nHomeland Security declared white supremacist extremism and domestic terrorism to be \u201cone of the most major threats to America.\u201d Though proponents of increased police budgets and surveillance believe funding is the best way to fight increasing crime, critics believe that this declaration will have severe ripples to already over-policed communities.\n\nResearchers believe increased police funding will increase surveillance predominately in Black, brown and working class neighborhoods, more so than in areas reft with white supremacist militias. As a result, activists and organizers are tightening up their ranks and security \u2014 in what they see as a protective response to state crackdown via increased policing and surveillance.\n\n\u201cIf you put \u2018wear black\u2019 on a protest flier these days, CounterTerrorism will show up. There\u2019s two to three times the amount of officers at protests, vigils, everything ... way more than there used to be,\u201d said Code, an anarchist from Pennsylvania, who prefers to use an alias to protect her anonymity and safety.\n\nCode has participated actively in community mutual aid and organizing for years, since long before 2020. She explained that she\u2019s noticed an extreme uptick in policing of protests, especially since the uprising against George Floyd\u2019s murder and even more so since January 6.\n\nWith recent increases in budget and spending, policing and surveillance technology are growing across the country \u2014 in some cities, doubling or tripling. Since entering office, Biden has promised to recruit 100,000 new police officers and requested an additional $35.3 million to \u201cmake America safer.\u201d\n\nDovetailed with this funding is an increase in federal government and private company unity, with corporations like Amazon collaborating with police and federal intelligence agencies, to share once-private consumer information and data to the state.\n\n\u201cWhen you research surveillance tech, it helps to start by looking at what [law enforcement] does to the \u2018worst of the worst,\u2019\u201d said Mitchell, who is also a hacker and fellow with the Ford Foundation. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to feel bad for what they did with those guys. So, an overzealous law enforcement shows their hands.\u201d\n\nIn January 2021, right-wing militants stormed the U.S. Capitol, and Washington, D.C. was shut down by the National Guard for weeks. Police and federal intelligence tracked rioters with cellphone data, license plate readers, facial recognition, social media monitoring and civilian tips.\n\nSince then, radical protests in the U.S. have, by and large, gotten a lot fewer and further between. Code explained that in late spring 2021, as the warm weather came out again to roost, police began cracking down on housing activists in Philadelphia before protests even began, arresting people within 10 minutes of setup.\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t even really protesting. They were standing on the sidewalk having a BBQ. And then the police just swept in, all aggressive. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t even want us to assemble at all,\u201d Code said.\n\nShe said that, since then, people in Philadelphia have been less active in radical street protest. Instead, preferring, a peaceful occupation and community building.\n\n\u201cPeople are mostly organizing mutual aid and are licking their wounds,\u201d Code said.\n\nHowever, in cities like Portland, Oregon, which saw ample police brutality against protestors in 2020 and extended street marches that continued through 2022, the local police have lately been taking a more hands-off approach to protestors. Instead of acting or disrupting marches, police have preferred to sit back, watch the marches and let non-protesting civilians\u2019 frustration with protestors increase.\n\nThis may indicate their current tactic: surveillance. Despite the ample anti-police protests in Portland and the minor street action from the PPD, the police budget is higher than its ever been, at $249 million. Even so, violent crime and gun violence have increased significantly in the past few years.\n\nWith this extra funding, Portland police are adopting surveillance technologies, including ShotSpotter. But, again, this surveillance technology is not exactly new. There\u2019s just a lot more of it now. And the prevalence of these technologies is increasing in most American cities.\n\n\u201cYou have a mass proliferation of tech that were once localized only in big cities, now being played out in smaller, local battles,\u201d said Sanjin Ibrahimovic, a surveillance technology expert and researcher at the Lucy Parsons Labs in Chicago.\n\nTechnologies like gunshot detectors, license plate readers, social media surveillance and biometric readers are now expanding across the country. They\u2019re getting more sophisticated, too, with facial recognition software being able to identify people even with face masks on.\n\n\u201cIdentifying a person with facial recognition data is so much easier than using fingerprints, and this is the new fingerprinting,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cFirst off, with fingerprints, you actually have to have someone touch something. You have to be near them, have them touch a glass, something. With facial recognition, I could get it from just about anywhere.\u201d\n\nIn October 2022, a team of truck drivers won a suit against the BNSF railway and were awarded $228 million. BNSF was taking their fingerprints without consent or awareness, against Illinois\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act.\n\nOnce acquired, without the proper protections and encryptions (which BNSF did not provide), these fingerprints could have been linked to their driver\u2019s license and other personal data. Attorney Jon Loevy, whose firm handled the case, explained, \u201cIf we don\u2019t fight back, this is going to go farther and farther. The truck drivers in this case ended up in a database without their consent. You can\u2019t put people in a database without their consent.\u201d\n\nLoevy\u2019s firm is also representing a case called Mutnick v. Clearview, which is focusing on fighting against facial recognition databases. Mutnick claims Clearview \u201cbuilt a searchable database of the scanned images enabling database users to instantly identify unknown individuals using nothing more than a photograph.\u201d\n\nLoevy\u2019s concern is that databases like these can result in people being \u201ctracked in public,\u201d which could have particular consequences for activists. He explained, \u201cIf you go through to a sporting event or intersection or building, there could be a camera that instantly scans your face. if you\u2019re a political dissident or critic of the government, they could arrest you. Science fiction has arrived. Dystopia has arrived.\u201d\n\nThough the states of Illinois, Texas and Washington and 17 cities, led by San Francisco, have passed laws to limit use of biometric data like facial recognition, not everywhere has. Given that Amazon, maker of the camera Ring doorbell (which is owned by about 10 million people nationwide), has a history of collaborating with police to hand over security footage, the amount of opportunities to surveil is not only ever-rising, but it\u2019s normalizing as a regular function of society.\n\nDespite the laws on biometric data, San Francisco\u2019s police force has recently gained access to use Amazon Ring\u2019s footage as needed. This allows police to submit \u201cemergency requests\u201d to use the footage to detect potential criminal activity \u2014 even misdemeanors.\n\nThe Ring doorbell, which video records and digitally analyzes its surroundings, is also compatible with a new app, called Ring Neighbors, akin to the Citizen App. Like Citizen, Ring Neighbors is a community engagement app that crowdsources data about neighborhood crime activities and sends alerts to users of potential crimes where they live.\n\nRecently, the Ring Neighbor app has begun to allow collaboration with police in places like New York and Florida. This includes allowing the police in some cities to ask civilians for \u201chelp.\u201d\n\nAs many cities have Fusion Centers, wherein police and federal agencies can share technology and intelligence, if the police have access to the Ring surveillance, it also likely means federal bureaus like Counter Terrorism do.\n\nLoevy is skeptical of this type of recording paired with facial recognition, saying, \u201cThis technology should scare people. They can track you in public based on having your photograph or your fingerprint.\u201d\n\nHowever, proponents of the technology say it helps keep the country safer, for example, from domestic terrorists. A website called Pimeyes allowed civilians to help recognize and trace January 6 rioters. Some of that data lead to their arrests and to holding the rioters accountable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s been well-documented that facial recognition is less accurate on non-white faces. Faulty facial recognition via video surveillance has also been known to result in arrest of the wrong person.\n\nSo, the proliferation of these technologies begs questions about their efficacy, too. Along with facial recognition proliferation, cities and suburbs have been increasing the presence of license plate readers. They\u2019re expected to be added nationally at a rate of 9% per year, with the goal of \u201celiminating crime.\u201d\n\nThere is ample concern that these plate readers will criminalize people seeking out-of-state abortion care, and it could also be used to track protestors.\n\nAs we\u2019re seeing a major increase in surveillance technology, \u201cThere\u2019s also been a major increase in the secrecy of these technologies,\u201d Ibrahimovic said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to find information about what tech they\u2019re bringing in. When we request information about it, say from the Chicago PD, moreso now, they won\u2019t comply with our requests because they\u2019re saying, \u2018It\u2019s a security risk.\u2019 They\u2019re claiming we could use the information \u2018for terrorist purposes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIbrahimovic said that the increase in security and threat-based language is swaying court decisions regarding information, too. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more cases side with police departments, over the peoples\u2019 right to information access. But, this technology is being purchased with public dollars \u2014 we should be able to know about this.\u201d\n\nDespite this, technologists have been able to collaborate to find information, as aforementioned, about what technology exists \u2014 the bigger, moral questions that linger are \u201cWhere are they being placed?\u201d and \u201cWhat, really, are they being used for?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see things like ShotSpotter installed in wealthy neighborhoods, but they will put it in the hood, where it was redlined,\u201d Ibrahimovic said. \u201cYou see the biggest abundance of these technologies in places that are already experiencing harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn New York, Black and brown communities are already dealing with visual Stop and Frisk, stopping without probable cause, databases with peoples\u2019 names ... just these huge networks of policing and networks of information,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nLike in Canarsie, there have already been situations where the increase in technology has led to unjustified violence against innocent people of color. With DHS\u2019s budget ballooning to almost $100 billion in 2023, organizations like the Action Center on Race & the Economy are worried that the introduction of more surveillance tech and policing will cause more harm than good.\n\n\u201cShotSpotter doesn\u2019t stop gun violence. It doesn\u2019t prevent gun violence. It\u2019s a probable cause generator,\u201d said Ed Vogel, a surveillance tech researcher in Nashville.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a high correlation of use of Stop & Frisk with ShotSpotter deployment. The police will arrive from the alert and will stop and frisk people because they think they have a gun. Then, they will put their name in the gang database.\n\nIn light of this, some radical activists are fighting back against this expansion of policing. They are warring directly at its breeding grounds \u2014 by opposing police training and education centers. Just outside of Atlanta, an abolitionist movement grows, to \u201cStop Cop City \u2014 a military police base.\u201d\n\nIn taking direct action to stop the increase of police training, and thus presence, activists have been occupying the forest, blocking the 85-acre proposed construction site of a police training base.\n\nAs a land defender explained on the Stop Cop City public blog, \u201cOn the evening of Saturday, November 19, chainsaw-wielding militants took action to close down the Atlanta Police Department\u2019s shooting range inside the Weelaunee Forest, where APD trains weekly to kill and maim the people of Atlanta.\u201d\n\nDetails of this action was confirmed by local news reports in Atlanta.\n\nIt\u2019s common for activist groups to not speak to the media, but instead, announce their anti-state actions and reasoning on public channels, like the Scenes from the Atlanta Forest site. This is done, by and large, to express their point of view while preserving their anonymity and safety, from fear of arrest or police apprehension.\n\nTo cite their reasoning behind the militant closing down of the shooting range, Stop Cop City said, \u201cThe only \u2018protection\u2019 police offer is violence and death.\u201d\n\nActivists claim this knowledge of policing and its harms and impacts directly inspires their work, fundamentally pushing back on Biden\u2019s idea that increased policing and surveillance will \u201cmake America safer.\u201d\n\nEmbedded in their direct action, they explained, is a reverence for the dead \u2014 people who have been the casualties of policing. People for whom more police did not mean \u201csafe.\u201d\n\nAs for the action on November 19, the Stop Cop City activists explained, \u201cWe took this action for the dead \u2014 for Rayshard Brooks and every person killed by the Atlanta Police, for every murdered revolutionary, for the Muskogee who were forced from this land, for every enslaved person who lived and died on the plantation here, for every prisoner killed by guards at the old prison farm and buried in unmarked graves in the forest. This forest is theirs and we will not allow the police to desecrate it with their presence.\u201d\n\nHowever, since the action in November, there has been a significant uptick in brutality against the forest defenders. On December 13, five people were arrested for domestic terrorism during a police raid of the camp. Again, on January 18, police raided and killed Tortuguita while also arresting seven other defenders on domestic terrorism charges.\n\nAt the Atlanta protests the following weekend, six were arrested for domestic terrorism, in what the Atlanta Solidarity Fund calls \u201cutterly baseless,\u201d as they, and the ACLU believe \u201cthere is no basis for such a case.\u201d\n\nWhile legal experts are working to analyze the situation, Stop Cop City activists are calling for an independent investigation by journalists into Tortuguita\u2019s killing. Activists and legal experts alike are concerned that the widely-circulating police narrative is \u201ca cover-up,\u201d as the Georgia State Troopers have not released body camera footage \u2014 despite photographic evidence that the Troopers were wearing body cameras.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s expansion of policing and surveillance technologies intend to \u201cmake America safer,\u201d activists and experts are worried about what their impact will be on already over-policed communities.\n\nIn response to this dissonance, anti-police and police surveillance movements continue \u2014 through direct action, community organizing and lawsuits. This resistance speaks to deep fears and concerns from radical populations and experts alike.\n\nAccording to Mitchell, this union of private corporations, police and federal agencies and civilian watch, could result in increased violence towards civilians. Though some communities are fighting back against it, it\u2019s unclear to many what the next few years will bring.\n\n\u201cTypically, in authoritarian situations, first we see streets full of blood,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThen, after that, surveillance becomes a regular part of the society. After a while, it\u2019s so normalized people feel no reason to push back. Then, surveillance becomes so palatable, brought on with such a slow boil that people will rely on it, they\u2019ll befriend it, they\u2019ll be buddy-buddy with it.\u201d```"}

Britain\u2019s first-ever extreme heat warning is in effect for large parts of England as hot, dry weather that has scorched mainland Europe for the past week moves north, disrupting travel, health care and schools. (Danny Lawson/PA via AP)\n\nBy Shreya Agrawal January 26, 2023 at 4:29 pm PST\n\nClimate scientists say that polar bears will most likely become extinct by 2100. You may be one of those who believe polar bears look cute and cuddly, or maybe you don\u2019t, but if you\u2019re reading this newsletter, you probably care, to some degree, about their wellbeing. But let me first start with an anecdote. A while ago, a friend and I had an argument about the climate crisis. This was not a Republican vs. Democrat argument, like one might expect. We are both fairly liberal in ideology and we both agree that climate change exists. What we couldn\u2019t agree on was whether the responsibility towards managing our shared resources is personal or political. My friend argued that all resource management was political and therefore individual contributions such as living sustainably, using less resources or practicing recycling doesn\u2019t make a difference. I agree, but also believe \u2013\u2013 and perhaps this is too optimistic \u2013\u2013 that every small effort counts. We ended up in a very heated discussion that left both of us with tingling nerves and elevated levels of stress for the entire night. I think we both realized that even within the realm of climate change believers, there can exist a variety of perspectives, and therefore, a variety of arguments where both sides can make irrefutable points.\n\nWhat does this have to do with polar bears? Polar bears have become the poster child for the impact of climate change. Their impending extinction is directly the effect of rising carbon emissions and vanishing sea ice. But to those who have nothing to do with polar bears in daily life \u2013\u2013 even if they may be staunch climate-change believers \u2013\u2013 isn\u2019t a polar just an elusive figurehead? An unrelatable figurehead? We know that the climate crisis doesn\u2019t only impact polar bears or penguins or the thousands of species that currently are endangered. It affects every human being, whether Democrat or Republican, capitalist or socialist, privileged or not. And so, our challenge becomes harder: with all these differences between those of us who believe in climate change, how do we share our knowledge with those who don\u2019t? How do we convince them that it is necessary to change our ways of living, in some way or another?\n\nPart of the reason we have forgotten how to talk to each other is because we are too comfortable in our \u201ccorrect\u201d beliefs. Alarm bells start to go off in our heads as soon as we hear our friends or colleagues say something that sounds contrary. And so, we fight with them, speaking over them to prove our point, or shirk away from the conversation until we find someone who echoes our beliefs back to us. But none of these methods encourage any further discussion. In fact, if someone feels like their opinions and beliefs are being attacked, the less likely they will be to listen to others, never mind showing acceptance. Sometimes, we forget that talking to each other is not about being right or being wrong; it is about acceptance, learning and most of all, about two-way communication.\n\nKwame Christian, the founder and CEO of the American Negotiation Institute, has touted compassionate curiosity as a response to stress instead of the usual fight or flight. Compassionate curiosity involves sharing our concerns with each other without judgment and coming to a solution together. But the funny thing is, the basest of all our concerns as individuals are almost exactly the same. All of us want access to basic resources, a clean environment, and healthcare. The real problem lies in the politicization of these concerns. Politicians have very successfully morphed these concerns into divisions of red and blue, which is personally terrifying, because unless we work together, we can never get closer to fixing the biggest crisis of our lives.\n\nSo how can we depolarize these discussions? I suggest we start by talking about the things we have in common. How about we talk about bananas being in danger of extinction? Or about global warming reducing the number of ski days every year? Or its effects on beer and coffee? Part of the trouble also lies in the politicisation of language. Phrases like \u2018climate change\u2019 and \u2018green energy\u2019 have started to represent a distinct political ideology, such that it can become hard to talk about the climate crisis without being labelled a liberal. When President Biden\u2019s first introduced the Build Back Better framework, many noticed that it very closely resembled the Green New Deal introduced by congresspeople Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Edward J. Markey, but replaced the controversial \u201cgreen\u201d with \u201cclean\u201d. The use of less politically charged language made it harder even for climate deniers to reject it completely. After all, we all want access to clean air, water and energy. A significant chunk of the framework was finally passed as the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nWe need to stop saying that the other side is wrong and start listening to their concerns instead of first shouting out our own. When you talk about the climate crisis with someone with different beliefs, let them share their concerns while you actively listen with curiosity for their ideas and compassion for their feelings. Ask questions to further the discussion and make them feel heard. Tell them that their concerns matter. I believe the only way to save polar bears is to recognize that the climate crisis affects more than just them. The discussion around this crisis should no longer remain polarized. But if you still believe that that climate change only affects the animals of the Arctic, then maybe we should all be polar bears.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)\n\nBy Avery Goodman, Kaitlin Becenti and Sophia Ketterer\nJanuary 25, 2023 at 7:26 pm PST\n\nAlphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, announced last Friday that it\u2019s planning to cut around 6% of its workforce. The company joins a wave of massive layoffs made by other powerhouse tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon, a trend that began last summer and continues into the new year. In a staff memo sent out November 20, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he was taking \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for cutting 12,000 jobs.\n\nIn light of the layoffs, USC Viterbi students are rethinking their future. As spring graduation rounds the corner, many students worry about finding a job in an industry they once thought to be secure.\n\n\u201cTech is seen as such a budding field and it\u2019s seen as the future. And yet, all of these layoffs are happening and it\u2019s a little confusing,\u201d said Hallie Faust, a double major in both computer science and business administration.\n\nSince the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, tech has been growing steadily. That expansion saw yet another boom during the COVID-19 pandemic. With an unprecedented uptick in reliance on remote work and education, the industry flourished. According to regulatory filings, Google\u2019s workforce grew by 68,000 employees during the pandemic.\n\nBut as post-pandemic realities set in, as well as talk of a potential recession, companies are having to reassess. In turn, Viterbi students, who once felt confident about landing a lucrative position in the tech industry, have been trying to read the signs and weigh their options.\n\nComputer science and business administration major Patty Srising sees herself as particularly vulnerable, given this new reality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought the tech industry is already extremely hard to break into as a woman of color,\u201d Srising said. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry that\u2019s dominated by dudes, and even they\u2019re getting laid off, so it\u2019s a bit concerning.\u201d\n\nWhile the recent layoffs were relatively equal in terms of gender, less than a third of technical and leadership roles in the industry are held by women according to a study by Deloitte.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, there\u2019s a lot of new developments in technology, so there\u2019s always going to be jobs in the industry,\u201d Srising said. \u201cBut since skilled people in companies like Microsoft are getting laid off, it just makes me wonder, will I make it?\u201d\n\nSeeing the recent layoffs as a sign of precarity, some students have already begun to change their plans. Mark Ray, a masters student studying green technology engineering, said he wants to pivot to a doctorate degree instead of pursuing a career, since his faith in the job market isn\u2019t very high.\n\nRay believes that buying some time could provide opportunity for growth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never a bad time to learn and take on new skills that make you more marketable and more capable for jobs to come,\u201d Ray said.\n\nBut for others, the signs are not at all clear. For Olivia Fortson, a freshman intelligence and cyber operations major, the recent layoffs do not reflect long-term instability in the tech industry. But she does think the changes may weed out students who are going into the field primarily for financial reasons.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve noticed is that some people just choose computer science because it gives you that guarantee of \u2018okay I can work anywhere I want, good salary, six figures,\u201d Fortson said.\n\nBut, according to Fortson, there is enough evidence to warrant thinking twice about pursuing a tech job.\n\n\u201cI think this is causing people to rethink their choices about whether they\u2019re passionate about what they really want to do or whether they just think it\u2019s going to land them a job as soon as they come out of college,\u201d Fortson said.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m not very worried because I know I love what I do, and USC has so many career services that I don\u2019t feel that stressed about it.\u201d\n\nSeventy two percent of Viterbi\u2019s class of 2021 landed jobs in their sector. Over the last years Viterbi has expanded its artificial intelligence programs, a field that Google has given more attention to recently.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all going to be okay. I think us tech people are going to be okay,\u201d Fortson said.\n```"}

But few things have USC students fuming as much as the current state of ridesharing options around campus. Earlier this month, a USC administration modification to its Safe Ride Program, also known as \u201cFryft\u201d or Free Lyft, went into effect, forcing students to share rides with other passengers instead of taking private ones. The change has resulted in long wait times, USC students say. And they are not happy about it.\n\n\u201cIt makes me furious,\u201d said Omar Elhawary, a senior pre-med student at USC. \u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient because it makes me late.\u201d\n\nSince the start of this spring semester, over 7,000 students have signed a petition against the change, accusing USC of putting money over student safety.\n\n\u201cI have class from 7 to 9 most nights, or sometimes even 7 to 11, so I\u2019m getting home at around midnight,\u201d said Ashley Nguyen, a USC sophomore. \u201cAnd when I have to make the choice to take a Lyft or walk, I normally choose to walk instead because it\u2019s faster. I\u2019m tired and I want to get home. And that\u2019s not always the safest thing because sometimes I forget to carry pepper spray, and I don\u2019t have someone to walk me home.\u201d\n\nStudents like Nguyen are concerned about female students being harassed by strangers they are forced to ride with.\n\nThe student body\u2019s critique has not gone unnoticed by the administration. In response to complaints, USC officials noted the shared-Lyft program was in effect before the COVID-19 pandemic and said any student who does not feel safe can cancel their ride.\n\nOn Wednesday, Michelle Garcia, senior associate director of USC transportation said administrators are working with Lyft to find solutions.\n\n\u201cI have gotten feedback from students regarding their long wait times, and actually a few have been really helpful in providing me with some information...[to] try and troubleshoot any issues with their algorithm that\u2019s creating these longer wait times,\u201d she said. \u201cThe information I\u2019m getting from Lyft is that longer than 15 minutes is rare, but it\u2019s not that it\u2019s not occurring.\u201d\n\nWhen Caroline Fromm first created a petition to restore the single-rider Lyft program in December 2021, the university listened and reenacted the policy, according to the petition. She said many students have waited up to an hour to be assigned a Lyft driver, and many of those drivers have expressed a lack of financial incentive to continue serving the USC area.\n\n\u201cLonger wait times making you walk around campus in the darkness are not necessarily safe,\u201d said Yoav Gillath, a USC sophomore and USG senator running for student body president.\n\nWhile Gillath said he could not comment on behalf of USG, he mentioned that USG has been in communication with USC Transportation. They have discussed possible transportation alternatives to expand student accessibility while keeping university costs low.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re dealing with a big budget deficit for the university,\u201d Gillath said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I think they switched back to shared Lyft.\u201d\n\nGarcia noted that the free shared Lyft program is not a common resource at neighboring universities.\n\n\u201cThere is no other university that compares to our Lyft program, even in its shared state,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nGillath said he will do everything in his power to restore the private Lyft program for current students.\n\n\u201c[Single-rider Lyft] would go a long way to assuaging some of the safety concerns, not just for students, but also for parents,\u201d Gillath said.\n```"}

Spudnuts, a 24-hour donut shop on Figueroa, serves breakfast meals all day long, attracting student traffic from morning to night.

The crisis has made the lives of workers far from over easy, as some are driving to Long Beach and Norwalk neighborhoods to find eggs.\n\n\u201cThey put a limit to how many eggs you can get,\u201d Long said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just go and get however many we need. I do know that a few of us do have to spread out and just buy eggs wherever we can, whether that be at the main restaurant depot we normally shop at or Food 4 Less, whatever store we can go and get eggs from.\u201d\n\nIn January, the average local price for eggs in California soared to an all-time high of $5.97, up from $1.92 last year, according to data from the federal reserve. Shelves are completely empty at Trader Joe\u2019s in the USC Village. A carton of eggs at the neighborhood grocery store costs customers up to $4.99. Prices are steeper at the Village Target, with prices as high as $7.49 a carton.\n\nFor students like Kayla Mahboubi, a senior studying computational neuroscience, eggs are a \u201cmust-have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually go to the market, but when I do, I have realized that eggs are very expensive,\u201d Mahboubi said. \u201cIt definitely affects a lot of people because eggs are such a staple, so when they\u2019re expensive, it can definitely hurt a lot of families.\u201d\n\nA widespread bird flu outbreak has exacerbated the egg shortage, with rising fuel and packaging costs also to blame for the high prices, according to the New York Times. More than five million birds across 47 states, including California, have been infected with the disease, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. About 340,000 more birds caught the virus in January as prices continued to soar.\n\nAs a result, some USC students are looking to online grocers to find their eggs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really hard,\u201d said Sophia Schreiber, a freshman majoring in business. \u201cMy roommates and I eat lots of eggs with our breakfast, so we\u2019ve been having difficulty getting eggs and every time we go in stores they\u2019re sold out, so we\u2019ve been having to order them on Amazon.\u201d\n\nOther students said the crisis is changing the way they eat.\n\n\u201cI have been struggling,\u201d Zine Hassfuther, a sophomore business administration student said. \u201cI\u2019ve been changing my diet around the shortage of eggs.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of lincolnblues licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)\n\nBy Tony Fajardo and Veronique Louis-Jacques\nJanuary 25, 2023 at 6:19 pm PST\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences revealed its full list of nominees for the 95th Oscars on Tuesday and USC students weighed in on the historic nominations. The 95th Annual Oscar nominations are bringing many firsts, with 16 of the 20 actors being nominated for the first time. In the Best Actor category, for once, all those nominated are first-time nominees, with names like Austin Butler for \u201cElvis,\u201d Paul Mescal for \u201cAftersun\u201d and Brendan Fraser for \u201cThe Whale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s super awesome that there\u2019s so many first-time nominees, especially the actors, like leading actor,\u201d said Aisha Yamamoto, a biomedical engineering student. \u201cI think that\u2019s really cool to see, like new names up there because it\u2019s usually like[a] repeat, every year the same name.\u201d\n\nAmong these first-timers is USC alum Ke Huy Quan, who graduated from USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts in 1999 and is nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His nomination comes after years of struggling to find work in the nearly 40 years that followed his appearance in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, according to Vanity Fair. Quan is nominated for his portrayal of Waymond Wang in \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d a film that dominated with 11 nominations, the most of any other film this year.\n\nBut Academy members are not the only ones who consider this film one of 2022\u2032s best. Aya Obeid, a junior majoring in International Relations, considered the film \u201cone of the best movies [she\u2019d] seen in a really long time.\u201d, saying, \u201dI feel like it was a great, [the] representation and [the] reflection of how right now we\u2019re fed so much media and so we get really bored really easily.\u201d Obeid added, \u201cBut I also just felt so emotionally connected with the main character.\u201d\n\nEven those who do not include the film in their list of favorites consider the film a notable success, like in the case of Isabelle Leonard, a junior majoring in Film and TV production. \u201cI am happy from an independent film perspective because independent films like even if it wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, I can see that the film is important and it clearly impacted a lot of people,\u201d said Leonard.\n\nBeyond the plot, Michelle Yeoh\u2019s performance was also praised by students. \u201cShe is really good and I think like her range in that role, I think that\u2019s deserving,\u201d said Leonard. Yeoh is also the first Asian actress nominated in the Leading category in 88 years, since Merle Oberon\u2019s nomination in 1935.\n\nBut while Oscar night has the potential to gain historic winners, many people might not even tune in, as viewership numbers over the years suggest the ceremony is losing its touch with the general public. With a recent high of 43.7 million viewers in 2014 to a low of 10.4 million in 2021, a sentiment that can be reflected by the opinion of USC students.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably not that relevant to most people. I think most people are not watching it. I think the biggest problem with the Oscars, other than it being way too long, is that a lot of the movies are not relevant to normal people,\u201d said Graham Bertoni, a junior studying Film and TV Production.\n\nMany USC students admitted to not paying attention to the Oscars at all and were not informed about the nominees. Even film students like Leonard felt disenchanted with the awards show, particularly this year.\n\n\u201c[The nominations] made me reflect on the year and how for me, at least this year, [it] didn\u2019t hit that hard in terms of the movies that came out.

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nBy John Walker January 24, 2023 at 9:52 pm PST\n\nThe 95th Academy Awards nominations came out this morning, rounding up this year\u2019s awards season. There weren\u2019t too many snubs in each category; however, there were some surprises. This year might not have the strongest slate of films compared to previous years, but the front runners have been a lock for some time in multiple categories.\n\nLet\u2019s start with one of the biggest surprises of the day. Nobody in the awards sphere had \u201cTo Leslie\u2019s\u201d Andrea Riseborough getting a nomination over Viola Davis for \u201cThe Woman King\u201d or Danielle Deadwyler for \u201cTill\u201d for Best Actress. This is Riseborough\u2019s third nomination for this film following nods from the Independent Spirit Awards and the Chicago Film Critics Association this season. It\u2019s next to impossible to see her winning over current frontrunners Michelle Yeoh and Cate Blanchett, and yet, stranger things have happened.\n\nNeither \u201cThe Woman King\u201d nor \u201cTill\u201d got a nomination this year. \u201cThe Woman King\u201d made a case for Best Picture after a successful box office run and was thought to make Makeup and Costumes, but the Academy went in a different direction. \u201cTo Leslie\u201d was another South By Southwest premiere with Best Picture frontrunner \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once.\u201d Riseborough, her team and the team behind \u201cTo Leslie\u201d went on one of the most successful Oscar campaigns in recent history, after it opened to rave reviews and is currently at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, went from being a festival darling to an Oscar nominee. Maybe Netflix should take some notes from this campaign.\n\nThis year the company has very little footprint. Ana De Armas somehow snuck in a nomination after \u201cBlonde\u201d was nominated for two Razzies. However, she was nominated for a SAG award, which is pretty good momentum for an Oscar nomination. \u201cGlass Onion\u201d also got the boot from the Best Picture race, which isn\u2019t too surprising. \u201cGlass Onion\u201d is almost on par with the original \u201cKnives Out\u201d film, but not quite topping it. On the other hand, Rian Johnson definitely deserves his nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, though he probably won\u2019t win.\n\nNetflix\u2019s current contender is \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front.\u201d It received nine nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay, Picture, Cinematography, International Feature Film and Picture. It was kind of expected as a World War I epic, but it\u2019s probably only in the conversation for Cinematography. Netflix will likely walk away with only one Oscar this season, if they\u2019re lucky.\n\nAnother movie that didn\u2019t get love this year at the Oscars is \u201cBabylon,\u201d and despite the film\u2019s Golden Globe and Critics Choice nominations, neither Margot Robbie nor Brad Pitt received nominations. It\u2019s not so shocking since the individual actors didn\u2019t receive nominations for the SAG Awards even though they got a nod for Best Performance by a Cast. While the acting branch nominated the acting awards and the producing branch nominated Best Picture, it was a surprise not to see Babylon get a nomination for Best Picture. It just goes to show that not every movie about movies is a shoo-in.\n\nLuckily there is no chance for a reprise of the infamous \u201cLa La Land\u201d fiasco. The Best Picture nomination went as expected. Following a push for India\u2019s film submission, \u201cRRR\u201d didn\u2019t get another nomination. People were hoping for a \u201cParasite\u201d-like win for the film, but Hollywood isn\u2019t ready to let Bollywood outshine on Oscar night, so it wasn\u2019t a shock when \u201cRRR\u201d didn\u2019t get a nomination for Best Picture.\n\nSurprisingly, \u201cTriangle of Sadness\u201d made the list. It won the Palme D\u2019or at Canne but didn\u2019t get traction following the festival. It also received a nomination for Best Director, beating out Joseph Kosinski for \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d Neither nomination shakes up the respective front runners, but it\u2019s nice to see a smaller indie film make both categories.\n\nAs per the Best Director category, men dominated again. It was a crowded field with James Cameron and Rian Johnson notably not getting nods. However, the Academy did not nominate any women directors. It was hard to see Sarah Polly, Maria Schrader and Gina Prince-Bythewood making it without their respective films being nominated for Best Picture. However, I definitely see Polly take home the prize for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nSee the full list of nominations here.\n```"}

And I hope that the next generation [of athletes] just goes from there and continues to take it and grow and just reach for the stars.\u201d\n\nWhile most buildings and monuments around campus are named for USC founders and donors, Felix earned this honor through her athletic excellence and advocacy work. Felix notably refused to renegotiate her contract with Nike when they planned to cut her contract by 70% after she gave birth to her daughter. Felix has since signed with Athleta, started her own brand Saysh and continues to advocate for female athletes.\n\nWhile her initial fight for maternal protections was a long, hard slog, Felix has no plans to give up any time soon. \u201cI think going down that path has just show[n] me how much more work there is to do, and so now I\u2019ve really shifted my attention to child care and the need for that,\u201d Felix said. \u201cBut just wanting to expand on that \u2013 my dream is for that to just be the standard, where you don\u2019t even think twice about it. So, just finding different ways to advocate for women and to make things easier so they don\u2019t have to make these very tough decisions.\u201d\n\nThe track field is the latest USC structure to be stripped of its controversial name, following the renaming of what is now the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs last year. Though other controversial monuments still stand on campus, Felix said she feels happy and thankful that USC is renaming the on-campus monuments so that \u201chistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I had the conversation with President Folt, I think the thing that really stuck out to me was that USC is going through this process of renaming these buildings that need to be renamed,\u201d Felix said. \u201cAnd obviously it\u2019s an honor, but to me, it\u2019s really more. I feel grateful that we\u2019re thinking about ... the ideals that we\u2019re wanting students to look to, that\u2019s a part of the process as well.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Los Angeles and having family members that attended USC, Felix remained conscious of the university\u2019s legacy years before she herself became a Trojan. Now that USC is facing the history behind its campus\u2019s controversial namesakes, she expressed excitement for the university\u2019s bright future and the legacy of Allyson Felix Field.\n\nAs for the athletes that will make use of it, Felix encouraged them to shoot for greatness not just on the field, but off of it. \u201cObviously, student athletes are at the school to get a great education and also to fulfill their potential in sports. But I think that what we\u2019re seeing right now for athletes is that we\u2019re interested in what they have to say and what they think on other things as well,\u201d Felix said. \u201cAnd so I hope that they feel empowered, that their opinions matter on a vast array of things, and that they can weigh in and also understand the weight of their platform as well.\u201d\n```"}

Now, it\u2019s a painful reminder that Asian Americans need to live on high alert \u2014 even in places that feel like home.\n\nThe Monterey Park Lunar New Year festival that was canceled following the shooting at Star Dance Studio. (Photo by Draco Guan)\n\nBy Jacqueline Cao\nJanuary 23, 2023 at 3:08 pm PST\n\nI know Monterey Park well. It\u2019s where I escape to for Chinese food on days when I\u2019m due to reconnect with my heritage or when speaking in Cantonese with strangers at 99 Ranch Market will bring me a sense of comfort that I don\u2019t feel with anyone else. My friends and I have spent hours gossiping over stacks of bamboo steamers, talking so incessantly that the har gow cools before we reach for our chopsticks. For dinner, we usually opt for Sichuan chili dishes that light our tongues on fire. We cry because the food is too spicy and because we are laughing too much and because the food is too spicy and we laugh again. If I could describe the San Gabriel Valley in one word, it would be: safe. Safe to eat the food that I love, safe to interact in my mother\u2019s mother tongue, safe because it feels like home.\n\nBut after the mass shooting in Monterey Park, I fear that any semblance of the safety that I felt before has been forcibly stripped away. On Saturday, Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve, a gunman opened fire in a busy dance studio in Monterey Park, where many locals gathered after that night\u2019s jubilant celebrations. He killed 11 people and injured another nine in one of California\u2019s deadliest mass shootings.\n\nMonterey Park, where Asians make up 65% of the population, is a central hub where locals and visitors alike gather to eat hot pot, enjoy bubble tea, shop for groceries and visit family. The dance studio where the shooting occurred was a cultural pillar for the neighborhood\u2019s multi-generational community and had attracted amateur and professional performers for nearly 30 years. The streets of downtown were decorated with lucky red lanterns and banners to welcome an auspicious new year, which, according to the Chinese zodiac calendar, is the Year of the Rabbit. This year is expected to be both lucky and disruptive.\n\nI\u2019m not superstitious. But to have such a senseless act of violence happen just minutes before the start of a year that is predicted to be unstable makes me skeptical about whether I should be. Ask me how I feel; I\u2019m not sure how to respond. Perhaps I\u2019m numb. Perhaps I don\u2019t know how to reckon with my grief on what is supposed to be the happiest day of the year. Perhaps I\u2019m still reeling from the 2021 shooting spree that killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women, at three different spas in the metropolitan Atlanta area. Or perhaps I would say that I\u2019m paranoid. I am more anxious about my surroundings these days, especially in New York, where a 40-year-old Asian woman was fatally pushed in front of an oncoming subway train on January 15, 2022. I previously lived in Flushing, New York, a predominantly Asian neighborhood where anti-Asian violence, fueled by the pandemic\u2019s anti-Chinese rhetoric, continues to this day (even with a drastic increase in New York Police Department budget). For a while, I didn\u2019t leave my home without a self-defense weapon. But how can a pathetic pepper spray shield anyone against a semiautomatic assault pistol?\n\nI feel afraid. I fear for the elderly, who were already on edge from anti-Asian attacks and now have had their local fun and welcoming community center taken from them. I fear for myself, my family, my friends, my community. Make no mistake: The shooting in Monterey Park \u2014 and the many other massacres that have preceded and will inevitably follow \u2014 is an issue of senseless gun violence in the United States. Maybe one day our politicians will dutifully protect their citizens against guns instead of doing anything but. For now, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll return to the comfort of San Gabriel Valley. But my people are strong and resilient; I know we will rebuild and recover.\n```"}

(Photo by Yusra Farzan)\n\nBy Celine Maia Mendiola and Yusra Farzan January 23, 2023 at 11:40 am PST\n\nContent Warning: This story contains mention of suicidal ideation and substance abuse.\n\nIf a student facing a mental health crisis today gets a visit from Department of Public Safety officers, they will be joined by a licensed medical health professional under a new program the university announced late last year. The Mental Health Assistance and Response Team (MHART) was designed to have \u201cstudents in crisis \u2014 or potentially in crisis \u2014 that are having mental health issues to interact primarily with mental health clinicians as an alternative to law enforcement.\u201d\n\nHad such a policy been in place in October 2021, one particular student might have had a completely different encounter, not the \u201cfrightful, misinformed experience\u201d she described having.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a year since a first-generation USC student was placed on a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold, forcing her to take a leave of absence in spring 2022. Though she\u2019s back at school, she said her mental health struggles and USC\u2019s response still make her feel like a \u201cDementor is sucking my soul out of me,\u201d using a Harry Potter analogy.\n\nThe student, who worked as a resident assistant in university housing, described in a series of interviews over more than a year a \u201cfrightful\u201d experience that was, at best, \u201cmisinformed,\u201d and at worst, a demonstration of a deeply flawed system for USC students in crisis.\n\n\u201cI survived \u2014 all by myself,\u201d said the student. Annenberg Media is not naming the student because she is worried speaking out will jeopardize her career prospects. The USC student has also not shared her mental health struggles with her family due to their religious beliefs.\n\nUSC called this particular situation an \u201cextremely unlikely scenario\u201d and outlined a very different process for what happens when a student reaches out for help.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety. As in-person classes resumed in 2021, the USC resident assistant struggled to manage her chronic illness. She could attain disability accommodations, receive deadline extensions and regularly attend therapy, but she still felt overwhelmed by the time the fall break of 2021 rolled around.\n\n\u201cI have to work a lot of jobs a semester since my family abroad has been really impacted by the virus, and therefore my mom was having a hard time making rent,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the pressure of working a lot of jobs and navigating the workplace as a first-generation woman of color and this disability became a lot for me.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 2021, feeling overwhelmed, she called the USC crisis support hotline. \u201cI was able to get on the phone with a psychiatrist, and I told him that I was eyeing my medication and how easy it would be to take more than one,\u201d she said. The counselor on the hotline was able to help the student with coping mechanisms and breathing exercises.\n\nThe next evening, she felt the same way and called the hotline again. Since it was after hours, she reached a nurse practitioner. What happened next left her feeling traumatized and dehumanized, something she said illustrates a bigger problem at USC.\n\nThe nurse practitioner asked the RA general questions about herself and promised to send help. Suddenly, she was confronted by three fully-armed DPS officers, the student said. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s going on? Why are these armed officers at my door?\u2019 It was really scary. \u2018Why are the police here?\u2019\u201d she recounted in an interview soon after the incident.\n\nAnnenberg Media has spoken to the student several times since reporting began in 2021. \u201cI didn\u2019t commit a crime. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I did not overdose. I was just scared out of my wits,\u201d the student said. She said she felt uncomfortable and scared by the DPS officers\u2019 presence in her apartment, especially since they were armed in what she considered a non-violent situation.\n\nShe said she was transported to Las Encinas Mental Health Hospital in Pasadena to be placed under a 72-hour psychiatric hold without fully understanding what was happening. Annenberg Media verified this information by cross-checking that day\u2019s DPS logs.\n\nThe student\u2019s testimony and USC Student Health\u2019s procedures for putting a student in a 72-hour hold do not match. The student\u2019s journal detailed everything that happened the night she was admitted into Las Encinas, including: \u201cI was not able to speak to a mental health professional.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s Mishandling\n\nDanielle Gautt, assistant director of outreach and prevention services at USC Student Health\u2019s Counseling and Mental Health Services (CMH), stated that the hospitalization process is nuanced. \u201cWe\u2019re really talking about individuals who have a plan, who have intent to possibly harm themselves and also can\u2019t really commit to safety,\u201d she said. Gautt reiterated that self-injurious behavior is not a criterion for hospitalization. It is only when a student\u2019s safety is at imminent risk that such action is taken, Gautt said.\n\nIn a separate interview, Dr. Steven Siegel, chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Keck, echoed Gautt, adding that a 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold \u201conly ever occurs when the student or a person, when the identified person has made it very clear, unequivocally clear, that they are a danger to themselves, or someone else.\u201d\n\nSiegel outlined a comprehensive, multi-step process for someone placed in this hold. \u201cNo one is ever hospitalized directly from that single interaction [over the phone]. Assessments are always done in person,\u201d Gautt said in a 2021 interview. \u201cEvery assessment, someone is physically there.\u201d\n\nHowever, the MHART program \u2014 in which a counselor accompanies DPS officers in a mental health emergency \u2014 was only established in September 2022. Gautt said that after business hours, a call to the crisis hotline is routed to Protocol, a mental health crisis service organization. Protocol providers are clinicians who do a general screening. If they think additional services are needed, a CMH clinician is available 24/7 to provide consultation and additional support. Siegel reiterated this point in a subsequent interview.\n\nThe USC RA said her call was not routed to CMH. Instead, she said, the officers took her to Las Encinas, where she spent three traumatic nights, without support or follow-up from the university.\n\n\u201cI came back to my apartment and how do I pick up the pieces from here? I went through such a dehumanizing experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI sat at my little desk and my desk is next to the door of my apartment, and I just kept seeing the DPS officers coming in and replaying everything that happened.\u201d\n\nWhen specifically asked about how USC did not reach out after this student\u2019s experience, Siegel declined to comment on a specific student\u2019s experience due to privacy. He added that USC will follow the appropriate processes to ensure it has a student\u2019s consent before coordinating care. Once they are discharged, he said, the university will \u201creach out to them. We offer them care. We try to provide them follow-up appointments, even help facilitate whether they need to go to something called an IOP as a step-down, or have their care at USC through CMH counseling and mental health.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s relationship with Las Encinas\n\nLas Encinas has a longstanding partnership with USC, according to Gautt. Siegel also emphasized their \u201cvery high quality\u201d programs. However, the student described otherwise.\n\nIn a journal entry, the USC student writes: I grabbed breakfast to only find...it had a piece of metal in it. I got a new breakfast.\u201d (Photo by Yusra Farzan)\n\nDuring her time there, the student\u2019s vegetarian breakfast was \u201cburnt,\u201d and, she later wrote in her journal, she discovered \u201ca piece of metal in [her] food.\u201d The hospital staff said they would report it, but did not seem too concerned, she said.\n\nThe student said she spoke to other female patients at the hospital. They all had similar beaded bracelets they crafted while making jewelry, one of the activities organized by the hospital. \u201cA lot of their bracelets said \u2018fuck this place.\u2019 It was spelled out,\u201d she said. She understood these girls\u2019 sentiments.\n\nThe hospital had one communal restroom and the staff did not provide patients with shower shoes. The female patients had to wear donated clothing and disposable underwear while in the facility. The only time they were allowed to go outside was for cigarette breaks.\n\nThe hospital said they would have a social worker contact the student\u2019s managers to let them know why she missed work; however, when she was discharged, she found that they had not.\n\nThe USC student was admitted on a Saturday night, but had to wait till Monday to see a doctor. \u201cI just wanted to talk to someone, and I had no one to talk to,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like talking to the patients was way more therapeutic than my time there.\u201d\n\nThree interviews with other former Las Encinas patients and examinations of documents reveal that the USC student is not alone in her trauma. The interviewees, all women, shared their own agonizing experiences under a 72-hour psychiatric hold at Las Encinas after calling the Los Angeles Police Department emergency line.\n\nWhen the USC student finally met the doctor that following Monday, he asked her basic questions about herself, such as what prompted her to be admitted and how Las Encinas was helping her. The doctor then said she could be discharged the next day and the hospital arranged for her to be dropped off.\n\n\u201cUSC did not provide the transport. I never once got a call from anyone from USC, any USC official or anything from the health office,\u201d she said.\n\nOther than bracelet-making, Las Encinas also organized activities like mini coloring pages for patients. The USC student shows her colored pages of houses and an owl. (Photo by Yusra Farzan)\n\nMore than a year after her 72-hour hold, the RA had to pick up the pieces alone. In follow-up interviews, she reiterated that USC has never checked in on her during her time at Las Encinas or any time after. She now attends weekly therapy sessions, which she says help to an extent.\n\nAround the first anniversary of the incident, the RA was overwhelmed, saying, \u201cThere were days where I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I was just crying, overcome with grief.\u201d\n\nThe RA wishes that USC had a more transparent process of handling mental health emergencies. Still, against all odds, she has been trying to take care of herself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be defined by my trauma; I want to define my trauma,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to let other students and readers know that they\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not the only person that experiences trauma.\u201d\n\nIf you have an experience you\u2019d like to share, Annenberg Media would like to hear from you.

After the credits rolled on the screening of \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio,\u201d del Toro took the stage with SCA professor Josh Staub for a Q&A.\n\nDel Toro discussed his perspective on the themes of his latest feature film, reflecting on the idea that \u201cdisobedience is a virtue.\u201d \u201cIdeology is something hollow that didn\u2019t come from you; it is handed to you and you are told to obey it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not nurture your soul, nor who you are, it benefits no one, but you fall in line. An idea, even if it\u2019s a wrong idea, comes from your experience and your spiritual component and even if you\u2019re wrong, you will grow out of that.\u201d\n\nTo del Toro, Pinocchio represents a sense of irony that, although a puppet, he is the only one free from the ties of fascism and order. It is through this story that he seeks to inspire a sense of conscious disobedience. \u201cWe have to be disobedient, every fucking person,\u201d he expresses. \u201cYou cannot just assume your parents are right or teachers are right or the government is good, fuck that! You have to say \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Why is this?\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough del Toro has worked across multiple animation projects, ranging from \u201cKung Fu Panda 2\u2032\u2032 to \u201cTrollhunters,\u201d \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio\u201d is his first animation endeavor as the director. Even so, he explained how, to him, \u201cthere are no boundaries\u201d between the mediums of live-action and animation. His iconic phrase from his recent Golden Globe acceptance speech,  \u201cAnimation is not a genre for kids. It\u2019s a medium,\u201d  continues to be a constant driving force in his storytelling.\n\n\u201cThe majority of studios in America, they just want to create babysitter movies,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019re going to go into an industry where you\u2019re going to be animating a fucking dancing yogurt can, and you\u2019re going to want to commit suicide!\u201d Rather, del Toro hopes to see an industry where animation embraces mundane imperfections to bring art to life.\n\n\u201cI was watching [My Neighbor Totoro] for the first time, and when the father goes to put his shoe in, he misses the shoe, he misses the shoe, he gets the shoe in. Those two mistakes represent weeks of work, but life is contained in there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more gestures like that you create, the more we see actors and you stop seeing the technique, you stop seeing the CG or the 2D or the stop motion, and you start feeling for them as if they were living people.\u201d\n\nBut what makes a del Toro film uniquely his? According to him, it all comes down to the fact that, \u201cI\u2019m Mexican!\u201d \u201cSomeone who comes from our culture as strong as ours has a nearness with death that is intimate,\u201d said del Toro. \u201cAnglo-Saxon culture likes to enhance success and youth and looking good and values that really make you forget death... and in Mexico, we are so aware of the nearness of death that we believe and live with a great intensity.\u201d\n\nHe cites how the wood sprite and death in  \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio\u201d  as well as the monsters in \u201cPacific Rim\u201d are essentially  \u201calebrijes,\u201d  or fantastical creatures from Mexican folk culture. In regard to his visual style, he gave a distinction between \u201ceye candy\u201d and \u201ceye protein.\u201d \u201cEye candy is just brief. Eye protein is telling the story through the visual medium,\u201d said del Toro.\n\nBefore the end of the Q&A, del Toro left the aspiring filmmakers and creatives with some advice. He urged artists to find the freedom to create even when constrained, citing how, when working under the Weinstein company for \u201cMimic,\u201d he found a way to dictate his unique visual style even when the studio controlled nearly everything else, from screenplay to casting to tone. \u201cDisobedience is not a tantrum, it\u2019s just finding your freedom in the spaces you have,\u201d del Toro said.\n\nFor the acclaimed director, the only path towards art is to be proactive. \u201cOnly love and passion and rage will lead you to art. Fear will never lead you to art,\u201d he said, \u201cBeing modest, scared, quiet, prudent is bullshit! You have to be true. You have to be fierce and you have to be brave and you have to risk fucking up royally because let me tell you, my only definition of success is fucking up on your own terms.\u201d\n\nAfter the event, fans funneled into a line to the lobby of the theater to meet the director, armed with everything from \u201cPacific Rim\u201d posters to \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d DVDs to figurines of del Toro in hopes of getting an autograph. For the many starstruck students who got to see the famed artist, they\u2019ll be sure to be like Pinocchio, sighing, \u201cWhat a day! What a day!\u201d through the night.\n```"}

In a game featuring two of the best defensive and lowest scoring teams in the Pac-12, the scoring started much quicker than one would expect. The Huskies opened up with two layups from sophomore forward Dalayah Daniels, and the rest of the team followed suit by starting off red hot, shooting 6-for-8 from the field. USC struggled early in the first quarter, allowing 19 first quarter points and giving up six turnovers. It was tied for the most first quarter points scored on a typically suffocating Trojans defense this season.\n\nThe second quarter was more favorable for USC. The Trojans outscored the Huskies 9-7 and only had two turnovers. Graduate guard Destiny Littleton and graduate forward Kadi Sissoko took turns chipping away at the Husky lead. With 2:38 to play in the half, Sissoko hit a midrange fadeaway to cut the lead to four. Then, with three seconds to play in the half, Littleton hit a fadeaway midrange shot over three Washington defenders to keep the Trojans\u2019 deficit at just four at half. By halftime, Littleton, Sissoko and redshirt freshman guard Taylor Bigby had combined for 20 of the Trojans\u2019 22 points.\n\nThe second half started with a bang for the Trojans. Graduate guard Okako Adika hit a three nearly four minutes into the half to tie the game for the first time since the opening tip. Then, with 5:02 left in the quarter, Littleton swished a three to put the Trojans up four. Halftime defensive adjustments were key to the USC win, as the Trojans started the half on a 12-4 run. Nearly every single possession, USC forced the Huskies to use the entire shot clock.\n\n\u201cWe just started ball screen coverage because they went to hit the roller so often,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cWe allowed [sophomore forward Rayah Marshall] to play more in space and I thought she was tremendous in doing that.\u201d\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Trojans brought even more defensive energy. Marshall had five blocks in the fourth quarter alone and single-handedly scared Washington out of the paint. Courtesy of Marshall\u2019s defensive effort, the Trojans went on a 10-2 run during part of the final frame. With seven seconds left in regulation, Washington was down three points and needed a prayer to force overtime. But junior forward Lauren Schwartz heaved up a contested three and drilled it to send the game to overtime.\n\nThough there was a dramatic ending to regulation, it was all USC in overtime. The Trojans outscored the Huskies 9-0 with the Trojans\u2019 stifling defense coming up huge, forcing five turnovers in overtime alone. Going into overtime, Gottlieb saw the extra time as a challenge to test the team\u2019s intensity.\n\n\u201cThis is a chance to see how tough we are, mentally and physically,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working really hard, we\u2019ve been talking about what it takes to win games beyond X\u2019s and O\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWith a tough road stretch still to play, Gottlieb is ready for the challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about getting back, getting recovered and getting our minds right to be road warriors for another weekend,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nUSC now moves to 15-4 overall and 5-3 in conference play. The Trojans will take on Utah Friday in Salt Lake City where the Trojans will look to extend their win streak to five.\n```"}

Ellis was the most consistent performer from start to finish, racking up nine points in each half on 7-of-16 shooting, including going 4-for-10 from 3-point range. Ellis added six rebounds, four assists and three steals to his statline.\n\n\u201cHe played a great floor game,\u201d Enfield said of Ellis. \u201cHe made shots and also rebounded the ball.\u201d\n\nTwo key scorers for the Trojans in the first half were freshman guard Tre White and freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu. White recorded eight first-half points and finished the game with 12 total on 5-of-10 shooting. Iwuchukwu, in his fourth career collegiate game, also had eight points in the first half. He finished with 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting. The 7-foot-1 big man, who ranked 25th in the 2022 recruiting class, added five boards and one block.\n\n\u201cHe was very good tonight,\u201d Enfield said of Iwuchukwu. \u201cHe offensively finished around the rim, and then defensively, he still has to get better. He\u2019s working on it.\u201d\n\nUSC played well as a team and went into halftime with a 43-33 lead. Peterson broke out in the second half, recording 15 points. He finished the game with 19 points and shot 7-for-11, including 3-for-6 from deep. He filled up the remainder of his statsheet with eight rebounds, four assists, three steals and two blocks, all of which led the Trojans or were tied for the lead.\n\n\u201cHe had a full line of every stat this game,\u201d Enfield said of Peterson\u2019s all-around performance.\n\nWith four minutes remaining, USC had a 77-57 lead. However, USC\u2019s seven turnovers within these last minutes \u2014 four of which were given up by Peterson \u2014 allowed the Sun Devils to cut their deficit to 10 with one minute remaining.\n\n\u201cThe last four minutes was one of the worst four minutes of basketball I\u2019ve ever been a part of,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about two senior guards [Peterson and Ellis] that turned it over. You\u2019re talking about [sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters] and Tre that are good ball handlers.\u201d\n\nIt was too little too late, however, as USC held off the Sun Devils in the final minute of play.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually glad that we can learn from this because that can never happen again,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey just relaxed and didn\u2019t finish the game the way they should\u2019ve.\u201d\n\nUSC will return home to face No. 5 UCLA at Galen Center on Thursday at 6 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe have to play like we did for 36 minutes tonight. Pretty simple,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIf we play like that, we\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll have a great home crowd advantage. We\u2019re very good at home.\u201d\n\nThe last time the Trojans faced the Bruins was on the road on Jan. 5, and the Trojans lost 60-58.\n```"}

Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Spreading Grounds to spotlight successful efforts by the Biden-Harris administration to secure funding for local infrastructure projects. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration plans to extend $12 billion to western water system infrastructure projects.\n\n\u201cThis funding will help build diversified water projects like the Tujunga Spreading Grounds in communities across the West, increasing drought resilience and protecting water resources,\u201d a White House official said.\n\nHarris stressed the importance of building infrastructure to withstand droughts and floods and multilateral cooperation from federal, state and local governments to maximize and preserve clean potable water for the future. Harris talked about how the Tujunga Spreading Grounds are a model for the future development of water systems.\n\n\u201cWork that is happening in this facility and in California [is] an example of what can and should be happening throughout our country and around the world,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHarris\u2019 motorcade arrives at the Tujunga Spreading Grounds at 1:30 p.m., where she discussed federal efforts working to mitigate the effects of drought and floods.\n\nHarris said a major goal for this funding is to \u201cbuild up resilience and adaptation [by] investing in smart ways to store water so that we will have that water in times of crisis.\u201d\n\nAfter Harris spoke, Wade Crowfoot, the California Natural Resources Secretary, discussed the weather turmoil in California in recent weeks after nine successive atmospheric river storms slammed the state.\n\n\u201cWe have recently pivoted from the driest three-year period since 1896 to the wettest three weeks on record,\u201d he said. \u201cThis weather whiplash is challenging us and challenging our infrastructure as never before.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to understand how to capture all of the precipitation that falls in the set of storms, like that which we just had, for extended dry periods which we continue to face,\u201d Crowfoot said.\n\nThis spring, the California Natural Resources Agency will focus on how to acquire and maintain the water from mountain snow melt that creates high river flows and gather it into reservoirs, and more importantly, into the ground for future use.\n\nCrowfoot, standing in front of Harris, Senator Alex Padilla, and Congressman Tony Cardenas, explains that a key step in the future of water maintenance is to recycle drinking water.\n\n\u201cScience tells us that hotter temperatures mean that we'll lose about 10% of our water supply by 2040 ... so we need to supplant or replace that water supply. Some of that is through groundwater recharge. A lot of that is through water recycling, using water molecules more than once,\u201d Crowfoot said.\n\nMark Pestrella, the director of Los Angeles County Public Works, explains the spreading grounds system employed at Tujunga.\n\nPadilla listens to Harris as she explains how federal funding will be used to support projects that can have a substantial impact on improving the state's water infrastructure.\n\nCardenas points out the storage capabilities and a level of water containing 18 feet of water. \u201cThat means the spreading grounds and over time are going to make enough water to sustain millions of people for generations to come,\u201d Cardenas said.\n\nHarris stayed at the event for 25 minutes. After leaving, Padilla, Horvath, and Cardenas further spoke about local collaboration and the Biden administration\u2019s demonstrated commitment to California.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Terence Holton January 22, 2023 at 10:33 am PST\n\nEven though the 2022 college football season has come to a close, the offseason is just heating up. Once again, USC head coach Lincoln Riley has put the transfer portal to good use; here are some of the key players the Trojans have brought in to bolster their roster.\n\nCopper State Stars: \nSophomore wide receiver Dorian Singer \u2014 Arizona, junior cornerback Christian Roland-Wallace \u2014 Arizona\n\nThe USC coaching staff committed highway robbery on the Arizona Wildcats and stole two of their best players on offense and defense \u2014 both of which will be immediate impact starters. Dorian Singer is arguably the best deep-ball wide receiver in the Pac-12, equipped with hands like glue. This past season, he racked up 1,105 yards, 66 receptions and six touchdowns. Against the Trojans, he made two incredible one-handed grabs and went for 141 yards and three touchdowns. Keep your eye out on this one USC fans \u2014 Singer will be a star.\n\nMeanwhile, Singer\u2019s Wildcat counterpart, Christian Roland-Wallace, will be a great replacement for cornerback Mekhi Blackmon. In 2022, Roland-Wallace chalked up 41 solo tackles, two forced fumbles and six pass breakups. While the stats aren\u2019t anything special, I am confident Roland-Wallace will be a favorable addition to a USC secondary that struggled at times in man coverage.\n\nUSC to USC: \nRedshirt sophomore running back MarShawn Lloyd \u2014 South Carolina\n\nLloyd will be another immediate impact player, as the redshirt sophomore led the Gamecocks in yards, attempts and touchdowns on the ground. The Trojan backfield already has a tandem of freshman Raleek Brown and senior Austin Jones, so it will be interesting to see how Lloyd will fit into the mix. Regardless, the run game will be explosive next year.\n\nTrench Warfare: \nRedshirt sophomore offensive tackle Michael Tarquin \u2014 Florida, redshirt junior offensive guard Jarrett Kingston \u2014 Washington State\n\nThe USC offensive line is losing three of its five starters from this past season, so naturally Lincoln Riley goes out and grabs two of the best offensive linemen in the portal. Both Kingston and Tarquin went down midseason with injuries and were unable to play the rest of the year. However, both are very versatile pass and run blockers and will be huge additions to the building blocks of the Trojan offense.\n\nGrinch\u2019s Goons: \nFreshman defensive end Anthony Lucas \u2014 Texas A&M, redshirt senior defensive end Jack Sullivan \u2014 Purdue, junior linebacker Mason Cobb \u2014 Oklahoma State.\n\nThe USC defense this season was like a box of donuts: good, but with a lot of holes. However, I have to hand it to defensive coordinator Alex Grinch, who has gone out and gotten multiple immediate impact players for this Trojan defense. Anthony Lucas will have the most hype of the defensive line additions coming into spring camp. He was a highly touted recruit coming out of high school and part of Texas A&M\u2019s historic recruiting class. Consequently, Lucas was buried in the depth chart and was suspended for off-the-field reasons. However, the potential is still there, and he will have the opportunity to fill the hole of departing defensive end Tuli Tuipulotu.\n\nOpposite of Lucas on the defensive line will be Jack Sullivan. At Purdue last season, Sullivan recorded 5.5 sacks, 24 solo tackles and one forced fumble. Sullivan should bring his Big Ten battle-tested experience to the Trojan\u2019s front seven.\n\nMy favorite addition to the defense is junior linebacker Mason Cobb from Oklahoma State. Cobb had a breakout year with the Cowboys last season, recording 96 tackles, two sacks, one forced fumble and an interception. The USC defense struggled with tackling last season; Cobb will be a great addition to bring ferocity and leadership to the defense. Don\u2019t be surprised if the USC linebacker corps ends up being the best position group of the Trojan defense in 2023 with the addition of Cobb.\n\nUSC football once again went big in the transfer portal and currently possesses the No. 5 transfer portal class, according to 247 Sports. This new-look Trojan team could find its way to a Pac-12 Championship and maybe even a College Football Playoff berth with the help of these transfers.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/01/21/opinion-now-is-the-time-for-a-varsity-usc-softball-team/", "response": "```\nOpinion: Now is the time for a varsity USC softball team\n\nAs USC moves to the Big Ten, the athletic department needs to uphold its values of inclusivity and athleticism by giving softball players an official opportunity.\n\nUCLA huddles before an NCAA softball Women's College World Series game against Northwestern on Friday, June 3, 2022, in Oklahoma City. (AP Photo/Alonzo Adams)\n\nBy Drake Lee January 21, 2023 at 6:06 pm PST\n\nLast summer, USC shocked the collegiate world when the school announced its move from the Pac-12 to the Big Ten in 2024. The athletic department will receive more revenue from broadcasting and prime-time matchups with new rivals. The move has been seen by some experts as a decision driven by football and basketball. However, the change of scenery also offers a chance to empower underrepresented sports by establishing new franchises and providing more opportunities. One of these possibilities should be an official USC softball team.\n\nWhen USC moves from one Power Five conference to another, it will be the odd school out. All 14 teams in the Big Ten currently have an official softball program. UCLA, USC\u2019s partner in the move to the Big Ten, has one of the most dominant softball programs in the nation. In the Pac-12, USC is one of three schools that does not have a softball team, and it is the only Pac-12 school in California that does not have one. The Golden State has long been regarded as a softball hotspot. According to scholarshipstats.com, in 2018, 20% of all Division I athletes originated from California. However, for the numerous talented softball players across the state, the gates of USC are sealed shut, barring talented student-athletes from enjoying the active environment and prestigious academics of Troy.\n\nThe softball movement in California comes at a time when the sport is rapidly gaining popularity throughout the nation. In 2021, an average of 1.2 million people tuned into each game of the Women\u2019s College World Series \u2014 450,000 more than the Men\u2019s College World Series. More eyes are on the sport, which means more revenue for institutions and players. NIL funds are a good indicator of how popular a sport is at the national level. From 2021 to 2022, softball players received 2.3% of these funds, according to the Associated Press. While that percentage may sound insignificant, other sports already established at USC, such as women\u2019s soccer, men\u2019s volleyball, women\u2019s lacrosse and men\u2019s track and field, received fewer NIL contributions than softball. In other words, softball would likely make more money for the university and the players than many active Trojan athletic programs.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t USC have a softball team? The obvious reason is the lack of space on campus for another field. However, it is very puzzling that a university with one of the largest endowments in the United States cannot obtain land off campus for a softball field, especially considering that USC spent $25 million to acquire University Village in 1999 and spent a further $700 million to tear down the former University Village buildings and replace them with the USC Village of today. USC has proven its ability to construct incredible outdoor arenas with Dedeaux Field. According to USC Athletics\u2019s Website, the university has renovated Dedeaux several times, including a $4 million project that added a new clubhouse and players\u2019 lounge. If USC can assemble fields such as Dedeaux, why can\u2019t the university use its ingenuity to construct a magnificent softball field?\n\nIf USC does not want to buy new land, it has a world-renowned arena in its own backyard: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. According to its own website, the Coliseum has hosted practically everything from men\u2019s basketball to NASCAR to the Summer Olympics to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Imagine a UCLA-USC matchup in the Coliseum to commemorate USC softball\u2019s inaugural season. Young softball players from across California would come to celebrate the beginnings of a historic franchise. USC President Carol Folt would usher in a new era, speaking to scores of fans wearing blue or cardinal.\n\nSoftball\u2019s emergence would open up the door for even more athletic opportunities. Men\u2019s sports would need to be added to keep the university in line with Title IX. This gives the chance for teams such as men\u2019s soccer and men\u2019s lacrosse to be added as USC already has the facilities to house those programs. Athletic director Mike Bohn will go down in history as the man who moved USC to a more profitable market in the Big Ten. But can he add another historic notch to his belt? Can he capitalize on a growing business? Can he prove that the move to the Big Ten benefits sports outside of football and basketball? Can he inaugurate the next wave of varsity sports?\n```"}

All I knew of \u201cThe Woman King\u201d was from the short description on the film\u2019s promotional website: \u201cIn the 1800s, a group of all-female warriors protects the African kingdom of Dahomey with skills and fierceness unlike anything the world has ever seen. Faced with a new threat, Gen. Nanisca trains the next generation of recruits to fight against a foreign enemy that\u2019s determined to destroy their way of life.\u201d As to whether \u201cThe Woman King\u201d is based on a true story, the site states: \u201cThe basic framework of the story is based on true events, but it is heavily fictionalized and dramatized. The Agojie was an all-female warrior group that did exist and they did protect the kingdom of Dahomey (modern day Benin) in West Africa.\u201d\n\nOne of the ingredients of the film that makes it entertaining to watch is how the characters\u2019 personalities are developed. Prince-Bythewood gave actors \u2014 including Viola Davis and John Boyega \u2014 the opportunity to write their own backstories and develop their roles in a film pitched as an action drama that runs two hours and 14 minutes. The film\u2019s length gives enough time to develop characters through flashbacks and extended storytelling, allowing the audience to get to know the characters\u2019 emotional, heroic, romantic and dark sides through interweaving storylines.\n\nWhen asked how she was able to pivot from her first successful film in 2000, \u201cLove and Basketball,\u201d to action films, Prince-Bythewood explained that Hollywood does not think women watch action films \u2014 much less are able to direct them. Her thinking on the subject changed when she went to see a Marvel action film (pre-\u201dBlack Panther\u201d) with one of her sons and was inspired to create one based on his question, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I get to see myself like that?\u201d Prince-Bythewood was further inspired by watching \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d directed by Patty Jenkins, and went on to direct the action films \u201cSilver and Black\u201d and \u201cThe Old Guard.\u201d She mentioned that working with actors on \u201cThe Old Guard\u201d taught her what it takes to make a good action film. To get the best result, she is required to find actors who are able to do multiple takes \u2014 up to 20 \u2014 of a scene to get it right.\n\nSince its release last September, \u201cThe Woman King\u201d has grossed $94.3 million worldwide and has won several awards and garnered many nominations. Prince-Bythewood also mentioned that one aspect that has made her film successful, while others have failed, is that \u201cThe Woman King\u201d works as a historical epic, a character drama, and a super (kick-ass) action movie. When asked how she balanced all three of these elements in her film, she explained that an audience will not care about the action if they don\u2019t care about the characters. In order to build the story, she \u201cdrops crumbs that will pay off in the action.\u201d Prince-Bythewood also pointed out that one of her goals was to disrupt the action film genre, adding that, sadly, all it took \u201cwas putting Black women in the center of it.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Drake Lee January 20, 2023 at 11:12 pm PST\n\nHaving not played since late December, USC graduate forward Kadi Sissoko shook off any notions of rust, putting together 19 points in a 51-44 victory Friday night on the road against the Washington State Cougars.\n\n\u201cOur offense was a little bit out of rhythm, but Kadi provided a great skill set for us,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. Along with Sissoko, sophomore guard Rayah Marshall collected nine points and 13 rebounds. Junior guard Kayla Williams added eight more points of her own.\n\nOn the defensive side, the Trojans limited their opponent to 50 points or less for the 11th time this season. The Trojans entered Friday with the fifth-best scoring defense in Division 1, with opponents scoring 51.6 points per game. WSU was missing junior guard Charlisse Leger-Walker, who averages 20.7 points a game. In her absence, the Cougars shot 35% from the field, well below their season average of 45%.\n\n\u201cWashington State has a really complete offense,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt made me nervous because they played well against Oregon without Charlisse, so I knew we had to step up on defense even more. We did a good job forcing turnovers and putting pressure on them.\u201d\n\nIn Beasley Coliseum, both sides went scoreless for the first two minutes before Sissoko made two free throws with 8:11 to go in the first quarter. The two teams went back and forth for the remainder of the quarter with Sissoko scoring nine of the team\u2019s 13 points in the period.\n\nThe Cougar defense started to concentrate on Sissoko, even triple-teaming her at one point. Despite this, the forward from Paris scored two key jumpers in the final two minutes to give her 15 points for the half and the Trojans a 26-23 lead at the break.\n\nOut of the half, the Trojans extended their lead to as much as 13 points. However, the Cougars clawed back with a 9-2 run to end the third quarter. WSU senior center Bella Murekatete scored seven points in the final three minutes of the period to tighten the score to 42-36.\n\nWilliams got the Trojans rolling in the fourth with a quick layup. A 3-pointer off the backboard by senior guard Alyson Miura gave the Trojans a 47-36 lead. Once again, the Cougars struck back, going on an 8-0 run while keeping the Trojans scoreless for five minutes. The score got as close as 49-44, forcing Gottlieb to call a timeout.\n\n\u201cI just had to settle my team down, and remind them that we still had the lead,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI mainly wanted them to slow down the pace.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Trojan defense stifled the Cougars, keeping them off the board for the final three minutes and ensuring victory. The win moves the Trojans to 14-4 overall and 4-3 in the Pac-12.\n\nThe Trojans will try to make it three in a row against Washington (10-7 overall) at Alaska Airlines Arena in Seattle on Sunday. The Huskies are coming off a 51-47 loss to No. 9 UCLA and are 2-5 in the Pac-12.\n```"}

One of these would be a wavering rendition of Jesse McCartney\u2019s \u201cBeautiful Soul\u201d featuring the artist himself. McCartney, who released the song in 2014, was a perfect surprise guest for the demographic of the crowd, which consisted mainly of older Gen-Z and younger millennials.\n\nFor the audience, it was an arm day at the Baby Gravy gym. Each song would begin with the performers asking for the audience to raise their hands, and after the first few songs, this would be more laborious than facing the painfully blinding screens on stage.\n\nMembers of the audience raise their hands and sing along to another DJ Tiiiiiiiiiip set as they wait for Yung Gravy and bbno$ to perform. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nWith a pristine performance of \u201cMr. Clean,\u201d Yung Gravy was a charismatic force on the stage that made the most of his crooning, half-absent demeanor. Between catching bras mid-air and spraying water on the front of the crowd, he performed much like the studio version.\n\nHowever, by the time that Yung Gravy and bbno$ started their seventh act, the crowd had grown weary. Despite finally playing chart-topping entries such as \u201cedamame\u201d and \u201cBetty (Get Money),\u201d the show had literally entered the eleventh hour. The duo\u2019s set had begun to roam closer to the length of a legacy act the nearer they drew to midnight.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine just how many combinations of rhythms an 808 machine could produce, and yet every single one seemed to be present at the show. The respective discographies of the duo shouldn\u2019t be faulted; the real culprit was whoever allowed the two artists to play as many songs as possible before curfew. Redundancy became the word of the night as the bass began to resemble a low drone.\n\nA total of 36 songs, not counting that of the openers, were played over three hours.\n\nYung Gravy performs \u201ciunno,\u201d another collaboration with bbno$. Originally from Rochester, Minnesota, he began his music career on SoundCloud while attending the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His track \u201cMr. Clean,\u201d helped him gain popularity on the music streaming service SoundCloud. He is known for his usage of soul music samples and unique mixes of popular trap music, a genre of hip-hop known for its usage of rhythmic snare drums and 808s kick drum beats. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nIf not for the sheer relief the audience felt at the breaks between the sets to interact with the audience, this concert would\u2019ve had an even larger population of people leaving early. For a genre of music that centers around having good flow, there was a lack of natural progression in the structure of the show.\n\nFor a tour that boasts Live Nation as a producer, it was a disappointing aspect amid some very unique and successful concert planning. Yung Gravy and bbno$\u2019s LA tour date was a success, but this may be attributed to factors that were not necessarily the duo\u2019s music.\n\nFor two artists that have just as many catchy hooks as their less-appealing releases, the attention is all on Live Nation for what direction they take on the next tour. A show like this brings up a juxtaposition of what is in store for the future.\n\nWhile nods and collaborations from industry old-timers pointing to the duo\u2019s acceptance into the community, the reliance on spectacle isn\u2019t one that gives way to longevity. As stars who found their footing with TikTok fame, it\u2019s a question of whether they\u2019ll be able to last longer than the platform with its oncoming ban.\n\nWill the next Yung Gravy and bbno$ tours be able to maintain the amazing trajectories of \u201cBaby Gravy\u201d or will this mission be aborted? Only time will tell.\n```"}

Fabela\u2019s own music and producing is influenced by his jazz piano background and inspirations of Herbie Hancock and Tyler the Creator. Fabela\u2019s production has crossed across multiple genres and styles, finding adaptability with each artist. He recently produced the indie piece \u201cBeaches & Sushi\u2019' for Los Angeles based singer-songwriter Samuel Lim. Annenberg Media spoke with Fabela and Lim to learn more about their inspirations, creative processes and time working together on \u201cBeaches & Sushi.\u201d\n\nFabela:  Hello, everyone. My name is Maverick, Maverick Fabela, and my major is Jazz Studies at USC and I\u2019m minoring in music production. I\u2019m from Lafayette, California, which is in the Bay Area. And yeah, I mostly produce music. I do do a lot of jazz piano, but that mostly stays in school. And I\u2019ve been at USC for three years, but I\u2019m still completing my second semester as a junior because I took some time off to go on tour. And yeah, here we are.\n\nMy own music is still in the process of being developed, which is why I enjoy, you know, going out and working with different artists to help me find my own sound. So as far as my production goes, it\u2019s definitely more bedroom pop, Steve Lacy. All of that kind of alternative music that has jazz bleeding into it in certain places is definitely the lane that that I\u2019m in, you know.\n\nOh, man. I remember the first time that I cried to a song was in the car when I was a kid, and it was \u201cBeautiful Day\u201d by U2 and it made me so emotional. And I was like, \u2018Wow, music is great. I love music.\u2019 And so after that day, I was really interested in making it. So I went home and my grandma was a church organist, so I found a piece of paper with music notation lines and I took a marker and I just drew random notes and I thought it was going to sound so good. And she was like, \u2018Honey, I can\u2019t even play this.\u2019 And so then I was like, \u2018Okay, now I got to learn, like, how to actually make music.\u2019 And so my parents started me off in classical piano lessons and I hated it. I strongly disliked it because my teacher was definitely more like, \u2018You got to learn this to get to this place and then you got to do this piece because you\u2019re not good enough to play that piece yet.\u2019 And that was kind of, you know, from like fifth to seventh grade. I was just kind of in a rut. And so I was just like, \u2018I quit. I don\u2019t like music and I\u2019m going to be a criminologist.\u2019 Yeah, so in eighth grade, I remember not having much of a sense of community in middle school either. So I showed up to jazz band and I loved it and I was like, \u2018This is the kind of thing that I want to get involved with because the community was so great and the music was there\u2019 and I just started practicing every day because I was like, \u2018This is awesome. I love jazz.\u2019 And I think around sophomore year of high school, my dad started listening to EDM performances, like while he was working from home and I was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s cool. Maybe I should get into production.\u2019 And so he was obsessed with this thing called Tomorrowland, which is this huge festival that people camp out at and go listen to music at. And so I was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna start producing music because I want to be the guy who\u2019s up there, you know, being the DJ.\u2019 And I tried to make EDM and it was awful. And then I think two months later I heard Tyler the Creator and Rex Orange County and that\u2019s easily what changed my life because I was like, \u2018No, I wasn\u2019t doing that because I loved EDM. But now I could say that I was producing music because I love the music.\u2019 And yeah, so around junior year of high school is when I started production and I was still doing jazz piano in school and jazz band. But around senior year I was conflicted and I think both my parents were kind of like, \u2018do the jazz piano thing\u2019 because they didn\u2019t really hear my production stuff. I was very secretive about it. I didn\u2019t think it was good enough or I didn\u2019t want people to know that I was producing music cause sometimes I was embarrassed about it. And so I applied for jazz piano here at USC and I just kept producing the whole time. And I think a few of the friends that I met late freshman year, Grant [Conley] and Connor [Christ], they were [in the] music industry, and they heard my demos and Grant was like, \u2018I want to manage you.\u2019 And then from there that kind of opened up a lot of doors for me to work with more underground artists who were making really cool indie music like Frank Sativa and Jonah Roy and Paco and Tommy Richman. So I think that kind of started me on to the production journey that I\u2019m on now.\n\nHerbie Hancock is definitely my main inspiration for I think everything because he released a jazz piano album and he kind of shifted with the times and he\u2019s still like in the eighties, he was making funk and he was also making really soulful stuff. So his diversity of palette, but still being able to know that it\u2019s him whenever he makes something is just a really cool thing. So I think I look up to him because I can sort of find a way to bring jazz into other genres of music without people knowing and going like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s jazz.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, well.\u2019 It\u2019s like fitting it in there where it needs to be and not overdoing it, which Herbie Hancock is really good at. So I think I\u2019ve looked up to him for a long time. My high school graduation gift was a signed photo of Herbie Hancock. Yeah, which was really cool. And then I think another musical inspiration would definitely be probably Tyler the Creator, especially because he also found ways to bring jazz into his music and it was a lot different at the time. And now there\u2019s a lot of people trying to do it. But he inspired me because I was like, \u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t know you could rap with jazz and with funk and with crazy, weird production.\u2019 Yeah, so I think Herbie, Tyler, I\u2019d say those are my two go to inspirations always when I need to find something to get my creative mind going. I\u2019ll just sit there and listen to their discography.\n\nIt\u2019s really important to act on it when you have the creativity, but I\u2019ve never found a way to harvest that creativity from nothing. And sometimes I\u2019ll just have nothing to write about and take a week break from music and let myself breathe. And then when I come back, I have a lot to write down and to get on to, you know, my computer and make music. But it\u2019s very hard cause creativity isn\u2019t a concrete thing either. It\u2019s kind of just like a feeling. And sometimes people base their creations off of how good they think they are, even though it\u2019s still very creative. And I think a lot of it is just being able to know when you have that feeling to create and being able to go straight to the laptop and make something or go straight to the piano and make something. And that\u2019s the toughest part about this summer, me and my brother went on a backpacking trip for about a month and we were around Europe and it was so difficult when I had those moments to not be able to do something about it. I think it\u2019s just catching it in the moment when you have it.\n\nIf we\u2019re going all the way back, it was my friend Marco Caipo and me decided to make a beat because he\u2019s a rapper and I made the worst beat. And I thought gunshots sounded cool, so half the beat was like jump scares because I thought it was cool. But we put it on SoundCloud and we actually were like, \u2018Man, how do we get people to hear this?\u2019 And we\u2019re like, \u2018We have to get more plays on it.\u2019 And so for two hours, we sat in a room and just replayed it on our phones and in our iPads and our laptops. And we\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, man, like this is going to get us listens.\u2019 And so that was the first release. And then I think the first real Spotify release was my own song called \u201cIDK Your Name\u201d by Maverick on Spotify. And I don\u2019t tell anyone about it, so this is a rare occurrence. But that was like, I had creative direction for it and I put it out and then I realized I wasn\u2019t ready to be an artist. So I\u2019m like, \u2018Let me start producing for other people,\u2019 you know. The first artist I produced for, who officially put something out was probably, I\u2019d say as far as writing goes, it was Jelani, Jelani Aryeh. And it\u2019s because I met Jack and this is when I was still getting to know my whole musical side, so I was like, \u2018Yeah, let me just lay down some piano and help out with some writing parts.\u2019 And I laid it down and it\u2019s the title track on his most recent album. So that was like my first official, with another artist, release.\n\nFirst it was EDM and it was interesting, so I switched to trying to make Tyler the Creator beats all day, every day. And then my song that I put out was definitely more Rex Orange County, Tyler the Creator inspired. And after that, I think it definitely shifted more towards the hip-hop side and the rap side. But I think now I\u2019m definitely in a lot of different lanes because I really realize that it\u2019s my job to be able to like make the platform for an artist to build whatever they want on. Which is why I think that I\u2019ve made a lot of rap stuff recently, and then I\u2019ve also done indie stuff, indie singer-songwriter like Sam [Lim] and definitely some more jazz stuff like Frank Sativa, because I realized that you need to be able to expand yourself as a producer into other genres and just be able to give them, whatever artists, what they need to make a good song.\n\nLim:  My name is Samuel Lim. I am an artist/actor from Los Angeles. I grew up out here, actually, and I loved music. It was something I did as a kid, but it was never something I had access to- the music industry. So for me that was never an option on my mind to pursue. I didn\u2019t know producers or anybody of that sort to get me started. I didn\u2019t really have any clue of what was going on in the music world. So my focus was in acting. I got my start in musical theater and that\u2019s where I really built my voice and my confidence, and that\u2019s where my love for singing came. And I think COVID hit and I was acting and pursuing that after traveling for some time and. I was like, \u2018Dang, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019 Acting, like all the productions, are shut down and all I have is my guitar and my piano. And so I started writing a lot cause I was going through some difficult times. And I posted them on Tik Tok, and through the power of Tik Tok you meet so many cool creatives and so a lot of people were just asking to collaborate and it just kind of rolled off from there. So it\u2019s been about a year since I started that journey.\n\nFabela:  Wow. Only a year?\n\nLim:  Yeah, it\u2019s only been a year, but it\u2019s been so much fun meeting so many cool people, so many talented people. Like, it\u2019s insane. I was like, \u2018I didn\u2019t know there\u2019s this many people that just had these chops hidden\u2019 and it was crazy, but it\u2019s been so much fun.\n\nLim:  Yeah, so I think I haven\u2019t been song writing for that long, so my music style is very still in the air. I guess it\u2019s still developing because as I said, it\u2019s only been a year. But I guess I would describe...I don\u2019t really know if I have a style. I just want it to be authentic really. I think just music can be taken in so many different directions. It\u2019s so hard to narrow down to one style. But for now, my style is very chill and I have more of a chill voice when I sing. So I like to use that to my advantage and sing a little bit of slower songs because I think that captivates people a little bit more than the upbeat stuff, but it\u2019s always in the air. I think there\u2019s always room for different creative opportunities and to experiment with your style. And as I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s only been a year and the more I meet with different creatives that have different styles, the more we collaborate, and the more we just explore I guess it\u2019ll just be taken in a different direction. So I\u2019m excited to see where it goes, but.\n\nFabela:  So recently we...actually not so recently. How long do you think it\u2019s been?\n\nLim:  It\u2019s been a few months.\n\nFabela:  A few months? Yeah, a few months ago. Man. Me and Sam hit it off over Instagram, and I was like, \u2018This guy is extremely talented. I would love to be able to facilitate his music making, especially because he already, you know, has an idea of what the song is going to be about normally.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Okay, so how can I, you know, help him make this come to fruition?\u2019 And I think it just kind of went very smooth in the way that, you know, I was able to create that foundation for Sam to work off of and not get in the way. And I think that a lot of the song came from you [Lim] and your artistic vision, which is great. And, yeah, so I think it was what was it one session or did we do it in one session?\n\nLim:  Yeah, pretty much.\n\nFabela:  Yeah, I think we did it in one session for a few hours and we left with the product that we were both pretty happy about. I was like, \u2018I love this song and my mom loves this song because I can send it to her.\u2019 And yeah, so it really wasn\u2019t a crazy process. I think that both of us just worked together really well and it was really cool to watch nothing come into such a nice song.\n\nLim:  Yeah, so with \u201cBeaches & Sushi\u201d I had\u2014normally, when it comes to songwriting, I\u2019m very all over the place. But, music for me is very connected to my emotions. And so when I write, it just directly correlates to how I\u2019m feeling and it\u2019s really hard for me to separate the two. And so my writing is a direct correlation to that. And so I often write in my notes different little bits. And I remember maybe a week before I was writing, I got a line. I think it was like, \u2018I broke all my rules for you, but it didn\u2019t matter cause you say you didn\u2019t ask me to.\u2019 So, I wrote that down and I didn\u2019t have any melodies, but I knew I wanted to use that somewhere. And I had that session set up with Maverick because my friend Paco, shout out Paco, he introduced me to Maverick. I was asking for more producers that can maybe\u2014my style is very chill and simple, and I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m a very simple guy when it comes to my music. So it\u2019s always fun working with producers that can throw a little flair in there. So I was asking Paco, you know, \u2018Hey I\u2019m trying to look for maybe\u2014I\u2019m trying to experiment with a few different producers, see if I can come up with any new sounds and any new styles.\u2019 And Paco gave me Maverick\u2019s Instagrams, so I hit him up. We hit it in the session and he was like, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 It was just crazy. We were just kind of talking and getting to know each other. And I was like, \u2018Dang, this guy\u2019s so good at pianos, so good at jazz, and he has all the chops.\u2019 And I was like,\u2019 Damn, this is what I need to kind of add little ear candy,\u2019 is what we call it in songs. And so, we just started jamming and he was like, \u2018What do you have?\u2019 And I had these just two simple chords that sounded very indie, and I was like, \u2018Let\u2019s just work off of this.\u2019 First thing we were like, It\u2019s so hard because you overthink in the studio, but with \u201cBeaches & Sushi,\u201d I was so determined to just not overthink it- just get into the song. I had a style in mind. I really like The Neighborhood and like Cigarettes After Sex, a lot of that vibe. And so I wanted to create a song kind of more chill, like indie band, where you kind of get a whole band because with my other songs, it was just kind of acoustic guitars and my voice and we just layered that. And so I wanted to get kind of a whole indie band sound going. So we whipped out those two chords. We just recorded them, put them on loop, started writing them.\n\nLim:  And yeah, the song just started kind of coming together. We had our friend Jack [Kolbe] come in the room just. And he was like, \u2018Hey.\u2019 He just wanted to hang. Also an extremely talented producer and obviously an extremely talented musician. So he was sitting down and listening to the chords and he just pulled up the bass and started playing this bassline. And we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, that sounds so sick.\u2019 So we added the baseline. Maverick pulled out the drums. Maverick sang in the background to the \u2018oohs\u2019 it\u2019s not me.\n\nFabela:  I forgot about that, What!\n\nLim:  Yeah, it\u2019s you. It\u2019s not me. If you hear the little background vocals, it\u2019s Maverick. It\u2019s not me. He just heard the chords and he was like, \u2018Oh.\u2019 And he just started working, got to the drums. I gave him a reference track, I think. I don\u2019t remember what song it was, it was a song by The Neighborhood, [I] gave him that. And he was listening to those drums kind of splicing it together. And it just started coming together really fast. I think within like the first hour we had most of the layout done and then I was like, \u2018You know what? Maybe we don\u2019t keep it going upbeat and we use this weird chord here and just like one strum.\u2019 And I whipped out the notes and I was like, \u2018This line would fit perfect.\u2019 And it was \u201cCause I broke all my rules for you.\u2019 It was the chorus. And then, \u2018I nearly killed myself\u2019 like it was the whole chorus that I was like, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s a little weird because it\u2019s kind of like there\u2019s a strum going, there\u2019s a groove going with the bassline. It\u2019d be a little bit interesting to just kind of snip it off into the chorus and just have this beautiful vocal where it\u2019s stacked with falsetto, which a lot of people tend to do.\u2019"}

Since 2008, the Trojans have been unable to crack the McKale code, as they only boast one win over the Wildcats in 12 matchups during that span. Thursday night\u2019s matchup was just more of the same for a Trojans team that is still looking to find success in Tucson, as they fell 81-66 to the Wildcats.\n\n\u201cMcKale Center is the toughest place in our league to play, especially with the talent level [Arizona] has had over the years,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Wildcats are one of, if not the most talented team in the Pac-12. They deploy two monster big men in redshirt junior center Oumar Ballo and junior forward Azuolas Tubelis. The two combined for 27 points and were a thorn in USC\u2019s side all night. What made defending them especially difficult was Arizona\u2019s ability to move the ball and get scoring contributions from almost every player who stepped on the floor. Five different Wildcats scored in double figures, with fifth-year guard Courtney Ramey standing out. Ramey went 5-of-10 from 3-point range and caused problems for a USC defense that tried desperately to keep the two big men in check.\n\n\u201cThey made some tough shots,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey\u2019re so good inside, so you have to focus to try to stop their bigs at times, and if their guards start making 12 threes, they\u2019re really hard to guard.\u201d\n\nFor all the defensive troubles, where the Trojans really struggled on Thursday was the offensive side. Their inability to make shots, as well as some poor decision-making, really hurt them in the end.\n\n\u201cIn the first half especially, we had so many open looks from three, lane shots, wide-open jump shots \u2014 and we shot a very poor percentage,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cOn the other end, some of their role players were making shots, and we weren\u2019t. We went ice cold. Against a team like Arizona, you have to keep up with them when they go on their runs by scoring.\u201d\n\nSenior guards Boogie Ellis and Drew Peterson led USC, as the two combined for 26 points. However, the pair shot 7-of-25 from the field, an inefficient outing. It was emblematic of a larger trend from the Trojans, who shot 36.9% from the field. It was even worse from 3-point range, though. The Trojans shot a paltry 4-of-17.\n\nUSC is still very much in the hunt for an NCAA tournament berth, even though its chances for a Pac-12 regular-season title decrease with every loss.

(Lauren Justice/AP Images for Athleta)\n\nBy Charlotte Phillipp and Nataly Joseph January 18, 2023 at 11:15 am PST\n\nPresident Carol Folt announced that USC will honor track and field athlete and alumna Allyson Felix by renaming Cromwell Field in her honor. The formal dedication of the new Allyson Felix Field will take place later this semester, Folt said in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had many women or people of color, who have been in our most honored positions on buildings and names over time,\u201d Folt said. \u201cBut in so many ways, Allyson [Felix] is a woman of her time, but also of the future, [she] embodies that character, that grace.\u201d\n\nFelix, known for earning the most Olympic medals of any track athlete, said that she was humbled by the news. \u201cFor me to be born and raised in Los Angeles and have such a history at USC, I am just completely humbled,\u201d Felix said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge honor to be a part of history in the campus, and it\u2019s such a special place for me.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her legacy as an athlete, Felix made waves when she broke her silence about renegotiating her contract with Nike after giving birth to her daughter. Felix declined to renegotiate after Nike said they planned to cut her contract by 70%. Felix has since partnered with Athleta, another brand of athletic wear, and started her own footwear brand Saysh in 2021.\n\nThe leader of the renaming committee behind this decision, associate professor of microbiology at the Keck School of Medicine Paula Cannon, described Felix as \u201cthe ultimate Trojan.\u201d \u201cShe graduated with a degree from Rossier, crushed it at multiple Olympics and international competitions, and bravely stood up for what she knew was right when her employer did not,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cIt will be so wonderful that the field she walked around as a little girl from the neighborhood will be named in her honor.\u201d\n\nFelix also received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 2022 and delivered USC\u2019s commencement speech the same year. The renaming of Cromwell Field comes on the heels of other name changes on USC\u2019s campus, such as the Von Klein Schmid Center\u2019s switch to the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center in 2022.\n\nCalls to rename the field stretch back years, citing Cromwell\u2019s decision to remove Jewish athletes Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman from the relay team during the 1936 Olympics and his description of Black athletes as \u201cprimitive.\u201d The renaming stokes questions about the future of other monuments on USC\u2019s campus, including the Widney Alumni House and Statue, built in 2014 and named after controversial USC founder Robert Widney.\n\nFor now, the university looks ahead to the upcoming dedication ceremony. \u201cTo have discussions about the renaming [of the track] because of my character, my integrity, and for fighting for women, is something that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Felix said. \u201cIt just really shows what USC values. I feel proud of the things that I\u2019ve stood for, and it makes me proud to be an alumna because of the direction that the school is going.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated after an interview Wednesday afternoon with President Folt.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/01/17/a-conversation-with-district-13s-new-city-councilmember-hugo-soto-martinez/", "response": "```\nA conversation with District 13\u2032s new City Councilmember, Hugo Soto-Martinez\n\nWe sat down with the progressive, new representative of LA\u2019s District 13 -- which includes Silverlake, Echo Park and East Hollywood.\n\nLos Angeles voters in the 2022 midterm election presented high concerns over the housing crisis, the exponential increase in the cost of rent and the safety of themselves and their loved ones in a city where crime is on the rise. In response to these feelings, a progressive wave hit LA, ushering in a slew of progressive challengers in local city elections, from mayor to the city council, to school boards, to county races. Karen Bass\u2019s mayoral victory was only one of the many progressive victories won in Los Angeles. Along with her victory, came the entrance of four progressive City Council members, including Hugo Soto-Martinez for City Council District 13. Soto-Martinez\u2019s victory represents a shift for LA City District 13 away from incumbent Mitch O\u2019Farrell. During O\u2019Farrell\u2019s nine year appointment, he was criticized for advocating and supporting the building of luxury high rises, destroying homeless encampments and increasing homelessness. Soto-Martinez advocated and promised the opposite of O\u2019Farrell\u2019s policies as City Council member, focusing on rapidly transitioning people experiencing homelessness into affordable long-term stable housing.\n\nSoto-Martinez sat down for a conversation answering questions regarding his own point of view on why he won, on what this represents regarding politics across the country and on how Angelenos should expect policy to change.\n\nWas running for office ever in the plan? Not in a serious way. I engaged in the political process, but as an organizer. I was happy doing that. It wasn\u2019t until the issues of the city got kind of out of control. I felt like we needed to bring a different perspective and someone who has different values back to the city.\n\nOn your logo it says HUGO, then \u201ccommunity power\u201d underneath it. What does that mean to you? What does community mean to you? I think that when we decided to run, we knew that we wanted people to be part of the process. So that comes back from my union organizing background. When you organize a hotel, you try to find leaders that work in each different department. And when you fight the company you have to make sure you have all the leaders on board in that fight. Cause those leaders have followers. And when you have enough leaders, you can have a majority of workers in the workplace engaging in the fight. When we thought about the campaign, the issues are very similar. The lack of housing, homelessness crisis, the lack of transportation issues, how we deal with our public safety. We knew that in order to take on those issues, what would be needed was going to be the power of community. Community is powerful. How can community be used a tool to get things done?\n\nRegarding policy, if you think about how laws traditionally get passed. It\u2019s corporations that use lobbyists. They have a lobbying arm and they go around and talk to different leaders and they push laws in the way. Community groups, they don\u2019t have the money for a lobbying firm and the messaging and money to create a campaign. What they do have is the power of their own labor. What you often times see is the protest, you see them going to City Council, them doing the lobbying themselves, them sharing their personal stories. The community becomes the face of the policy. What I call that is the outside strategy. The inside strategy are the lobbyists that are connected to the structure of power, but the outside strategy is the outside agitator pushing from the outside. That is the community piece that comes in, those folks being engaged from the grassroots level. That\u2019s a different kind of pressure that is not connected to it but challenging it. I think that is probably the most important way.\n\nI\u2019m from Queens. AOC and Tiffany Caban both represent my district. Both of them are democratic socialists such as yourself. Their time in office is fairly new, and your time is office is brand new. Do you feel like their victories and your victory represents a sentiment among people that is growing coast to coast? I think so. I don\u2019t know the conditions in New York and what\u2019s causing the movements to arise. But income inequality is a nationwide issue. Fighting the racist structures is a national thing. People having an ideology based on democratic socialist is a national thing that Bernie Sanders was big on bringing up. I think there\u2019s a lot of beliefs that are very rooted. They are probably facing rising rents and a lot of low wage workers. I do think in that vein it is something we can use as a platform.\n\nYou are not the only progressive candidate that won. Karen Bass won her election. Other progressive candidates won their elections for their City Council races. What encouraged and motivated Angelenos to vote for you and other progressive candidates? This was a very anti-establishment sentiment. People see what the results of the decision making body that was there for many years. Especially around homelessness, people are in the streets, the skyrocketing rents. What we talked about was the lack of public infrastructure, transit infrastructure. But we weren\u2019t really talking about the root causes of this. You know, the skyrocketing rents and lack of affordable housing and the power of developers in the city around homelessness. The backwards policies of moving people from one block to the next without really finding housing solutions or mental health and drug addictions. I think people were really excited to see someone really challenging the roots of the system instead of just trying to paper over it. I think that\u2019s what really resonated with a lot of people.\n\nWhen you went around and you talked to people on your campaign and voters in your district, what issue seemed the most pressing if you could choose one? The number one was homelessness. I would say like 6 out of 10 people would say homelessness and then after that housing. A lot of students here at USC are amazed at how many people experience homelessness around the city. Many are amazed also at the price of rent in this neighborhood.\n\nHousing and homelessness were two of your main policy goals for your campaign. You yourself called it a bold vision and bold plans for the future. How do you plan to accomplish this? We\u2019re going to work with other council members, the mayor who I believe has a very similar vision. Our office is about 30 people, that\u2019s how big the staff is. We want to have a team within the staff that only works on the homeless crisis. That\u2019s all they do. They take calls, they visit encampments, they connect people to services, they build those relationships. Second, we are pushing a lot for adaptive reuse. Which is just a fancy word for refurbishing vacant buildings. There are a lot of vacant buildings that are in the city. We could be using those for housing. We want to be really aggressive about turning those into housing solutions. And then finally, we know what doesn\u2019t work and that\u2019s the sweeps. Rounding people up and pushing them from one side of the block to another. That just retraumatizes and pushes them further away from housing. We want to stop that practice within the district.\n\nIn the time of your campaign and even prior, how did you develop the specific policy? The most effective way is listening to the people doing the work. We would do a series of roundtables on different issues. Depending on the issue we would convene a roundtable of the people doing the work. Whether that was homelessness, housing, transit, environment, women\u2019s reproductive rights. And we asked what are the things you need to be better at your job? What are the policies? When you have been interacting with people, what kind of feelings have you been gathering? For the most part there is a lot of frustration. People feel like we do a lot but not enough for things to change. There is a lot of anger. People are definitely upset with their leaders. You feel that a lot. With the campaign, it is about trying to create a new vision. To fill people with optimism and a sense of having a much better future. That\u2019s what organizing is a lot about. You might take folks who are feeling down or are unhappy about the future but you can inspire them. We\u2019ve been trying to take folks who are feeling frustrated or angry and fill them with a lot of optimism.\n\nNow that you\u2019re elected, is there anything fun you\u2019re looking forward to as a City Council member? I\u2019m looking forward to bringing my niece to City Council. My first niece, she\u2019s fun, she\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s full of so much joy. Expose her to how government works and hopefully she can become a strong and independent woman and a leader in her own right.\n\nAnd lastly, what\u2019s your biggest fear? To not let people down. People have a lot of expectations from us. We\u2019ve inspired a lot of folks. I hope we can live up to everything that we\u2019ve talked about. Campaigning is very different than governing. And hopefully we can achieve what we\u2019ve said.\n```"}

Expand The second-year classical guitar major helped re-establish the university\u2019s mariachi band, Mariachi Los Troyanos de USC.  (Photo courtesy of Daniela Santiago)  By   Citlalli Ch\u00e1vez-Nava January 17, 2023 at 10:39 am PST \n \n \nUpon joining USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music to complete her undergraduate music studies, Daniela Santiago decided to reactive an important element of the university\u2019s musical past. Equipped with the determination that has been the consistent thread guiding her early music career, the second-year classical guitar major helped re-establish a mariachi band on campus which resulted in the formation of  Mariachi Los Troyanos de USC . The previous mariachi ensemble, Mariachi Sur de California (also known as \u201cUSC Mariachi\u201d), was formed in 1996 remained active in different variations for over a decade but eventually went dormant. For Santiago, 19, it made no sense that a university based in Los Angeles, a city with deep Mexican cultural roots, didn\u2019t have an active mariachi band. Beyond this, college life without having a connection to the genre that is close to her heart and where she grew as a performing artist seemed unimaginable. \u201cI started off in an orchestra and obviously I love that environment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also wanted to have another type of music community where I was surrounded by people like me ... just the whole outfit, I love everything, the gritos (interjections), everybody cheering each other on.\u201d Beginning as fun, casual gatherings to play Mexican-inspired music, USC\u2019s mariachi band is now a recognized student organization of more than 30 members that has been profiled by  the local NBC station  on multiple occasions. William Kanengiser, who serves as the band\u2019s faculty advisor and Santiago\u2019s classical guitar professor, credits the group\u2019s success to Santiago\u2019s leadership and determination \u2014 qualities he noticed when she auditioned to join the school just a couple years ago. \u201cThe moment you meet Dani, you\u2019re struck by her drive, passion, and love of music,\u201d he said via email. \u201cAlthough she\u2019s a small person, she can fill up a room with her smile and energy.\u201d When I met Santiago on a warm afternoon at USC\u2019s Village, I quickly understood Kanengiser\u2019s impression. As soon as Santiago began discussing her musical journey, her youthful, dark brown eyes quickly lit up and the delivery of her sentences quickened as she reminisced about encountering her first instrument, the viola, when she was only in seventh grade. \u201cThe first time I touched the instrument, I just knew that it was the key that unlocked everything,\u201d Santiago said, brimming with joy. \u201cI was finally able ... to unleash everything, all the potential I had.\u201d Santiago could be described as a musical omniglot. Beyond playing the classical guitar and the viola, she also plays the violin, ukulele and accordion. She has dabbled with the saxophone and is currently exploring a drum set in her dorm room. \u201cMusic itself, the musical instrument is what fascinates me, just how it works, how the sound produces the tone, the technique, everything,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of my dreams is to learn every instrument.\u201d Despite the classical guitar being a newer instrument for Santiago, Kanengiser believes even as a second-year student, she\u2019s made immense progress. \u201cShe is already playing high-level pieces with technical skills and musicality,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s especially adept at Mexican and South American music, but also plays Bach and classical works beautifully.\u201d Today, Santiago makes musical strides, but accessing training was not easy for her growing up. Born to Oaxacan immigrant parents and raised in Austin, Texas, Santiago is the first person in her family to pursue higher education. She credits her parents\u2019 unconditional support and the support of a local non-profit dedicated to music equity, Austin Soundwaves, for her musical and academic success. Her father, a landscaper, and mother, a housecleaner, instilled the importance of working hard to pursue one\u2019s dreams. Because of her parents, Santiago also developed her love for mariachi music and Mexican music giants Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jimenez and Vicente Fernandez. Her father also put her onto Mozart and Beethoven and would nag her to stay off her digital devices and instead spend that time practicing music. \u201cMy dad has always been so supportive,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess he saw something in me and he would actually push me harder than I would push myself.\u201d Thanks to him, Santiago also began to develop her stage presence when she was about 14 years old. \u201cWhen I started off in the mariachi, he would say, \u2018Tienes que cantar, tienes que estar en el escenario\u2019 (you have to sing, you have to get on that stage),\u201d she recalled. \u201cThat would terrify me.\u201d Yet, as Santiago reflects now, she knows her dad\u2019s resolve is what helped create the path to reach some of the most distinguished musical institutions in the nation and special music programs every summer since she can remember. This past summer took her to La Guitarra Espa\u00f1ola, her first-ever international trip, for a month-long guitar intensive and festival held in Granada, Spain featuring flamenco guitar music legend and current USC Thornton School Artist-in-Residence, Pepe Romero. Santiago reflected on witnessing who she referred to as the current \u201cgod of classical guitar\u201d perform his most famous set. Noticing Romero had made a few minor mistakes, she came away with an observation that reflects the contagious optimism that she brings to her classical guitar practice and her life. \u201cIt felt good knowing that we all work hard, but mistakes will still happen,\u201d she said. Those who know and understand her musical talents the best are assured of Santiago\u2019s potential and the imprint she will leave at USC and beyond. \u201cHer dream is to create a group at USC that will represent the Hispanic culture of USC students, not only when she\u2019s studying here, but continuing on for generations,\u201d Kanengiser said. \u201cI am immensely proud of all she\u2019s accomplished so far, and the sky\u2019s the limit for Dani.\u201d An earlier version of this story said that Santiago established USC\u2019s first-ever mariachi band, but she actually helped co-found a new version of the ensemble alongside fellow student, Jos\u00e9 Romo. The university\u2019s previous mariachi band formed in 1996. It was called Mariachi Sur de California.\n```"}

(Photo by Colin Huang)\n\nBy Will Camardella January 15, 2023 at 9:25 am PST\n\nAlthough the 71 points USC scored was not its highest scoring output of the season, the Trojans\u2019 offense looked about as sharp as it has all season long in a 71-56 win over Utah on Saturday night. The 15-point margin of victory is tied for the largest in a conference game this year for USC.\n\nBoth teams were able to start quickly on the offensive side, but while the Utes\u2019 scoring mainly came from senior center Branden Carlson, the Trojans put together a much stronger team effort from start to finish. Four different USC players finished in double figures on the night, with two more finishing just one field goal away from reaching that mark.\n\n\u201cI thought our depth helped us tonight,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said after the game. \u201cWe were able to rest our starters, but also our guys off the bench came in and played well. I thought we had a team effort tonight on both sides of the ball.\u201d\n\nSenior guard Boogie Ellis and fifth-year guard Drew Peterson both had their jump shots working from beyond the arc and from midrange, making contested shots throughout the game. Ellis finished the night with 17 points, shooting 7-of-13 from the field and hitting three 3-pointers. Peterson contributed another 11 points and knocked down both of his attempts from long range.\n\nAlong with good shooting nights from those two players, the real key to the Trojans\u2019 offensive success was their free-flowing, unselfish brand of basketball on display. Nine different players combined for 18 assists \u2014 the Trojans\u2019 most in a conference game this season. Peterson and sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters led the team with four dimes each.\n\nThis successful ball movement came along with just 10 turnovers, one of which came on an intentional shot clock violation with three seconds remaining.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had nine turnovers in the last two games,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThat\u2019s important for us to play smart offensive basketball. We have really improved offensively, especially in the last couple of weeks, and so we\u2019re right there. ... I\u2019m very proud of our effort and how unselfish we have become on offense.\u201d\n\nIt seemed throughout the night that the offense was coming easy for USC, as each player made the right passes both in and out of transition to set up teammates for easy buckets. Two of the biggest beneficiaries were Dixon-Waters and freshman guard Tre White, who combined to score 24 points. White did most of his scoring in the first half, but his biggest highlight came midway through the second, when he leapt up to slam home a two-handed alley-oop off a feed from Peterson to electrify the crowd.\n\n\u201c[The alley-oop] was even crazier with the atmosphere,\u201d White said. \u201cWhenever we have the gym packed like this, these are the best games. I live for these games. When the fans are just behind us, I feel like players can feel it on the court.\u201d\n\nIn the first half, Carlson accounted for half of Utah\u2019s scoring output, putting up 17 points in the period on 7-of-9 shooting. He hurt USC both underneath the basket and from long range, knocking down three triples and recording another eight points in the paint. While Carlson was able to produce, his teammates struggled mightily, as the rest of the Utes shot 26% from the floor for the game.\n\nOut of the halftime break, with the Utes down by five, Carlson picked up where he left off, scoring a quick four points as part of a 7-0 Utah run to regain the lead. After that, though, the Trojans found a way to keep the ball out of his hands and make his teammates beat them, which they were unable to do. While Carlson did not score for the final 18:38 of the game, the Utes made just 23% of their field goals and 18% of their threes the rest of the way.\n\n\u201cOur game plan was to shut some of their key players down, and [Carlson] was one of them,\u201d White said. \u201cAt halftime, we just re-adjusted. In the first half we did pretty good, but we fixed a couple little small things, and I feel like we shut him down.\u201d\n\nThe Utah offense reached new lows down the stretch of the game shooting the basketball, missing seven of their final eight shot attempts, and scoring just two points in the last 6:51 of the game. During that same period, the Trojans dealt with a scoring drought of their own that lasted over four minutes. However, Ellis connected on a key jump shot, and Dixon-Waters slammed a one-handed dunk in transition in the final two minutes to put the game out of reach.\n\nOne last area of improvement for USC in this game came on the glass. Rebounding had been a struggle for the Trojans in recent games, but they outboarded the Utes 41-29 overall, and recorded 13 offensive rebounds that led to 19 second chance points. USC redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan led all players in the game with 10 boards.\n\n\u201cGuys like Reece and Tre, we\u2019re at our best when they\u2019re offensive rebounding and it manifests into points,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThey are really great athletes, so we just have to continue to make it a stamp in our game.\u201d\n\nThis win improves the Trojans to 13-5 on the season and 5-2 in the Pac-12. They will embark on a two-game road trip next week in Arizona, starting with a matchup against the No. 9 Wildcats on Thursday night.\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson January 14, 2023 at 12:27 pm PST\n\nAfter consecutive defeats at the hands of ranked Pac-12 opponents, USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb was worried her team would have low morale and play poorly against Cal. But the Trojans were able to impress their coach with a resounding 63-43 victory over the Golden Bears (10-6, 1-4 in Pac-12 play) at Galen Center.\n\n\u201cIt was a character test tonight,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI thought our players just were a really good version of themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans started off the game with 13 straight points in part because of redshirt freshman guard Taylor Bigby, who scored eight of the points in the six-minute long scoring run for USC. Four of those points came from the free-throw line as Bigby was relentlessly attacking the rim at the beginning of the game.\n\nBigby started the game in place of the leading scorer for USC, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, who has now missed three straight games with a leg injury. Gottlieb has been impressed with the way members of her team have played during the absence of a player who averages 15.3 points per game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019re going to be at our best: when we can have multiple weapons,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe know we got a pretty good one sitting out right now, so it\u2019s only going to make us stronger when [Sissoko] comes back.\u201d\n\nGottlieb also added that Sissoko is now \u2018day-to-day.\u2019\n\nThe Trojans led by 19 at halftime in part because they dominated the offensive boards, recording 10 offensive rebounds in the first half alone. The team only finished with 13 offensive boards, but Gottlieb was still impressed with the rebounding performance by her team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about asserting ourselves on the boards,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a focus to box out, keep the other team off the boards, and hey, how about we make them call a timeout.\u201d\n\nSophomore forward Rayah Marshall was a key piece in the rebounding effort, securing 11 total rebounds, three of which were offensive rebounds. Marshall scored 17 points to go along with her boards, achieving her ninth double-double of the year.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is just about coming out, dominating and doing whatever is necessary,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cEven if I have to play point guard, I just want to win after 40 minutes.\u201d\n\nMarshall\u2019s 17 points were the second highest on the team as graduate guard Destiny Littleton scored 18 points of her own. Littleton was able to right the ship for the Trojans in the second half as they allowed Cal to score 19 points in the third quarter. Littleton\u2019s 14 second-half points matched the number of points the Golden Bears scored in the first half as a team, helping the Trojans keep their lead.\n\n\u201cThroughout these games, I don\u2019t even press to score,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cI really get off with getting my teammates involved and just being a leader out on the court. The points happen because they were good basketball plays.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans only extended their halftime lead by one point in the second half, in part because they allowed eight points off turnovers in the second half. Overall, USC committed 17 turnovers, which is now the third game in a row with at least 17 turnovers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve turned it over too much all year,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep working.

Californian farmers are becoming increasingly stressed about water in a parched state, but struggle with the balance between conserving water and feeding the nation.\n\nA crew digs a well in a alfalfa field in Dos Palos, Calif., Thursday Nov. 19, 2009. The government is spending $40 million in federal stimulus funds to pull water from underground aquifers in drought-stricken California, even as evidence is growing that the well-drilling boom could degrade the quality of water delivered to millions of residents. (AP Photo/Russel A. Daniels).\n\nBy Shreya Agrawal January 13, 2023 at 6:21 pm PST\n\nJulie Behneman has been working at her family farm in Valley Center, California for about 40 years. She prides herself on growing juicy citrus and lush avocados, and sells her produce and fresh juices every Sunday at the Santa Monica Farmers Market on Main Street. She said the secret to growing juicy citrus is lots of water, but as climate change exacerbates the drought, water is becoming scarce and is threatening the future of farming in the American Southwest.\n\n\u201cA lot of citrus and avocado growers are just letting their groves dry out down where we are,\u201d Behneman said. \u201cIf you have a well, you can continue to get by. But even the wells have saltwater in it, and the avocados can\u2019t take that much salt.\u201d\n\nSalvador Hernandez Flores, who works at family-owned GB Farms in Fresno, said it has become risky to grow fruit because of the drought. \u201cThere\u2019s no rain,\u201d Flores said. \u201cYou\u2019re paying for water. It\u2019s more expensive.\u201d\n\nMany farmers including Benheman have said that they have been forced to increase the prices of their produce every year because of rising water costs. \u201cWe would try to conserve as much as we can, but the trees still need water to be juicy, for the fruit to be juicy. So for farmers, that\u2019s difficult,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the past few decades, many farms turned towards private wells to reduce their use of expensive government-supplied water. This practice has now exhausted groundwater supplies and aquifers, forcing farmers to turn back to government suppliers.\n\nAshley Chavara, who works as a seller for GB Farms, said that customers have started to complain about the rising costs of produce.\n\nThe agricultural industry uses around 80% of the water available in California. Most of the water in Southern California comes from the Colorado River, which has seen an unprecedented decrease in water levels in the past few decades, according to data from the U.S. Interior Bureau of Reclamation.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law by President Biden in August 2022, includes a number of provisions to reduce water use, including a $4 billion provision to reduce the impacts of the drought in the Southwest. The provision allocates $550 million for water programs in disadvantaged communities and $12.5 million to provide emergency drought funding to tribes. It also allocates funds to provide compensation to those who voluntarily reduce their water usage. This has been aimed at farmers to get them to reduce their operations or even shut down their farms.\n\nSmall farms like Behneman\u2019s are also trying to become more sustainable in their practices and water use. However, California\u2019s agricultural industry is massive. While the government has passed several plans for water use reduction like the Water Conservation Act of 2009, many of these rely on the farmers to suggest changes for water reduction, including the drought resilience provision in the IRA.\n\nJarvez Turnage, owner of family-owned farm Barons Microgreens, says that many farmers are reluctant to make their practices sustainable due to concerns about initial equipment costs and the time it would take to switch. \u201cI think farmers could do little things that conserve their water usage, but a lot of times, they are so worried about their time and are just trying to get the job done,\u201d Turnage said.\n\nKonrad Fisher, Director of the Water Climate Trust, said that water systems will continue to be exploited as long as the agricultural industry is prioritized over our natural environment. He believes that farms need to take more responsibility for their water use.\n\nJulie Behneman holds baskets of persimmons at the Santa Monica Farmers Market. She owns a private well as her water supply. \"If you have a well, you can water the citrus, but you really have to spend the money on the city water for avocados,\" she said.\n\nFeeding the nation\n\nThe agriculture industry in California brings in more than $50 billion in revenue every year. According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), the state grows more than a third of the country\u2019s vegetables and more than 75% of the country\u2019s fruit and nuts. California\u2019s most profitable agricultural commodity, however, is dairy and cattle.\n\nCalifornia and other southwestern states have an ideal climate for growing crops and rearing livestock, which makes agriculture economically viable. But dwindling water supplies have now become a major limiting factor.\n\nCattle and livestock in California primarily subsist on alfalfa, a water-intensive crop that was brought to California from Chile in the mid-19th century. Alfalfa is one of the largest consumers of water among all crops and occupies an average of about a million acres of land in California.\n\nAccording to data by the California Department of Water Resources, pastures are the most water-intensive crop in California. \u201cIf we can manage the grass well, we don\u2019t need as much water for the grass, which is very different than alfalfa and hay,\u201d said Patrick Soule, who sells produce and meat for Casitas Valley Pastures in Ojai and other small farms.\n\nAlfalfa is usually watered using flood irrigation where fields are flooded with water. Most of this water evaporates or runs off the field, resulting in wasted water. Soule has worked on many farms for the last 25 years and has seen the effects of drought and climate change firsthand.\n\n\u201cThe reservoir in our area was at 33% when I last checked,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are really dry. I\u2019ve seen fruit trees that are stressed even though they\u2019re on irrigation.\u201d\n\nHe said most farmers know about the water issues and that \u201cheavy limitations\u201d might be put on water use if farmers don\u2019t make voluntary cuts. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s a little bit of denial where some people are just tiptoeing around and not really talking about and getting into the meat of the issue.\u201d\n\nBut he also acknowledges that water reduction can only be possible to a certain extent, given the numerous large farms that cover Californian soil and their importance within the nation. \u201cWe just want to grow all of our own pasture and grass and those animals tied to that land, and hopefully make a restorative practice,\u201d he said.\n\nTurnage believes there is a culture of being wasteful among farmers in the United States. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t conscientious of water usage because it free flows so easily,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in the process of feeding alfalfa, the runoff that we receive, are we conserving that?\u201d\n\nCrops used to feed California's livestock consume some of the highest amounts of water in the state.\n\nSolutions\n\nWhen Jarvez Turnage bought his farmland for Baron Microgreens more than 20 years ago, it was covered with orchards of apricot, apple and pomegranate trees and some grapevines. But when Turnage took over, he was forced to remove most of those trees because of their higher water demands. Instead, he decided to grow microgreens. He said he doesn\u2019t need to use as much water anymore, so his private well is filling up with water again.\n\n\u201cMicrogreens are the future of food,\u201d Turnage said. \u201cNot only can you grow it vertically in a smaller space, but it also doesn\u2019t require as much water to get the full nutritional value of the plants you\u2019re growing.\u201d\n\nOne of the touted solutions for the drought would be to stop growing crops in the Southwestern U.S. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t really make sense either. That has negative implications for food security,\u201d said Elizabeth Koebele, an environmental policy expert at the University of Reno, Nevada. \u201cIt\u2019s thinking about switching crops to more water efficient plants so that we can potentially grow higher market value crops, moving away from alfalfa to other crops,\u201d she said.\n\nKatherine Hayden started her indoor urban farm Radicle Roots in 2020 right in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. Like Turnage, she grows microgreens and also grows mushrooms, which do not require much water. Vertical and hydroponic farming are at the core of her agricultural practices.\n\n\u201cThe plants only drink the water that they need and nothing is wasted,\u201d Hayden said. She believes having local farms is critical. \u201cKeeping things local is going to be one of the keys to keeping costs low for everybody all over the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some farms that could do more about water waste, but I definitely think that the farmers should stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to start talking about what we actually need,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cIf we limited waste and focused on crops that can actually feed people, we could easily prevent extinction, stop harming tribes and feed everybody.\u201d\n\nFisher said the production of alfalfa doesn\u2019t need to completely stop, but needs to be reduced by a considerable amount. \u201cWhat\u2019s more important? Salmon extinction or continuing to eat a bunch of hamburgers?\u201d\n\nKoebele thinks the lack of more stringent water preservation laws stem from a lack of a centralized governance structure on the Colorado River system. All of the upper and lower basin states control water rights in the Colorado River, in what Koebele calls a \u201cpolycentric governance structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many different players who have a say in how water is used and managed in the Basin,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that makes it really complicated. There\u2019s not one major law that could change everything in the Colorado River basin and all at once.\u201d\n\nAgriculture has the oldest and most senior water rights in the Colorado River Basin. Koebele said a lot of big farms have been involved in discussions about cutting water usage, especially in the Imperial irrigation district, Coachella Valley and other parts of Southern California. But they do not want to give up their political rights to the water.\n\n\u201cIf they say they don\u2019t actually need as much water as they\u2019re using, there is a potential to have those rights taken away from them in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that users don\u2019t want to give up too much in the short term because it\u2019s a risk in the long term.\u201d\n\nBut the Colorado basin states have adopted a more collaborative approach over the last couple of decades. \u201cPeople are willing to work together to try to find creative solutions,\u201d Koebele said. \u201cBut I do think we\u2019re just so pressed with the drought impacts that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to collaborate and also to voluntarily give up water even though it\u2019s a drought emergency.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if they would stop farming operations and receive compensation in return, Behneman, Flores, Soule, Turnage and Hayden said no. \u201cWater is our biggest issue and concern,\u201d said Behneman. \u201cBut I would like to keep continuing to farm.\u201d\n```"}

Finding a community is often detrimental to the wellbeing of students. Luckily the Latinx/Chicanx Center of Advocacy and Student Affairs, more widely known as La CASA, has offered that home away from home since 1972. La CASA has only grown in population and popularity since its establishment, forging leadership and community for a group that makes up 15% of the USC population. Now, La CASA will be opening its doors to the community in a bigger space.\n\nAccording to Leticia Delgado, the Center Supervisor of La CASA, the center will be moving to the El Rodeo and Daily Trojan offices located on the fourth floor of the Student Union. Construction is set to start in May, after graduation, so that the new space will be accessible to students starting in the fall of 2023.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for a bigger space,\u201d said junior political science student and La CASA Cultural Ambassador Adrian Salguero Guevara. \u201cFor some of our bigger events, it\u2019s really hard to fit everyone in here.\u201d\n\nAlthough there were benefits to moving La CASA into the student union back in 2014 \u2014like having the center closer to other cultural spaces \u2014the space significantly downsized instead. In the early days of La CASA, previously known as El Centro Chicano, the space was located off campus on Jefferson Street. Two stories were allocated to the center. Then, La CASA moved to the United University Church on the third floor before finding its way to the Student Union.\n\nMore space is a major benefit of having a larger location, especially for programming as Adrian Salguero Guevara said. At this semester\u2019s open house, the current location of La CASA welcomed 217 students. It was at the open house that University President Dr. Carol Folt made the announcement of the location change.\n\n\u201cUSC Student Affairs is committed to building community among all of our students,\u201d said Monique S. Allard, interim Vice President of Student Affairs, in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cThis includes expanding and modernizing many of our student spaces, including La CASA.\u201d\n\nOnce moved in, La CASA will be twice the size of its current space. Student Publications says the change is still under negotiation. Nonetheless, the change in space has been welcomed with open arms by La CASA and other cultural centers who will also benefit from the construction. For example, Asian Pacific Student Services, or APASS, located in STU 410, will share the larger kitchen space with La CASA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for the Latinx students because they will have a bigger space. And these cultural centers are so highly important for them because they feel like they belong,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cThese are hubs for students. It\u2019s a place where you can take a power nap in our napping pods ... If you\u2019re a commuter, you can put your lunch away in the refrigerator.\u201d\n\nThe legacy of La CASA as a center for community, culture, leadership and student wellbeing will only continue to grow as it embarks on this monumental change and opens its space to the growing Latinx population at USC.\n```"}

(Photo by Jaden Dhaliwal)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel January 12, 2023 at 11:04 pm PST\n\nAfter falling just short against crosstown rival UCLA in a 60-58 loss at Pauley Pavilion one week ago, the Trojans were looking to get back on track in front of a home crowd at Galen Center. USC jumped out to an early 15-3 lead, which would end up as their largest of the night. After the Buffs stormed back, USC\u2019s advantage shrunk to two as the Trojans went to the locker room up 34-32 at the half.\n\nSenior guard Boogie Ellis finished the first half with four assists and eight points, one shy of the team\u2019s leader, junior forward Joshua Morgan, who netted nine. Despite the pair\u2019s stellar performances in the first 20 minutes of play, the highlight of the half came only five minutes after tip-off. As Colorado lined up to take its first of two free throws, the crowd at Galen Center was on its feet roaring in support. The fans weren\u2019t cheering for what was happening on the court though, rather what was about to happen. The standing ovation was in response to freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu taking off his warmup jacket and striding to the scorer\u2019s table.\n\nIwuchukwu is a former five-star recruit who was expected to play a large role on the Trojans\u2019 squad this year. However, during a preseason practice in July, the freshman suffered cardiac arrest due to a heart condition and had been sidelined since the start of the season. When he checked into his first college game on Thursday night, the Galen Center crowd was sure to give him a warm welcome.\n\n\u201cI personally really liked how the fans gave him a standing ovation,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI know that made his first game back special... he\u2019s probably going to remember that one for a while.\u201d\n\nThe freshman\u2019s appearance was not only a special moment for his teammates, but one for head coach Andy Enfield as well. \u201cHe\u2019s an incredible person and he\u2019s gone through a lot,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was really special... We were just so happy he was out there and he\u2019s a big part of our team.\u201d\n\nIwuchukwu only played five minutes, which Enfield credited to a minutes restriction that will remain until the team\u2019s medical staff gives the green light.\n\nJust minutes into the second half, the Buffs went up 38-36, grabbing their first and only lead of the contest. From that point on it was a dogfight, culminating in fifth year guard Drew Peterson knocking down a fadeaway jumper as the shot clock wound down to put the Trojans up three with 1:20 left to play. USC rode this lead out to a 68-61 victory over Colorado, snapping the Trojans\u2019 two-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cI try to put the ball in our leading scorers\u2019 and best offensive players\u2019 hands,\u201d Enfield said of the clutch play. \u201cThey\u2019re instructed to try to make a play if you can\u2019t get a clean look and Drew made a big time shot.\u201d\n\nWhile senior captains Ellis and Peterson led their team with 14 and 15 points respectively, USC won the game with its defense and ball security. Morgan proved to be a key player on the defensive front after getting benched in the second half of USC\u2019s loss to UCLA. The junior forward responded with four blocks, including some key ones in the final minutes, and three steals in the win over Colorado.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of motivation coming into this game,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI feel like last game I kind of let my teammates down so this game I really had to make sure that I wasn\u2019t going to be a detriment, that I was going to make up for last game and I think I did that.\u201d\n\nWhile the Buffs won the battle on the boards, out-rebounding the Trojans 44 to 29, USC made up for it by forcing 22 turnovers and only committing 9 of its own.\n\nUSC will look to keep up its winning ways when the Trojans square off with Utah at Galen Center at 7:30 p.m. Saturday night.\n```"}

Local residents remain stuck in their houses, as two to three inches of thick mud trapped people and their cars from getting out of Beckman Road, the main street affected by the landslide. In addition to the mud, rocks and tree roots made roads difficult to navigate.\n\nOne resident, UCLA professor Martin Monti, began digging his driveway gate free with a shovel, in an attempt to prevent more damage to his property. Beckman, a private driveway, remained unnavigable to vehicle traffic on January 10. Monti says he worries that the city will not be able to provide adequate services to remove the mud from the road, as much of the street is private access for residents only.\n\nMartin Monti, wearing plastic bags over his shoes to protect him from the mud, points at the debris from the mudslide that settled outside his front gate. Thick roots from unearthed trees mixed in with the mud and water covering the streets.\n\nDirt and mud from the hillside that collapsed from the storm cover Beckman Road and the white concrete barrier meant to keep the dirt, tree and grass from falling onto the concrete below.\n\nMonti begins digging the dirt from underneath his fence, trying to prevent more damage to the electronic gate.

But as the campus empties and students return home to their families, this time of year can also serve as a grim reminder of grief for those on the outside lacking a strong natal support system. For that reason, this time of year gives us an opportunity to reflect on the ways in which even the most functional of families, in all of their best intentions and well wishes, may have followed patterns of abuse while trying to protect us from institutionalized oppression.\n\nIntergenerational abuse and the ways it is fueled by historical state-sanctioned violence was a major theme at the Mid-October LA Meet-Up of the NoName Book Club. In the grass of Leslie Shaw Park, sat 25 Los Angeles community members coming together to discuss Heavy by Kiese Laymon, Belly of the Beast: The Politics of Anti-Fatness as Anti-Blackness by Da\u2019shaun L. Harrison and revolutionary politics throughout. Complete with readings aloud the safe space was church-like, sacred yet inclusive, the circle expanding for every newcomer.\n\nBook club leaders and one-half of the Radical Hood Library organizers, Micheal and Fatima, led members through an exploration of the intersection of health, insecurity, anti-Blackness, fatphobia, intergenerational violence and how intra-community policing has created more harm than good as we try to heal from the effects of historical attacks on our humanity as a people. Much of this violence we experienced was birthed as a way to protect each other from state violence and for good reason.\n\nThe book, Belly of the Beast, explored the politics of the conditions that lead to the constant feelings of unsafety Heavy describes through anecdote. Harrison guides readers through the nuances of state-sanctioned violence against fat black people through the intertwined histories of the War on Drugs, the War on Obesity and recent police killings of unarmed fat Black men, whose largeness in size is often used as justification for their senseless murders.\n\nThroughout Belly of the Beast, Harrison asks to think of a world beyond radical self-love, desire, gender, modern conceptions of health, and especially beyond abolition. As Black people, we are often confronted with the harsh truth that there is no protection from state violence, not physically, not mentally, and not socially. But as Justine, NoName book club attendee, noted \u201cthere is protection when we protect each other.\u201d\n\nHowever, with most of us being only three to five generations removed from slavery, and even less than that removed from the racialized tragedies that occurred after, it is clear to see the implications that this has had on our family structure, how we treat and think of each other and ourselves. For example, in his painfully truthful letter to his mother, Heavy, the memoirist Kiese Layman describes the harms his mother inflicted on him while trying to preemptively shield him from harm at the mercy of white hands. Her protection often took the form of policing her son\u2019s way of speech, dress, demeanor and his weight.\n\nThrough this, she aided society in instilling many psychological complexes in him, as her preferred method of protection was often distancing herself and her only son from their Blackness. Just like Kiese, insecurities instilled by our loved ones once served as a mode of protection, as shrinking oneself, literally and figuratively, provides a mirage of safety to targeted bodies. But, sitting under the beaming sun of Leslie Shaw Park in the NoName Book Club circle during Trojan Family Weekend, we remembered the Black childhood experience and the ways in which our mothers, fathers and even extended family members, in trying to protect us in the only way they knew how, may have led us astray.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/01/11/growing-up-chinese-in-middle-america/", "response": "```\nGrowing up Chinese in Middle America\n\nBy Mei Zhang\nJanuary 11, 2023 at 12:38 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s spring break, 2022, and I\u2019m in Spain. We just got off an 11-hour flight, and my friends and a couple of people we met at our hostel are sitting at a tapas bar. At the table next to us, there\u2019s a middle-aged woman with long wavy hair and crinkles in her eyes, giggling and pointing her finger at me: \u201cChino, chino, chino!\u201d She seems delighted. Her daughter turns towards me. \u201cSorry, that\u2019s my mother. We\u2019re from Argentina, and I think my mom\u2019s never seen an Asian person.\u201d Sensing her genuine amusement, I smiled at her and nodded, not knowing a lick of Spanish myself. I could tell she meant no harm; she was simply entertained.\n\nAfterward, our friends who were with us, from Holland and Germany, said, \u201cWhat she did was so fucked up.\u201d \u201cOh, is it?\u201d I hummed. It was strange, but I\u2019d seen worse. \u201cYeah, I guess I\u2019m used to it.\u201d They looked at each other. \u201cHow bad is it in America?\u201d \u201cIt depends. Where I grew up it was pretty bad.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a scene in Minari where the family visits the local church for the first time. They are in a town in rural Arkansas, and the only Asian family there. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Two white children point at a series of random objects and ask the young daughter, Anne, what their Korean translation would be. They giggle as Anne impassively and patiently recites the words for cookies, grapes, and bread for their entertainment. When I told my friends in Los Angeles that this same thing happened to me, they were shocked. But kids are kids, and kids are curious about the things they don\u2019t know. Where I grew up in Oklahoma, that just happened to be the color of my skin, the shape of my eyes.\n\n\u201cTell me if this is Chinese.\u201d My second-grade classmate then drew lots of horizontal slashes crisscrossed with vertical ones, or to my second-grade brain, an elaborate tic-tac-toe grid. \u201cHmm, it kind of looks like the word for \u2018well\u2019,\u201d I offered. I then drew out the word \u4e95 for him. Mason was my friend, and he was a sweet kid. I wanted to be nice. I reasoned that it did kind of look similar. This sort of ritual was not uncommon, and it wasn\u2019t just Mason who would ask me. It also wasn\u2019t just random scribbles on paper. Sometimes it was verbal. \u201cIs this a Chinese word?\u201d And then they would unleash a stream of gibberish of \u201cding, dang, dong\u201d and similar sounds. I don\u2019t remember how many times it happened, or knowing how to feel. I don\u2019t remember if I was annoyed, or embarrassed, or just curious \u2014 curious why this part of me was such an object of fascination. I just knew that every time it happened, I was reminded that I was foreign to them.\n\nWe\u2019re on a bus. It\u2019s either kindergarten or first grade. I\u2019m sitting alone, and the boy in front of me turns around. \u201cHow come your eyes are so small and ugly?\u201d he says. I\u2019m indignant. My eyes are small, yes, but that doesn\u2019t have to make them ugly. \u201cWell, why are your eyes so big and fat?\u201d \u201cAt least they\u2019re not squinty.\u201d \u201cAt least they\u2019re not buggy!\u201d I learned a lot that day. I learned that I was different, and that my otherness was tied to the way I looked. I learned that because I looked different, it also excluded me from being pretty. This back and forth went on for a bit. Our chaperone sat two seats ahead of us. She was also alone and within earshot. In retrospect, maybe she truly didn\u2019t hear this exchange. But the impression left on me was clear: when it came to defending myself, I was on my own.\n\nI\u2019m in the third grade. We\u2019re playing Poptropica in the computer lab. I look over my friend Vivian\u2019s shoulder, one of the only other Chinese Americans in my grade, and I notice that the avatar she was building had blonde hair. \u201cWhy is yours blonde?\u201d \u201cHm? Oh, I don\u2019t know. I just think it\u2019s prettier.\u201d The next time I was redesigning my Poptropica character, I changed mine to blonde, too. I don\u2019t remember if I kept it or not.\n\n\u201cChing chang chong!\u201d Kyle yelled. He pulled his eyes back in a gross imitation of my face. This happened regularly in the fourth grade. Later that year, I found out his grandfather was Chinese. I was surprised. I imagined what it would be like if I had a kid, who then had a kid, who then grew up to alienate and bully other children for the color of their skin, who looked just like me. That made me sad.\n\nIn the tenth grade, Kyle called me a chink. I whispered to my friend that his grandfather was Chinese, and that I was afraid that if I married someone who wasn\u2019t Asian, I would have grandkids like him. \u201cKyle,\u201d my friend yelled back, \u201cyou\u2019re the reason she\u2019ll never marry a white guy.\u201d\n\nIf you listened to the array of substitute teachers trying to make out my name on the roll sheet as they called attendance, we would begin a painful and yet familiar ritual. First, a pregnant pause reserved exclusively for ethnic names. Then, a creative barrage of how you could rearrange the letters of the name \u201cMei\u201d \u2014 I\u2019ve gotten \u201cMee-uh\u201d, \u201cMye-uh, \u201cMee\u201d, and my favorite, the most faithfully Anglican reading to the letters in Mei: \u201cMee-eye.\u201d \u201cHere,\u201d I responded. There wasn\u2019t any point in correcting them. Sometimes they were embarrassed, sometimes they didn\u2019t care. Sometimes they were politely curious about how it should have been pronounced.\n\nThe most interesting interactions happened when they wanted to know how to pronounce my last name. This was much more of an endeavor, and it would go something like this: \u201cHow do you say your last name?\u201d \u201cZayng.\u201d \u201cIs that how you really pronounce it?\u201d \u201cWell, no,\u201d I would say sheepishly. \u201cBut it\u2019s kind of hard to say, so I just say Zayng.\u201d \u201cTell me how you really say it.\u201d \u201cOkay, it\u2019s Zhang.\u201d Then they would make some careful attempts at the correct pronunciation, through which I would gently correct them during however long they decided to stretch this out for. They were being genuine, and I didn\u2019t realize this before, but by taking the time and effort to learn how to pronounce my name properly, they afforded me a sort of equal respect and dignity.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t realize this in elementary school. I just felt more uncomfortable the longer this ordeal took, especially since it was in front of the entire class; in a twisted way, this respect for learning my name came at the cost of the discomfort of being singled out for it.\n\nSummer of 2022. I was sitting with a couple of my close friends in a near-empty Chinese restaurant in Seattle. We had all come to know each other through an internship at a tech company, which, culturally, I would describe as a career for overachieving yuppie-types who also value having ample time for diverse hobbies such as hiking, bouldering, or being a foodie. One of them grew up overseas, so I suspected they were unaware of the sort of locally grown racism I encountered in Oklahoma. I was trying to explain cultural appropriation to them. They were confused as to why Asian Americans bristled at white people donning cultural garb.\n\nMy Brazilian friend, who grew up in Dubai, shared that her close Indian friend gifted her a sari. She knew that she could wear this in India, and it would be fine. I imagined a picturesque scene of her walking along some unnamed street in India wearing the sari and local Indian women smiling approvingly. Since I had never been to India, the 2-second clip in my head was probably more akin to AI-generated art.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s a big deal here. People in India would view it as appreciation. And people in America would change their minds about me wearing it if they knew I got it as a gift. But why should that make a difference?\u201d\n\nThe classic example I bring up as cultural appropriation is the prom dress incident. In 2018, a white girl from Utah wore a qipao as her prom dress. She had no relation to Chinese culture. In the prom photos, she and her exclusively white group of friends were seen bowing mockingly, all with their palms pressed together. Asian Americans were incensed.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she countered, \u201cbut mainland Chinese people online didn\u2019t find any issue with it. In fact, they liked it and thought it was cute. Why are Asians in America so sensitive about this?\u201d\n\nA myriad of emotions flashed within me. I felt indignance, and with it the need to appear rational and detached as I intellectually condemned this prom dress action as factually racist. But on a deeper level, I felt an inward pressing need to defend the legitimacy of the pain I experienced as an Asian American. Both are hard to do, especially at the same time.\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d she continued, \u201ccultural appropriation is a sensitive rebrand of cultural exchange. Take the t-shirt for example. Without trade and cultural exchange, and other people trying on other culture\u2019s clothing, things like this wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nI felt a haze of emotions. A sort of deep forlornness at the idea of a qipao being compared to a t-shirt. I knew this wasn\u2019t even her intention. Regardless, I could feel tears welling up. I don\u2019t even know why my friend\u2019s t-shirt comment made me so upset, and I was even a little bit ashamed at how wounded I felt. I stared up at the celadon wall, paint peeling at the edges, seemingly at nothing, willing my thoughts and my heart to slow down. I knew that they were waiting for me to respond, but I stayed quiet, for fear that if I spoke I really would begin crying. And that, in my mind, would have shown how emotional and therefore irrational I was, which would then extinguish any ethos I had in this conversation. I felt it was imperative that I could justify my pain in a wholly \u201crational\u201d way for them to afford it respect. Somehow, by showing my pain, I feared it would invalidate my pain.\n\nThe reason that Asian Americans found the qipao prom dress to be culturally appropriating while native Chinese people found it charming is, as most racial dynamics boil down to, due to power. In China, the majority of people there are, unsurprisingly, Chinese. What this means is that being Chinese was the norm. Children were not bullied, belittled, ostracized, exoticized, or othered for being Chinese. You couldn\u2019t be traumatized for being Chinese in China.\n\nIn America, this was the opposite case. My Chinese-ness was an indicator of my foreignness, my otherness. My small eyes? Ugly. My yellow skin? Strange. My name? Unpronounceable. As my classmates waved around their circular ham and square cheese slices in plastic Lunchable packages, the dumplings I brought home from lunch were met with bewildered faces and a comment of \u201cstinky\u201d. I used to be mortified at wearing my qipao out. I felt a sense of shame that I didn\u2019t belong to society the way my white peers did, and wearing a qipao felt like an excruciating way of admitting this fact.\n\nIf a Chinese girl wears a qipao in China, it is fine. If a white girl wears a qipao in China, it is also fine. If a Chinese girl wears a qipao in America, she is at best more exotic, and at worst an alien. So, why would it be alright for a white girl to wear a qipao, especially with no association with that culture, and have it be seen as quirky or cute when a Chinese girl wearing that cultural dress is a walking reminder that she does not belong?\n\nI wish I could\u2019ve articulated this in that moment, at the dining table with the checkered tablecloth. But I was frazzled, and eventually the conversation drifted ahead, though I was frozen in place.\n\nSometimes, I feel like I\u2019m not a real minority. On one hand, I\u2019m clearly traumatized enough by my Asian American experiences that I\u2019m writing this. On the other hand, I go to USC, and I\u2019m not a rare breed in white-collar jobs. I live a relatively cushy life: \u201cI should stop complaining,\u201d I tell myself, \u201cafter all, other people have it worse.\u201d I find myself disregarding my own trauma because I\u2019m a \u201cmodel minority.\u201d Because my identity and my achievements are weaponized to put other minorities down, I sometimes feel I cannot rightfully claim the title of being a minority, which is completely unfair; my experiences tell me I am, even if my inclination is to invalidate myself.\n\nI hope people can better understand this specific sort of pain of Asian otherness. What has imprinted on me from a young age is a deep sense of being a \u201cperpetual foreigner,\u201d that even if I\u2019m a natural-born citizen and I speak perfect English, that, to them, I\u2019ll never be truly \u201cAmerican\u201d. Although I can never be the perfect, quintessential blonde American girl, there is something inextricably American about me. I\u2019ve only discovered this recently, after some international travel, noticing my sigh of relief once I land at an American airport and look up at signs in English with Calibri font and the stars and stripes in the background telling me I\u2019m home. When I\u2019m abroad, I begin to understand how American I am \u2014 my accent, my values, the quirks I intuitively understand about a strange holiday, like Thanksgiving. I\u2019ve only now begun internalizing the fact that I am truly American, even with the slew of identity baggage that I\u2019m still making sense of \u2014 and perhaps that makes me all the more American.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/01/11/podcasting-as-the-gen-z-medium/", "response": "```\nPodcasting as the Gen-Z medium\n\nThe growth of the podcast industry is undeniable. Today, it seems as though every person you know, journalism expert or not, has a podcast of their own. If not for expertise, what unites these individuals is their combined love and interest for audio technology, and the ability to express their knowledge and opinions to the masses. The increase in podcasting among younger generations is especially unique. They are migrating to the medium because their favorite celebrities and influencers are creating podcasts, hence demonstrating the influence of celebrity and influencer culture.\n\nConsidering podcasts\u2019 exponential growth and emergence into mainstream media, it raises questions about the social and behavioral forces that contributed to its rising popularity. A podcast is defined as long-form media that is constructed in an audio format. It can cover content from education and news to entertainment. At its most fundamental level, it requires an individual to have a microphone and a recording device. The consumer of the podcast then listens to the recording wherever they choose. In the car, in their home, or during another activity.\n\nThis basic explanation of podcasting gets into the medium\u2019s intentional design and usage: to offer an accessible and personalized experience for consuming media. Media Scholar Henry Jenkins, who teaches a course on the history of podcasts at USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, touched on one of the most favorable traits of podcasting. \u201cMost of us listen to podcasts on earbuds and that affects the aesthetic of podcasting,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to be in our head, not on our speakers across the room. That means it\u2019s a more intimate medium, more personalized than radio has been.\u201d\n\nJunior Claire Fogarty, a podcast creator and student of Mr. Jenkins, agrees that podcasting is a more intimate medium but because of its dependence on the human voice. \u201cThe intimacy of the human voice can really be an amazing story telling technique to feel like you are having a conversation with them,\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cWith radio, broadcast, traditional television, there will be so many elements that you are not just focusing on the human voice.\u201d\n\nBoth Jenkins and Fogarty addressed one of the primary social forces contributing to podcasting\u2019s appeal. The ability to listen to a podcast anytime, anywhere and the added intimacy of feeling as though the media you are listening to is only being told to you, like a personal conversation. Junior Isaac Tula, a podcast creator himself, said that podcasting simply comes down to the art of \u201cconversing and storytelling.\u201d\n\nPodcasting offers listeners the ability to consume information in a timely manner. Despite podcast\u2019s long-form roots, podcast episodes have progressively gotten shorter and shorter, lending itself well to individuals\u2019 behavioral need to multitask, such as listening to a podcast on one\u2019s commute to work. The average podcast episode ranges between 25-30 minutes, according to Co-founder of Bumper Dan Misener, coinciding with the average commute in the US.\n\nJenkins related the oversaturation of media content with individuals\u2019 need to multitask. As we become used to oversaturating ourselves with information, many of us feel bored riding the bus, walking down the street, so we tend to listen to podcasts to fill in those gaps,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThat is certainly one of my uses.\u201d\n\nIn a media-driven society where it is normalized and expected to inundate ourselves with information, and do so while multitasking, it is no coincidence that individuals like millennials and Gen Z\u2014who are byproducts of a media-driven society\u2014are drawn to podcasting\u2019s accessible and personalized nature.\n\nContributing to podcasts\u2019 accessibility is the fact that anyone can create one; anyone can become a podcast creator. This is because there are various free apps available to the masses that assist in recording and distributing podcasts to media platforms. Because of the ease of access to podcasting tools, the average person can engage in the creation of podcasts as much as the consumption of them.\n\nJenkins stated that one third of his students in his course on the history of podcasts tend to have their own podcasts already. Despite having access to Annenberg Media Lab, he has succumbed to his students\u2019 approach of using \u201csimple tools available for free online that don\u2019t require any studio\u201d due to how easy it is to distribute.\n\nFogarty is a student who got into podcasting in 2018, before such simplified approaches were created. Considering that only four years have passed since she used a more traditional and lengthy approach to podcasting speaks to the immense growth and development that has occurred in the podcasting industry. \u201cWhen I started my podcast, I was 16, Anchor didn\u2019t exist, there was a lot more DIY to it, and a lot more that I had to figure out on my own,\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cIt was crazy when the thing I spent months and months on for my podcast you now can do in a couple of clicks on your computer.\u201d\n\nAnchor is a producing RSS platform that quickly and efficiently records and distributes podcasts. One of the reasons for its efficiency is because it is linked to Spotify and Apple music, two large media platforms. According to a 2019-2020 study by Statista, Spotify and Apple Podcasts are the most popular platforms for consuming podcasts with Spotify attracting 25% of listeners and Apple Podcasts attracting 20%.\n\nWith Spotify and Apple Podcasts increasing the medium\u2019s ease of access, social media platforms are also amplifying podcasts by promoting them on their platforms. Snapchat, for example, includes clips and trailers of podcasts in the forms of ads or on stories to increase their visibility. The demographic of Snapchat users are also millennials and Gen Z.\n\nNot only are podcasts being more widely promoted, but they are being promoted to younger audiences that consume and create the content they see and interact with online. Fogarty confirmed this reality that the promotion of podcasts on social media has led Gen Z to engage with the media platform. \u201cSnapchat, believe it or not, is a really big promoter of podcasts and podcast channels,\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cA lot of podcasts will put mini versions on Snapchat.\u201d\n\nIn addition to social media, TV shows and sitcoms have introduced podcasts into mainstream media, amplifying its visibility and recognition as an important media platform. \u201cWe are seeing it represented in popular culture,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201c\u2018Only Murders in the Building\u2019\u201d is maybe the most notorious example where the lead characters and most of the plot centers around the production of a podcast. There are podcasts hosts that are showing late night comedy shows. We\u2019re seeing Saturday Night Live spoof podcasts.\u201d\n\nTula communicated another way podcasting has emerged in the social limelight. \u201cI see a ton of YouTubers having their own podcasts, so they are removing their ten-minute videos and going into depth on what they\u2019re thinking or about their life,\u201d Tula said.\n\nFogarty recently interned at a podcast company doing market research and discovered an interesting trend in her research: the majority of people listened to podcasts by YouTubers that they liked. Even more surprising is that listening to their favorite YouTubers was their first exposure to podcasting. As Fogarty stated, there is this \u201ccyclical\u201d relationship where YouTubers or famous celebrities, in this case, \u201cnow have podcasts because more audiences have migrated to podcasts, and audiences are now migrating to podcasts because celebrities have them.\u201d\n\nSome examples of mainstream celebrities who have podcasts are Obama, Meghan Markle, Dua Lipa, and so many more. While the younger generations\u2019 route to podcasting was through social media and mainstream celebrities and YouTubers, the older generations\u2019 route to podcasting was through radio. \u201cPodcasts for older generations were more like, \u2018Oh, I love listening to Terry Gross in the car, now I can listen to it on my phone,\u2019\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cYounger generations were getting to the podcast app through influencers, easy access via Spotify, and cross-promotion of social media apps that were already popular for them.\u201d\n\nThe dramatic increase in the visibility of podcasts through social media and in mainstream media through celebrities, influencers, and YouTubers, are the primary determinants for its growing success and popularity, especially among younger generations. According to Edison Research, in 2022, 62% of Americans age 12+ will have listened to a podcast once in their lives. This is a 57% increase from 2021 and an estimation of 177 million people.\n\nJenkins returned back to the larger appeal of podcasting aside from its accessibility and visibility in mainstream media. He articulated how podcasting\u2019s appeal, by its very nature, is grounded in its nicheness and intimate qualities. \u201cI think a lot of people are excited that it is still largely grassroots,\u201d Jenkins said. The mix of grassroots and professional means that there is high-quality stuff to get you started but there is also a fascination with how niche it can go.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that podcasts\u2019 appeal for younger generations stems from their desire to escape \u201ccorporate media dominance.\u201d They intend to navigate \u201calternative channels as they don\u2019t feel their voices are heard or represented in the dominant medium.\u201d\n\nThe accessibility, visibility, intimacy, and personalized nature of podcasting is what makes it the ideal medium for younger audiences to express themselves as a consumer or as a creator.```"}

This affinity for video games has never been more popular, with entire industries and communities connected by a shared enthusiasm for gaming. To the surprise of some parents, playing and making video games can actually be a viable career choice nowadays, too. Sometimes, this passion and popularity for gaming can lead to the creation of wonderful opportunities that empower and uplift diverse groups of people.\n\nFor Jamie Collier, a recent graduate at UNC-Chapel Hill, playing video games on Twitch \u2014 a streaming platform mainly used by gamers \u2014 is a passion that she\u2019s enjoyed throughout her years in college. However, as a Black content creator, and as a woman of color, things haven\u2019t always been easy.\n\nThe George Floyd tragedy and its aftermath in the summer of 2020 sparked a new wave of online racial tensions among different communities in online gaming spaces. In particular, the video live streaming platform Twitch saw an increase in a phenomenon called \u201cHate Raids\u201d, which are targeted attacks initiated by anonymous users that flood marginalized content creators\u2019 stream chat rooms with insults and harassment.\n\n\u201cAt that time, it would be... like, I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s call them like, hate raider; one, two, three, four. They would go into, like, multiple creators of colors\u2019 channels and start hate raids. So, like, they get banned on one channel, then just move on to the next. And that\u2019s how that specific account kind of became known for hate raiding. So, people just made a list of all the known hate raiding accounts and were like, \u2018Hey, you need to block these users because they\u2019re not there just to be chatting, like, they\u2019re there for malicious intent\u2019\u201d, says Collier.\n\nPlaying games online as a Black person is often a mixed experience. For example, when joining a lobby of strangers to play with in the popular video game Call of Duty, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear the N-word or other racial slurs via microphone chat. If it\u2019s discovered that you\u2019re a woman by the way your voice sounds, the harassment is usually much worse. At other points in a Black person\u2019s gaming experience though, some of the kindest people you\u2019ll ever meet could also be in the same lobby.\n\nStreaming on Twitch is very similar for Black content creators, it\u2019s a mixed experience. In February 2021, the Twitch community took part in a month-long celebration of Black streamers, post-George Floyd, for Black History Month. It was an effort that was initiated and spearheaded by Twitch itself.\n\n\u201cHistory doesn\u2019t just happen. It\u2019s created. And Black streamers are creating it live every day\u201d, Twitch stated in a press release. \u201cSo this Black History Month, we want to celebrate Black brilliance by honoring, uplifting, and recognizing the Black creators who shape gaming culture and beyond everytime they go live.\u201d\n\nThis was an opportunity to highlight members from the Black Twitch community creating interesting content and to feature them on the front page of the website. However, by this point, hate raids had already become a known problem on the platform, and community members were optimistic but understandably cautious.\n\nTwitch assured users that their concerns in 2020 were heard and that changes had been made. Also, it didn\u2019t necessarily matter how popular a particular content creator was on the platform. If you\u2019re identifiable as a Black streamer, hate raids were still an issue for them, too.\n\nKaiCenat, a very popular Black streamer who achieved the rare feat of amassing over 100,000 subscribers on Twitch, still faced intense discrimination from racist trolls whose primary objectives were to diminish his success.\n\nWhile Twitch had a plan to solve the influx of racism affecting its platform, it failed to fully prevent these attacks from happening. To be fair, issues of toxic gamer culture aren\u2019t exclusive to Twitch; however, the company is in a unique position as the top destination for gamers to watch and stream video games. They have a responsibility as an industry leader to enact effective protocols and changes that smaller companies can hopefully emulate themselves to make gaming better for everyone.\n\nDespite the positive sentiments, crafty and determined trolls still found ways to get around the various tools that Twitch implemented for its users.\n\n\u201cOur goal is for everyone to have a safe, celebratory experience that introduces viewers to some awesome communities. We know more visibility can sometimes lead to unwanted trolling and harassment so we\u2019re offering sessions on mod tools, best practices, and more to every creator participating in our Black History Month celebration. We\u2019ve also implemented a clear escalation process for any creator in need of more support,\u201d the company said.\n\nTanaya Ree, an actress, creative producer and Twitch streamer, knows from experience, as a Black woman, that the effects of toxic gamer culture is spreading.\n\n\u201cGaming cultures that exist on other live streaming platforms such as Microsoft\u2019s Mixer, Facebook Gaming, YouTube Gaming or that exist on TikTok, all of these avenues of social media where people can create content. As a woman and as a person of color, I\u2019ve experienced misogyny and racism, this isn\u2019t a Twitch specific thing,\u201d says Ree.\n\nIn her view, Twitch has helped Black content creators in significant ways and isn\u2019t the primary source of where others should place their blame for the influx of racism on the platform. A few of her friends have benefitted from things like the Twitch Ambassadors program, or were a featured channel during Black History Month.\n\nHowever, she wants to keep Twitch accountable for things that are exclusive to its platform as a result of the hate raids, such as the act of doxxing or swatting. This is when trolls find the real address or other private information of the streamers and then post it online for others to see. The result is sometimes violent as swat teams or police officers show up to the residences of the streamers to arrest them based on bogus phone calls.\n\n\u201cPeople...during the hate raids, people\u2019s addresses were being leaked. People had to block their address in chat. And I\u2019m like you got to do more to combat these things and have better safeguards. so your platform doesn\u2019t get hacked by people who can easily take over and do these things.\u201d\n\nThe impact of hate raids caused additional pain and suffering to a community of people that were already going through tough times as a result of the George Floyd murder and its aftermath. The extreme efforts of racist trolls to harm Black streamers continues today, despite Twitch\u2019s implementations.\n\nThe bright side to the hate raids and Twitch\u2019s letdowns is that the moment has united people within the Black gaming community closer together. It\u2019s easy to find Black streamers of diverse interests and backgrounds, banding together in support of each other on Twitter or other social media spaces whenever something like this happens to a fellow community member.\n\n\u201cAny time you see a platform not doing something,\u201d Ree said, \u201cJust make sure you\u2019re also being the voice to uplift and empower, and host and raid whatever you got to do to support the communities around you, if you feel like it\u2019s not being done.\u201d\n```"}

Cold crisp aluminum with a Modelo logo on it, always laying strewn across the neighbor\u2019s front lawn. The neighbors \u2014 our tenants \u2014 had a problem, obviously. But I didn\u2019t know it then. I just had to clean them up.\n\nWhen my parents first moved to the south side of Chicago, they got a good deal on their house. At the time, Chicago Heights was a haven for a lot of newly arrived Mexican families, and we happened to move right into the heart of this blooming community. I remember that house very fondly. The four pillars on the porch gave it a stately presence. The blue hue of the wood spoke of serenity on the street.\n\nWhen I was strong enough to push a lawn mower, it became my job to landscape both of those houses on Schilling Avenue. It seems that my father wanted to instill a good work ethic within me at 11 years old, and when he offered to pay, I couldn\u2019t refuse. He was a proud Mexican man, with hazel eyes and thick brown eyebrows that illuminated resilience. It made sense why he wanted his son to develop the same ambition that brought him to the U.S.\n\nThe weekly allowance became my incentive to mow that lawn every Saturday, every summer. I wanted to save up for that beautiful blue bike I saw at Walmart. I was only 11, but I desperately needed a hot ride to park at the corner store down the street.\n\nWhen I first began, I didn\u2019t know how rowdy those tenants could get. Our usual tenants tended to be from a similar background to us: Spanish-speaking immigrants who sent as much money as they could to Mexico. They would work various jobs, from pizza cooks to car wash employees. Sometimes they would bring us a pizza if they felt generous when they stopped by to pay their rent.\n\nMy brother and I often observed them when we played outside; it was always dark hair, brown skin, swollen knuckles, and coarse voices. I remember a few of them, and the stories my dad would tell us about them. Mene was a lighter-skinned Mexican who always wore a flat-bill hat. I think he was balding because from the few times I did see the crown of his head which always looked fainter and fainter. He would rotate his hats out several times a week to show off his fascination for American baseball teams. His favorite was the black New York Yankees hat \u2014 it was the one he always wore when going out.\n\nMy dad always asked the man to get him a similar one but he always made an excuse. \u201cC\u00f3mprame una Mene,\u201d my dad would shout when he saw him leave. \u201cNext time boss-man,\u201d he would reply in his broken English. My dad and he both knew where he was going: the liquor store on Ashland. I guess Mene never got around to buying my dad that hat, but he made sure he got the 24-pack of Modelos.\n\nRey was the other tenant who lived in the lower unit. He was a warm shade of brown with studs on his ears. He looked short, but he was taller than he appeared to be\u2014almost like how a stop sign looks tiny from afar but when you stand next to it, you realize it\u2019s actually seven feet tall. Rey wasn\u2019t seven feet but he was a little bit taller than my dad. I guess the wife beaters he wore and the knee-length shorts shaved off a few inches from his height.\n\nEven so, my favorite thing about him was when he made jokes with me and my brother, especially when he saw us walk back from school. \u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 aprendieron hoy?\u201d was the daily inquiry about what we learned that day. \u201cNom\u00e1s pura matem\u00e1ticas\u201d I would respond, complaining about just learning math that day. \u201cLas matem\u00e1ticas no sirven para nada,\u201d He would say about the uselessness of math. I thought it was funny he said that, given that he was a cashier and cook at the Mexican restaurant nearby.\n\nMy brother made it his concern to tell Rey about lunch they served at school that day. Equally, Rey made it his concern to tell my brother that he couldn\u2019t live off his replacement lunch of Hot Cheetos and Brisk Tea. I don\u2019t remember much of the other tenants, mostly because they left so soon after arriving. A lot of them ended up getting a girl pregnant and found a bigger apartment, while others just decided to go back to Mexico.\n\nThe longest anyone stayed was Mene and Rey, and that\u2019s why we were sort of close. They were the consistent drinkers of the neighborhood too, and the ones who orchestrated the parties on Fridays. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t even call them parties. They were just a couple of brown men standing around griping cans of beer with the same swollen knuckles that had cycled in and out of that next-door apartment.\n\nThe occasional speaker with music would arrive, but the weekly convention did not need Mexican corridos to set the mood. When they did convene, though, it would only be small talk interrupted by large swigs of beer. It\u2019s like they were trying to see who could get drunk the quickest, and if it took 7 beers, so be it. But when they did hit that sweet spot of intoxication, the laughter was infectious.\n\n\u201cEres bien feo guey! Te pareces a una baca,\u2019\u2019 Mene would say to Rey in reference to his big nose. I didn\u2019t think Rey was ugly, as Mene believed, but he did need a better skincare routine. \u201cNo tu guey, te pareces a un burro\u201d Rey would snap back. He was right though. Mene did have pointed ears that made him look like a donkey.\n\nAnother tenant whose name I didn\u2019t know would affirm Rey\u2019s comeback and say that Mene\u2019s ears are the reason he couldn\u2019t keep a girlfriend. To an 11 year old, this was the most hilarious shit ever. It was highly entertaining to watch these men interact, to douse themselves in beer, to hear their cackling all through the night.\n\nI eventually asked my dad why they drank so much and why they never cleaned up. My dad solemnly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re adults now, and they pay their rent. Also, you would be out of a job if they stopped.\u201d I never asked again.\n\nBut no matter how entertained I was, I knew that Saturday morning would be a long day of work. It was no big deal though, because my mom\u2019s chilaquiles gave me enough energy to get me through the humid Chicago summers. I woke up early to go next door and inspect the staircase of the apartments. If there were a substantial amount of cans, I would have to go to the garage and get two black garbage bags. If the drinking load was light, I would only get one.\n\nIt was so gross to pick up those cans one by one, placing each drink of the night before inside my black bag. At the time, I never understood why those men chose beer\u2014beer was gross. After I purged the grass of the memories of the evening before, I would pull out the lawn mower. I was shorter than the handles, but still, I revved the engine as hard as I could to get the job done.\n\nI was fascinated how the red lawn mower ran up green grass like a razor to the scalp. I\u2019d give both of our houses a much needed haircut, and the next day the lawn would shine brightly with Sunday morning dew. \u201c\u00a1S\u00edguele Amigo!\u201d They would say when they saw me struggle. It meant \u2018keep going\u2019. \u201cDe nada!\u201d I yelled because I knew I was getting closer to that bike.\n\nI pushed and pulled every corner, struggling to make straight lines. However, no matter how much cleaning I did the hour before, a beer can would always hit the bottom of the blade, shutting the engine down with a high-pitched PING! Frustrated, I lifted the machine and removed the can. By the time I was done, I smelled like warm Budweiser and bleeding grass. I was exhausted, but the crisp $20 bill always had a way of easing my woes.\n\n\u201cLook at you! Making big money Alancito,\u201d Mene would say in a sarcastic tone. \u201cMore than you,\u201d I would reply with quick banter. It\u2019s like we had a symbiotic relationship with each other. Those tenants would provide the work and I was the one who did the work. We both knew that if they stopped drinking, I would be out of a job.\n\nMy dad made sure that I cleaned the grass before I cut it, and if there was nothing to clean, I would get less pay. I guess the reason I remember this one specific memory is because I understand it more now. as a kid I only saw beer cans and bottles, never what they truly meant, or as to why they got there.\n\nI would hear the cackling and the music from my open window on a Friday night, enjoying the show but dreading the work that I would have to do the following morning. I never took into account who those men were, and I see it now that I am in college. These men shared the same background as my family: Mexican, immigrant and trying to make a living in America.\n\nI didn\u2019t know that most of them were in their twenties, at the cusp of adulthood with no idea who they were or how to speak the nation\u2019s language. They were simply working to pay their rent, to put gas in their tank, to send some money home, and to spend the rest on beer. \u201cWhat a waste,\u201d I usually thought. But I learned that alcohol was the easiest way to forget; the beer was a way of silencing the horrors of their journey here.\n\nRight before I left for college, I had a conversation with my dad. \u201cWhatever happened to Rey and Mene, and all those other guys?\u201d I asked. \u201cRey has a baby girl now and he lives in Indiana. Mene found a job in Texas through a relative,\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. You remember when Mene got so drunk he forgot his name and his birthday?\u201d I laughed. \u201cYeah Mijo, but I seriously think Mene still doesn\u2019t know his birthday.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cHis mother never told him the day he was born, and he was the last of eight children so no one really cared for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he get here, then, without a birthday?\u201d \u201cLike everyone else Mijo. Mene was a close friend of mine because I helped him cross the Rio Grande. We were with the same coyote, in the same group, in the same truck to Chicago. I almost saw him drown.\u201d I was at a loss for words.\n\nI remember how my dad spoke about crossing the border, but I never knew that they did it together. I guess that\u2019s why my dad never questioned his drinking habits, because he understood Mene\u2019s trauma; Mene was only trying to drown out the voices from the river that almost drowned him.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you drink, Dad, if both of you had such a similar story?\u201d \u201cMijo, my father died from an infected liver when I was three because he drank so much. As much as I wanted to, I knew that I couldn\u2019t do the same to you and your brothers. I had to find other ways to cope. So forgive me if I have such a short temper.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say. My own father who made me the ambitious young man I am today was the same as the neighbors who I criticized as a child. So in a way, the tenants who lived next door actually lived with me, but they were shaped in a different form: they were my dad.\n\nWhen I moved to California at 18, so far from Chicago, I was forced to grow up in ways I didn\u2019t think were possible. I was placed on an unfamiliar ground where palm trees replaced corn fields and oceans replaced lakes. Three months prior, I was in high school, not knowing I was saying goodbye to my childhood.\n\nIf it was hard for me, I can\u2019t imagine how hard it was for them. Mene, Rey and my dad were a part of a generation of immigrants that left their crippling financial situation back home to chase the American dream. They wanted to see for themselves if it was real, to see if they could make it big like so many others before them.\n\nAs unfamiliar as I was in California, I had the luxury of calling my parents and friends anytime I wanted, as long as I adjusted to the time zone. I, for one, spoke the common language of the U.S. I can\u2019t fathom how my dad spent weeks without calling his mom, and how hard it must\u2019ve been to not understand the conversations on the streets.\n\nI didn\u2019t know much about Rey and Mene\u2019s backstory, but I assume it was no different from my father\u2019s. So when they ended up living next door to each other on the street full of Mexicans on Schilling Avenue, I realized it was all for me. It was for the next generation so that their children could have a better life than the one they tried to escape.\n\nIt is easy to fall in the hole of the unfamiliar, to let sorrow consume you to the point where the only remedy is trapped inside a glass bottle of Budweiser. I don\u2019t know why I remember those beer cans from those Saturday mornings, but the memory exists. Those men have since moved out, and I too, have moved out, but new tenants live there now. I wonder who picks up those bottles and cans for them.\n```"}

That\u2019s this moment. There are intimations of the new, there is consolidation among the old. In between, there is a transition. Here, a lot will be formed. But many of those formed will be morbid.\u201d \u2014  from \"The Great Left Divide\"\n\n\u201cOne man will think for 48 million Filipinos\u201d \u2014  from HARING BAYAN: Democracy and People Power in the Philippines\n\nSpecters of communism haunt many immigrants. I first met the ghost through my mother who introduced me (through stories, not literally) to the New People\u2019s Army, a group waging guerilla warfare throughout the Filipino countryside, championing their constant violence against proletariats and bourgeoisie alike as their tool of \u2018liberation.\u2019 It is the longest running \u2018communist\u2019 insurgency in the world (though they don\u2019t follow much of its ideals) all led by Jose Maria Sison, their leader of admittedly bourgeois upbringings who died last year.\n\nSo, vis a vis my mother, I came to know my first variant of McCarthyism; how American of her! Alongside these stories of militant rebels, I learned of what happened to those who were \u2018too political\u2019: Folks who disappeared under the Ferdinand Marcos regime, friends shot, lovers dead. Daily news of the deceased. Keeping your head down made sure it stayed on your body, and people\u2019s heads were so down, some of them went underground and a counter-movement against the dictator began.\n\nThere was the First Quarter Storm of 1970, a period of protests consisting of events like the Battle of Mendiola, where protesters clashed with police (one side was clearly being shot); A \u2018People\u2019s March\u2019 in Manila with students, workers and the urban poor crowding the streets; the Diliman Commune protest of 1971, when students occupied their university campus in the romanticized 60s-70s fashion, which left several students injured and one dead (a 17-year-old boy named Pastor Mesina), and the Plaza Miranda bombings, which killed nine and injured 95, reportedly done by the government or the CPP though both deny it.\n\nRegardless of its cause, the Miranda bombings was Marcos\u2019 excuse to declare martial law, leading to the persecution and death of many. One of the most significant protests occurred in 1983, when Ninoy Aquino, opposition leader to Marcos, was assassinated. The streets were decorated with yellow ribbons to welcome Ninoy\u2019s return to the Philippines. His mother advised him against it, especially with the upheavals and antagonisms present in the country, but he went anyway and upon arrival at the airport, shouts of \u201cPusila! Pusila! Pusila!\u201d emerged and he was shot on the airplane tarmac.\n\nTen days after Ninoy\u2019s death, more than a million Filipinos would carry him to his grave, along 19 miles for 10 hours and a half. One mourner was reportedly struck by lightning and died. So, Ninoy came, and died, as many others did.\n\nThe Filipino people had seen and felt much. Liberation from centuries of occupation and imperialism, through Spain, America and Japan, engendered a discussion of how to build a country anew. Is it built through sacrifice? Through industry? Through democracy? A market? Capitalism or communism? What -ism, what body, what people, makes a country? Freedom was a gargantuan possibility.\n\nAfter Filipinos dismounted the \u2018colonial horse,\u2019 where would they walk? Would they really be governed by another administration, another group of people who had no stake, nor care, in their living? As if in answer, 1986 came, and the People\u2019s Power Movement came to its crux. Between February 22 to 25, Malaca\u00f1ang, the \u2018White House\u2019 of sorts in the Philippines, was surrounded by protesters. Flashes of yellow re-emerged in the streets, particularly at EDSA, Epifanio de Los Santos Avenue.\n\nPeople were tired and starving, and many felt that death was nothing worse than what they could feel now. My mother was praying in the countryside with her family at the time. She was Catholic, like many Filipinos, and simply wanted everything to go well. A tense fervor swallowed the country. You couldn\u2019t help but think: would I live? Go to school? Meet my friends? Have another meal? What happens now?\n\nSoldiers readied themselves. Tanks rolled in. Archbishops, militants and cardinals were interspersed throughout the fiasco. As death seemed imminent, neither the religious nor secular provided answers. However, the guns would be lowered. Military defections in the Filipino army took place. Radio and TV stations were reclaimed by protesters. Cory Aquino would be sworn in as President as Marcos tried to retain his power.\n\nPanic ensued, and one of Marcos\u2019 generals, Fabian Ver, implores Marcos to authorize an airstrike to disperse the protesters. On air, before the TV screen, Marcos replies: \u201cMy order is not to attack.\u201d Some Filipino \u2018loyalists\u2019 praised Marcos for his \u2018forbearance\u2019 and \u2018self-control\u2019. What 3,200+ extrajudicial killings and 75,000+ reported instances of torture under his rule attests to, I leave you to ponder.\n\nProtests continued, and on February 25, protests would end. Cory Aquino, wife of Ninoy, would be sworn in as President, hand on the Bible owned by her dead husband\u2019s mother. At Malaca\u00f1ang, Marcos was preparing to flee. Around midnight, with millions of dollars in gold, jewelry and cash, the Marcos family fled. Protesters celebrated, and Malaca\u00f1ang\u2019s gates broke as people flooded in.\n\nThey entered, walked around, saw its halls and saw the opulence that had come at the cost of the Filipino people. They entered the dining room. On the table were plates of hot food, untouched and left in a haste according to my father, who stood in the room that day; what he felt, I don\u2019t know, but complex histories produce conflicting individuals, and Marcos was gone: he was saved by the U.S.A., never again to return to the Philippines.\n\nII. The Leaving\n\n\u201cKung hindi tayo kikibo, sinong kikibo? Kung di tayo kikilos, sinong kikilos? Kung hindi ngayon, kailan pa?\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t move, who will move? If we don\u2019t act, who will act? If not now, when?\u201d \u2014  a slogan created by Abraham \u201cDitto\u201d Pascual Sarmiento in UP Collegian\n\n17 years later, my mother herself would come to America. Big ambitions filled her head and 1986 was long past. She came out of the countryside with our family. We had lived on! Cory Aquino had the presidency and with her ascension came hope. My mom went to college, and through the years presidents changed. However, conditions didn\u2019t: Poverty remained and new problems emerged.\n\nRapid urbanization during and after Marcos\u2019 rule created new sociocultural issues and divisions. People remained dissatisfied and to this day, the NPA still recruits, guerillas still exist and political corruption still remains. Much of the country is still ruled by the same old political dynasties and families. In fact, by 1991, the Marcos family was back in the Philippines (though Marcos Sr. the dictator was dead).\n\nThe Aquinos accuse the Marcos\u2019 of corruption, the Marcos\u2019 accuse the Aquinos, who then accuse the Dutertes and so on and so on. Of the 80 provinces of the Philippines, about 73 have similar familial dynasties. Then, in 2016, Rodrigo Duterte came. Drug wars were waged and thousands were killed, and under his presidency, Ferdinand Marcos would be buried in the national Heroes\u2019 cemetery.\n\nIn 2022, the son of Marcos became the new president, rewriting his family\u2019s past and rejuvenating his family name anew. The genealogy of the country concerned my mother no longer for she had a life of her own to wrangle. In 2003, I was born. My mother was now in New York, the \u2018Big Apple.\u2019 Things were new, and America\u2019s politics seemed particularly new, especially with its bold proclamations of Democracy.\n\nBut a month after she arrived in America, the Twin Towers fell. The Iraq war started. Impingements and intertwinings occurred, and lives were lost, claimed, and taken once more. Revolution entails more than destruction: it means making something of fragments. It means not only transformation and preservation, but cycles, in the way that one never flees one\u2019s oppressions but faces it.\n\nWhen does one first meet war? At birth? Or when it\u2019s too late? From a distance? Or on our street? Supposedly post-racial and post-everything compared to the \u2018third world,\u2019 America promised to be the Dream. Instead, many immigrants were presented with a dissociative vision: America the dream, America the nightmare and America the slumbering and unfulfilled project, that just needed one more voice, one more eventual American, one more nation under the Nation, and perhaps, in amnesia or jubilee, it would overcome its own silences and cacophonies to create a sacrosanct nation for all.\n\nI saw the incongruency of this country, perhaps in the way that my mother would have seen the Philippines. The colonialists were ousted, and freedom was there, so why did Ferdinand Marcos come? But again, he was more a symptom of a condition rather than a cause, revealing that Filipinos were still invariably shackled. By what? Did the key break on the path to \u2018liberation\u2019?\n\nRevolution entails more than destruction: it means making something of fragments. It means not only transformation and preservation, but cycles, in the way that one never flees one\u2019s oppressions but faces it. And this honesty towards one\u2019s condition, of recognizing that one is still affected in whatever way, leaves one yearning for more.\n\nA mouth opens in America, and at times the words become silent.\n\nIII. The Reverberations\n\n\u201cO kay sarap mabuhay lalo na\u2019t may lambingan.\u201d \u201cOh how good to live, especially when there is tenderness.\u201d \u2014  from \u201cMaalaala Mo Kaya\u201d\n\n12 years later, 2015, my mother and I are watching a melodrama called M.M.K, Maalala Mo Kaya (Could You Remember?), an anthology series detailing the hardships and lives of true-to-life Filipinos who overcame situations, detailing \u2018bootstrap\u2019 stories and the like. A special episode featured Manny Pacquiao, a boxing world champion and Filipino icon.\n\nIt is said that whenever he has a fight, crime decreases in the Philippines! Anyways, my mother stares at the screen of whatever episode we were watching that night. She stares, blinks, then says her story could be there on the TV, flashing before us. I laughed in disbelief at the time; I couldn\u2019t quite fathom my family or my people\u2019s condition then. I was quite numb to myself, and as an extension, to her.\n\nTo admit something has happened to your people is hard, especially in America, where admitting particular disappointments and inequities are often pinned on the supposed incompetence of an individual and their people. She continued, as I paraphrase and translate from Tagalog: \u201cYou know English well. You should write our story down.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t fathom that either. Our story being valued? Who would it be valued by and why? Would we not be an Oriental oddity, an exoticized good, peddled around on a global scale outside of the local marketplace? It\u2019s a fearful thing to be a story or a narrative, to be exchanged and bartered, to be reduced to an expression of something else other than Life.\n\nI wanted to feel human in whatever context I was in, and now, I may understand what she may have wanted. She only wanted something to corroborate her life and her sense of reality, to prove that things had happened, to and around her, that she had lived and still lives, like many others in America yearning for a confirmation that one has existed with or without a country.\n\nAnd in this country, in this house we call America, questions of liberation, freedom, and \u2018unity\u2019 have defined us since our inception. Who are we? Who is \u2018we\u2019? And at times I don\u2019t feel my particularities until I am with others, and I remember an old friend saying once, sometimes I forget you are Asian, until I remember that you are, and yes, I am that and something else that I\u2019m forgetting, because we\u2019ve all been touched in some way by this American malaise, of this \u2018figuring out\u2019 and yearning.\n\nIV. The Questions That Remain\n\n\u201cFor the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul\u201d \u2014  Leviticus 17:11\n\nHow do we process a break long after it happens? I suppose the first step is to return to something, so I remember this: On early mornings my mother would see her father rise. Outside, there were chickens crowing as rubber trees flitted in the wind. Village folks, farmers, and workers were about. Women at the marketplace carried goods, coca-cola and Americana.\n\nIt was the 70s, and she was young. The economic situation was damnable, but my mother told me there was something about that life that gave her joy, though she was aware of her condition. There was the sun. The country air. Plants and \u2018nature.\u2019 And most of all, family.\n\nIn spite of what revolution or change does to a country and its people, they held onto each other. All I know is that people have always lived in spite of deprivations, for the dispossessed have always lived despite death.\n\nShe recollects one morning where there was only a singular egg to be shared for breakfast. She was hungry, and between her brother and sister, they divided it into three. I don\u2019t know how good that egg was; as for what my grandparents ate, I also don\u2019t know.\n\nAll I know is that people have always lived in spite of deprivations, for the dispossessed have always lived despite death. There are no bidas, no heroes in this story, or any story for that matter. No protagonists, only recurrences. Those we focus on, we focus on because they are in our blood, our heads and once there, they live, no matter how far removed or far they are from us.\n\nHomesickness and yearning only ever means finding yourself strangely transposed in a piece you don\u2019t quite note. So you move, and you play and a note is out of time and you\u2019re trying to remember why you\u2019re syncopated. I\u2019ve come to regard my familial phantasms in such a way.\n\nLike a ghost looking for a body, I see my history, and I lose myself to it sometimes. Possession: that\u2019s the issue. Filipinos are a translated being, as all humanity is. Who possesses a translation? The language? The author? Or the translator?\n\nAll that remains is a body, whether real or an \u2018idea,\u2019 a corpus of work, a word, a book, newspaper clipping or something. Looking at garbage in the street, or the metal or concrete, I sometimes wonder where it came from.\n\nI would come to be American in the fact that my mother is not. I feel at times that the act of immigration is one of literal translation. To transfigure one\u2019s culture to relay itself to another: it\u2019s not hegemony, it\u2019s not adaptability nor assimilation but simply survival.\n\nBecause you can\u2019t speak survival in another country with the same tongues. America has new mouths and structures. Saying bayan ko and kailan pa is of another time and space, a mirror world.\n\nThe People\u2019s Power Movement is long past, and I am now in the States, but what remains? I guess names. The fact that so many stories converge within me, producing confusion. Or is it the fact that I am connected, but painfully severed, from my past, so I can\u2019t help but feel that in each story I learn, I hear something of my own people?\n\n\u201cWhen history sleeps, it speaks in dreams: On the brow of the sleeping people, the poem is a constellation of blood,\u201d said Octavio Paz.\n\nI look up at the sky, not many stars in the cities of America. No Big Dipper, Orion or Hunter, though those are Greek conceptions not exactly pertaining to my people. My people\u2019s myths are somewhere, but I am struggling to see where as I sift through newspapers I\u2019ve never held, within archives that attest that my family\u2019s history has passed.\n\nSo, like an American, I\u2019ve come to see myself in others because I can\u2019t see myself. In immigration, things are not lost, but turned into impressions, or a hardscrabble reality, rugged, realistic, rough.\n\nIn the way that colors flow into one another, it\u2019s the only way I can envision an American, one, who despite all parochiality and myopia, finds themself incontrovertibly tied to another. Someone is in their blood regardless of blood, and their living depends on how they\u2019ve come to face this fact.\n\nIn \u201cTime is A Mother\u2019', poet, archivist, writer, and dreamer, Ocean Vuong, wonders, \u201cNo, not beauty \u2013\u2013 but you and I outliving it...\u201d\n\nTo outlive, and be outlived... History is a way of figuring out what has happened to one\u2019s people, a way of continuing in spite of death, to not exactly give birth, but to reincarnate what\u2019s been \u2018lost,\u2019 in the process finding possibilities of redemption, not simply for you and I, but perhaps for what remains in the land our forebearers left.\n\nWhen we look back, what do we see? Things past, or our face, woefully present, looking back?\n```"}

With her being the longest-reigning British monarch in history, her influence reached all corners of the world. While browsing tributes of her, there\u2019s one picture that can be found over and over. It\u2019s a portrait of a young Queen Elizabeth shortly after her coronation in 1952. On top of her head sits a stunning crown. The picture is beautiful and regal \u2014 fitting for a queen. But the gorgeous crown sitting on top of the Queen\u2019s hair holds a stolen jewel. In 1905, while South Africa was still a part of the British Empire, the largest diamond in the world, known as \u201cThe Great Star of Africa,\u201d was stolen at the direction of the British monarchy. This jewel, along with several smaller ones stolen from other nations, sits atop the Queen\u2019s crown. Their beauty serves as a distraction from the ugly history of how they were retrieved. A history rife with colonialism, oppression and injustices perpetrated against countries across the world at the hands of the British Empire, a history that Queen Elizabeth did not rectify during her record-long reign. This lack of action has left former British colonies reveling in the Queen\u2019s death while the rest of the world mourns.\n\nWhile British people were lining the streets in black, waiting in three-mile lines to see the Queen\u2019s coffin and weeping for their monarch, people in Ireland were chugging beer and chanting \u201cF*** Lizzy\u201d from the rooftops. A stark contrast given the two countries are just a short hour-long flight from each other. For those who always looked up to the Queen as a role model and a symbol of leadership, it may be confusing as to why anyone would be happy that she died. But for people living in countries recovering from the effects of British rule, it is anything but surprising.\n\nFor many, worshiping the Queen and the royal family as a whole is very personal to them \u2014 it ties into their culture and identity. Children grow up singing \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d like Americans sing the national anthem. Everyone knows where they were during Princess Diana\u2019s death or William and Kate\u2019s wedding, and everyone has their own stories to tell. Supporting the royal family is an integral part of the British experience. For them, it\u2019s easier to idolize royalty instead of recognizing the harm they\u2019ve done, as the monarchy\u2019s actions don\u2019t affect their core identities. That can\u2019t be said for nations like India, Pakistan, Australia and Ireland.\n\nMany of the TikToks that displayed the Irish celebrations had their comment sections flooded with allegations of insensitivity. And yes, cheering and toasting to someone dying is usually something that everyone would consider to be insensitive. But Ireland, Britain\u2019s first colony, has long had a complicated history with the monarchy. Before gaining independence, Ireland endured over 800 years of military and political intervention at the hands of Britain. After gaining independence, the Queen remained head of state of parts of Northern Ireland, leading to tension between the parts of the country under British rule and the parts that were not. This culminated in The Troubles, a period in which nearly 4,000 people lost their lives. While she aided in repairing the relations between Ireland and Britain following this tragic period, it\u2019s hard to ignore that this could have all been avoided if the British didn\u2019t colonize Ireland in the first place.\n\nDuring the Queen\u2019s reign, 56 other nations gained independence from Britain. It was not by the Queen\u2019s hand, but rather, in spite of it. While Britain\u2019s colonialism began long before Queen Elizabeth ever graced the throne, the damage it\u2019s done to countries still persists even today. Countries that were previously colonized suffer from economic instability, cultural degradation, and persisting human rights violations as a direct result of British occupation. And though the Queen might not have directly caused these issues, as a world leader, many felt that she had a duty to help repair the damage her family has caused throughout history. She didn\u2019t do that. At no point during her reign did the Queen offer reparations or any type of aid to the countries that left the British Empire. While she signed letters of apologies to nations like New Zealand and Barbados and visited former colonies, including Ireland, in an attempt to build positive relations with the nations, her actions often fell flat and came off as performative.\n\nCritics of the royal family feel that with the royals accumulating so much of their wealth from the direct exploitation of these nations, there is a duty to give some of it back. But despite all this, to most of the world (or at least countries who haven\u2019t faced Britain\u2019s oppression), the queen was an icon. Is an icon. She took over the throne during her mid-20s while the United Kingdom was still reeling from the aftermath of World War II. She set a record for the longest reign of a British monarch ever. She was the Queen of England during a time when women were expected to stay home and raise children. At a glance, she looks like a champion for women\u2019s rights, leadership, and empowerment. And in many ways, she was.\n\nBut despite being a powerful woman, Queen Elizabeth continued the rule of oppression, white supremacy, and misogyny just like all royals have throughout history. To this very day, in the year 2022, the title of \u201cKing\u201d still outranks the title of \u201cQueen.\u201d If you have ever wondered why Prince Philip was a prince and not a king, that\u2019s why. Similarly, women have to adhere to strict dress codes that ban immodest dress or flashy colors or patterns. Colored nail polish is strictly forbidden. On top of this, strict rules are in place for etiquette, with the royal women instructed to cross their legs in a \u201cladylike\u201d way and curtsy in the presence of higher-ranking royals (who are quite literally their own family members). While the Queen loosened rules regarding marriage and divorce during her reign (her sister and three of her children all got divorced \u2014 which was previously a huge no-no for the royals), these outdated practices remained a staple of the royal brand. She could\u2019ve changed them but chose not to. Instead of challenging norms of femininity, she decided not to test society\u2019s idea of what a \u201cqueen\u201d should be. She stuck with what was safe and never dared to be a radical queen, both in her policy decisions as well as her everyday fashion choices.\n\nThink about it like this: she was the leader of the largest empire in the entire world, but she wouldn\u2019t dare to wear bold nail polish. While much of the world chalk these practices up to tradition, recently, more people have begun to realize that the Royal Family is truly as outdated and out-of-touch as they portray themselves. Meghan Markle\u2019s allegations of racism stunned Americans and outraged masses of Brits after her Oprah interview last spring. While many were stunned that members of the royal family would dare to ask the couple about their son\u2019s skin color, those who have been directly impacted by British colonialism were not the least bit shocked. Is the royal family, racist? For residents of countries who gained freedom from the commonwealth, that was like asking if the sky is blue. But for those who are less familiar, it\u2019s hard to reconcile the shiny, polished exterior with the royals\u2019 dark, oppressive history. And it\u2019s hard to reconcile that it might not even be history, but actually continuing on in the present.\n\nAs stated previously, the royal women have often been looked up to as style icons and fashion inspirations. But between Queen Elizabeth\u2019s stolen jewels and misogynistic dress standards, there are a lot of problematic elements behind what they wear. A lesser-known, but one of the more egregious examples of this occurred in 2017 when Princess Michael of Kent wore a racist brooch. The Queen\u2019s first cousin wore a piece of blackmoor jewelry, which fetishizes images of slavery. To add insult to injury, this racist accessory was worn to a lunch with Meghan Markle \u2014 the first Black member of the Royal Family. Yet, people were still surprised four years later when Meghan started detailing her experiences of racism while being a working member of the family. Not only were they surprised, but British people in particular became defensive. It was almost like the decades of scandals surrounding the family had been swept away. As if Princess Diana, a blonde, white, British woman had not vocalized similar complaints just two decades prior. Markle was villainized by the media and painted to be the one causing the problem. British tabloids accused her of bullying her staff and even making Kate Middleton cry \u2014 despite no evidence supporting these claims. No royal other than her husband defended her. The Queen and other royals stood by as racist, misogynistic abuse was thrown at her by the media. While Prince Harry confirmed that neither the Queen nor Prince Philip made the racist remarks about Archie\u2019s skin color, the Queen never responded to the allegations or made any type of commentary suggesting that the behavior was wrong. She had a chance to comment on racism and did not take it. Imagine how powerful that would have been.\n\nIf one theme is apparent, it\u2019s that every scandal with the royals easily disappears as quickly as it appears. Why are the Brits, and others too, so loyal to them despite countless controversies surrounding them? Whether it ranges from racism to historical injustices to infidelity to even involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, nothing seems to remain in the public consciousness for long. One explanation for this can be found in groupthink. I mean, imagine being a Brit and not supporting the royal family? One can imagine that it would easily put you at odds with family, friends and other peers who were raised to have the utmost respect for the monarchy. On the flip side, the same goes for countries like Ireland that have long had a contentious relationship with the royal family. How do you revere the Queen in a country that quite literally is toasting to her death? If one thing is apparent throughout various nations, it\u2019s that responses to the royal family are strong. Positive or negative, it seems that everyone has a charged opinion.\n\nIt can be hard to reconcile the overwhelming love and hatred that coexists for Queen Elizabeth at the same time. During a period where so much changed for Britain, and the rest of the nations in the Commonwealth, Queen Elizabeth was a stagnant staple of grace, femininity, and poise. Prior to her death, she had met 12 Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and oversaw Britain through the aftermath of World War II, the Welfare State, The Troubles, and numerous other significant historical events. She led Brits through this time and spoke to the nation freely and openly about current events, including injustices being perpetrated against people across the world. That\u2019s why people love her. But it\u2019s also why people hate her. At the same time she was helping the United Kingdom recover from World War II, Nigeria was embroiled in its own civil war, which was fueled by the British impeding the Republic of Biafra\u2019s secession efforts. After war was unjustly waged on her own nation, Queen Elizabeth abetted the same thing happening to another. It\u2019s difficult to stomach both of those realities at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, when we discuss colonialism, many of the same themes come up: economic harm, cultural degradation, violence, environmental impact ... the list goes on. But while countries around the world fight against these long-lasting issues, the royals continue to be lauded by the press for their charity work and philanthropic efforts. According to the Royal Family\u2019s website, Queen Elizabeth was a patron of over 500 charities during her lifetime, many of them dedicated to addressing social injustices, poverty, hunger, homelessness and even a few supporting educational programs for marginalized groups. While I\u2019m sure her volunteer work and financial support helped many (mostly white) people throughout her lifetime, the hypocrisy of it all is hard to ignore. The same issues she tried to solve within her own country and other commonwealth countries she has perpetuated in other places.\n\nFor supporters of the Queen, it can be hard to see anything other than an adorable old lady giving back to the community and changing lives. Which in all fairness, she did. But for those dealing with those issues in their own lives at the hand of the monarchy, and seeing no aid from them, it makes Queen Elizabeth look like a complete sham. In totality, it\u2019s understandable why people can look up to the queen. At a glance, she was a lot to aspire to. But the reality is, the leadership style she was applauded for was a leadership style of inaction. A leadership style of brushing things under the rug and ignoring difficult conversations regarding oppression and injustice. It\u2019s easier to push things away and claim them to be long-forgotten history than face the fact that the horrors we read about in our history textbooks continue today. Even worse is that history books in the United Kingdom do not mention these events \u2014 most students in British schools have actually never heard of the Revolutionary War. With so much understanding of history needed to guide these difficult discussions, it\u2019s no wonder why many have been brainwashed into supporting the royals.\n\nWith that being said, for those who are aware of the monarchy\u2019s actions, while our natural instinct is to mourn a dead person, it\u2019s hard to celebrate the queen\u2019s life when she was never held accountable for her actions. In 1997, during her last visit to India, Queen Elizabeth said \u201chistory cannot be rewritten\u201d in reference to the 1919 massacre of Indians by British troops. She was right, history cannot change and no royal, no matter how powerful, can go back in time and un-colonize nations. But what they can do is aid countries in repairing themselves to the best of their ability. However, none of that can be done unless the monarchy acknowledges the full extent of the harm they have perpetrated against other nations. That, they have yet to do.\n\nWith the Queen\u2019s death bringing about these conversations and her being succeeded by a much less popular king, the history of the monarchy is facing an unprecedented level of uncertainty. With the general consciousness of the royals\u2019 injustices slowly increasing, many have surpassed the need for the monarchy. In fact, there are currently calls to completely abolish the monarchy, with many of those calls coming from Brits themselves. While the Queen never entertained such a thing, maybe one day there will be a ruler who realizes this may be the best thing after all, even if it upsets loyalists to the monarchy and fans of the Queen.\n```"}

Artwork: City Deep,2020. HD video. Courtesy of the artist. \n\nBy Charlotte Phillipp January 11, 2023 at 12:34 pm PST\n\nIn a loud, buzzing gallery room that overwhelms the senses at the Broad Museum, five projectors whir throughout an almost pitch-black room. They play five different short films, some animated, using stop-motion depicting laborers hard at work, others are live action in black-and-white and show household workers making beds or even dancing. Steel contraptions, described as a \u201cbreathing machine\u201d that combine parts such as pneumatic pipes and megaphone-like objects, pump away loudly. The room is frenzied yet calculated, creating an all-encompassing work that uses tools of industry to invoke both harmony and chaos.\n\nThis piece, \u201cThe Refusal of Time,\u201d is one of 130 featured works of South African-born artist William Kentridge on display in a new Broad retrospective, \u201cIn Praise of Shadows.\u201d Meant to encapsulate Kentridge\u2019s career, the exhibition runs through April 2023 and includes the 13 pieces by the artist already in the museum\u2019s collection.\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Kentridge\u2019s works are appearing in such a significant way in Los Angeles today. L.A. and Johannesburg, Kentridge hailing from the latter, are both cities of industry built on the labor of oppressed peoples, according to exhibition curator Ed Schad. Additionally, cinema as both an art form and an industry, which is particularly significant in L.A., take precedence in Kentridge\u2019s works.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be interesting to show Kentridge\u2019s studio in utter contrast to the big-budget cinema, as we typically understand it here in our city,\u201d said Schad at the exhibit\u2019s opening. Harkening to works such as the films in \u201cThe Refusal of Time,\u201d as well as his 2003 shorts \u201cDay for Night\u201d and \u201cJourney to the Moon\u201d \u2014 which both play with themes and concepts used in early cinema like drawings and camera tricks \u2014 Schad said, \u201cI wanted it to be a celebration of the intimacy and ambition of cinema from a new point of view.\u201d\n\nFilm is hardly the only art form that Kentridge practices, though. Active since the 1980s, the artist has worked in everything from printing to opera. Currently, Kentridge works out of Johannesburg\u2019s Centre for the Less Good Idea \u2014 inspired by a Tswana proverb that says, \u201cIf the good doctor can\u2019t cure you, find the less good doctor.\u201d Both a studio for his physical endeavors such as painting and sculpting, the center also houses performance spaces for actors and other performance artists.\n\nMuch of his multi-hyphenate artistic practice focuses on charcoal drawings, sculpting with metal, and theater \u2014 including a new production, \u201cHOUSEBOY,\u201d that premiered at L.A.\u2019s REDCAT in mid-November of last year.\n\nOne series on view at the Broad, \u201cDrawings for Projection,\u201d spans much of the artist\u2019s career. Beginning in 1989 and ending with works created in 2011, the metaphor of Kentridge\u2019s use of charcoal comes across the strongest. A common appearance in his works, many of these drawings depict workers such as miners, as well as their bosses, which is why his use of charcoal reflects such a strong theme of labor.\n\nTypically, Kentridge works by drawing with charcoal and then attempting to remove it from the page to create shadows. As described in the exhibit, \u201cOnce touched to paper, charcoal cannot be entirely erased.\u201d Such is the impact of labor on the people of cities such as Johannesburg.\n\nKentridge drew some of these works for various animated films, including \u201cOther Faces\u201d and \u201cWeighing... and Wanting,\u201d both of which are on view in the exhibition. The former, using the charcoal drawing method to create crude, shadowy, and almost faceless black-and-white human figures, illustrates Kentridge\u2019s striking work through specific characters, such as the fictional mining magnate, Soho Eckstein.\n\nMost of the time wearing a pinstripe suit, the large and cruel Eckstein is present in many of Kentridge\u2019s pieces. The industrialist often appears as a caricature of the colonial presence in South Africa. His evil can be likened to that of a villainous Shakespearean king.\n\n\u201cWeighing... and Wanting\u201d explores Eckstein\u2019s fall from grace. Without Apartheid to run his industry, he is without a place in the world.\n\nNotably, colonialism and industrialization are always thematically present in Kentridge\u2019s work. The son of a Jewish family of anti-Apartheid activists and lawyers who lived for many years in South Africa, Kentridge\u2019s work explores the impact of colonialism both past and present.\n\nHis films, as well as many of his other works, probe the social and political consequences of the transition from Apartheid to democracy in South Africa, as well as the mundane state of being that came with this oppression.\n\nDepictions of characters that Kentridge has created, such as Eckstein and another called Felix Teitelbaum, portray the stain that colonialism leaves on oppressed peoples.\n\nIn works such as his 1980-1981 series of etchings and drawings titled simply \u201cDomestic Scenes,\u201d Black workers are portrayed as \u201cfrenetic and madcap,\u201d as the Broad\u2019s catalog states. They labor in mines. They do housework. They pose near their horses. They sit solemnly on the couch after a long, hard day\u2019s work.\n\nThemes of colonialism also emerge in his 1997 work of printing and line drawings titled \u201cUbu Tells the Truth,\u201d albeit in a different way. Named after \u201cUbu Roi,\u201d a 19th-century French parody of \u201cMacbeth,\u201d the nature of the character Ubu is grotesque and satirizes the gluttonous monarchy.\n\nHere, Kentridge repurposes the theatrical representation of King Ubu through drawing, this time depicting him as a disgusting, excessive industrialist. Playing with texture, Kentridge represents human skin through rough line drawings so as to capture the humanity taken away from those oppressed by Apartheid and colonialism.\n\nBut workers are the heart of the stories that Kentridge tells, not their oppressors.\n\n\u201cThe work of William finds the evidence of this history and the landscape in the maps, but it also finds in the work in individual consciousness,\u201d said curator Schad, \u201cboth in revolt against apartheid and as well as consciousness that\u2019s complicit with its interests. This story is a fraught and rich one.\u201d\n\nJust down the road from the Broad, at the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater (REDCAT), Kentridge put his multimedia theatrical experience to work. Based on the 1956 novel of the same name by Cameroonian diplomat Ferdinand Oyono, Kentridge\u2019s \u201cHOUSEBOY\u201d follows the early life of Toundi, a young boy who cycles through various jobs in the residences of wealthy, white colonialists in Cameroon.\n\nThe play is told as a staged reading of sorts, with an older version of Toundi acting as the narrator and reading from the novel. A younger Toundi, joined by the many characters who follow him through his journey, interjects with dialogue and acts out the story.\n\nFor the most part, the stage is bare except for chairs for each of the actors to use when they\u2019re not taking part in the story, plus a few select props \u2014 including fine glassware on silver platters, a large stick that Toundi\u2019s father threatens to beat him with, and a wooden broom.\n\nThe story of Toundi is written in diary entries from his older self\u2019s perspective as he is kicked out of his home by his parents. His journey as a \u201chouse boy\u201d begins as he is brought into the home of a French Catholic priest as a servant.\n\nThere, he becomes religious and learns the trade of running a home.\n\n\u201cI was going to learn about the white men and live like them. I caught myself thinking I was like one of the wild parrots we used to attract in the village with grains of maize. They were captured through their greediness. My mother often used to say, laughing, \u2018Toundi, what will your greediness bring you to...?\u2019 My parents are dead. I have never been back to the village.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to learn about the city and white men and live like them. I caught myself thinking I was like one of the wild parrots we used to attract in the village with grains of maize. They were captured through their greediness. My mother often used to say, laughing, \u2018Toundi, what will your greediness bring you to...?\u2019 My parents are dead. I have never been back to the village.\u201d \u2014  Houseboy, Ferdinand Oyono\n\nDespite the difficult and troubling story, the young Toundi is played by Alfred Motlhapi with earnestness and almost a sense of whimsy (at least at the beginning of his tale). Such is the case of much of the highly-stylized play.\n\nThere are scenes, such as when Toundi and Father Gilbert, the aforementioned priest, take a motorcycle ride singing \u00c9dith Piaf\u2019s \u201cJe ne regrette rien,\u201d where the staging is simply the two actors on chairs, swaying side-to-side as if they\u2019re going around sharp bends.\n\nAfter the priest\u2019s death (by motorcycle, spoiling one of the show\u2019s purest moments), Toundi is then brought into the home of a colonial commandant and his wife.\n\nOne of the most sincere (and funniest) moments of the show occurs during the conversation about Toundi being hired by the commandant. When asked if he is a thief, Toundi responds no, stating that he is Christian and doesn\u2019t want to go to hell. He wonders aloud if hell is nearby.\n\nPlayed by Sue Pam-Grant, the commandant\u2019s wife, simply referred to by Toundi as \u201cMadame\u201d throughout the show, is one of the most stylized characters of all. At all times, she holds a long cigarette between her fingers, and her bright red lipstick stands out against her all-white costume. It\u2019s made very clear to the audience from the beginning that she is beautiful, smart, kind and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 powerful.\n\nHer story and Toundi\u2019s are often intertwined, and her downfall later in the story reflects his.\n\nAlthough she initially treats Toundi kindly, the commandant becomes notably distant as he\u2019s away traveling. The beginning of the end arrives when Madame starts an affair with one of the most notorious, brutal characters in the show \u2014 the head of the local prison, known for beating the locals nearly to death.\n\nMadame turns on Toundi as she becomes dissatisfied with her life during the affair. Her charming conversation with Toundi about his goals to become wealthy and start a family turns into screaming at him.\n\nToundi, once the devout Catholic, loses his faith as well as his goals to become successful like Madame and her husband.\n\nJust as in his visual art, Kentridge is highly experienced in theatrical works, including everything from opera to staged readings. Nearly all of his performance work comes from the aforementioned Centre for the Less Good Idea.\n\nAn organization run by Kentridge and his team, the Centre is where many of his theatrical productions are developed. Although his theatrical works are thematically similar to his visual art, there is one key difference \u2014 every work produced through the Centre is collaborative.\n\nAt the talkback after the performance, Kentridge recalled when \u201cHOUSEBOY\u201d was in development in the Centre\u2019s last season before COVID-19, the original cast in South Africa was able to play with the story in such a way that some of their own elements still remained in the Los Angeles performance.\n\n\u201cWhen we started reading and playing with it, [William Harding, who plays the priest] speaks very fluent and easy French. And so he said, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s put some of it back into French,\u2019\u201d Kentridge recalled. \u201cWe managed to find Jean [an actor from the original South African cast who] is from the Cameroon and could bring in phrases of Ewondo, though it\u2019s not so familiar to him. But he knew a lot of old songs ... In the middle of a rehearsal, he suddenly said, \u2018Stop, stop,\u2019 and he\u2019d take out his phone and he\u2019d phone through to some uncle in the Cameroon and sing the song over the phone.\u201d\n\nThis pre-COVID season at the Centre attempted to reinterpret the act of performance.\n\n\u201cWe called the season \u2018what of text,\u2019 and the idea was to look at existing text to take what exists on the page in the way that it is read, and to think about an audience as the reader,\u201d said Bronwyn Lace, a colleague and collaborator of Kentridge\u2019s, at the talkback.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that this dynamic exists all over the world and it\u2019s not only particular to the colonial period, it\u2019s particular to our contemporary world, too. So this is, I think, what the novel allows for, and then the performed reading of the novel extends that.\u201d\n\nThe story is one of pain and sadness, all told through the lens of an intimate look at colonial life.\n\nMost significantly, from an artistic perspective, this show sees Kentridge turning text into live performance.\n\nAs he writes in the REDCAT program, \u201clet this be a provocation, let us see what emerges.\u201d```"}

After all, we are celebrating today\u2013I\u2019m sure graduation day has been marked on Yi-Ma\u2019s calendar for years. If only the calendar didn\u2019t stop in 2018. Yi-ma\u2019s wardrobe hid a rainbow behind closed wooden doors. Her blouse selection was a palette in disguise: it determined what hue today would hold. From baby blues to decadent crimsons, my grandmother communicated simply through color. She exuded love in her rich platters\u2013mosaics of fresh vegetables, seasoned fish, and the fluffiest white juk anyone could imagine. Her colors were not always so direct. Sometimes, she would nestle a smidge of blue in a disappointed frown. Red spewed from the top of her head whenever she was ready to scold someone. I am proud to say that I was never the cause of her crimson shift \u2013at least, not that I can remember.\n\nUnderneath this prismatic facade lies a sad, gray heap of regret. I sometimes wish she didn\u2019t have to rely solely on color to speak with me. If only I could speak the same language, then maybe the colors we shared wouldn\u2019t get so muddy. For years, I\u2019ve felt estranged from my own culture. Growing up in America, I never appreciated the value of learning our native tongue. I let Fuzhounese words slip through my mind until I could no longer understand what Yi-ma was saying. I guess I\u2019ve always relied on her vivid hues to tell a story. I\u2019ve relived her childhood through her theatrical hand gestures and journeyed through time with the colors of her voice, but I can hardly remember anything she has said.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say we didn\u2019t make the most of the world we shared. Everything around us became our blank canvas\u2013there was no color, no object, and no gesture that wasn\u2019t included in our palette of communication. One day, my mother brought an orchid home. An innocent lavender tipped the petals, which leaned hopefully towards the warm sunlight. It rested on a glass table that stood in between our kitchen and family room and served as a warm greeting for us in the early mornings when sunrays spilled into the morning room. Yi-Ma was particularly fond of the blossoming succulent, or maybe I just always imagined her surrounded by lilac. She loved anything purple and anything natural, as revealed by her daily floral shirts. The flower was her tiny blessing every morning before she started hacking away at the fish for the day\u2019s dish. It provided a common ground for us to express our admiration for its simple beauty without speaking.\n\nAround the same time she lost her sense of communication, the orchid began to wilt. Yi-Ma no longer changed into her blouses. Rather, a loose, black slip-on was the only thing keeping her warm. The emotive shades of her facial expressions subdued. Days started blurring into melancholy grays, and the worst part was that there was nothing to restore the color. As she turned into a shell of herself, I watched the rich hues of my culture begin to fade with her. She was the glue that tied our family to our history and grounded us in our roots. Slowly, her secret recipes went erased, stories of her childhood were never told, and our family\u2019s history became a distant recollection.\n\nThe birthday cards I wrote for her were stacked neatly in the drawers of her bedside table. They held words she didn\u2019t understand, but I made sure the hearts I drew were neon and bright enough to communicate my endless love... Even they started to lackluster. Dust collected on the crisp edges of paper. The room remained closed, and all that her wardrobe could do was age silently.\n\nI think I underestimated my grandmother\u2019s colorful spirit. I forgot that her rainbows could pour over the divide between life and death. She was the glue that tied our family to our history and grounded us in our roots. Slowly, her secret recipes went erased, stories of her childhood were never told, and our family\u2019s history became a distant recollection. The orchid had wilted away before she passed away. We never bothered to get a new one; its remnants rested sadly in our kitchen, but we always halfheartedly imagined it would blossom again.\n\nRight after the funeral, our home was desolate and unfamiliar. The last hints of color seeped away. The kitchen no longer smelled like warm rice and pungent fish sauce. Instead, cold air wafted through the empty space and erased the distant memories of our loud family gatherings. The scent of hot oatmeal she made for me every morning no longer filled my lungs when I woke up. Instead of the chaotic game shows she loved watching, I came down to a black TV screen. The in-law suite was shrouded in a foggy silence.\n\nHowever, something bright caught our attention. It probably wasn\u2019t that bright, but amidst a gray landscape, anything would stick out. Pure white petals were emerging from the dead orchid\u2019s stem. No one had watered or cared for the flower ever since we started losing Yi-ma, yet life was blooming. I could see hints of purple painting the young white buds. It was almost like Yi-ma was smiling at us.\n\nHer passing rekindled an appreciation for our culture. I smelled wafts of her recipe the day after Thanksgiving, when my oldest aunt made turkey juk out of the leftovers from the night before. I found myself wanting to know more about where I came from and how my grandparents created a life for themselves here by changing a black-and-white landscape into one where we could live colorfully. Maybe I am a bit late, but Yi-Ma\u2019s color palette never runs out of paint. I\u2019m starting to make art on my fresh, new canvas.\n\nMy robes were the perfect color: a rich red, the color of celebration and prosperity in our culture. Yi-Ma would reserve her bold fuschia and crimson dresses for special occasions, artfully paired with some red lipstick. I\u2019d like to think she\u2019d pull out one of her bright dresses to celebrate together. I visited her right before graduation. Of course, we brought along a bouquet of happy flowers to place next to her\u2013there was a mixture of purple and fuchsia, just as she\u2019d like. I made sure to update her on everything and simply thank her for being the best grandmother anyone could ever ask for.\n\nA week later, graduation day was perfectly clear\u2013it was the type of day that a kid could draw with crayons. Walking down the aisle, I saw my humongous family squished together in the first few rows of the pavilion. They were all wearing some brilliant shade\u2013even my uncle decided to bring out his pink shirt. My best friend\u2019s black summer dress was decorated with pink roses\u2013there is a reason why Yi-Ma loved her so much. Graduation was a memory painted on a canvas. If only I could frame this image and share it with Yi-Ma. After all, our silent exchanges were nothing short of art.\n\nWhen I go back home, there is one thing I am certain I will see. The orchid still rests happily on the glass table in our kitchen. I can\u2019t wait to see how much it has grown when I return.\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Kaitlyn Huamani January 10, 2023 at  8:33 pm PST\n\nPolitical heavy hitters and Hollywood stars gathered at the Roybal Film and Television Production Magnet School on Monday to discuss how they hope the unique pilot-program school will help to diversify the entertainment industry. Actors and producers George Clooney, Mindy Kaling and Don Cheadle, who all serve on Roybal\u2019s advisory board, joined Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho for a tour of the school. The group also took part in a roundtable discussion on how the school hopes to change the industry while uplifting underserved groups of young people, said principal Blanca Cruz.\n\n\u201cTalent is equally distributed across the country to all students,\u201d Carvalho said. \u201cOpportunity and equitable access to great educational opportunities in schools and programs is not guaranteed, and we cannot immediately guarantee it by ourselves. That guarantee comes through partnerships.\u201d\n\nThe Roybal School was established in September 2022 as a partnership between the LAUSD and Clooney, actor and filmmaker Grant Heslov and talent agent Bryan Lourd. The school is focused on building a pathway for historically underrepresented young people to find careers in the film and television industry, according to its website.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason we were doing this was we looked at our industry and said it doesn\u2019t reflect the society we live in,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAnd the fix is not just hiring people to try and fix it. The fix is starting at a young age, basically a trade school, to get these young people able to do these jobs.\u201d\n\nGeorge Clooney was all smiles Monday morning at the Roybal Film and Television Magnet School. (Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nClooney also said that by training students the way a trade school would, he hopes that they are college- and career-ready, which can shorten the timeline for the payoff of the program. He also highlighted the school\u2019s strong connections with major industry players like Disney, Fox, Amazon Prime Video and entertainment industry unions that will help with quick job placement for graduates.\n\nDuring the tour, Clooney, Kaling and Cheadle spoke with teachers and students and watched some of the projects and lessons they were working on. Students shared the unorthodox way their lessons are taught \u2014 for example, in history class, students research for documentaries with the help of the History Channel. Students also showed how they learn geometry through set design and construction.\n\nCardona and Emhoff both said they felt that the real-world application of the school\u2019s curriculum is beneficial and that the students are \u201clucky\u201d to learn from the best in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe public-private partnership is needed if we\u2019re going to raise the bar on education in this country. And man, I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019m seeing here today,\u201d Cardona said. \u201cIt\u2019s really inspirational to me, and when I go back to D.C., this is the model that I\u2019m going to think about when I say we need to raise the bar across the country.\u201d\n\nLike Cardona, Emhoff said Roybal could be the model for the future of public education that is tied to creating \u201cgreat paying union jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love this program,\u201d Emhoff said. \u201cThe secretary and I were talking about if we can replicate this program here at Roybal, which is training the below the line crew to go out there into the industry, we can do this with nurses, we can do this with tech, we can do this with so many different things all across the country. So not only are you helping the production community, but you\u2019re going to really set the stage for helping this entire country.\u201d\n\nRoybal screenwriting and video production teacher John Paul Green said that he felt \u201cstarstruck\u201d by the notable names stopping by the school on Monday, but was happy to have eyes on the school\u2019s unique program and the future opportunities they hope to create for their students.\n\nMindy Kaling, a Roybal advisory board member, and Bryan Lourd, a founding partner, have a conversation before the roundtable discussion.

One student noticed that Clooney and Cheadle were wearing similar outfits, and Clooney said \u201cDon, did you get my memo about the black turtleneck and jeans?\u201d which prompted giggles from the students.\n\nOnce the antics were over, the students were eager to share their work and their enthusiasm for Roybal.\n\n\u201cEver since I was a child, I have very much enjoyed creating stories and producing stories, so being here feels like a very nice opportunity where I get to not only just be with my friends and have fun with them, but I have fun with the material and the stuff that we practice every day,\u201d said Karisma Quintero, an eleventh grader at Roybal. \u201cI love this school with my whole heart.\u201d\n```"}

They mounted a comeback to make for an intense ending but eventually fell short 59-56. On Sunday, it was the Bruins who trailed by 12 entering the fourth quarter. However, the home team was able to complete its come-from-behind effort this time around, as UCLA used a big fourth quarter to win an intense rivalry game 61-60.\n\n\u201cIt was a really good college basketball game,\u201d USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said alongside her players postgame, all of whom were visibly upset after a gut-wrenching loss. \u201cI\u2019m devastated for our players, and they did pretty much everything we asked them to do in terms of competing.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s safe to say that officiating was the story of the game, as would be expected in a game that featured 51 total fouls and 50 free throws. The raucous crowd at Pauley Pavilion in Westwood was frequently dissatisfied by the constant whistles, but the Bruins benefited by going 10-for-12 on free throws in the final quarter as part of their big comeback.\n\nNeither team had much going on offense in the first quarter; USC shot just 23% from the field. However, the Trojans were still able to keep it close by getting to the free-throw line, where they went 10-for-11 in the opening period. Spoiler alert, though \u2014 fouls would come back to bite USC.\n\n\u201cThe way that game was officiated, obviously they were making a lot of calls, and it hit us at the wrong time,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI felt like we did a good job of being aggressive there, and it just hit us the other way at the wrong time, especially in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nAnother major key for USC was again to limit the offensive presence of UCLA senior guard Charisma Osborne, who leads the Bruins with 18 points per game. Osborne struggled in these teams\u2019 first matchup, shooting just 6-for-24 from the field and 1-for-9 from three. The Trojans continued to cause her issues the second time around, as Osborne started 1-for-9. In fact, USC limited the Bruins\u2019 whole starting lineup, which combined for just seven points in the first half.\n\nUSC junior guard Kayla Williams was a vital cog in the Trojans\u2019 success in both of those aforementioned keys. She was a primary defender that locked up Osborne, showing why she was named to the Big West All-Defensive Team last season while at UC Irvine. She also got to the line six times in the first half and had 10 points to lead USC to a 34-30 advantage at the break.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always about defense \u2014 defensive intensity affects the offensive end,\u201d Williams said about her all-purpose approach to the game. \u201cI try to be great at that as much as possible, and when that happens, shots start to open up.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of performing well on both ends, there aren\u2019t many two-way players in the nation better than USC sophomore forward Rayah Marshall. With graduate forward Kadi Sissoko missing her second straight game due to injury, Marshall had to carry the load in the frontcourt. She did just that, with no sequence showing that more than the following in the third quarter: Marshall gathered a rebound off of a block, dribbled a couple times up the floor and found redshirt freshman guard Taylor Bigby for a wide-open three. Bigby, who was starting in place of Sissoko, drained the deep ball to give USC a 43-32 lead. The next time down the floor, Marshall converted an and-one driving down the lane, putting the whole Trojan bench on their feet amid a 12-4 USC run coming out of the half.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Marshall and Williams, though; the entire USC defense was suffocating, especially in the third quarter. UCLA shot just 3-for-20 from the field in that frame and missed all five threes it took, while also turning the ball over five times. In fact, the Bruins were 8-for-20 on layups at one point in the game. Despite picking up her fourth foul late in the third period, Marshall was perhaps most responsible for that inefficiency. Ranking No. 3 in the nation with over three blocks per game, the reigning Pac-12 Player of the Week had three more Sunday, her 36th consecutive game with a rejection.\n\nHowever, UCLA came out hot to start the fourth, perhaps thanks to five quick foul calls on USC in just 100 seconds to start the quarter. Ten straight Bruin points cut the Trojans\u2019 lead to two, which made the lively Pauley Pavilion crowd a serious factor in an already intense rivalry game. With Osborne continuing to struggle (she finished just 2-for-16 from the field), freshman guard Londynn Jones had to carry the Bruins\u2019 offense off the bench, setting a career-high with 22 points.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a player of that caliber coming off the bench, you can\u2019t have any let up,\u201d Gottlieb said regarding Jones. \u201cThat was just on us, and we have to be better with that.\u201d\n\nHer pair of made free throws gave UCLA a 57-55 lead with two minutes remaining, as the crowd volume continued to climb. All of a sudden, the game felt eerily similar to the first matchup last month, with the home team charging back after a double-digit deficit. Free throws were shot on the next four total possessions, with Marshall fouling out during that span and UCLA maintaining a two-point lead. After a UCLA stop, Jones went to the line yet again, but missed one of two to give USC a chance to tie down three with 22 seconds left. Graduate guard Destiny Littleton had to force up a shot from the wing but missed long, and the Trojans didn\u2019t have enough time for another chance from behind the arc.\n\nUSC, now 11-4 overall and just 1-3 in conference play, will have the chance to bounce back from the tough loss when the Trojans welcome Cal to Galen Center on Friday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m.\n```"}

After a demoralizing first half that ended with a score of 44-26 in favor of UCLA, USC combatted its nerves with consistency and grit in the second. As the game wound down to the final minutes, Pauley Pavilion got louder and the game got tighter.\n\nUSC struggled on the offensive side of the ball early in the game. Freshman guard Tre White had seven points, the team\u2019s best at the half, and the team only had one offensive rebound. The Bruins finished the half with an 18-point lead, showing not only their offensive dominance but their ability to play both sides of the ball.\n\n\u201cIt was embarrassing in the first half, it embarrassed me as a head coach. You know, to come out in a rivalry game, be down 18 at halftime and the effort that we gave was embarrassing for all of us,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cI said at halftime, we didn\u2019t yell and scream, but they made their minds up. They want to go compete and they did.\u201d\n\nComing off the bench, sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters led the team with 16 points, four rebounds and two assists.\n\n\u201cWe had to match their energy. We came out slow, lethargic in the first half,\u201d Dixon-Waters said. \u201cSo we had to match their energy and intensity and offense and defense and just ball movement and get open shots.\u201d\n\nThe second half appeared to coax out a different side of the Trojans and the Bruins. USC chipped away at the 18-point deficit to ultimately take a two-point lead with a minute left in the game. The Trojans\u2019 first lead since the game was 2-0 was quickly taken away as UCLA junior guard Jaylen Clark hit a three off an offensive rebound to take the lead by one.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s frustrating when veteran guys are inconsistent, but we\u2019re still a team that\u2019s developing and we\u2019re improving now,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe\u2019ve improved a lot since the beginning of the season. I think you saw that tonight, especially in the second half.\u201d\n\nOn the following possession, Dixon-Waters headed down the court looking to take the lead back from the Bruins, senior guard Boogie Ellis was called for an offensive foul right after setting an illegal screen.\n\n\u201cThe play before that was frustrating because we had the ball in Reese\u2019s hands who was playing well and Boogie got an offensive foul on that ball screen slip,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThe last thing I said to him at the timeout was \u2018don\u2019t get an offensive foul on a slip.\u2019 And, unfortunately, he did.\u201d\n\nUCLA made one of the two free throws, giving the Bruins a lead of 60-58. The Trojans put the ball in Ellis\u2019 hands, who went up for a last second jump shot that bounced off the rim.\n\nAlthough the ranked rivalry win could have put USC on the map after having just one ranked win over No. 19 Auburn, Dixon-Waters had a positive outlook on the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just a younger team than we were last year trying to figure everything out,\u201d Dixon-Waters said. \u201cBut we\u2019re definitely getting there and I\u2019m happy with the progress we made this season, from Florida Gulf Coast to now.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will rest for the next week before they have another Pac-12 match against Colorado on Jan. 12. This loss brings the Trojans to 11-5 overall and 3-2 in conference play. The Trojans hope to avenge the loss to UCLA at Galen Center on Jan. 26.\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Terence Holton January 04, 2023 at 9:38 pm PST\n\nAfter an 11-1 regular season, USC football\u2019s postseason play can only be described as forgettable. Though sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams capped off his magical year with a Heisman Trophy, on the field the Trojans fell just short of a College Football Playoff appearance and a Cotton Bowl win. What was the largest shortcoming for the Trojans, though? The defense.\n\nThere were some upsides for the defense as the Trojans forced 29 turnovers this season \u2014 tied for fifth in the country. Those can be credited to defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s schemes that proved to be fantastic in forcing turnovers. However, when it came to the most basic of defensive attributes \u2014 stopping the football \u2014 Grinch\u2019s strategies failed. The Trojan defense was 80th in total rush defense and 112th in passing yards allowed. To make matters worse, USC also gave up a whopping 6.5 yards per play.\n\nAgainst Tulane, USC gave up 305 total rushing yards and let junior running back Tyjae Spears go for 205 of those yards and four \u2014 count \u2018em, four \u2014 touchdowns. The Green Wave averaged 10.4 yards per play. To put that in perspective, Colorado, arguably the worst defense in college football, allowed 7.2 yards per play on the season. Though Tulane is a formidable opponent, the Trojans\u2019 defense shouldn\u2019t have collapsed the way it did.\n\nLet\u2019s give Grinch some vindication \u2014 the offense didn\u2019t help the team out much either in the closing minutes. After electing to run the ball on the one-yard line, leading to a safety that put the USC defense in a difficult position. However, it is a common theme that this defense undercuts the offense. Tulane had the ball for 19 less minutes than USC did. Throughout the game, the Trojan offense marched down the field methodically. Then, the defense stepped on the field, and it felt like Tulane was going to score every single play.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched any USC football games this season, you can probably guess what the defense\u2019s biggest flaw was \u2014 tackling. Missing tackles is no new problem for the Trojan defense. Against Utah in the Pac-12 championship, USC missed 24 tackles en route to a 23-point loss. Another issue was the gaping holes in the secondary. The two biggest plays from the Green Wave offense were simple five-yard slants across the middle of the field. The schemes Grinch draws up generally do not cover the middle of the field. Back in November when Cal nearly beat the Trojans, the Golden Bears offense found success with straight slants, allowing them to change it up and throw it deep.\n\nThese two problems of big holes in the secondary and the inability to tackle have been consistent themes this entire season for the Trojan defense. So what has to change? Obviously Grinch cannot be blamed for everything. However, this USC team was eerily similar to past Lincoln Riley and Alex Grinch-led Oklahoma teams that had incredible high-scoring offenses, but also defenses that were easily bested and often cost the Sooners big games.\n\nI\u2019d like to say that the Trojans can just keep building the defense through the transfer portal, and \u2014 to Grinch\u2019s credit \u2014 they have grabbed some good players from the portal. At a certain point though, it will come down to a coach\u2019s ability to call good formations and teach proper tackling techniques. I\u2019m just not sure USC can trust Grinch especially after his past years at Oklahoma.\n\nIn particular, there is one solution to this poor defense that I would suggest the Trojans explore: Wisconsin defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard. The Badgers had a strong defense this season, allowing offenses allowing only 303 yards and 20 points per game. With new head coach Luke Fickell joining the Badgers, Leonhard may look to other opportunities. While unlikely, it\u2019s possible Leonhard would like to bring his stout defensive mindset to sunny Los Angeles to be on the staff of one of the best coaches in college football.\n\nIt is my belief that Riley wants to give Grinch a chance to build his own defense before he calls it quits on his defensive coordinator of four years. That makes it highly implausible Grinch and USC part ways after this season, but many Trojan fans, including myself, are ready for a change, and I will be a strong supporter of the #LeonhardtoSC movement.\n```"}

Disappointment that will linger for ages. Complete and utter disarray on the gridiron. USC\u2019s performance in the last four minutes of the Cotton Bowl fit the bill as one of the worst losses in the school\u2019s storied history \u2014 a seemingly impossible series of unfortunate events which, by some calamity, took place.\n\nIn Arlington, Texas, the Trojans were crushed and drowned by the Green Wave, losing in unfathomable fashion 46-45 to Tulane in the Cotton Bowl Classic. It was the 1,694th time an FBS team led by 15 points or more in the final five minutes over the last five seasons \u2014 Tulane became just the second team to overcome that deficit.\n\nThe defeat leaves an aura of disappointment surrounding the season as a whole. \u201cIt\u2019s as tough of a loss as I can remember in my career,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said.\n\nEverything unraveled. The Trojans held a 15-point lead with 4:30 to play. They had just burned some clock, two Tulane timeouts and kicked a field goal. It looked to be a signed and sealed victory.\n\nThen, Tulane scored quickly. Then, sophomore receiver Mario Williams scuffed the kickoff return, leaving USC at its own 1-yard line. Then, Tulane stuffed a run for a safety.\n\n\u201cThe safety is sitting heavy in my gut right now,\u201d redshirt senior offensive lineman Justin Dedich said. \u201cOur unit didn\u2019t get it done when we needed it most.\u201d\n\nBut USC still led 45-39, and with just one timeout remaining, a Tulane touchdown drive was a pipe dream. And yet, it happened.\n\nThe touchdown came on a 6-yard pass that was initially ruled incomplete. As fans looked to the video boards, you could see the collective statement on their lips: \u201cHe caught it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe line to finish and win these big games like we had at the end is so thin, it\u2019s a fine line,\u201d Riley said.\n\nIt was the culmination of a year\u2019s worth of underwhelming defense and special teams play from the Trojans. \u201cIn year one, obviously you wanna accomplish everything, but you only have so much time,\u201d senior linebacker Shane Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get everything done at first.\u201d\n\nThis season\u2019s broken record storyline once again came to fruition: could the USC defense get enough stops to help out the offense? No. Unequivocally no.\n\nThe offense did about as much as it could: 45 points, 594 total yards, 11-of-15 on third downs. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams had 472 all-purpose yards with 5 touchdowns, a new Cotton Bowl record. Williams connected with nine different receivers over the course of the game, all of which had at least two receptions.\n\nBut it was junior receiver Brenden Rice who stepped up in the absence of junior receiver Jordan Addison. The Colorado transfer had 174 receiving yards on six receptions with two touchdowns. Rice made the sideline his best friend, pulling in multiple miraculous grabs in traffic to set up scores or score himself.\n\n\u201cOur job on offense is to score, that\u2019s all we can control,\u201d Williams said.\n\nBut the defense, worn down and defunct in tackling, couldn\u2019t hold up its end of the deal. USC conceded 10.4 yards per play, an absurd number that might even be outdone by the fact that Tulane scored 46 points with just 52 offensive plays.\n\nTulane\u2019s notorious spread triple-option offense saw it running the ball on nearly every play. And it worked. Junior running back Tyjae Spears commanded his will, rushing for 205 yards with four touchdowns on the day.\n\n\u201cTheir ability to run the football ... 300-plus yards rushing, that\u2019s the entire game right there,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tackle good players and a good running back, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d\n\nThe game\u2019s scoring eventually went warp-speed, but USC\u2019s offensive intentions were clear from the start \u2014 slow and steady wins the race. It was a jarringly new approach for a team that had won so many of its games via shootout.\n\nThe first possession of the game was a long haul that took 9:02 off the clock before Tulane even touched the ball. After a relatively tame first quarter, USC\u2019s efforts to slow play down were thwarted in a second quarter that saw 35 combined points scored.\n\nIt was a game of streaks in the first half, with three 14-0 unanswered runs between the two teams. The missed-tackle mess which doomed the USC defense against Utah did just the same against Tulane.\n\nA whiff in the open field allowed the Green Wave to reach the goal line and subsequently score in the second quarter. On Tulane\u2019s next drive, junior receiver Jha\u2019Quan Jackson took a middle-of-the-field catch to the outside, leaving at least three USC defenders in the dust for an 87-yard touchdown to tie it.\n\nIt tied the longest touchdown pass in Cotton Bowl history.\n\nIt was a record breaking loss in many facets, a loss that brings the momentum of the USC program to a screeching halt, at least temporarily. Heading into the month of December, that momentum was undeniable. Fresh off back-to-back ranked rivalry wins, the Trojans were a win away from the College Football Playoff and a chance to play for the national title.\n\nMuch, if not all, of that energy is washed away. \u201cThere\u2019s still so much more to go to be in that position where you close out a conference championship game,\u201d Riley said.\n\nThe blowout Pac-12 Championship loss to Utah proved only the beginning of USC\u2019s slide. Now, the offseason provides a chance to revamp.\n\nDefensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s job status will be a point of discussion in the offseason. After a seven-win improvement from 2021 to 2022, USC\u2019s is undeniably moving up in the power structure of college football.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we\u2019re here, and we\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe know what we need to get better at as a program.\u201d\n\nEven still, the loss won\u2019t be easy to shake off in any way. \u201cWe\u2019ll spend a lot of time on it, get some clarity, let this one soak in,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll go back to work.\u201d\n```"}

The Cougars separated themselves by out-shooting the Trojans from behind the arc. WSU shot 14-for-29 (48.3%), while USC shot 3-for-18 (16.7%).\n\n\u201cThey did a great job driving and kicking to the 3-point shooters. They made some tough shots, and they got their confidence, it seemed like,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cThey shot a very high percentage, especially in the first half.\u201d\n\nShooting from 3-point range has been a strength for the Cougars all season long. Going into today\u2019s game, WSU led the Pac-12 with 114 made 3-point shots. USC, despite running a four-guard lineup with strong 3-point shooting potential for most of the season, went into the game tied for ninth in the conference.\n\nFresh off a 27-point performance against Washington, senior guard Boogie Ellis struggled in the first half, scoring just four points on 2-of-6 shooting. \u201cHe got off to a slow start,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe missed his first four threes. He\u2019d been shooting the ball so well [previously].\u201d\n\nSophomore guard Kobe Johnson stepped up in the first half, scoring eight points on 3-of-4 shooting. He finished the game with 13 points on 3-of-5 shooting and went 6-for-7 from the free-throw line. He also grabbed seven rebounds and added three assists and one steal.\n\nBut the Cougars\u2019 pristine shooting gave them a 41-30 lead heading into halftime. \u201cIt took a while for our guys to realize that we were behind,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey played hard in the second half.\u201d\n\nFifth-year senior guard Drew Peterson took the reins in the second half, racking up 10 points. He finished the game with 16 points on 7-of-16 shooting and eight rebounds, leading his team in both statistical categories. However, Enfield expects more out of both him and Ellis.\n\n\u201cI thought [Drew and Boogie] weren\u2019t as aggressive as they have been. Drew held the ball too much in the first half, especially on close-outs against guys he could get by,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the flow of our offense, and those two guys, it starts with them.\u201d\n\nSophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters showed up in the second half, scoring seven points after a scoreless first half. \u201cWe have high hopes for Reese,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s a terrific young man, hard worker and we need him to be productive and help us. He\u2019s developing as a player, and so we have full confidence in him.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Trojans weren\u2019t able to gain the momentum they needed, largely due to the fact that Ellis, USC\u2019s leading scorer this season, could not find a rhythm until the end of the game. Eight of his 12 points came in the final minutes of the game, but he fouled out just as he started to heat up late \u2014 when the Trojans needed him and his experience most.\n\nHaving been in foul trouble since the end of the first half, Ellis only played 29 minutes. For most of the game, USC played sloppy and failed to capitalize on opportunities. The Trojans had 11 turnovers and failed to facilitate proper ball movement, resulting in only nine assists compared to Washington State\u2019s 16.\n\nAlthough USC doubled Washington State\u2019s offensive rebound total (18 to 9), both teams had the same number of second chance points (16). \u201cWe have to do a better job of putting the ball on the floor, getting a lane, kicking it out and playing as a team,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nAlthough the Trojans improved offensively and defensively in the second half, they failed to reduce the deficit by much and simply traded off baskets with the Cougars. The loss snaps the Trojans\u2019 seven-game win streak, along with their three-game win streak in Pac-12 play. USC fell to 11-4 overall and 3-1 in conference.\n\nUSC will play its third consecutive road game as the Trojans face No. 11 UCLA at Pauley Pavilion on Thursday.\n```"}

Ellis finished with 27 points on 10-of-19 shooting and added seven boards in the fast-paced affair. \u201cHe made some tough shots, he got to the rim and made a couple of long threes,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said of Ellis. \u201cWe called a couple of plays for him, and he executed.\u201d\n\nThe first half began with two rapidly moving offenses exchanging baskets. Redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan was used heavily inside during transition and finished the game with 11 points on 5-of-8 shooting to go along with five rebounds and five blocks. Going into the game, Morgan led the Pac-12 with 37 rebounds this season. \u201cHe just puts his hands up, he talls up, he blocks it, he\u2019s got great timing,\u201d Enfield said of Morgan. \u201cSo I know the dunks were awesome, and he played really well offensively, but the five blocks and the challenging of another nine or 10 shots were so important for our team, especially when we play four guards like we did ... the whole game\u201d\n\nFifth-year senior guard Drew Peterson and freshman guard Tre White also scored double-digit points \u2014 with Peterson racking up 17 on 5-of-13 shooting and White posting 12 points and going 3-of-4. Both were effective from the free throw line, with Peterson nailing seven of eight free throws and White making six of seven. White\u2019s presence was also felt via his physicality as he led the Trojans with five offensive rebounds. As a team, USC grabbed 18 boards on offense, leading to 16 second-chance points. \u201cWhen they play zone, they don\u2019t really box out because they\u2019re not guarding a particular man,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cSo we worked on, the last couple days, running against their zone defense, trying to tip the ball if we couldn\u2019t rebound it.\u201d\n\nUSC maintained a slight lead most of the game, and the Huskies trailed by two with one minute to go in the first half. A 5-0 run to end the half put USC up 41-34 going into halftime and gave the Trojans the momentum they hoped for. The second half closely resembled the first with both offenses going back-and-forth. The Huskies didn\u2019t allow the Trojans to pull away and eventually Washington went on a 10-0 run, taking a three-point lead with 10 minutes left. Ellis and Peterson came alive and led the Trojan offense in the second half. They combined for 29 of USC\u2019s 39 second-half points and helped the Trojans regain the lead. Right after Washington\u2019s 10-0 run, USC retaliated with an 8-0 run and never looked back. The Trojans\u2019 lead never dropped below five points the rest of the game. \u201cWe just told them that they had to play harder and smarter, and they came out and really did a great job the last seven, eight, nine minutes of the game,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nEven in such a fast-paced game, the Trojans displayed a quality defensive effort. Washington shot 22-for-68 (32.4%) from the field, including 9-for-27 (33.3%) from 3-point range. USC blocked 10 shots and stole the ball eight times. USC outshot Washington, as the Trojans made 28 of 61 (45.9%) attempts from the field and five of 14 (35.7%) from deep. \u201cThe open part of their zone is in the middle and on the baseline ... so we attacked the rim and got to the foul line a number of times too,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI thought we were aggressive and shot-faked and did our job.\u201d\n\nThe win marks the seventh straight Trojan victory. USC is now 3-0 in Pac-12 play, marking the third time in the 21st century the Trojans have accomplished such a feat. \u201cOur team has improved in the last month significantly on both sides of the ball. I\u2019m happy where we are as far as our improvement,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe have to get a few other guys on the bench to give us some more bench minutes, but they\u2019ve improved as well.\u201d USC will stay in the Evergreen State to battle Washington State on New Year\u2019s Day at noon on Pac-12 Network.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nDecember 30, 2022 at 3:43 pm PST\n\nDec. 21, the beginning of the Early Signing Period for high school prospects, was a relatively quiet day for USC. Early Signing Day, or ESD, has become infamous in recent years for prospects flipping their verbal commitments and signing with another school. That did not happen to USC this year. But USC was also not able to join in on the flipping mania. Despite the silence, USC still comes out of the day with a lot of positives.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the beginning of the Early Signing Period and a look ahead to the rest of the 2023 recruiting class.\n\n1. USC kept their commitments\nOn Early Signing Day, USC had 20 verbal commitments. In this day and age, verbal commitments mean almost nothing, but USC was able to buck the trend as 19 of their 20 commitments signed to play for the Trojans. These 20 players give USC the No. 15 recruiting class in the country up to this point. Three of the 19 signees were 5-star recruits, which is the highest number since signing four 5-stars in the class of 2018.\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley and the rest of the recruiting staff were able to quell the rumors that quarterback Malachi Nelson and wide receiver Zachariah Branch would change their commitments from USC to Texas A&M after both visiting last summer. The only verbal commit USC has not yet signed is Ja\u2019Kobi Lane, a 4-star wide receiver from Arizona. Lane has been committed to USC since Aug. 26, but ASU has been making a push for the wideout since Kenny Dillingham, the former offensive coordinator for Oregon, became the Sun Devils\u2019 head coach. Lane has not decommitted from USC, but pen has not yet hit the paper to make Lane to USC official.\n\n2. USC did not gain any commitments on ESD\nAnother reason for the quiet ESD was that the Trojans were not able to poach any prospects from other schools or secure a signature from any uncommitted high school players. This stagnation was in direct contrast to other PAC-12 foes. The biggest loss came to the hands of Oregon, who was able to sign 5-star edge defender Matayo Uiagalelei. Uiagelelei was also considering USC and Ohio State, but ultimately chose the Ducks, despite playing high school football at Southern California\u2019s own St. John Bosco.\n\nWhat makes matters worse is that Oregon, a recruiting rival for USC, was able to secure four signings on ESD alone to vault themselves past USC in the recruiting rankings. USC must hope this is not a sign of things to come, both in terms of attracting transfer talent and locking down elite local talent. Even when USC moves to the BIG 10 in 2024, the Ducks and the Trojans will still compete to bring west coast football back to prominence.\n\n3. USC still has a chance to make some noise\nDespite not making much noise in the Early Signing Period, USC is still in contention for multiple high-level prospects before National Signing Day on Feb 1., 2023. USC still has holes to fill at tight end and defensive back in their high school class. The Trojans are still an option for tight ends 5-star Duce Robinson and 4-star Walker Lyons and cornerbacks 4-star Rodrick Pleasant and 3-star Tyler Scott.\n\nAlthough USC currently sits at No. 15 in the recruiting rankings, if the Trojans are able to sign even two or three of these prospects, they might vault into the top ten of the rankings. Scott is a special case, as he has already signed with a school, but decided to not announce who he signed with until early January. Robinson, Lyons and Pleasant, however, have not yet made a decision, at least publicly. Robinson hails from Arizona and Lyons and Pleasant hail from California, making it even more important that USC locks them down.\n\nOnly time will tell if Riley and Zach Hanson, USC\u2019s tight end\u2019s coach, can seal the deal with two tight ends. Donte Williams, the cornerbacks coach for USC, will hope he can close on Pleasant, as USC only has only two defensive back signees in the high school class.\n\n4. The Trojans leave a lot to be desired on defensive recruiting\nUSC signed nine 4 or 5-stars on ESD. Only two of those nine were defensive players in linebacker Tackett Curtis and edge rusher Braylan Shelby. While Curtis and Shelby are highly ranked, this high school recruiting class is significantly weighted toward the offense. This was likely always going to be the case as Lincoln Riley is widely considered to have one of the greatest offensive minds in college football.\n\nThe Trojan defense, however, significantly weighed down the offense this past season on several occasions. The USC staff showed they could recruit offensive players at a high level, but could not consistently recruit defensive players, as the loss of Uiagalelei showed. Overall, eight of the 19 players USC signed on ESD were defensive players. Rankings do not always mean everything and there is plenty of potential for the USC defensive staff to develop these players, but this ESD showed USC might not be ready to recruit on the national level for defensive prospects.\n\n5. USC has started to make use of the transfer portal again\nThe college football transfer portal will now forever be intertwined with ESD as schools look to fill holes on their roster both from high school prospects, but also players from other college programs who are looking to find their next homes. USC has signed seven players from the transfer portal up to this point in the process. Despite only signing two 4-star defensive players from high school, USC has already matched that number with two 4-star defensive players from the transfer portal.\n\nThe Trojans also signed two 3-star defensive players from the transfer portal who are on the brink of 4-star status. The Trojans ended up with the No. 1 transfer portal class last offseason and hope to repeat that success again this year. Beyond the important offensive additions like Heisman-winning quarterback Caleb Williams, USC brought in instrumental defensive players. Mekhi Blackmon, Shane Lee, Bryson Shaw, Eric Gentry and Solomon Byrd were all defensive additions from the transfer portal who made significant impacts on USC\u2019s defense this past year.\n\nThe portal has not been quite as favorable for the Trojans this year as it was last year. They have already lost out on defensive linemen Braden Fiske and Trace Ford to other schools. However, defensive coordinator Alex Grinch still has a lot of time to make some additions as many more players will enter the transfer portal once bowl season is over.\n\nOverall, results from the first couple days of the early signing period were a mixed bag.

You\u2019re not the only one.\n\nDisplays of fireworks are a hallmark of New Year's Eve festivities. (Photo courtesy of Mike Halsall)\n\nBy Yvonne Abedi\nDecember 30, 2022 at 11:23 am PST\n\nWhen I think about New Year\u2019s Eve, I think about New York, the ball drop, Ryan Seacrest and of course New Year\u2019s resolutions. For me, the day is always filled with a lot of anticipation for the new year and I always find myself wondering how I\u2019m going to change and be even better than last year. As the day progresses, a list of resolutions begins to run through my head: work out more, take more time for yourself, eat healthier. But when nightfall comes, all of those thoughts come to a halt.\n\nAlthough my family and I don\u2019t usually do too much during the day, we always make sure to watch all of the New Year\u2019s Eve specials, specifically Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve. After eating the last of the Christmas leftovers, we move over to the couch and begin a long night of waiting for the ball to drop. Cozied under mounds of blankets, we spend the night chit chatting about the different specials, laughing at the celebrities and recalling things they\u2019ve done throughout the year.\n\nAs I grew older, staying up for the whole night became a huge struggle. No matter how hard I try, the night always involves me falling asleep before 12 a.m. The last year I remember forcing myself to stay up until after midnight was when One Direction performed and announced their hiatus in 2015, and look where that got us. But my mom always wakes me up to say a happy new year and gives me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Then, I pull together the last ounce of energy I have to trod upstairs and collapse onto my bed.\n\nAs the house fills with the aroma of the blueberry muffins my mom always makes on New Year\u2019s Day, I regain consciousness, and the thoughts of where this new year could take me fill my head again. With the New Year comes New Year\u2019s resolutions, meaning millions of people around the world are coming up with ways to better themselves and become the best version of themselves in the New Year.\n\nBettering yourself and seeking to be the best version of yourself always sounds like a great idea, but with the nature around New Year\u2019s and the pressure to fulfill your resolutions, starting the New Year can be very overwhelming. Like many people, losing weight has been one of my New Year\u2019s resolutions for years and one of the reasons it took me so long to begin seeing results from this goal is that I lacked patience. I tried everything from horrible diets to excessive exercise and none of these beared long-term results because I used extreme measures to try and get results as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen I did see results they never lasted because I didn\u2019t have self-control or the basic knowledge of how to lose weight safely and realistically. I had to do some research to achieve my resolution in a safe and healthy way. The results took time and there were a lot of failures and setbacks within my journey because I\u2019m human and that is what comes with being human \u2013 we make mistakes.\n\nWhen New Year\u2019s comes and the clock strikes 12, we don\u2019t turn into a completely different person; we don\u2019t live in a fairytale. Our lives aren\u2019t supposed to be picture-perfect. We can\u2019t magically turn into this new person just because a new calendar year has started. This thought process around the New Year is the reason why so many people don\u2019t fulfill the goals they have created for themselves. They set unrealistic and unattainable goals within such a short time frame, which typically only ensures failure.\n\nTime and patience are key when trying to do anything well. These are commonly two things people fail to anticipate when going on their journey to better themselves. Instant gratification is something that everyone grapples with, but with social media, the desire for instant gratification has increased at an exponential rate. On social media, we see only the good of people\u2019s lives. We don\u2019t see the process of their journeys and all the struggles and pain that came with it, we only see the results. So with the lack of transparency and rawness that\u2019s fed to us on a daily basis, we feel as though we should get results instantly, as well.\n\nBut like anything in life, it\u2019s not that easy, anything you want takes work and patience. For the start of 2023, instead of creating unrealistic goals to become a new person, we should be taking life day by day, striving to be better but also giving ourselves grace and room to make mistakes to create healthy patterns within our lives. You can\u2019t just wake up and change your mindset and change who you are as a person. Everything takes gradual effort, it should never be new year, new me it should be new year, same me, just a little better.\n```"}

(Photo by Viktoria Capek)\n\nBy Viktoria Capek\nDecember 21, 2022 at 12:51 pm PST\n\nAlmost every Thursday for the past three months, Linna Wang toured a different cultural center, art museum or artist studio in Los Angeles. But the tours lost their spark after the one place Wang was most eager to see turned out to be her biggest letdown: the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena. Her disappointment had nothing to do with the stories told at the museum, moreso with the people in charge \u2014 non-Asian leadership where she thinks Asian representation should be.\n\nWang is a first year Roski School of Art and Design graduate student at USC, pursuing a dual degree in studio art and art history. The program has been an adjustment following her forced transfer from the San Francisco Art Institute after its closure earlier this year, but she enjoyed her Thursday curatorial studies class. The 24-year-old from Shanghai visited the Pacific Asia Museum, a USC-operated space, with her class in September. The historic site at 46 N. Los Robles houses one of Southern California\u2019s only collections of Asian and Pacific Island art.\n\nIt was once named after the Native American and Asian cultural art collector Grace Nicholson, who hired a Pasadena architectural firm to model the building after traditional Chinese construction. In 1929, the building and courtyard were opened to the public as a center for art galleries and events before Nicholson gifted the building to the City of Pasadena in 1943. From 1954 to 1970, it operated as the Pasadena Art Museum. Its next owners, the Pacificulture Foundation, redesignated the structure as the Pacific Asia Museum in 1987. In November of 2013, the museum partnered with USC to expand its educational programs related to Asian art, history and culture. Today, the Pacific Asia Museum operates as one of two university museums, alongside the Fisher Museum of Art.\n\nWang\u2019s experience at the museum was spoiled once a tour of the gallery\u2019s permanent exhibit began. She had concerns about displays from the collection of 17,000 items assembled by the museum\u2019s former and current operators. In the museum\u2019s Chinese gallery, Wang was troubled by a wooden shrine, a Feng shui diagram and a set of jadeite earrings and a matching bracelet. Using a handwritten chart in her notebook, Wang explained to me the differences between grade A, B and C jade, which she learned about in school growing up in Eastern China, along with lessons about the Qing Dynasty. Because of its color, texture and reflection, she had suspicions that the set of jewels on display in the gallery were not authentic jade, or grade A, despite how they were listed.\n\nLinna Wang, who grew up in Shanghai, shares her notes on the different types of jade. (Photo by Viktoria Capek)\n\nOfficials at the Pacific Asia Museum determined Wang\u2019s disquiet about the jade to not be true, based on confirmation from gallery docents, but that didn\u2019t ease her frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t know why white people can become the main curator of Asian art,\u201d Wang said in an interview a few weeks after the visit. She took issue with the authority responsible for the collection, the same person who led her class excursion: a white woman and the Pacific Asia Museum\u2019s sole curator, Rebecca Hall. \u201cSome of the stuff, she can only know the first layer,\u201d Wang continued. Despite Hall having a doctorate in Southeast Asian art history, Wang feels as though the approach to display different cultures in the museum lacks a depth only an Asian person can properly construct.\n\nThe Asian population is the largest ethnic demographic \u2014 roughly 62% \u2014 of the San Gabriel Valley, where the Pacific Asia Museum is located. Further, Asian individuals make up USC\u2019s third largest ethnic group. Wang wondered why an Asian resident, student or USC faculty member wasn\u2019t curating in Hall\u2019s place. \u201cHer way of thinking is really shallow,\u201d Wang said. \u201cLike America\u2019s culture.\u201d\n\nJoining Hall as a non-Asian, executive leader for the Pacific Asia Museum and Fisher Museum of Art is director Bethany Montagano. Montagano accepted the Pacific Asia Museum\u2019s director role in 2019 following former director Christina Yu Yu\u2019s departure. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in Asian studies and studied at Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka, Japan. She also carries a master\u2019s in museum studies and a doctorate in American history with a focus on gender, race and cultural representation.\n\nWang\u2019s apprehension about the museum\u2019s leadership joins a larger conversation about diversity in culturally specific museum spaces. And Hall agrees that representation of diverse cultures should be top of mind. \u201cI think people are right to have those concerns,\u201d Hall said during an interview at the museum. \u201cI can never change who I am, but as a person in power at a museum, I\u2019ll do everything I can to work with people of diverse backgrounds.\u201d\n\nMost of the items on display at the Pacific Asia Museum were present before Hall\u2019s start as curator in 2018. Still, she reaffirmed the executive team\u2019s work with the Pacific Asia Museum\u2019s board of directors \u2014 the majority of whom are Asian \u2014 and entities such as the China Society of Southern California to accurately label and present items in exhibits, such as the jadeite earrings and bracelet.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019m fostering are these labels that I call \u2018community labels,\u2019 [for] which we have conversations with members of communities that are represented in the museum, to hear their perspectives on the objects,\u201d Hall said.\n\nHowever, for student Storm Bookhard, who joined Wang on the class tour of the Pacific Asia Museum, consulting diverse voices for the museum\u2019s setup isn\u2019t enough. She wanted to know how the gallery was actively fighting for Asian communities. \u201cWe directly asked [Hall] about how they, as a space, have responded to current violent movements against Asian and Asian American people,\u201d recalled Bookhard, who is Black. She was referring to the increase in AAPI hate crimes following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHall told the class she hadn\u2019t curated any exhibitions that specifically fought against hate; her job was to give Asian artists a platform to share their own messages through rotating exhibits such as \u201cOff Kilter: Power and Pathos.\u201d The summer exhibition highlighted the experimental attitudes of three female Asian artists and their ability to address sociopolitical issues with satire and critical commentary.\n\nThe students shared one other concern about the Pacific Asia Museum regarding what audience the institution caters to and what messages it\u2019s trying to send. \u201cFor me, if I were working at the [Pacific Asia Museum], I would add more language,\u201d said Wang, referencing the museum\u2019s use of only English on labels throughout eight galleries spanning art from Japan, Korea, China, Himalaya, Pacific Island and South and Southeast Asia. \u201cFirst think about [the] Asian community. Then think about other audiences in the U.S.\u201d\n\nVarious language options are available for audiences to translate information on the museum\u2019s website, however.\n\nStacey Queen, a museum scholar and the Director of Education and Visitor Services at Tudor Place Historic House & Garden in Washington D.C., published an academic journal in 2018 on upholding diversity in cultural spaces that historically served predominantly white audiences. In an email, Queen added to the conversation surrounding representation in leadership at establishments such as the Pacific Asia Museum and the importance of uplifting culturally diverse voices.\n\n\u201cToday, more than ever, museums, cultural spaces and historic sites must embrace diversity, inclusion, equity and accessibility challenging those who want to rewrite the facts of history with narratives that whitewash the truth and boost falsehoods and lies,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe responsibility of engaging the public in an effort to unite mankind falls into the lap of our spaces.\u201d\n\nHall said she understands the apprehension Wang and Bookhard have about leadership at the Pacific Asia Museum. She wished more people were willing to talk about their concerns with cultural diversity in museum spaces of all kinds.\n\nThe students, meanwhile, are hopeful that speaking up about their concerns leads to more active and obvious representation at the Pacific Asia Museum and similar culturally specific spaces. As Bookhard said, it\u2019s not a matter of standing against something: \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is a conversation to oppose [Pacific Asia Museum]. It\u2019s a matter of us continually reevaluating how these systems work and what it looks like to have a public-facing position \u2014 a position in which histories are in your hands.\u201d```"}

Just one year ago, it was a Starbucks caramel iced latte with caramel drizzle for Savannah DeMelo, still donning the cardinal and gold in her final season in Southern California. But the former has now become her go-to order, as DeMelo goes to work in the violet and lavender for Racing Louisville. It\u2019s a 12-month stretch that\u2019s seen her go from All-American to American international, from senior leader to Rookie of the Month, from USC\u2019s No. 10 to one of May\u2019s Best XI. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say unexpected,\u201d DeMelo said, \u201cbut I was coming into my rookie season just trying to learn as much as I could... and I was ready for the challenge.\u201d Racing selected DeMelo fourth overall back in December of 2021, making her the highest Trojan selected in four years. Come the following April, she started in Louisville\u2019s opener, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2-1 loss in Chicago. Three games later, DeMelo opened her NWSL account on a match-winning free kick in a 1-0 victory over San Diego \u2014 a right-footed missile into the top right corner of the goal. \u201cMy first goal,\u201d DeMelo said, \u201cwas when I was super like, \u2018Oh my gosh. This is actually happening. I\u2019m scoring. I\u2019m starting\u2019... I remember we had a couple days off, and me and my friends went to the lake and just reflected on everything. That\u2019s when it hit me.\u201d That goal was the first of four \u2014 all of which came from outside the box \u2014 for DeMelo in 2022, who finished as Racing\u2019s second-leading scorer on the season. Of the 50 players selected in the 2022 NWSL Draft, only Diana Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez scored more goals in their rookie campaign. The USC alum started \u2014 and played more than 80 minutes \u2014 in all 22 of Racing\u2019s games this season. But come season\u2019s end, DeMelo\u2019s name was absent from the list of three finalists for Rookie of the Year. \u201cThe three they picked were all amazing players,\u201d DeMelo said. \u201cDefinitely disappointed because everyone wants to make it, but it doesn\u2019t take anything away from the season I had and how I contributed with the team. All that stuff is extra.\u201d Despite the omission, DeMelo\u2019s season hardly went without recognition. After leading Louisville to a once beaten month of May, DeMelo earned a spot on the month\u2019s Best XI. She scored a pair of goals in July, playing every single minute on her way to Rookie of the Month honors. DeMelo finished 2022 with the 14th best average match rating according to FotMob \u2014 a rookie mark only topped by Samantha Coffey. By late August, two days after a contest against the Red Stars, her rapid ascension had become impossible to ignore \u2014 for everyone. \u201cMy trainer came up to me,\u201d DeMelo said, \u201cand she was like, \u2018Are you ready to go?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Am I ready to go where?\u2019 And she goes, \u2018To camp.\u2019\u201d To be fair to DeMelo, the USWNT roster for the September friendlies had been set seven days prior. But when Trinity Rodman couldn\u2019t attend due to a family commitment, it was the former Trojan who got the call. \u201cI literally looked at my phone,\u201d DeMelo said, \u201cand it said, \u2018Vlatko: Can I call you in five minutes?\u2019 I was super pumped. I got super red. And I went and had a conversation with him and within three hours I was flying to Kansas for camp.\u201d She earned a second call-up a month later, which included a trip across the Atlantic for friendlies with Spain and England \u2014 the latter in front of 76,000 at Wembley Stadium. But DeMelo wasn\u2019t always the complete player the last 12 months have proven her to be. Keidane McAlpine coached the U.S. international for all five of her years in Southern California, and there\u2019s one thing that sticks out about their time together. \u201cAlways talking to her about her defending,\u201d McAlpine said with a laugh. \u201cWe spent probably the first two years just talking about her defending and her willingness to run and work... That was our thing. Just trying to get her better in that.\u201d All the time and effort has paid instant dividends for DeMelo at the next level. Her 3.06 tackles per 90 against wingers and attacking mids put her in the 96th percentile of all midfielders in top eight competitions. DeMelo finished in the 87th percentile for interceptions, blocks and clearances as well. The former youth attacking midfielder has not only added the defensive element to her locker, she\u2019s become one of the world\u2019s best defenders at her position. \u201cProps to [former USC assistant coach] Jason [Lockhart] and Keidane because they kind of transformed me into that player,\u201d DeMelo said. \u201cI\u2019m not playing against girls that are younger than me. I\u2019m playing against girls who are 30-plus years old, national team players, so I knew I had to add that, and I think that\u2019s what separated me from college Savannah to a professional Savannah.\u201d In just 12 months, Savannah DeMelo added a Best XI and a Rookie of the Month to her resume, and picked up her first \u2014 and second \u2014 senior national team call-up. The next dozen include the dawn of year two, a potential World Cup nod and maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 a reunion with her dog Milo. \u201cMy family\u2019s super attached to him,\u201d DeMelo said, \u201cso it\u2019s going to take a lot to get him to go to Louisville... We\u2019ll see.\u201d \n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Grant Cambridge)\n\nBy Mia Brower\nDecember 19, 2022 at 10:31 am PST\n\nMoises Hernandez sits at his desk in his dorm room of Ripley Hall at the Naval Academy Preparatory. A stack of books lines the shelf behind him. To their left, a black-and-white service hat. His uniform has been folded and retired for the day in a drawer beneath his bed. In four months, Hernandez will be finishing his Plebe Summer, a seven-week program designed as an introduction to the military, where civilians are turned into midshipmen. He will have learned the importance of self-discipline, reached top physical condition and married the basics of boat handling and seamanship. By then, he will be four months closer to becoming a U.S. Marine.\n\nHernandez, 18, knows what the next 25 years look like: he will go from Plebe, to Youngster, to declaring his major, computer engineering, before entering the summer of service selections. He then plans to serve for 20 years, before \u201cpossibly becoming an astronaut.\u201d Hernandez \u2013 the first in his family to serve, go to college or be born in the United States \u2013 has not always been so concrete about his future. When he first started at University Prep Value High School in Los Angeles in 2016, he didn\u2019t plan on going to college. He thought, hazily, he would enlist in the military instead.\n\nYet the high school, one of four public charters born from the Value Schools organization in L.A., saw something more for Hernandez, an honors student and active member of the school\u2019s Leadership Council. Founded upon five core values and a mission to provide high-quality education for historically underserved communities, the school would hardly let Hernandez forget its second value: Each student can develop to his or her fullest potential.\n\nOne day during Hernandez\u2019s sophomore year, he and his English teacher, Mr. Pacis, also the school\u2019s vice principal, met to talk about his \u201cpath\u201d and \u201cwhat would be best for him.\u201d \u201cBeing the first is the most difficult thing, because you\u2019re the stepping stone for future people to emulate,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cKnowing you\u2019re capable of doing something, or you\u2019re capable of going to a prestigious school is definitely something that not a lot of people believe they can do.\u201d\n\nThat was when Pacis, who Hernandez calls \u201clolo,\u201d grandpa in Filipino, told him he could go to college and serve in the military. Both. \u201cHe said, like, if anything, you\u2019re going to be a leader,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cYou\u2019re going to this school, we\u2019re preparing you for a leadership role, and you\u2019re the best fit for being an officer. \u201cAfter that I was like, \u2018You know what, I agree with you. I\u2019m going to apply to the Naval Academy. And I\u2019m going to go.\u2019\u201d\n\nThree years later and 3,000 miles away, he can remember the fourth floor of 700 Wilshire Blvd., and the spot where his biological grandfather dropped off him and his brother each morning. He thinks of his baseball team celebrating a win at Chick-Fil-A, or the community events and annual toy drive for which he always enjoyed volunteering. He also remembers the five core values as they relate to the three he now holds. \u201cHonor, I can relate that to value No. 1. Courage. Have the courage to develop yourself. That\u2019s value No. 2,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cAlways push yourself to do better, never settle for less and respect yourself. It\u2019s value No. 3.\u201d\n\nDr. Jerome Porath was superintendent of schools for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles when the Charter Schools Act of 1992 was signed into California law. The Milwaukee native had spent the majority of his career educating at-risk youth in L.A.\u2019s inner-city neighborhoods. As multiple downtown Catholic schools prepared to close, he saw that the new legislation and charter school movement presented an opportunity \u2013 to create a school centered on values. Things that \u201cwould stay with you for life,\u201d said Grant Cambridge, Value Schools Board chair and Foundation Board chair.\n\nIn the late 90s, Porath and a small team of educators began sketching their plans for Downtown Value School, a K-8 elementary charter that would offer values-based education to 480 low-income students. The school, on the border between Pico Union and South L.A., was running at full capacity when Cambridge joined the board in 2007. One year later, Value Schools\u2019 second permanent facility opened, this time a high school located in Koreatown in Central L.A. The schools, with an academic year longer than most starting in early August and ending in June, focus on small classroom sizes.\n\nCasey Frye moved from Catholic to public school during her early elementary years. She wasn\u2019t sure her teachers knew her name. When Frye came to Downtown Value School as a fourth grader in 2003, she suddenly felt seen. Value School\u2019s fourth value belongs to building \u201ca safe, nurturing community.\u201d In order to learn, it says, students must \u201cgenuinely care for each other and seek good for each other\u201d so that they \u201cfeel secure and supported in efforts to grow in every way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was almost like the flip of a switch,\u201d Frye said. \u201cWhen I went to school... It was a home. These are my people. These are my teachers. These are my friends. This is my family.\u201d Every morning before school, Frye and her mother would drive 60 miles west from San Bernandino, where her mother worked a minimum-wage job while raising Frye and her three siblings.\n\nFor some students, it\u2019s not as simple. In 2016, Edgar Ballesteros was in his second year of teaching at Central City Value High School.

This is who I am, this is what I do every two years, this is what can happen if things don\u2019t go well,\u201d Ballesteros said. \u201cI think that brought us closer than I think anything else that I could have done.\u201d\n\nFrye was Valedictorian her senior year.

The ranked contest in Galen Center was circled for many as a day when the Trojans could assert themselves against an opponent capable of competing for a national title. USC\u2019s ability to force turnovers, work tirelessly on the boards and make shots in critical situations led to a 74-71 win, proving the team to be true contenders.\n\nSenior guard Boogie Ellis led the way with 28 points, serving as the Trojans\u2019 catalyst on offense. He was 9 for 15 from the field, and contributed 8 points at the free throw line. Boogie took advantage of the Tigers\u2019 weaknesses in the paint and attacked the rim often. On what allowed him to be so successful, Ellis attributed it to, \u201cJust being aggressive. I\u2019m at my best when I\u2019m aggressive.\u201d\n\nFollowing the win, head coach Andy Enfield had nothing but positive things to say about Ellis. \u201cBoogie\u2019s incredible in all aspects of the game,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe defended, he was physical, he was quick, he was aggressive on offense. I thought he played his best game of the year. He made the right decisions on offense, he didn\u2019t force a lot of things, he made some shots. I just thought he played a great game.\u201d\n\nRight behind Ellis on the stat sheet was sophomore guard Kobe Johnson, with 10 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists. Where Johnson really excelled though was in his ability to force turnovers. He had a game-high six steals and set the tone defensively for the Trojans. \u201cWe focused a lot on defense,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cComing into this game, we knew it was going to be a very physical game, and we had to match their physicality. I think we did that. We caused a lot of turnovers, forced them to make bad passes, take some bad shots. We really locked in on that.\u201d\n\nJohnson and the rest of the Trojans forced Auburn to turn the ball over 23 times, leading to 23 points off of those turnovers. \u201cWe\u2019ve hung our hat on defense the last 3 years,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cToday we had 23 steals. Obviously defense played a really big part. We know we are going to have to win games with our defense.\u201d\n\nSunday marked USC\u2019s fifth consecutive win after two losses in the Bahamas. \u201cWe needed this big win, especially after the Bahamas,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIt gives us a lot of confidence, knowing that we can play with one of the best teams in the country. We just gotta build off of it and trust one another and just keep getting better.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will travel to Phoenix, Ariz. to play Colorado State on Wednesday at 8 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/John S. Peterson)\n\nBy Malala Pyle\nDecember 18, 2022 at 8:21 pm PST\n\nAt 9:36 p.m. on Dec. 10, No. 2 seed San Diego went on a 6-0 run to finish an electric five-setter, advancing to the Final Four for the first time in program history and bouncing No. 1 seed Stanford. Earlier that evening, No. 1 seed Louisville defeated No. 3 seed Oregon in a five-set thriller, meaning the Cardinal loss ended the Pac-12\u2032s chances of making a Final Four appearance.\n\nHow do neither of the two best teams in the Pac-12 \u2014 both of which won over 22 games in the regular season \u2014 make the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament? Simply put? The Pac-12 is a doomed conference.\n\nLooking purely at the tournament, the Pac-12 is struggling to make appearances in the Final Four. In the last three years, only one Pac-12 school has made the Final Four \u2014 a Washington team in the 2020 tournament that lost 3-1 to Kentucky. On the other hand, outside of San Diego, all three of Louisville, Pitt and Texas are looking at their second national semifinal appearance in that same time span. And while they didn\u2019t make the Final Four this year, Wisconsin fans saw two Final Fours in three years \u2014 not to mention a national championship.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the same ACC, Big Ten and Big 12 teams are returning to the Final Four, because the Pac-12 isn\u2019t putting any teams in. And there\u2019s trouble on the horizon for the Conference of Champions.\n\nIn 2024, USC and UCLA will no longer be members of the Pac-12 as the two will make their move to the Big Ten \u2014 arguably the best conference in college volleyball right now. The Pac-12 loses two historically good programs in USC and UCLA. If you take the L.A. schools\u2019 combined seven NCAA championships and give them to the Big Ten, the Pac-12 is left with 10 while the Big Ten\u2019s count goes up to a whopping 20. That\u2019s not to mention the pair\u2019s seven runner-ups, 21 Final Fours and 66 tournament appearances.\n\nThe loss of the two teams could end poorly for the leftover Pac-12 teams. There\u2019s Arizona and Oregon State, who won a combined eight games in-conference this season; Arizona State, who hasn\u2019t won more than half of their matches since 2019; and a Cal team that hasn\u2019t won a conference game since the early half of the COVID season.\n\nThe conference\u2019s woes even leak into the professional sphere. Of the 12 women who played for the United States\u2019 2021 Olympic team in Tokyo, only one played Pac-12 volleyball \u2014 middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo Gunderson who graduated from Stanford in 2009. Two-thirds of the athletes on that same Olympic team played for Big Ten schools \u2014 the likes of Nebraska, Illinois, Purdue and Penn State. Good volleyball players, those at the highest level, go or went to Big Ten schools.\n\nSince 2012, seven of the 36 US women\u2019s volleyball roster spots were filled by Pac-12 alumni, and the lone Pac-12 player from the Tokyo team finished her college career over 10 years ago. The new generation of Pac-12 players \u2014 over the course of the last decade \u2014 don\u2019t live up to the professional US volleyball standards like Big Ten players do.\n\nSomething has to change in the Pac-12. Stanford and an Oregon program that hasn\u2019t gotten past the Elite Eight since 2012 aren\u2019t enough to make what\u2019s left of the Pac-12 a competitive volleyball conference. Unless one of the remaining teams emerges as a contender next season, the Pac-12 can kiss its Final Four hopes and national championship dreams goodbye.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Katrina Marcinowski/HBO Max)\n\nBy Grace Galante December 18, 2022 at 8:08 pm PST\n\nAnother year of television is quickly coming to an end, and this year has brought us more shows depicting students and college life than ever before. From \u201cEuphoria\u201d to \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d, 2022 delivered content on all different types of schools and students. Here are some of the best and worst television shows about students that aired this year:\n\nBest: Abbott Elementary\nIn a television landscape dominated by streaming, \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d proves that a cable sitcom can still captivate audiences. Created by comedian Quinta Brunson and based on her mother\u2019s experiences as a school teacher, \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d highlights the struggles of an underfunded public school in Philadelphia while also delivering on the comedy too. Filmed mockumentary style, \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d is reminiscent of other sitcoms like \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d with the characters often looking deadpan at the camera when something goes disastrously wrong at the school. While the show touches on many real-life issues in the education system, the humor is also authentic and keeps you laughing non-stop the entire time you\u2019re watching the show.\n\nWorst: Elite\nThis Spanish show and Netflix original is wildly popular on the platform, but its depiction of teenagers is almost too unrealistic to take seriously. Following students in an elite private school, the characters often find themselves the center of scandals like murder mysteries, affairs and drug abuse. While not all shows are meant to be realistic, \u201cElite\u201d just doesn\u2019t represent what the majority of high school students experience, and is also unnecessarily graphic to the point where it doesn\u2019t contribute anything to the story. Rather than showing more realistic, healthy and safe portrayals of teen romance, the show has depicted multiple instances of adults pursuing relationships with the underage students. To make matters worse, the series fails to show that these relationships are inappropriate and predatory. Lastly, the show has also received backlash for their portrayal of Muslim characters.\n\nBest: The Sex Lives of College Girls\nUnlike \u201cElite,\u201d \u201cThe Sex Lives of College Girls\u201d gives a more accurate depiction of what being a student is like in 2022. While the characters drink, party and have sex, as college students do, we also get to see storylines featured around classes, clubs and on-campus jobs, as well. Showing all facets of the college experience is part of what makes this show so relatable and authentic, and is something that is often lacking in teen shows today. Additionally, the show features a variety of characters that differ in race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and even interests - guaranteeing that there is a character nearly every college student can relate to. Lastly, the show navigates the four protagonists exploring their sexuality in an authentic way, with conversations about sex and sexuality that are open, honest and more real than what viewers are typically used to seeing. Plus, the show remains light-hearted and comedic while tackling topics like these.\n\nWorst: Gossip Girl Reboot\nWhen HBO Max announced the \u201cGossip Girl\u201d reboot, fans across the world were ecstatic that the teen drama was getting revived with a new set of characters. Unfortunately, the new series is lacking the charm of its predecessor. Unlike the original show, the characters are not as blissfully unaware of their privilege and wealth as the likes of Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf. The show attempts to have its characters aware of their privilege and identities but with a lack of subtlety on these real world-issues, the writing often comes across as self-righteous and patronizing. While I applaud HBO Max for making a more diverse \u201cGossip Girl\u201d, the show\u2019s coverage of social issues isn\u2019t nearly as nuanced or realistic as it could be, and the diverse characters aren\u2019t nearly as developed or multi-faceted as their white counterparts. That being said, the majority of the show\u2019s characters are simply just unlikeable and the series also revealed the identity of Gossip Girl after the first episode, spoiling the show\u2019s most central mystery.\n\nBest: Heartstopper\nBased on the graphic novel series of the same name, the show follows high school student Charlie who\u2019s outed as gay at his all boys school. As Charlie navigates Truham Grammar as the only openly gay student, he meets popular rugby player Nick and quickly develops feelings for him. Throughout the course of the series, Nick begins to have feelings for Charlie and struggles with his sexuality. \u201cHeartstopper\u201d is a coming of age story featuring a male bisexual main character at the forefront which we often don\u2019t see on screen. \u201cHeartstopper\u201d also features other openly LGBTQ+ characters including Charlie\u2019s best friend Elle who is a transgender girl and Nick\u2019s friend Tara, who is a lesbian dating her classmate Darcy. Unlike teen shows like \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cElite,\u201d the characters in \u201cHeartstopper\u201d don\u2019t drink, do drugs, have sex and rarely curse. It\u2019s refreshing to see teen storylines on screen that don\u2019t center around partying and sex, especially since the characters in \u201cHeartstopper\u201d are only 14 to 16 years old. While most teen shows feature lots of adult themes, \u201cHeartstopper\u2019' strays from the norm and embraces those who choose not to grow up just yet. Lastly, \u201cHeartstopper\u201d is an authentic portrayal of self-exploration and the ups and downs of discovering an LGBTQ+ identity in high school.\n\nWorst: Euphoria\nThis is a hot take given that the show is wildly popular amongst teens and young adults right now, but there is much to be desired when it comes to Euphoria\u2019s portrayal of school and student life. While the drama is addictive and the storylines are enthralling, I often find myself thinking that \u201cEuphoria\u201d would be much better as a college show, or even a show about twenty-somethings. Like many of the other series on this list, \u201cEuphoria\u201d features high school characters in very adult storylines that aren\u2019t always reminiscent of one\u2019s high school experiences. Additionally, the majority of the cast is well beyond their teen years, and their clear maturity can make it hard to relate and sympathize with the characters. And while the actors are of age, the nude scenes with characters who are supposed to be minors is something the show has drawn criticism for. This, coupled with the over-the-top makeup and extravagant outfits, make it hard to believe it\u2019s even a high school show. In fact, it\u2019s a running joke how the \u201cEuphoria\u201d characters are never seen in class and that the name of the school they attend is actually unknown. With all this being said, \u201cEuphoria\u201d is still a masterful show and one that I love, I\u2019m just not completely sure high school is the best setting for it.\n\nBest: Never Have I Ever\nWritten and produced by actress Mindy Kaling, who also produces \u201cThe Sex Lives of College Girls,\u201d \u201cNever Have I Ever\u201d follows Indian American teen Devi as she is determined to become popular and fall in love with her dream boyfriend while dealing with the grief of losing her father. Throughout the course of the series, Devi finds herself torn between multiple love interests and making a handful of questionable choices. \u201cNever Have I Ever\u201d has been praised for their South Asian representation with Devi and her family. The show also features other South Asian characters and love interests outside of Devi and her family who all have different experiences with their culture. These characters are individually fleshed out and their experiences as South Asian Americans in the show are not monolithic. Additionally, the show features other characters who are POC and LGBTQ+ with equally as fleshed out storylines as the main characters. \u201cNever Have I Ever\u201d is not afraid to show the wildly chaotic side of being a teen girl experiencing love and loss and is equally as emotional and tender as it is satirical and outrageous.\n```"}

Counting the 2028 Olympics, it\u2019s the three-time host of the Summer Olympics, home of the USC Trojans since 1923 and has hosted various sports teams such as the Rams, Clippers and UCLA Football in different periods. Most recently, the Coliseum hosted NASCAR fans for the Busch Light Clash in February of 2022. On Feb. 5, 2023, NASCAR will make its return to the storied stadium.\n\nAs a brand that reflects the American spirit, NASCAR no doubt sees the historical value of the Coliseum. However, the icing on the cake is the geological advantage \u2014 its proximity to the USC campus. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tremendous opportunity having it right here close to USC this year,\u201d said Patrick Rogers, vice president of NASCAR Marketing Services. Students are targeted specifically by the Coca-Cola Torch Party Porch, a standing-room-only general admission section on the steps of the Peristyle that provides up-close access to musical entertainment, driver introductions and racing action.\n\nNASCAR also announced that the pre-race performance will feature Cypress Hill, an American hip hop group from South Gate. They have yet to disclose the mid-race performer, but Rogers said they hope the performer helps to \u201cbuild a much younger, more diverse fan base.\u201d If students have ever thought about coming to a NASCAR race, Rogers said the Clash will be an \u201ceasy access opportunity\u201d and a chance to \u201cmake some lifelong fandom out of it.\u201d\n\nConstructing a track in the Coliseum is the latest in a series of efforts to broaden NASCAR\u2019s audience. In 2020, during the Black Lives Matter Movement, NASCAR banned Confederate flags from all racetracks. According to a report from Performance Research, two-thirds of NASCAR fans under 40 said NASCAR\u2019s actions made them more likely to watch a NASCAR event and 57% said they\u2019d be more likely to attend a NASCAR event. According to Morning Consult\u2019s online survey, 46% of respondents aged 35 to 44 stated that they were NASCAR fans. On the other hand, 59% of respondents aged 18 to 34 said that they were not a fan.\n\nNASCAR is turning over a new leaf for the younger and more diverse groups. Kyle Larson, driver of the No. 5 Chevrolet Camaro for Hendrick Motorsports, said that his identity as a half-Japanese millennial racer has attracted a lot of Asian fans. He envisions himself to be an ambassador for the Asian community. \u201cI hope, again, that everybody comes out to this event. And, you know, if you weren\u2019t here for the race earlier this year, it was probably unlike anything else that anybody would have ever seen before,\u201d Larson said. \u201c[It\u2019s] definitely a spectacle and [I] hope to get a lot of younger party crowds out here.\u201d\n\nAlthough the quarter-mile Coliseum track is the shortest length for NASCAR racers to run on, the bold decision might just pay off for the sport. The 2023 Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum will begin at 5 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 5 and the exclusive ticket offer for students is available online.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza\nDecember 16, 2022 at 7:16 pm PST\n\nWhen Lindsay Gottlieb accepted the head coaching position for the USC women\u2019s basketball team, she had every intention of restoring the women\u2019s college basketball scene in L.A. to elite status. Although Thursday\u2019s Crosstown Showdown against the No. 10 Bruins didn\u2019t result in a victory for the Trojans, Gottlieb\u2019s squad proved just how exciting these games can and should be.\n\nEven though the Bruins led by 11 at halftime, the game never truly felt out of reach for USC. The Trojans grinded their way back from that initial deficit to outscore UCLA 28-20 in the second half.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t draw up a new defense at halftime,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI just said, \u2018Let\u2019s protect the paint better.\u2019 Too many layups. Too many mid-range jumpers that were uncontested. We\u2019ve really defended well all year. We\u2019ve shown that we can defend at the highest level.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans came into Thursday\u2019s matchup ranked second in the country in scoring defense. Holding the No. 10 team in the country to 59 points is an incredible accomplishment, especially with the quality of scorers that the Bruins deploy.\n\nThe Bruins\u2019 two leading scorers, senior guard Charisma Osborne and freshman guard Kiki Rice, were held to five points and one point respectively in the second half.\n\nOn the offensive side, USC was led by sophomore forward Rayah Marshall and graduate forward Kadi Sissoko. Marshall, in her first game since Nov. 30, picked up right where she left off, scoring 15 points and adding 10 rebounds. Sissoko\u2019s footwork and ability to finish at the rim proved challenging for the Bruins as she finished with 20 points \u2014 seven of which came in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of our fight, grit and intensity,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cHolding a top-10 team to 59 points, we\u2019ve gotta be able to score more than 56. There\u2019s some things that are gonna haunt me \u2014 missed free throws, possessions in the second quarter [where] we gave up too many points.\u201d\n\nIn total, USC went 12-of-20 from the line, with five of those misses coming in clutch situations in the fourth quarter. Another area that the Trojans need to improve on is on the offensive glass. The Bruins finished the game with 20 offensive rebounds in total. Those 20 offensive boards led to 23 second-chance points, starkly greater than USC\u2019s 12 second-chance points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated that we gave up 23 second-chance points,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c[But] we really honed in on not turning the ball over, [and] we only turned it over 10 times. I think there\u2019s a lot of positive, even though it kills me to lose the game. Things can get tweaked and fixed, but you need to have a care factor and a toughness. I think those are things that we do have.\u201d\n\nUSC will now travel to Dallas to take on Texas as part of the Coast-to-Coast Challenge. Sissoko believes the team is ready to bounce back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of our team,\u201d Sissoko said. \u201cI see growth and I\u2019m very optimistic for what\u2019s coming for us. We\u2019re working really hard in practice and it showed in games. Only the sky is the limit, but we\u2019re going to keep working on the things we need to work on.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the outcome of Thursday\u2019s matchup though, it is obvious that the work is paying off. Not only are the Trojans on their way to greatly eclipsing last year\u2019s 12-16 record, but they are on a mission to prove that women\u2019s college basketball is alive and well in Southern California. Thursday\u2019s Crosstown Showdown was just a small glimpse of what is to come. Just ask Coach Gottlieb.\n\n\u201cI think that this is a start,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe crowd was great. UCLA is a top-10 team, [and] expectations are to compete and win. I think this is only the beginning. We want to win and we want to win now.\u201d\n```"}

Through her online persona known as \u201cswiftieplanntika,\u201d Annika shares discussions of Swift\u2019s music from a queer perspective to more than 27,000 TikTok followers.\n\nAnnika\u2019s blunt commentary on \u201cHits Different\u201d holds up; earlier verses establish Swift as the first-person narrator of the song (\u201cI washed my hands of us at the club\u201d) singing to an ungendered other person (\u201cYou made a mess of me\u201d) until that character is revealed as \u201cdream girl\u201d in the bridge.\n\nDespite the queer implications of \u201cMidnights\u201d through lyrics in \u201cHits Different,\u201d and shared themes of curious love, regret and feeling trapped expressed in other songs, such as \u201cYou\u2019re On Your Own, Kid,\u201d Swift\u2019s record-breaking 10th studio album doesn\u2019t need lyrical or thematic support to prove it\u2019s an anthem for LGBTQ+ people.\n\n\u201cMidnights\u201d is a queer album because queer people such as Annika say it is \u2014 because that\u2019s how they interpret it. And Swift\u2019s music is nothing if not ambiguous for the sole purpose of allowing fans to receive her music in any way they see fit.\n\n\u201cEven though this is an album about Taylor Swift\u2019s life and her very specific experiences, she has such a grasp on the human language that she can make it universally applicable,\u201d Annika shared over a Zoom call.\n\nThe 24-year-old doctoral student classifies herself as a member of the Swift fandom known as \u201cGaylors.\u201d These fans are largely members of the LGBTQ+ community who believe Swift to also be queer and that the artist shares stories and clues about her sexual identity in her music.\n\nOver the past two years, the Gaylor fandom gained traction thanks to online venues such as TikTok giving them a platform to express their queer understanding of Swift\u2019s music. The community grew exponentially as Gaylors worldwide unpacked the dense lyrics and LGBTQ+ symbolism in albums such as \u201cfolklore\u201d and \u201cevermore,\u201d both released in 2020.\n\n\u201cAs queer fans, naturally we tend to want to read subtext,\u201d said Leah Dajches, a postdoctoral scholar at Penn State. \u201cWe tend to want to find some of those gaps in narratives where we can see ourselves.\u201d\n\nMuch of Dajches\u2019 academic research focuses on the role entertainment media plays on the identity of sexual minorities. In May of this year, she surveyed more than a thousand people online and published a queer examination of \u201cfolklore\u201d and its impact on fans.\n\nDajches found that self-identifying queer listeners of Swift\u2019s music, who felt encouraged by representation in songs such as \u201cbetty,\u201d were more accepting of all sexual identities. The work received pushback mainly from self-identifying heterosexual supporters of the artist, however, who claimed speculation of Swift\u2019s music as queer to be inappropriate.\n\nThis response to the possibility of Swift being a queer-representing artist is why Dajches chooses to interpret Swift\u2019s music like she does.\n\n\u201cI think at the end of the day, if you\u2019re resonating with the music [and] the lyrics and it\u2019s doing some type of good for you in terms of seeing representation that you need to see, that\u2019s what\u2019s most important,\u201d she said.\n\nFor \u201cMidnights,\u201d Dajches was drawn to track seven from the album, titled \u201cQuestion...?\u201d The song reflects on a past relationship, with a chorus mimicking someone who could be asking for advice.\n\nCan I ask you a question? / Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room... Do you wish you could still touch... her? / It\u2019s just a question\n\n\u201cThere were lines and lyrics describing what it was like when I started to really explore my sexuality,\u201d Dajches said. \u201cIt kind of felt reminiscent of when you\u2019re in a first love with someone who identifies as a woman and you\u2019re questioning.\u201d\n\nIn the same spirit of curiosity, Annika shared a connection to the album\u2019s fourth track, \u201cSnow On The Beach.\u201d The song, featuring Lana Del Rey, describes a moment of falling in love with someone while they\u2019re unexpectedly falling in love with you.\n\nAnnika explains that lyrics from the bridge \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t speak it / afraid to jinx it\u201d \u2014 describe what someone developing same-sex feelings for the first time might feel. The song indicates the narrator might not be comfortable speaking about their romantic interest, similar to the way queer individuals may not feel comfortable or safe speaking about their romantic interests in heteronormative spaces.\n\nAccording to Leigh Pfeffer, one way that LGBTQ+ people combat this discomfort is through queer flagging, a system where people identify themselves as queer through actions or symbols.\n\n\u201cWith the LGBT community, there\u2019s always been ways that people have found each other,\u201d said Pfeffer, the manager of museum experience for the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco.\n\nPfeffer is also the host of \u201cHistory is Gay,\u201d a podcast uncovering patterns of queerness throughout history and in famous historical figures. The term \u201cqueer flagging\u201d dates back to the 1970s when gay men in New York City would wear certain colored hankerchiefs to subtly announce they were looking for other gay men.\n\nModern queer flagging happens across the entire LGBTQ+ spectrum, however, and manifests in online trends (for example, indicating you\u2019re a queer woman by saying you \u201clisten to Girl in Red\u201d) and through symbolism in popular music such as Swift\u2019s.\n\nThe use of queer symbolism in the singer\u2019s 2020 album, \u201cevermore\u201d \u2014 arguably Swift\u2019s most lyrically poetic and raw production, released at the height of COVID-19 lockdowns \u2014 had fans buzzing with inferences about songs such as \u201cright where you left me.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s bonus track strangely includes a moment quiet enough to hear a \u201chairpin drop,\u201d instead of using the common phrase \u201cyou could hear a pin drop.\u201d The significance of \u201chair\u201d in this lyric relates it to \u201cthe hairpin drop heard around the world,\u201d an alias for The Stonewall Riots, or a series of protests made by gay community members in New York City in 1969 on behalf of LGBTQ+ equality.\n\nPfeffer said \u201cdropping hairpins\u201d was also a slang term used to hint that you were gay during the 1960s.\n\nThe connections to queer history within \u201cevermore,\u201d the album preceding \u201cMidnights\u201d (not including Swift\u2019s re-recorded albums), may explain why speculation for the singer\u2019s latest release to be an LGBTQ+ haven was more prevalent than in the past.\n\nAnd while the flagging in \u201cMidnights\u201d may not be as loud as \u201chairpin drop,\u201d songs from the era are hardly void of symbolism. Different types of flowers, for instance, signifying importance to the LGBTQ+ community \u2014 from violets to carnations to lavender \u2014 appear in the songs \u201cThe Great War,\u201d \u201cMaroon,\u201d and \u201cLavender Haze.\u201d\n\nNo deal, that 1950s shit they want from me / I just wanna stay in that lavender haze\n\nWhen the chorus from the album\u2019s first track so closely references the \u201850s and lavender in the same breath, it\u2019s difficult for historians such as Pfeffer not to think of the Lavender Scare, a movement named for persecuting queer people from government jobs during that time period.\n\nNot to mention lavender\u2019s association as a color of queer desire, a connection drawn from lyrics of the 7th century BC poet Sappho, who wrote erotically about women with \u201cviolet tiaras\u201d \u2014 lavender being a lighter shade of violet.\n\nFurther, there\u2019s the band Lavender Country, whose self-titled 1973 album is considered the first known queer-country recording in music history.\n\nThrough this lens, it\u2019d be a phenomenal coincidence that the song opening this essay, \u201cHits Different,\u201d would only be available on a lavender edition \u201cMidnights\u201d CD.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to allow people to read between the lines and see where things are hidden in a world that\u2019s very othering when you\u2019re LGBT,\u201d Pfeffer said.\n\nIf physical symbols such as lavender aren\u2019t convincing enough evidence that \u201cMidnights\u201d is a queer sanctuary, thematic motifs also fall upon several songs in the album. Most notably \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d which calls on the historically queer trope of leading a double life.\n\nIn the chorus of her lead single, Swift explores a battle of living between extremes, the singer\u2019s public persona \u2014 a musical sensation fans recognize \u2014 and her private life. This suggests she may be someone entirely different than the person audiences are rooting for, calling herself an \u201canti-hero.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s me, hi, I\u2019m the problem, it\u2019s me... It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero\n\nAccording to Pfeffer, a queer individual grappling with the self-doubt expressed in \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d may worry about persecution from loved ones if they were to discover that person\u2019s true identity.\n\n\u201cI felt almost like I was reading my own diary as I was listening to these songs because it so beautifully mirrored my own queer experience,\u201d Annika said.\n\nThe TikToker discovered Swift\u2019s second studio album, \u201cFearless,\u201d when she was 10 years old. She felt drawn to the queer themes uncovered in the singer\u2019s discography because of how she grew up, isolated by her sexuality in a tight-knit Mormon community in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nShe\u2019s found joy interpreting LGBTQ+ meanings in the stories Swift shares with her fans through music and social media.\n\nBut outside of seeking to better understand the queer messages Swift may be sharing through her art, Annika and Dajches found community in evaluating the singer\u2019s enigmatic songs.\n\nOther fan communities of the singer felt similar revelations through songs such as \u201cBigger Than The Whole Sky,\u201d a \u201cMidnights\u201d deluxe album (known as \u201c3am Edition\u201d) track about the heartbreaking loss of a loved one.\n\nThe lyrics of this song resonated with grieving fans, especially those who suffered from a pregnancy loss or miscarriage.\n\nIn spite of any prior evidence uncovered through the lyrics, symbols and themes of \u201cMidnights,\u201d perhaps the biggest indication that there\u2019s more to the cryptic nighttime-inspired album than what\u2019s on the surface is the final track of the deluxe \u201c3am Edition.\u201d\n\nSwift spends her final minutes implicating listeners in a direct confrontation through \u201cDear Reader,\u201d a slow, ethereal ballad built like the advice column from a newspaper.\n\nDear reader / You don\u2019t have to answer / Just \u2018cause they asked you... Dear reader / The greatest of luxuries is your secrets\n\nThrough the subsequent lyrics, \u201cI prefer hiding in plain sight,\u201d it sounds as if Swift has already shared every detail about her career, sexuality or any future goals that she plans on sharing outwardly at this time.\n\nSince Swift has never publicly denied the queer undertones in her music, fans are left to their own devices when interpreting songs.\n\n\u201cI would encourage people to open their minds to the idea that the stories that she\u2019s telling could be surrounding the queer experience,\u201d Annika said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not inherently invasive to analyze her art through that lens \u2014 art that she has willingly constructed and put out in the world to be analyzed.\u201d\n\n\u201cMidnights\u201d ends with Swift\u2019s suggestion to \u201cfind another guiding light,\u201d perhaps by seeking interpretations of her music from Annika, Dajches and other inquisitive fans \u2014 or really, anyone who isn\u2019t Taylor Swift.\n```"}

My name is Runyu Li, and I am an international student from China. I am currently in the Public Relations and Advertising program at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\n\nOn December 3, 2022, after I ate lunch with a friend while walking from Lorenzo back to campus within the USC Department of Public Safety Zone (DPS zone), I was attacked by a random stranger. It happened when I was crossing the street and noticed a tall man staring at me angrily. After we made eye contact, I tried to walk past him, but he blocked me. He then suddenly lunged towards me and punched me without warning. I had no time to react and fell to the ground. My head ached and I felt dizzy so I wasn\u2019t able to get up. I had a few scratches on my hands and arms due to the fall.\n\nMy attacker quickly left the scene, but a bystander saw what happened and helped me to my feet. After he left me, I walked to McDonald\u2019s to get a drink, but on the way, the same man who attacked me approached me while cursing. I ran away immediately. Because I still had a headache and felt dizzy, I couldn\u2019t recall what he had said to me. I ran into McDonald\u2019s and reported the incident to 911 and DPS immediately. Several police officers arrived minutes later. Two medics also came to check my condition. They determined I didn\u2019t need additional medical attention.\n\nMy initial thought after the attack is that it was just one incident triggered by mental illness. However, after reading a report from ABC 7 on an Asian man who was attacked in Koreatown during the daytime, I felt the incident was similar to my experience. I then felt that I may have been a victim of a hate crime against Asians given the spike in anti-Asian hate since 2020 due to Covid anxiety and blame. According to Stop AAPI Hate, there were more than 11,400 reported hate incidents against Asian Americans from March of 2020 to March of 2022.\n\nIronically, before the incident, I actually attended a safety knowledge learning section hosted by USC\u2019s Chinese Graduate Student Association (CGSA) and USC DPS police officers. When I think back, some tips they taught us are really useful and can even save people\u2019s lives: Students and faculty cannot bring weapons, including tasers, to campus. Students can bring pepper spray of fewer than 2.5 ounces to campus. For the pepper spray, make sure you have it somewhere that is reachable (I put it in my backpack, so I didn\u2019t have enough time to reach it when I got attacked). Practice using pepper spray somewhere safe first, so you know which direction to spray and how far your pepper spray can reach. If you encounter a suspicious person, run and call the police first (If you directly engage in a physical confrontation with the other party, not only may you be injured, but you may also be considered as over-defensive). Don\u2019t stare at your phone while you are walking, be aware of things around you while you are walking. If you decide to call the police, make sure you can describe the location as clearly as possible, so the police can find you quickly. If you see someone get attacked, please call the police, and record the video and image of the attacker. Help the victim get away from the attacker if you can.\n\nEven though USC does a lot to keep the students safe, I still feel really unsafe living near campus as an Asian student. I just want to use my story to warn people to stay safe and, especially, help stop Asian hate. I never thought I would be a victim of a violent crime. After this incident, I started to question myself \u2014 why me? Is it because of the way I look? Was it because I am Asian? Do I look weak? Is it because of my outfit? I\u2019m unsure if my attack was an anti-Asian hate crime and even though there is no doubt of the culprit\u2019s violence towards me, I also can\u2019t stop judging myself after all of this. I regretted that I could not react fast enough or wasn\u2019t strong enough to protect myself.\n\nThe DPS police officers told me that if I ever saw the man on the street in the future, I should call LAPD immediately to report it. The police officer also mentioned that the man who attacked me might suffer from mental illness, which means he would be released quickly even if they caught him. After hearing this, it only increased my fear of living in this area.\n\nSo I wonder: Can schools, DPS, and local police officers do more to protect the safety of students and faculty? Community safety issues are a long-term problem around the USC area; why has this problem never been solved? Does the school take sufficient safety measures and inform students and faculty on how to protect themselves?\n\nAfter the incident, I took the initiative to contact the police and the school doctor for help. But what about those who have been through a similar incident but haven\u2019t had the courage to seek help? Were they left to suffer in silence during and after the attack?\n\nAfter talking with several friends and family members, I feel better. I am also trying to do different things like go to museums, hang out with friends, and eat a decent meal to distract myself from the aftermath of the incident. I am trying to see the positive things in my life and catch the great moments around me. Even most of the time, when people ask me what happened, I will just answer and even make jokes about it. But deep inside my heart, it is actually painful and awkward to think about what happened.\n\nIf something similar happens to you (hopefully, it never does), I just want you to know you are not alone and that it is not your fault. Just ask for help if you need it and try to enjoy your life because you deserve it. We all do.\n```"}

There\u2019s a quiet calm that settles in once the chaotic finals season has run its course, and that creates the perfect time to sit back and watch holiday movies. We\u2019ve studied, we\u2019ve pulled all-nighters, we\u2019ve shed a tear or two from sleep deprivation and stress. Now, we get to enjoy a brief and well-earned reprieve.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you might have fallen into a pattern of watching the same holiday classics every year. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation\u201d as much as the next person, but 2022 might be the year you add a new holiday movie to your watch list. With over 150 holiday movies released this year, there are many excellent films to choose from. Here are the 10 buzziest films from this holiday season and how you can watch them.\n\nFalling for Christmas\nStreaming on Netflix\nNetflix\u2019s newest Christmas film is best when viewed in a group setting. I couldn\u2019t get through 10 minutes without shutting it off when I watched it by myself, but over Thanksgiving break, I was howling with laughter while watching it with my family. There\u2019s something about a silly group atmosphere that complements the absurdity of the film. If you\u2019re looking for a silly, brain-turned-off comedy, this is perfect. It\u2019s got over-the-top campy acting, an absurd plot and the obligatory annoying fiance we love to hate. Plus, Lindsay Lohan\u2019s back! \u201cFalling for Christmas\u201d is like a modern reboot of 1987\u2032s \u201cOverboard.\u201d Both stories are about a rich heiress who has never worked a day in her life, a falling accident that causes amnesia, and learning the value of family and meaningful work. But this film is thankfully without \u201cOverboard\u2019s\u201d very problematic aspect of the male love interest intentionally lying to her about her identity.\n\nThe Noel Diary\nStreaming on Netflix\nIf you\u2019re looking for a holiday pick-me-up, keep scrolling! This one\u2019s a tearjerker. It\u2019s quiet, restrained, down-to-earth, and possibly one of the best romances on this list. I must admit that I have been in love with Justin Hartley since he graced my screen in Smallville many, many years ago, so I may be a little biased. \u201cThe Noel Diary\u201d is about a New York Times-bestselling author, Jake, who reluctantly visits home after his estranged mother passes away. He soon meets Rachel, a woman who is just as eager to uncover her past as Jake is to get away from his. The two strangers embark on a road trip together after they discover that Jake\u2019s estranged father might be the key to unlocking Rachel\u2019s past.\n\nSpirited\nStreaming on Apple TV+\n\u201cSpirited\u201d is an imaginative retelling of \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d Ryan Reynolds plays our modern-day Scrooge as a callous PR agent who incites culture wars just to sell Christmas trees. The Ghost of Christmas Present is Will Ferrell, and the two actors have great chemistry together. Their interactions are the best part of the film. Although it might not be clear in the trailer and promotional materials for this film, it\u2019s a musical, and I was very caught off guard when the characters started singing. If you\u2019re not a fan of musicals, you might want to skip this one. There are a lot of musical numbers, and while the lyrics are creative and the performances can be fun, there were times when the story came to a grinding halt so another song could play. This broke up the pacing of the film and made it feel clunky. It\u2019s still a wholesome story and I could very easily see how musical fans could make it into their newest holiday staple. Most of my family members gave this a three out of five, and I agree.\n\nChristmas with You\nStreaming on Netflix\nThis holiday film is brimming with heart! The tired Christmas rom-com tropes that I snickered at in \u201cFalling for Christmas\u201d I actually enjoyed in \u201cChristmas with You.\u201d This movie also features a cast of Latinx actors and showcases Latinx culture, which is refreshing given that most holiday movies are overwhelmingly white. From the fantastic casting to the soundtrack to the plot, the characters\u2019 heritage is at the forefront of the film instead of an afterthought. \u201cChristmas with You\u201d features Angelina, a singing icon who is struggling to maintain her career in the music industry. Angelina\u2019s label has already snatched a younger singer and will drop the legendary star if she can\u2019t produce a Christmas hit before the holidays. To get away from it all, Angelina makes the impulsive decision to meet a young fan and grant her \u201cChristmas wish.\u201d What started as a brief escape from the cutthroat music scene and an inauthentic relationship morphs into all the inspiration and family Angelina needs to survive the holiday season.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special\nStreaming on Disney+\nThis is a must-see if you\u2019re a Marvel or \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d fan. It has the same actors, the same charm and witty, humorous dialogue as the films. To cheer up Quill, Mantis and Drax go on an important quest to bring him the Christmas gift of his dreams: Kevin Bacon. The hilarious special includes awesome moments like a band of aliens debuting the instant hit \u201cI don\u2019t know what Christmas is, but Christmastime is here,\u201d and Mantis hug-tackling a bewildered Captain America lookalike in Hollywood. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer!\n\nA Wesley Christmas\nStreaming on BET+\n\u201cA Wesley Christmas\u201d has all the staples of a fun family Christmas movie: the aunt who drinks a little more than she should, the one who can\u2019t grow up, the underrated sibling who has an amazing singing voice and more. This holiday season, it\u2019s a house full of interesting characters. The acting and comedic delivery are stellar. The film does lean into tropes a little more than I\u2019d like (for example, I\u2019m not sure that PTSD was depicted with all the nuance it requires.) However, it\u2019s a tale as old as time: nothing matters more than coming home for the holidays.\n\nViolent Night\nNow in theaters\nThis new holiday movie definitely delivers on its title. \u201cViolent Night\u201d follows Santa Claus on a gift-giving routine that has become extremely stale to the old-timer. This is soon to change, however, when a band of thieves break into a house just as Santa is dropping off presents. Then...well, the night gets extremely violent. Violent Night is a welcome departure from the typical peaceful Christmas film.\n\nA Christmas Story Christmas\nStreaming on HBO Max\nRalphie is back. \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d is one of the best Christmas classics, and the sequel lives up to the original. It\u2019s such a nostalgic film full of fun callbacks, like \u201cI triple-dog dare you!\u201d and the nightmare fuel Santa Claus slide. Several original cast members returned for the sequel, including Peter Billingsley as Ralphie and Zack Ward as Scut Farkus. Billingsley is much older now, but he still has that same goofy grin and sense of humor. Fans of the first film and newbies alike will thoroughly enjoy the silly family hijinks.\n\nScrooge: A Christmas Carol\nStreaming on Netflix\n\u201cScrooge: A Christmas Carol\u201d is a musical retelling of the Christmas story we all know and love. The story beats don\u2019t deviate much from the classic, but the animation is beautiful. I particularly loved the updated entrance of the Ghost from Christmas Past, who transforms from a candle into a ghost with a golden dress of melted wax. The film uses the art of animation to infuse the old-fashioned tale with some engaging modern visuals. This is a fun one to watch with young kiddos, siblings, nieces and nephews.\n\nThe Santa Clauses\nStreaming on Disney+\nThis one isn\u2019t technically a movie, but I had to sneak it in. \u201cThe Santa Clause\u201d franchise has become synonymous with Christmas, and for good reason. This miniseries packs in all the heart and fun we\u2019ve come to expect from its name. Tim Allen and Elizabeth Mitchell are back as Mr. and Mrs. Claus, respectively and we even get to see Eric Lloyd as grown-up Charlie. The latest Scott Calvin adventure depicts an older Claus who decides it might be time to say goodbye to his iconic job title. Before he retires, Scott must find the perfect Santa successor.\n```"}

Cricket. This time around, the story is unexpectedly set to the backdrop of a fascist Italy.\n\nPinocchio performs for Count Volpe. (Photo courtesy of the Associated Press)\n\nThis new setting is a driving element in the story, as it is even the reason for Pinocchio\u2019s creation in the first place. Geppetto\u2019s grief after losing his son during a World War I bombing drives him into a drunken frenzy, leading to the creation of the iconic character. The story follows the usual tropes: Pinocchio sets off on his own and begins working at a carnival while Geppetto is swallowed by a gargantuan sea creature when searching for Pinocchio.\n\nWhile the skeleton of the film remains quite traditional, it is the revisions to the source material that set it apart. Del Toro uses the unique time period as a vehicle to make a bold anti-war statement through the beloved children\u2019s tale. From the very start, Geppetto attempts to express to Pinocchio why war is not a good thing. War took his son away; war forces young children to experience violence at an early age; war brings death and carnage except to the boy with a borrowed soul.\n\nPinocchio is even made to be a tool for propaganda. When working under the puppet master Count Volpe, voiced by Christoph Waltz, Pinocchio dances to the tune of nationalist anthems, praising the fascist fatherland in their fight for Italy, all as small children clap and cheer, innocent to the militaristic reality.\n\nDirector Guillermo del Toro with the miniature house and models used for \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio.\u201d (Photo courtesy of the Associated Press)\n\nMost shockingly, Pinocchio is even drafted into the Royal Italian Army, under the idea of training him to become the \u201cperfect soldier\u201d after he insults Benito Mussolini (yes, that one) to his face. This leads into another crucial addition del Toro made to the story: the question of Pinocchio\u2019s mortality.\n\nDel Toro crafted a unique idea that serves the original folktale and the new adaptation immeasurably. One of the slight changes del Toro made here was having the traditional \u201cblue fairy\u201d appear as a Wood Sprite, voiced by Tilda Swinton, and portrayed in gorgeous color and character design, reminiscent of \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d with a hint of Biblically accurate angels. In this version, the Sprite has a sister: Death (also voiced by Swinton), who first greets Pinocchio when he is run over by a car. As it is revealed, Pinocchio is immortal, and simply must sit with Death in a waiting room until an hourglass runs out to be sent back to Earth, with each successive death having a longer wait than the last.\n\nGeppetto, voiced by David Bradley, with Pinocchio, voiced by Gregory Mann. (Photo courtesy of the Associated Press)\n\nThe story of Pinocchio\u2019s immortality is somber but surprisingly uplifting. A central part of many Pinocchio stories is his desire to become a \u201creal boy,\u201d a driving motivation that is not terribly present here. In its place, Pinocchio wishes only for Geppetto to be happy, and thus, a critical sequence from the film sees Pinocchio becoming a \u201creal boy,\u201d or mortal, to save his father.\n\nWhile a puppet is often viewed to be commanded by strings, del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio seems to be freer than even the humans in this world. His mere existence threatens the social fabric, creating an anomaly that sticks out among a crowd of yes-men burdened by the weight of dictatorship. Even with his ties to immortality, the boy is willing to cut those threads for the sake of those he loves.\n\nEven the film itself can be viewed as this expression of freedom. With more than enough adaptations on hand, del Toro chose to not be bound by the scripts of precedent. Instead, he used the versatility of animation to express mature themes in a tale that is meant for anyone and everyone fortunate to come across it.\n\n\u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio\u201d is now available in select theaters and is streaming on Netflix.\n```"}

It follows Charlie, played by Brendan Fraser, a 600-pound English teacher who hopes to reconnect with his estranged daughter in what he feels may be his final days. Charlie left his wife and daughter Ellie, played by Samantha Morton and Sadie Sink respectively, to pursue a relationship with a man. When their affair ended in tragedy, Charlie developed an eating disorder, supported only by his nurse Liz, played by Hong Chau. Meanwhile, an outsider perspective enters the story in the form of a young Mormon missionary named Thomas, played by Ty Simpkins.\n\nThe film is a gut-wrenching character study, showing the life of a man whose faith in humanity is unrelentless, except for in himself. The heart and soul of this work is Fraser\u2019s performance. Dubbed the \u201cBrenaissance\u201d by some fans, Fraser\u2019s comeback in recent years has been met with overwhelmingly positive support. Fraser at the 79th Venice Film Festival. He received a six-minute standing ovation at the premiere of \u201cThe Whale\u201d at the festival. (Photo courtesy of Vianney Le Caer for Invision and AP News)\n\nAfter his time as a Hollywood heartthrob in films like \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and \u201cLooney Tunes: Back in Action,\u201d Fraser seemed to vanish from the acting scene in the early 2000s. After a film executive allegedly sexually assaulted him, along as other personal struggles, his career was put on pause, with the actor taking only a few minor roles over the years. However, since around 2018, Fraser has slowly been making a comeback, notably in the comic book adaptation scene. Fraser was widely praised in the role of Robotman in the DC show \u201cDoom Patrol,\u201d and was set to appear in the now canceled \u201cBatgirl\u201d film as the villainous Firefly. \u201cThe Whale\u201d marks his first major theatrical performance in years, and he does a remarkable job in crafting a character with visceral nuance.\n\nDonning a fat suit and heavy prosthetics, Fraser exposes incredible vulnerability in playing a sickly man, making every breath sound labored and every movement a struggle. But beyond his physical look, Charlie is portrayed as a man with a deeply-rooted sadness hidden under an exterior of unadulterated optimism and hope for the people around him.\n\nSadie Sink as Ellie in \u201cThe Whale.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Niko Tavernise)\n\nEven under layers of makeup, Fraser focuses on humanizing Charlie. With the constant \u201cMoby Dick\u201d allegories, the idea of the whale holding unseen emotions can be applied to the external perceptions of Charlie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d is his default response, as he shackles the blame of his circumstances onto himself alone, while desperately wanting to see those around him maximize their potential.\n\nHowever, one of the more controversial aspects of the film is how the story treats Charlie, and the film has been hit with accusations of fatphobia because of this. While Aronofsky has addressed these comments, many critics stand by their claims. Some feel that the depiction of his obesity is borderline exploitative, hammering in a constant sense of pity the audience is supposed to feel. Every time Charlie struggles standing or gorges on food, the film seems to emphasize his difficulties and even the dirtiness of the man. Although it is crucial to provide an authentic depiction, these repetitive sequences feel as though they are attempting to wring out artificial sympathy from viewers.\n\nAt times, it feels like a routine circus act by making all of these actions a part of some animalistic show, and it takes all of Fraser\u2019s ability to ground him in real empathy. As an adaptation of a play, the film operates within the same framework, as it is set mostly in a single location with more actors moving in and out of the room versus the rooms themselves changing. While it never feels constrained in its environment, it leaves an odd taste in one\u2019s mouth by the end of it because of how abruptly it ends.\n\nHong Chau as Liz in \u201cThe Whale.\u201d (Photo courtesy of the Associated Press)\n\nThe film itself attempts to tackle a many themes, including but not limited to religion, sex and existentialism, but it never truly resolves many of them. These ideas are all shown through the conversations Charlie has with those around him, but only one of them is given proper closure. After one final discussion with Liz on the notion of the inability to \u201csave\u201d people, she simply exits without any further comment. After a long-desired reunion with his ex-wife, they share a tender moment, only for it to segue into another devastating sequence. Even his relationship with Thomas seems to end in joyous resolution before seemingly unraveling much of their connection in a single, bitter moment ending in an ellipsis.\n\nOne could argue that some stories are better left open-ended and that these sudden exits make sense in the context of a play. However, when adapted to film, they feel more like unfinished sentences than thought-provoking questions. The only relational conclusion the film works to portray is Charlie and Ellie finally reconciling after distant years. Sniffles were heard throughout the theater as Sink and Fraser provide one of the most moving and powerful moments in film this year.\n\nSimply put, \u201cThe Whale\u201d is a film that may leave one conflicted. Aronofsky\u2019s complex questions of morality push audiences into intellectual turmoil, as they are forced to confront the ideas presented in the film. Even so, there is so much explored that it may leave viewers overwhelmed, on top of the generally uneasy feeling as persistent as the fog-horn-like score heard throughout. Perhaps it is the moral ambiguity present through every character. For every redeeming quality, they are equally as sinful, ultimately subverting the clear-cut morality of most stories presented in escapist cinema.\n\nEven though the script and story never really break out of their theater bubble and may feel unsatisfying as a whole, the work is worth seeing for the remarkable performances themselves. Everyone plays their role in crafting this story, whether it be Chau\u2019s overbearing, but anxious care of Charlie, Simpkins\u2019 na\u00efve mask covering his past or Sink\u2019s dry aggression that morphs into inadvertent love. Above all, Fraser channels his many years away from the industry into an emotionally brutal performance one cannot help but be captivated by. His voice provides what the film both needs and preaches: honesty in what otherwise could have been a superficial and manipulative story of a tragic individual.\n\n\u201cThe Whale\u201d is available in select theaters starting Dec. 9, 2022.\n```"}

{"key": "/2022/12/12/new-artist-spotlight-with-dj-daily-double/", "response": "```\nA tastemaker who bonds the old to the new, DJ Daily Double, also known as Matt Garfinkel, is an anomaly in the music industry. Having worked in the music management sector throughout 2021, DJ Daily Double quickly recognized his calling to be on the stage, rather than behind it. In less than one year, he transitioned from assisting an artist to performing as the opening act for major names such as Flo Milli, JELEEL! and Rebecca Black. His career transformation is a testament to his undying work ethic, highly personable nature, and talent for making any known song feel fresh.\n\nBorn and raised in Bethesda, Maryland, Garfinkel spent his childhood hearing his parents\u2019 favorite album, S\u00e9rgio Mendes\u2019 \u201cTimeless,\u201d radiate from the living room. His roots in samba/hip-hop fusion merged with the sound of his grandfather\u2019s jazz records on Sunday afternoons in his childhood home. Adopting an immensely eclectic palette in his early years, he began to develop his own music taste with his discovery of Michael Jackson and Eminem in the third grade. While many eight-year-olds were playing with toy cars and Nerf guns, Garfinkel was walking to his friend\u2019s house daily to listen to albums on repeat. Through sharing an iCloud account with his older brother, he was also introduced to the works of Chance the Rapper and Mac Miller, which inspired him to eventually land a managerial role in the rap world.\n\nHis music taste became 100% his own when his parents gifted him an iPod in the sixth grade; young Garfinkel finally had unlimited catalogs at his fingertips. Reflecting on the time, he said that the iPod made him feel \u201cempowered to make my own decisions for the first time.\u201d Garfinkel quickly discovered which records were the ones he would play on a Sunday afternoon. When asked what defines his music taste, he smirked, \u201cI mostly developed my music taste from poking around on the internet.\u201d This search led him to artists like Joey Basa$$, Tyler, the Creator and Odd Future. His pull to these artists speaks to his love of individuality. \u201cThey\u2019re people doing cool things in hip-hop at the time, inspiring other people to be creative, to be themselves, and to do their own thing,\u201d Garfinkel said.\n\nAs an artist himself, Garfinkel echoes the individuality of these artists through his fusion of many genres. He does not want to be put in a confining musical category, as he said that would limit his artistry. Since he was raised on catalogs from across the world that span the pop, rock, jazz, samba, rap, hip-hop and dance categories, DJ Daily Double\u2019s sound is based upon the vast array he was subjected to from an early age. When asked about his genre, he simply replied: \u201cI\u2019m a DJ.\u201d\n\nGarfinkel has played many impressive events so far, with the most significant being USC\u2019s Welcome Back concert. He opened the concert and DJ Daily Double\u2019s set was highly regarded by students for weeks following his performance. A USC student newspaper, The Daily Trojan, wrote that he \u201ckicked off the concert with a set that had the crowd buzzing.\u201d He brought local rapper Sumit up to the stage and remixed top hits while hundreds, if not thousands, of students danced in sync. With this set, DJ Daily Double\u2019s future success became apparent to the students in the audience. His performance was followed by major artists JELEEL!, Rebecca Black and Flo Milli. The four artists amassed a crowd of about 6,000 people, a number that broke USC Welcome Back history.\n\nPlaying for an audience of this size highlighted the rapid growth Garfinkel has experienced since starting his act as DJ Daily Double less than a year prior to the concert. Since then, he has performed for over 8,000 people, released chopped and screwed remixes of \u201890s tracks on SoundCloud, played with local rappers and shared stages with many fellow talented artists. The secret to his success, as he said, is an authentic love for his artistry. \u201cI\u2019m following through on the dreams I had when I was younger... which is so satisfying.\u201d \n```"}

For Tippy Balady, though, the decision to turn down such an opportunity was easy. As a high school senior in Dallas she auditioned for both \u201cIdol\u201d and USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music. But she chose to attend school rather than pursue a television career.\n\n\u201cBehind the scenes of \u2018American Idol,\u2019 they have a lot of people that go out and vet artists,\u201d the singer-songwriter recounts over a soda at a campus cafe. \u201cA lot of the people that you see on TV are people that they found on Instagram ... and asked, \u2018Hey, do you want to skip the cattle call?\u2019\u201d\n\nBalady by no means is simply \u201csomeone on Instagram,\u201d though. Beginning her music career at age 15, after a long, difficult stint as a competitive figure skater (with some songwriting classes on the side for fun), she began to take her craft more seriously after producing her first song for charity with the help of her parents.\n\nThat first song, \u201cCoconut Cake,\u201d produced for a Parkinson\u2019s Foundation event, was about her grandmother. Though she notes it wasn\u2019t fantastic production-wise, as she was just getting her feet wet for the first time in releasing music, and her parents didn\u2019t have much experience in music when the song was released, it led to having an opportunity to work with more experienced producers as only a senior in high school.\n\nStraight after the song\u2019s release, she was approached by Jason Burt, a producer out of Modern Electric Studio in Dallas. Burt \u2014 just as her parents, her producer for \u201cCoconut Cake,\u201d and later on the American Idol scouts, as well as the Thornton School of Music would \u2014 saw something unique in her songwriting and style.\n\nShortly after, her next release, \u201cBegin Again,\u201d marked a more formal start to her career. The song \u2014 a slow, powerful anthem-like piece \u2014 also marked the beginning of her journey to finding and developing her sound.\n\nShe\u2019s always had a distinct, twee-like style that pervades both her music and physical presence. Drawing heavily from childlike, whimsical imagery and focusing on themes such as coming of age, a sense of whimsy is ever-present in her work.\n\nBalady\u2019s most recent music video release, \u201cAlphabet Soup,\u201d uses imagery of her and some friends dressed up as clowns, romping around the town in Texas where her grandparents live as they videotape each other on an ancient camcorder. The musician leaves a strong sense of this whimsy wherever she goes.\n\nEven on a chilly Friday morning off from school, she rolled into the coffee shop on a pair of yellow roller skates and picked out one of the more unique drink options \u2014 a ginger soda.\n\nGiven the qualities present in her music, Balady\u2019s influences include artists such as Dodie, a British singer-songwriter with a playful style similar to Balady\u2019s, and the Punch Brothers, a bluegrass-inspired band that likes to play with genre. She also cites Sarah Bareilles as an artist whose songwriting she wanted to emulate.\n\nHowever, Balady credits her time studying gospel music in Black churches back home as the place where she learned the most about singing.\n\nBalady almost treats songwriting as a game. From the time she was in songwriting camp as a kid (with a boot on each foot from figure skating injuries) to now, she draws inspiration not just from her life experiences, but from the suggestions her friends and professors give her.\n\nOftentimes, she\u2019ll write from prompts, but it could never be as simple as \u201cwrite about an experience you had.\u201d Of course, her sense of play has to be present even here.\n\n\u201cCase in point, last week, I went to a writing session that was like, \u2018I want you to write about a crow,\u2019\u201d Balady says. \u201cThen it was like, \u2018What do you mean you want me to write about a crow?\u2019 And then, I just kind of \u2014 I dunno \u2014 unfolded it from there.\u201d\n\nAnd did anything come of this tale of a crow?\n\n\u201c[I wrote a song about] being summoned by this being to come closer and come nearer to it. And it turns out, it\u2019s more about an unhealthy relationship, the darkness of the wings,\u201d she said.\n\nJumping into her more current projects, Balady remembers something she wanted to say about her influences.\n\n\u201cI forgot to mention one thing: I\u2019m also very influenced by musicals. Sondheim is a huge influence,\u201d she says.\n\nIn addition to admiring Sarah Bareilles\u2019 traditional songwriting, Balady had seen her Broadway show, Waitress, and was also inspired by her musical theater writing. So much so that Balady is hoping, with the help of some people in the school of Cinematic Arts, to write and produce her own musical.\n\nNot just any premise, either \u2014 Balady wants to write an \u201880s slasher musical.\n\nAfter seeing Waitress, Balady says, \u201cI [didn\u2019t] even know that that was an option for me. It didn\u2019t even pop into my head. And so since then, I\u2019ve been like, \u2018How can I do this?\u2019\u201d\n\nBalady acknowledges as only a college student working on her own, and as someone with not a lot of education in composing or musical theater structure, she may not have the means right now to make a musical come to fruition. Even so, it seems that she\u2019s accepted her lack of understanding of the genre and taken it as a challenge \u2014 and the thrill she might get from learning how to do it well might be euphoric.\n\n\u201c[Having the means and] being able to actually do the form and then me being able to make the music on top of that \u2014 which, out of everything, that\u2019s what I\u2019m the most interested in anyway \u2014 that is the most freeing and liberating experience,\u201d Balady says.\n\nOne project of hers that is much closer to releasing, though, is titled \u201cTaming of a Wendy Bird.\u201d Aptly for Balady, it takes themes (and its name) from Peter Pan and explores the \u201cgrowing pains\u201d and mundanity of life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the growing pains that we experience in our lives and the little things that we have to deal with ... that are more nuanced and people just don\u2019t necessarily talk about,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cLike, I have this song called \u2018Quite Frankly,\u2019 and it\u2019s about not being able to get rid of images of old friends on your walls ... You have some sort of connection to it, but you know that you should throw it away.\u201d\n\nOf course, for the music video she has planned for the song\u2019s release, Balady wants everyone to dress as pirates.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s just like, This is your life. This is me in a nutshell. This is my little core of songwriting and it encapsulates a very important and imperative moment in my life.\u201d```"}

That is until friends Susan Kounlavongsa, Abby Yingtong Wu and Zo\u00e9 Blue M learned to play. Together, they are now \u201cMahjong Mistresses.\u201d\n\nWhat started as a small idea \u2014 an event where they could teach the game to friends \u2014 quickly became much bigger. By the time that the Mahjong Mistress event rolled around on Oct. 1, of this year, the group had received an influx of over 200 RSVPs. They didn\u2019t believe so many people would even care about Mahjong, but little did they know that groups in the same vein were cropping up from San Diego, to Oakland to New York.\n\nMahjong is an ancient game that\u2019s never truly lost its hold on people, but it gained a reputation of being for older generations \u2014 along the lines of bocce or shuffleboard. So how did Mahjong find itself a mini-zeitgeist in the Asian creative space?\n\nLin and Kounlavongsa go way back. They met in LA through their shared interests in food and music, Kounlavongsa is studio manager of the NTS Radio LA station, where the group held its first teaching session. The pair later met Yingtong Wu, also in the music business working at 88Rising as a producer. Blue M is the most recent introduction into the fold after they all met at Little Tokyo Table Tennis, a weekly event that\u2019s mission is aligned with Mahjong Mistress\u2019 and has brought the LA Asian community together.\n\nLin taught each of her friends how to play Mahjong. They each had some experience or memories tied to the game but never a chance to play. Although they were all taught Taiwanese Mahjong, they each come from different Asian backgrounds. Kounlavongsa is Laotian. Yingtong Wu is the youngest and grew up in Hong Kong before moving to New York and settling in LA for her job. She then found herself quickly embedded into its Asian creative scene. Blue M is a Japanese American fine artist who was recently featured in the Jeffrey Deitch gallery for her group work, \u201cWonder Women.\u201d Finally there is Lin, Taiwanese, who works with Light in the Attic Records and her own label, Pure Person Press.\n\nThey each shared a desire to cultivate a healthier Asian American community in LA. After witnessing the success of the Little Tokyo Table Tennis league they realized that they could do that through Mahjong by activating a playful spirit in the community. And, yes, they all learned Taiwanese Mahjong, but what the group found so valuable about the game was its widespread popularity all throughout the world. There is Chinese Mahjong, Taiwanese Mahjong, Korean Mahjong, among others, all of which are incredibly complex. Variations on aspects like tile organization and tile amount distinguish each culture\u2019s gameplay.\n\nThe US\u2019 history dates back to the early 20th century when a Mahjong fad spread across the country. Notably, a good percentage of the country\u2019s Jewish population has maintained its relationship with the game. That same strength leaves the game vulnerable to misappropriation, however. Most recently, \u201cThe Mahjong Line\u201d of tiles was released to the disappointment of many within the Asian community, but the issue was tied not simply to the concept of appropriation, but in the company\u2019s advertising, which completely erased Mahjong\u2019s roots in Asian cultures.\n\nLin said, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something where just like any other game it all comes from somewhere. But [the point of] a game is being there and having a good time,\u201d but she did feel that nuance was required for the situation. She continued, \u201cSo many people forwarded me that when it first happened. That\u2019s fucking gross because- it\u2019s not their game, and it\u2019s not theirs to introduce. It\u2019s not theirs to capitalize on. That\u2019s what it was...obviously a money grab.\u201d\n\nThe Mahjong Mistresses members position their event as cultural exchange, a way to invite people to learn about their culture in a respectful environment that also enriches the community. Oct. 1 was the chilliest evening in a while. In true LA fashion I had to park several blocks away from the NTS studio in the Pico-Union neighborhood of LA. I walked in silence, brimming with anticipation and excitement \u2014 I don\u2019t get out much \u2014 before arriving 15 minutes later. I took a deep breath on the corner and walked in, feeling intimidated by the people around me, thinking they were so cool. It felt as though I had unknowingly walked into a street fashion photo shoot.\n\nI met up with Lin and she brought me to a table pre-populated by three strangers \u2014 we were ready to start. Or, we would be. Whenever we figured out how to. The girl next to me drank wine out of the bottle while I sipped on a Thai tea cocktail, one of the many Asian-inspired drinks they had available that night. I tried my best to follow along with the directions as Lin instructed us, but I had no idea what I was doing. We rolled the dice as retro Asian pop played in the background over the sounds of tiles clacking. I ran my fingers across their embossed designs while my table exchanged their experiences with Mahjong, of which there were few. I did not win, but that was okay. It was nice to hold the hefty pieces in my hands and talk to the strangers about life.\n\nThe event wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the help provided by friends of the self-proclaimed Mahjong Mistresses. Kounlavongsa was able to organize the space, Jess Wang of Gu Grocer y provided Taiwanese snacks, David Linchen designed their flier and photos were taken by Jeffrey Tang. That\u2019s just a few among the many collaborators that the group found in their network of Asian professionals. It was incredible to see so many successful people of color collaborating on an event that\u2019s only purpose was to be fun.\n\nSpeaking before the event, Lin gave context for the gameplay: \u201cIt stops being about winning and more about conserving your own power so that nobody else wins.\u201d It was difficult to prepare for how difficult learning Mahjong would be, I had no experience reading Chinese and the \u201cdumbed down\u201d rules were still confusing, but it was still fun \u2014 between the \u201cMistresses\u201d walking between each table to guide players, the useful mini-guides they made and learning with a table of strangers.\n\nThe others playing at my table agreed with Lin\u2019s hypothesis about the Mahjong zeitgeist, \u201cPeople are realizing like, Hey, this is like a sick game. Why don\u2019t we spend time to go back and re-examine what this game is and what it\u2019s about and explore cultural roots. Which is happening all around the Asian art scene \u2014 wanting to go back to your roots.\u201d\n\nAlan Chen and Jenn Lui own Baba\u2019s House in Oakland, which opened last November. Lui, who grew up playing Mahjong with her family every weekend, was looking for a way to incorporate her culture into the den inside of their multi-purpose space that also boasts a restaurant curated by AC Boral, an Asian snack shop and a media room. We spoke on Zoom and she recounted falling in love with the sight of the tile set on the table, just as customers looking to book the room found themselves not knowing what to play. For their first event they had two tables ready to play, but needed at least two more. Lui and Chen\u2019s parents saved the day and offered their very own sets.\n\nDescribing her parents\u2019 set she said: \u201cThey\u2019ve had it for probably a decade now. It\u2019s random. It\u2019s sparkly and purple on top,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe other table is actually Alan\u2019s, my partner at the shop. It\u2019s his mom\u2019s little traveling Mahjong table. So it\u2019s really cool. It actually looks like a briefcase. And then you can open it and put the legs in.\u201d The grandpa of a close friend of theirs even loaned his set to play with. These contributions made the event that much more special to Lui and Chen.\n\nLui offered a crash course on Mahjong before letting guests try for themselves. She said that of the 20 people who showed up, only three of them knew how to play the game before going to Baba\u2019s House. The group itself was diverse, with Lui saying, \u201cPeople learn some things. That was exciting, a lot of folks of different ethnic ethnicities showed up. For sure we had a range. It wasn\u2019t all Chinese folks. It was a mixture of Asian and white and Black.\u201d\n\nChen says that the space itself \u2014 luscious dark red walls, shiny golden mural, and Mahjong tables \u2014 is appealing enough to make customers curious. He\u2019s also pretty sure that the Mahjong scene from \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d played a role in the uptick in Mahjong interest. The difficulty of Mahjong makes gatekeeping it unnecessary to in Chen\u2019s eyes: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a complicated game if no one teaches you,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re just sitting around watching people play, it\u2019s really hard to figure out\u201d \u2014 meaning that like most games, if you\u2019re willing to learn, you will be allowed to play.\n\nMahjong specifically demands cultural exchange. For traditional sets, at least, you need to learn at least the numbers one through nine in Chinese. Despite having huge cultural importance, it\u2019s also worth noting that Mahjong is a gambling game without the same kind of significance as clothing or hairstyles. Teaching Mahjong is as, if not more, important than the component of cultural exchange.\n\nThe revitalization of Mahjong is helping a new generation of Asians and Asian Americans feel reconnected to their heritage. Says Lui: \u201cTo be able to see people and folks of our generation play and have a laugh, and have such a great time, really brings me back to that space of a happy home. My parents, they were hard workers. And so to see them with their friends, laughing and being sassy with each other, was a really, really beautiful time.\u201d\n\nBaba\u2019s House continues to hold monthly Mahjong nights which are streamed on Twitch. The Mahjong Mistress group will be holding a semi-private event this December 11 teaching another lucky group about the intricacies of their hobby. Both organizers continue to champion the beauty of their heritage one tile at a time.\n```"}

Some lit and filled with wax, others empty, charcoaled black from the burning wicks. They outnumber the years Moreno lived. \u201cRIP ACE\u201d is spray painted on the curb. A dinosaur-shaped mirror has been nailed to the wooden utility pole. Rounding out the memorial is a bag of Lay\u2019s Barbeque chips, a Modelo beer can, a bottle of Corona, and a large plastic bottle of strawberry melon Brisk.\n\nIn the first half of 2022, the city of Los Angeles recorded 181 homicides, on track to exceed the nearly 400 homicides reported last year. Boyle Heights, where Moreno lived his whole life and died, had the third highest homicide rates in the whole city, behind Vermont Knolls at second and downtown Los Angeles at first. The night that Moreno died, three others also lost their lives in L.A. County.\n\nThis is the story of one man, in the wrong place at the wrong time, killed by gunfire. The details in this account come from Moreno\u2019s family and friends that were there the night he died. LAPD has yet to provide Annenberg Media with a requested copy of the police report. Much of that night is a mystery, but what is clear is Moreno left an impact on his community and a legacy of an infectious smile gone too soon.\n\nMoreno, who would have turned 24 next year on Valentine\u2019s Day, grew up in Boyle Heights with two sisters and two older brothers. They lived in a pink house on Wabash Street for 10 years, and he played basketball with his sister Maricarmen Moreno in Wabash Park.\n\nHe lived his whole life in Boyle Heights - attending Evergreen Elementary School, Belvedere Middle School and rotating between three high schools. Moreno was born with hemipelagic cerebral palsy and lived with the condition for his 23 years of life. He struggled with academics, said his mom, Blanca Patricia Sanchez. \u201cYour son is very smart,\u201d she remembered teachers telling her, \u201che just doesn\u2019t want to learn.\u201d\n\nMoreno worked on construction sites with his dad since he was in high school. He wanted to be an X-ray technician, but dropped out in the final semester of 12th grade, leaving him with few options. So, he carried cement buckets with his dad. It was tough work, his older sister, Kimberly Vasquez, remembered. It motivated him to get another job working as a security guard.\n\nOn September 16, Moreno spent the whole day working construction with his dad, Efrain Moreno Galindo. In the afternoon, Galindo fell from a ladder and Moreno took him to the hospital. By the time the long day had reached 9 p.m., Moreno hadn\u2019t had any food. That\u2019s why he kept texting his longtime friend, Fernando Aguilera. \u201cHe was hungry. That whole day he was bugging me,\u201d Aguilera recalled.\n\nHis favorite was Jack-in-the-Box, and Moreno ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken strips combo, and then headed to the 2500 block of Folsom to a friend\u2019s house. A dinosaur mirror, deflated balloons, posters for a fundraising car wash, and a portrait of Moreno adorn the light pole where the car he was driving crashed into on the fatal night.\n\nBlue, yellow and white houses encircle the intersection at Folsom and Mott streets. Aguilera, who was in the car when Moreno was shot, explained that the turn at the intersection is a little off. \u201cYou need to go pretty wide to make it work,\u201d Aguilera said. Moreno, driving his mom\u2019s car, asked his friend for his sandwich. Aguilera said no and told him to park first since they were less than a block from their destination.\n\nIn the intersection, Moreno honked twice at a car that was about to hit his burgundy Honda Accord. In response, gunshots rang out. Moreno\u2019s foot hit the gas pedal and the car sped west down Folsom Street. Aguilera wasn\u2019t wearing his seatbelt and put his arms over his head as he prepared himself for impact. After the crash, he felt hot all over and began checking himself for blood. \u201cLuckily, I was good,\u201d he said.\n\nAguilera got out of the car on the cool September night. He ran to the other side of the car to check on Moreno. His friend wasn\u2019t moving. He had been shot in the back of his head behind his left ear. Aguilera sent a text message in a group chat that changed everything. Multiple neighbors came out of their houses to see what happened. Many tried to call the police, but were not able to get through, according to Aguilera. He said the police and ambulance didn\u2019t arrive for 15 minutes, despite the Hollenbeck Community Police Station being less than a mile from Folsom and Mott.\n\nMoreno lived with his mom down the street from where he died. They shared a one-bedroom apartment hidden behind a beauty salon and a cobbler. The front door opens to Sanchez\u2019s bed on the left, the kitchen straight ahead, a bathroom on the far left, and Moreno\u2019s room down the hallway on the right.\n\nHis dream was to get his mom out of Los Angeles. \u201cMom, we\u2019re gonna get out of here,\u201d she remembers him saying. In an interview alternating between Spanish and English, Sanchez said her son visited her after seeing his dad at the hospital that night. Moreno quickly went home to use the bathroom. \u201cClose the door,\u201d Sanchez remembers saying. She had just come home from her dialysis treatment and was exhausted.\n\n\u201cHe loved food, huh. He would always be out with his friends eating,\u201d his youngest sister, Maricarmen Moreno, said. Cheeks, Rex, T-Rex, cacheton, cupid and dinosaur were among the many nicknames his family and friends had for him. \u201cDinosaur, where is my tree house? You promised me you\u2019re going to be in my tree house,\u201d said Gloria Hern\u00e1ndez, one of Moreno\u2019s childhood friends. He had promised her to make the tree house since she was a little girl.\n\nOmar Gonzalez, who described their friendship as \u201can everyday thing,\u201d remembers the rotating mix of restaurants the two would frequent. Moreno introduced Gonzalez to Korean barbecue, which quickly became their favorite. Gonzalez is 29 and always looked at Moreno as a younger brother. Gonzalez said he was not exaggerating when estimating the two hung out every single day for four years. They had lost touch, but had just reconnected the weekend before and made plans to get Korean barbecue. He would not get a chance to say goodbye.\n\nGonzalez was at his home when his group chat lit up with the text. \u201cHe got a headshot,\u201d it read. Angry, he called his friends looking for more information. A wooden cross dangles from a framed portrait of Moreno nailed to the utility pole next to Moreno\u2019s shrine.\n\n\u201cI just remember, I just stood standing in my restroom window for, like an hour and a half calling different people just, like, maybe someone will tell me otherwise. The next day, I remember, I just passed through that shit, honestly, it made me sick to my stomach. He didn\u2019t deserve that, man. He was really good kid.\u201d\n\nThe LAPD believes the incident to be gang-related, according to officials quoted in the Boyle Heights Beat days after the shooting. The shooter fled the scene on September 16 and the case remains an ongoing investigation, LAPD PIO Officer Rosario Cervantes wrote in an email. Aguilera said neither party was affiliated with local gangs.\n\nVasquez clearly remembered her mom calling her crying with the news. As she drove to her mom\u2019s house, \u201cI just was thinking it\u2019s not him, you know, it\u2019s an accident. They got mistaken.\u201d Sanchez said she hasn\u2019t had a full night of sleep since her son died. She said it is a bit easier after her dialysis treatment because she is so tired.\n\nAll of Moreno\u2019s belongings are still down the hall from where Sanchez tries to get some rest. \u201cOnce I\u2019m here alone, I get really lonely and I cry,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI know that if I\u2019m here one or two days alone, I\u2019m just going to get really depressed.\u201d\n\nAguilera hasn\u2019t slept much either. He said he feels bad because Moreno just wanted his sandwich. \u201cThere\u2019s days I can\u2019t sleep. It just comes back to me you know. We were just hungry,\u201d Aguilera remembered.\n\nMoreno\u2019s funeral was held on October 18 at the Sepultura Rose Hills Cemetery. A GoFundMe, started by Vasquez, and a car wash organized by his friends, helped pay for funeral expenses. The car wash raised more than $8,000, with donations of money and food from community members.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nDecember 08, 2022 at 12:28 am PST\n\nIt only took USC 15 seconds to secure a lead against Cal State Fullerton, a lead the Trojans would not surrender throughout the game. A skyhook by redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan sparked a 14-0 run to start the game, which mirrored the final score of 64-50. The fast start was a team effort as all five starters scored after just 3:02 in the game, punctuated by a 3-pointer from senior guard Boogie Ellis. Titans senior guard Tory San Antonio finally scored a three after 5:12 of gameplay, but the Trojan defense would remain strong throughout the game.\n\n\u201cOur defense has been really good,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cOur players play hard. They know where to be defensively and they cover for each other.\u201d\n\nThe Trojan defense held Cal State Fullerton to a 32.8% field goal percentage throughout the game and gave up a season-low 50 points. Throughout the game, the defense forced Cal State Fullerton into bad shots and created turnovers.\n\n\u201cWe played hard on defense,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe challenged them using our size and length.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s offense was a different story, playing streaky in the first half after the fast start. They only scored 15 points in the last 15 minutes of the first half, allowing the Titans to crawl back to 29-21 at halftime.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make a lot of shots when we were wide open,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe had 16 assists, that number could have easily been 23 or 24.\u201d\n\nIn the first half, the Trojans only shot 38.7% from the field, despite starting five for seven.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d fifth year guard Drew Peterson said. \u201cWe\u2019re chipping away at things that can make us better every day. We just missed a lot of shots.\u201d\n\nUSC settled in on offense during the second half, shooting 48% from the field, and built their lead back up to cruise to a win. Freshman guard Tre White was the largest offensive bright spot for the Trojans, scoring a career-high 16 points. His previous high was 11 points against Tennessee on Nov. 24, which he matched by the end of tonight\u2019s first half after making five of his six shots from the field.\n\n\u201c[My comfort level] grows every day,\u201d White said. \u201cI just wanna thank my teammates. They keep swinging it to me and I\u2019m just executing.\u201d\n\nWhite was just one of the true freshmen who had a significant impact on the game. Freshman forward Kijani Wright played more than 15 minutes in place of redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan, who Enfield said had an off-night.\n\n\u201cJosh has been very valuable,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe just wasn\u2019t playing as well tonight as he has been lately.\u201d\n\nWright may not have lit up the stat sheet, recording six points and one rebound, but he played solid defense against Titans\u2019 senior forward Vincent Lee to help the Trojan defensive effort.\n\nEven with the streaky offensive performance, Enfield has seen the progression of his young squad throughout the season.\n\n\u201cWe have guys that have never been relied upon to do what they\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating at times, but our players have improved.\u201d\n\nEnfield singled out sophomore forward Kobe Johnson, who now has back-to-back double-digit scoring performances.\n\n\u201cKobe Johnson was a role player last year, he played seven or eight minutes,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cNow you see him starting to improve as a player and fill up the stat sheet.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will need their young core to continue to develop as their home matchup against No. 11 Auburn looms on Dec. 18. USC will have one more game against Long Beach State on Dec. 14 to prepare for their ranked opponent.\n```"}
{"key": "/2022/12/07/the-university-of-california-cant-intimidate-its-way-out-of-the-graduate-worker-strike/", "response": "```\nThe University of California could have prevented its largest labor crisis at the bargaining table. Instead, as professors cancel lectures due to teaching assistant shortages, lab sections pause crucial lessons and undergraduate assignments go ungraded, the university\u2019s pattern of intimidation and foot-dragging becomes less a tactic and more a liability in negotiating against 48,000 striking graduate workers \u2014 the university\u2019s backbone for all day-to-day curricular activities.\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest ever strike of academic workers has been a long time coming, according to Michael Dean, a seventh-year doctoral candidate in history at University of California Los Angeles  \u2014 not only because the university has stalled open negotiations since March 2021, but also because it has engaged in numerous illegal negotiation tactics with the four union bargaining units.\n\n\u201cRather than come to the bargaining table and negotiate with us, the university has decided to engage in a variety of unlawful tactics at the bargaining table, \u2018\u2019 said Dean, a lead member of the United Auto Workers unit 2865 bargaining committee. \u201cRefusing to negotiate in good faith, refusing to provide us with the information that we need in order to bargain \u2014 that we have the right to ask for \u2014 in order to bargain unilaterally.\u201d\n\nWhen Dean first moved to Westwood in 2016 to attend UCLA, he paid 69% of his paycheck back to the university in the form of rent. The average UC graduate worker earns $24,000 a year, according to the UAW. \u201cCurrently, many of us pay 50, 60, 70, even higher than 75 to 80% of our income [in rent],\u201d Dean said.\n\nUnder the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act, employers must meet various legal obligations when bargaining with unions. The Student Researchers UAW Union has filed 37 charges through the Public Employment Relations Board, alleging labor violations such as abrupt policy changes outside of bargaining, refusal to share necessary information and direct survey of unit members about policies under negotiation. As of Dec. 6, PERB has officially recognized 15 of these charges against the UC as unlawful labor practices.\n\nDean said the UAW submitted nearly 150 information requests from the UC to create reasonable proposals about nonresident tuition, housing subsidies, transit costs, dependent healthcare and childcare programs. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out, what impact is this [policy] going to have on the university if we were to waive this? What do they cost? How are those costs decided? How many people are taking advantage of them?\u201d Dean said. \u201cAnd the university just refused to provide information on most of them.\u201d\n\nAhmed Akhtar, a sixth year doctoral candidate and student worker in the physics department at UC San Diego, has been organizing with the Student Researchers United UAW union since 2017. As elected bargaining team representative for SRU-UAW, Akhtar represents 17,000 researchers that perform experiments, collect data and do the work that makes the UC a prestigious research institution.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like [the university] respects our time,\u201d Akhtar said, adding that negotiation representatives from UC Labor Relations have frequently been late to bargaining sessions and spoken condescendingly to unit members. Protective measures against racial discrimination, sexual harassment and faculty bullying in the workplace, proposed by Akhtar and his colleagues at SRU-UAW, had all been halted in negotiation due to the university\u2019s abstentions, said Akhtar.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason 96% of union members voted in favor of a strike. \u201cIt really is in contrast to the university\u2019s stated position of caring about equity and diversity, being a progressive force for social change,\u201d Akhtar said. \u201cIf the UC wants to be seen as a truly public institution, it has to make itself accessible to people from middle class backgrounds.\u201d\n\nAccording to the  SRU-UAW , the UC has tried to intimidate union workers at least eight separate times. On Nov. 23, the union  reported  that after a UC San Diego student emailed other graduate students to rally support for a letter to the chemistry department leadership, one professor called for the student\u2019s firing and another personally emailed him, saying \u201cit\u2019s important that you...not engage any further in any form or shape on the issues surrounding your letter.\u201d\n\nIn  October , union members at UCSF \u201cwitnessed...a recently-tenured UCSF faculty member angrily ripping down all the UAW posters,\u201d which was repeated at least four times thereafter. The UC repeatedly weaponizes graduate workers\u2019 dual status as degree-earning students. Over the past several months, it has threatened to fail, penalize and dismiss grades or course credits if workers participate in union activity.\n\nOn the first day of the strike, the UCSD chemistry department\u2019s vice chair threatened that student-employees who stop work \u201cbecause of the strike\u201d may receive an unsatisfactory grade in two required courses,  reported  the union. At UCLA, the School of Music Dean Eileen. L Strempel  emailed  graduate students saying \u201cthere is no protection\u201d for students who choose to strike, and that \u201c[a]ll students\u201d should attend class or else \u201cthe professor should penalize them.\u201d\n\nIn response to the UAW\u2019s Nov. 14 notice to strike, leadership at the UC Santa Cruz engineering department  emailed  workers stating that \u201cthe right to withhold labor does not apply to academic work\u201d if courses are involved. But, the only reason for workers to enroll in these courses is to perform work as researchers and teaching assistants.\n\nAt UC Davis, UC Graduate Program Coordinator Amanda Turner  threatened  to revoke workers\u2019 financial aid if they continued to strike. The HEERA clearly  establishes  that universities cannot threaten the right to unionize or withhold labor by interfering with the student portion of their dual status. Their work, roles and achievements as students and employees are one and the same.\n\nAs the strike continues into its fourth week, Dean said the UC still refuses a 14% salary increase that would account for basic inflation rates and rising rent in California. \u201cThey\u2019ve offered us a 7% [increase] in the first year, followed by 3% every year after,\u201d Dean said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even close to [the cost of living]\u201d increase  and  inflation  rate this year.\n\nThe UAW\u2019s proposal, Dean emphasized, asks for only 3% of the university\u2019s total budget to compensate the entire graduate workforce. \u201cUndergraduate tuition is one of the largest portions of the overall budget,\u201d said Tobias Higbie, a professor of labor studies and history at UCLA. \u201cIt\u2019s circulating around the university to pay for education, but also to pay for beautiful gymnasiums and dormitories and other things like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like a private school, [UC] has to appeal to those tuition-paying families so that they feel like they\u2019re getting their value in coming to UCLA,\u201d Higbie added. That\u2019s likely why the university dismissed and delayed negotiations until three weeks ago, when the UAW strike infiltrated its front-facing operation across media coverage of all 10 campuses.\n\n\u201cThe UC recognizes that an academic worker strike would hurt their branding and messaging as a socially progressive force in California,\u201d Akhtar said. \u201cIf its core mission is doing the cutting edge research of an elite educational institution, you can\u2019t do that without teaching assistants, student workers and staff.\u201d\n\nLast Tuesday, postdoctoral workers and researchers reached a tentative agreement with the university, raising the minimum annual pay for full-time positions from about $55,000 to $70,000 or higher, including a $12,000 raise by next October. The agreement, which applies to roughly 12,000 of the total 48,000 UC graduate workers in the union, represents the first major step forward in a nearly 20-month stalemate at the bargaining table.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to have reached agreements that address the soaring cost of living, and reflect the value of our contributions at UC,\u201d said Neal Sweeney, president of UAW unit 5810, in a statement. \u201cThese agreements represent a new, best-in-class model that will improve quality of life \u2014 and the quality of research \u2014 for scientists across the U.S.\u201d\n\nDean said the bargaining units have also made historical agreements about bullying and harassment in the workplace. But, the UC and UAW remain far apart on major policy proposals, including compensation, that could signal an end to the strike.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be ready and willing to consider fair proposals, whenever the university wants to make them,\u201d Dean said. \u201cBut so far, the university hasn\u2019t been making fair or reasonable proposals on the core issues.\u201d\n\nFor Higbie, who bore witness to public divestment from academic workers in California since the late 60s, the UAW strike culminates both the UC\u2019s unlawful practices and larger neoliberal failures in modern American society.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic, the global financial crisis, student loan debt, the climate crisis \u2014 it feels as though there are multiple overlapping things hitting us all at once, and it\u2019s beyond any individual\u2019s ability to deal with,\u201d Higbie said. \u201cSo I do think there is a change in attitude, especially among younger people, towards the idea of a labor movement.\u201d\n\nAs final exams approach and graduate workers stick to their picket lines, Dean and Akhtar remain confident that the UC can no longer intimidate their way out of the labor movement they helped create.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nDecember 06, 2022 at 10:27 pm PST\n\nFor a team with more newcomers than returners, most would expect a slow start to the season. It takes time for teammates to establish rapport with each other, coaches to identify players\u2019 abilities and schemes to strengthen and prosper. But USC women\u2019s basketball seems ahead of that typical development curve.\n\nThe Trojans continued their perfect start to the season on Tuesday night at Galen Center, thumping San Jos\u00e9 State 71-44 to advance to 9-0. Even USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb has been surprised by how well her seven transfers have immediately adapted to their new team, as each of them had at least one field goal, rebound, assist and steal against the Spartans.\n\nAfter all, it makes sense that players make each other better when each can seemingly do a little bit of everything. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun to see that we have a lot of complementary parts,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress to try and get as good as we can be, but I think that\u2019s been encouraging.\u201d\n\nA lot of that comes down to defensive intensity, as Gottlieb remarked that her team was mad even though it gave up just 44 points to San Jos\u00e9 State. But that\u2019s partly how USC has vaulted itself to the No. 3 scoring defense in the country, allowing just 47.9 points per game after Tuesday\u2019s game.\n\nThe Spartans\u2019 offense surprisingly started out on the stronger foot, as San Jos\u00e9 State jumped out to a 10-5 lead in the first quarter. Heading into the game, the matchup of the elite USC defense against the San Jos\u00e9 State offense seemed lopsided, as the Spartans are 332nd of 350 teams in field goal percentage at 33.5%. That end of the court wasn\u2019t necessarily the issue for USC early on, though, as the Trojans would still go on to hold the Spartans without a field goal for the last five minutes of the first quarter.\n\nInstead, it was the Trojans\u2019 continued nemesis this season that limited them to just a 12-11 lead after the first quarter: turnovers. The Spartans\u2019 ability to force turnovers was their primary advantage on paper for the game, as their 21.7 forced turnovers per game (30th in the country) matched up well against a USC team that is susceptible to giveaways. Sure enough, the Trojans turned it over five times in the opening quarter, preventing their offense from establishing much early rhythm.\n\n\u201cWe knew [San Jos\u00e9 State] wants to pressure ... I think we\u2019re capable of clamping down and being a little more disciplined,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI thought our decisions got better ... Sometimes it\u2019s even just doing the simple thing to make the play will cut down on the turnovers.\u201d\n\nBut once USC started to take care of the ball, it began to find the bottom of the net much more frequently in the second quarter. Graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, the Trojans\u2019 leading scorer on the year with 16.4 points per game, led the way on offense with 11 first-half points. The Minnesota transfer had an expanded task due to the absence of sophomore forward Rayah Marshall, who missed her second straight game after suffering an injury against Cal Baptist on Nov. 30.\n\nAnd as the USC defense continued to dominate, a 14-0 run ensued, giving the home side a 10-point lead. Gottlieb\u2019s varied defensive schemes, from a 2-3 zone to a full-court press, caused issues for the Spartans offense, and six different Trojans recorded a steal in the first half alone. San Jos\u00e9 State recorded just seven points in the second quarter, while USC\u2019s offensive improvement helped it build a 34-18 lead going into the half.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 ball movement was a primary reason for that boost on offense, as USC recorded 21 assists on 26 made field goals for the game. Senior guard Alyson Miura passed particularly well with a team-high five assists; she had only nine on the season prior to Tuesday\u2019s game. She also knocked down two threes, including one midway through the third quarter that permanently pushed the Trojans\u2019 lead to a 20-point margin.\n\n\u201cCoach [Gottlieb] does a great job of reiterating \u2014 especially at halftime \u2014 that we\u2019re a better team when we share the ball, and when we try to find the best shot on the court every time,\u201d junior forward Koi Love said.\n\nMeanwhile, San Jos\u00e9 State continued to have nothing going offensively. By the end of the third quarter, just two Spartans had made multiple field goals, and they were shooting 22.7% from the field as a team. With USC\u2019s leading rebounder Marshall out, the Spartans\u2019 best source of points was via second chances, where they outscored the Trojans 16-0.\n\nAfter the game, Sissoko and Love were both self-critical about the team\u2019s effort on boxing out and preventing offensive boards, noting the need to improve before the Trojans\u2019 next game: a clash against No. 13 UCLA.\n\nBut this game was still all USC in the second half. Sissoko continued to be the primary offensive weapon, finishing with a game-high 17 points on 7-for-12 shooting. But it was a true team effort behind her, as seemingly every Trojan put up crooked numbers all over the stat sheet.\n\nJunior guard Kayla Williams started out slowly shooting the ball but finished strong by making three of her last five threes. She also finished in double digits with 11 points, including a saucy, straight-up step back from deep that extended the game\u2019s margin to 63-32 USC with about six minutes to go.\n\nAfter a short break for finals, USC is already looking ahead to that aforementioned rivalry game against the Bruins next week, which will take place at Galen Center on Dec. 15 at 7 p.m. UCLA, which currently stands at 8-1, will be the toughest test this far for the Trojans, who will be looking to continue their best start since 2015-16.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve made a ton of steady growth,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging because I still think we have a huge growth trajectory. It\u2019s a really fun group to coach ... We\u2019re still continuing to grow that chemistry of how we work together to slot new players.\u201d```"}

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Adam Jasper December 06, 2022 at 9:23 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say this weekend was one of the worst sporting weekends of my life. I sat in a pub in Las Vegas early Saturday morning running on three hours of sleep. The night before, I witnessed USC football\u2019s demise in the Pac-12 Championship Game \u2014 and as the final whistle sounded, my sporting spirit dipped about as low as it ever had before. The United States were knocked out of the World Cup.\n\nAfter observing the proper mourning period after the USMNT\u2019s 3-1 loss to the Netherlands, I\u2019m here to share my thoughts on the campaign. The defeat in the Round of 16 sucked the air out of rooms around the nation. The hope and optimism kindling amongst the USMNT faithful was succinctly snuffed out. It hurts knowing it\u2019ll be another three and half years before we see the U.S. on the biggest world stage again. It hurts knowing the talented roster of American newcomers had what it took to pull off an upset. It hurts knowing the upset never came.\n\nBut, in the end it was deserved. The Dutch had the U.S. beat in most facets of the game, and the most clear distinction was in energy. You could see the Americans\u2019 legs failing as the game went on, and a well-rested Netherlands team took advantage of a few defensive lapses in concentration. The writing was on the wall after a grueling group stage. After squandering three points against Wales and grinding out a draw against England, the U.S. had to cling on for dear life in their 1-0 win over Iran. There was little energy left in the tank by the time the knockouts came around.\n\nIt really makes you think what could\u2019ve been had the U.S had more depth, or more aptly, if they had utilized their existing depth. Manager Gregg Berhalter is to blame. Now, this isn\u2019t going to be some scathing cry for Berhalter to be fired. I\u2019ve come close to writing that before, but at this point, it would be unfair to him. He showed more tactical awareness in this group stage than we\u2019ve ever seen from him, and he earned my respect in getting out of a group that was by no means easy.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m taking more of the \u201cthanks for everything, it\u2019s time to go\u201d approach. It\u2019s undeniable that Berhalter took the U.S. from one of its lowest points in recent history and got it back to the knockout rounds of the World Cup. I\u2019m choosing to be grateful for his impact in ushering in a new era of United States soccer history. We made it out of the group, after all, a feat that none of the other CONCACAF teams (looking at you, Mexico) could claim.\n\nIt was a memorable campaign to say the least, and I\u2019ll never forget the feeling of overwhelming joy I shared with friends and family when we scored. That being said, Berhalter\u2019s limitations when it comes to game management and talent evaluation are too glaring to ignore. Hell, Gio Reyna played just 11 minutes in the group stage. Managerial malpractice 101.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the U.S. to have loftier aspirations, and it\u2019s time to move on from Berhalter and find a new manager. Finding the right candidate is crucial in maximizing the potential of this generation of talent. I do tend to get ahead of myself though, so I\u2019ll slow things down and take a step back.\n\nThis World Cup campaign was a massive step in the right direction for soccer in the States. I\u2019ve never seen so many people in this country care about men\u2019s soccer \u2014 we even had Charles Barkley hyping up the team on national television. I had friends following the team that I didn\u2019t even think watched sports. There\u2019s finally a sense that people really do care, and for someone like me who has always wished everyone else would care like I do, I couldn\u2019t be more overjoyed.\n\nThis team really does have a high ceiling, and with the right pieces, it should be able to push further in the competition come 2026. Now\u2019s a better time than ever to keep the fandom momentum going because the United States Women\u2019s National Team is going for its three-peat this coming summer. And if you\u2019re tired of seeing Americans lose at soccer, then you clearly haven\u2019t watched enough of the women\u2019s team.\n\nAs this column moves forward into the new year, I\u2019ll discuss the USWNT as well as provide updates on the men\u2019s squad when news comes around. Until then, stay believing. \u201cSoccer in the States\u201d typically runs every other Friday.\n```"}

Michigan won, 43-22. (AP Photo/AJ Mast)\n\nBy Terence Holton December 06, 2022 at  4:17 pm PST\n\nAs this is the last edition of  The Big Ten Breakdown , where I have broken down various aspects of USC\u2019s move to the Big Ten, I figure it is time to take a look at some of the Trojans\u2019 future opponents and how they all fared this year. They will be ranked in five different tiers based on performance this year, starting from the best and ending with the worst.\n\nThe Cream of the Crop: Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State\n\nThere are only three teams that belong in this tier: Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State. All three teams eclipsed ten wins already this year and have dominated the Big Ten over the past decade. Michigan won the East division with a 12-0 record, beating both Penn State and Ohio State along their road to glory. Michigan and Ohio State are both heading to the College Football Playoff and could possibly rematch in the national championship, while Penn State will play Utah in the Rose Bowl (go Nittany Lions). All three teams are playing in New Year\u2019s Six bowls and are the best competition the Trojans will face when they head to the Big Ten in a couple of years.\n\nBest of the West + Maryland: Purdue, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Maryland\n\nAll these teams \u2014 except Maryland \u2014 competed to win the Big Ten West this year, and all of them, for the most part, dominated their out of conference schedule. All teams in this tier have decent bowl games against Power 5 opponents, but each of these teams pale in comparison to the likes of the first tier. Each of these teams won at least seven games, and almost every single one of them was in a close game with Penn State, Ohio State or Michigan. These teams are all good and could probably contend for the ACC or the Pac-12, but they have a long way to go before they reach the level of those three elite Big Ten programs.\n\nThe 2021 Los Angeles Lakers: Michigan State, Wisconsin\n\nThis tier, rightfully named \u201cThe 2021 Los Angeles Lakers,\u201d is created for the teams that were flat-out huge disappointments. Michigan State and Wisconsin went into Week 1 ranked among the top 20 teams in the country, with Michigan State even climbing to No. 11 by Week 3. However, since then, it has been a quick trip off a cliff for both programs. The Spartans\u2019 run was ended by Washington when they were routed 39-28 by the Huskies. Wisconsin also fell to a school from Washington, losing 17-14 at home to Washington State. It must have been something about the Evergreen State. While Wisconsin ended with six wins, meaning they will play in a bowl game, Michigan State came one game short of going bowling, with only five wins.\n\nLes Mis\u00e9rables: Rutgers, Indiana, Nebraska\n\nAll three of these programs finished with only four wins, with the best of the trio likely being Rutgers. In Week 10 of this season, Rutgers was actually beating Michigan at halftime 17-14. The Scarlet Knights proceeded to get clobbered by the Wolverines in the second half and lost 55-17, but it was a valiant early effort. One thing these programs all had in common was they all struggled with non-Power 5 teams. Rutgers barely beat Temple, winning 16-14. Indiana had to take Western Kentucky to overtime to win by three. The most brutal result of the bunch was Nebraska losing at home to Georgia Southern.\n\nOverall, these are not really the games to look forward to from a fan\u2019s perspective, as they are really just like playing another game against Cal or Arizona State.\n\nStick to academics: Northwestern\n\nI had to create a whole new tier for Northwestern. That\u2019s how bad the Wildcats were at football this year. Northwestern quite literally never won a game on American soil, as their only win came against Nebraska in Ireland. Northwestern also lost to Southern Illinois and Miami (Ohio) at home. Evanston, Ill. is one of those places where the Trojans may not want to play purely because of the weather and not at all because of the football team. They have their own special tier because they are terrible at football, but Northwestern will always have great academics.\n\nSo, that is how all of the Trojans\u2019 future opponents did this year. USC moves to the Big Ten in 2024, and I cannot wait to watch matchups such as snowy games in Minnesota, the White Out at Penn State or Saturday night games at the Coliseum against Michigan or Ohio State. There are endless possibilities.\n\nAs a reader, I hope you learned something about USC moving to the Big Ten, and thank you for reading  The Big Ten Breakdown. The Big Ten Breakdown runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Some artists have already begun their careers with very important feats under their belt. Mind you, this artist holds his feats under his cinto piteado and cowboy boots. Equally as proud of his Mexican heritage is his passion and dedication to the art of Regional Mexicano; a genre of music that has gained a major following and indulged in a renaissance of sorts.\n\nOne of the recent artists paving the way for the new form of music is Xavier Zazueta. Originally from Sonora, M\u00e9xico, Zazueta recently launched his first full-length album in which he leaps into the industry led by greats such as Julion Alvarez, Luis R. Conriquez and Christian Nodal. Zazueta\u2019s album titled, \u201cDisfraz de Amigo,\u201d which translates to a \"friendship mask\u2019' was launched back in August and has already reached close to 3.7 thousand views on the single\u2019s official YouTube video. He has also gathered a total of 1,817 monthly listeners on Spotify; extending his outreach on other music platforms.\n\n\u201cThe goal of this album is to reach the hearts of all Latin people,\u201d said Zazueta. At such a young age, Zazueta has been gaining popularity in M\u00e9xico audiences since his participation in the reality show \u201cLa Academia\u201d back in 2011. In more recent years, Zazueta has also had the opportunity of performing in front of large audiences; from performing at the White House in front of a number of Hispanic Senators to giving his best at the SOFI Stadium in front of a sold out crowd.\n\n\u201cI feel like opportunities are coming to me without being looking for them, so I\u2019m taking advantage of all the opportunities I have for people to get to know me,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Zazueta, being one of the new voices of Mariachi music and Regional Mexicano is a big deal. He recognizes that through his music he will carry the torch to a very important legacy. \u201cI feel it is a very big responsibility because they are our roots. To talk about mariachi is to talk about a Mexican, to talk about Mexico,\u201d he adds, very connected to his words.\n\n\u201cEver since I can remember I\u2019ve been in love with Mexican ranchera music,\u201d he recalls his morning drives with his father back in his homeland of Sonora, Mexico while listening to greats like Jorge Negrete and Pedro Infante. Now he has gone from hearing those emblematic songs on the radio to hearing his own being played.\n\nZazueta knows he can achieve a lot through his music and is willing to try various styles proposed to him; but he knows he has to represent his culture and Mariachi music to the fullest. He says, \u201cI want to try to leave a mark on the young people and the new generations, just like my father taught me that this was our music; our roots.\u201d```"}

Expand Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams deserves to be announced as the Heisman Trophy winner on Saturday, regardless of the Pac-12 Championship outcome. (Photo by Michael Chow)  By   Matthew Andrade December 05, 2022 at  2:35 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s been 17 years since a Heisman Trophy has been placed on the shelves of Heritage Hall \u2013 and 18 since it was a trophy that USC didn\u2019t have to give back. That Heisman-less streak will end this year. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams cemented himself solely in that position at the end of the regular season. And that didn\u2019t change with USC\u2019s loss to Utah. If anything, the loss helped Williams\u2019 Heisman case.\n\nIn the first quarter, Williams bolted for a 59-yard run that would have been Williams\u2019 signature Heisman moment had he not injured his hamstring at the end of the play. Caleb Wheel-iams \ud83d\udca8  @uscfb   pic.twitter.com/oVyaXfETWn \u2014 FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX)  December 3, 2022\n\nUSC led 14-3 after the possession, but from that point on, Williams didn\u2019t look the same. He was missing receivers and was almost entirely unable to move out of the pocket. \u201cYou ever have an old rubber band?\u201d Williams said of the injury. \u201cIt kinda felt like that.\u201d USC was outscored 44-10 after the injury. The offense was at a near standstill with its quarterback effectively on one leg the rest of the night. The Trojans put up 194 yards in the first quarter, but they only managed 225 yards for the rest of the game while Williams was sacked seven times. That offensive stagnation proves one thing: Williams is USC\u2019s offense. The No. 5 offense in yards per game could hardly move without Williams at 100 percent, and if that doesn\u2019t show that Williams is the most outstanding player in college football, I don\u2019t know what will.\n\nBut the Heisman Trophy is more than merely the \u201cmost outstanding player.\u201d. It\u2019s also given to the player \u201cwhose performance epitomizes great ability combined with diligence, perseverance, and hard work.\u201d With confetti streaming down on Utah\u2019s trophy ceremony, Williams could be seen off to the side tearing up as he watched the team responsible for USC\u2019s two losses hoist the trophy the Trojans had their sights on all season. A member of USC\u2019s staff had to come to the field to escort Williams off or he would have watched the entire ceremony imagining what could have been. During the postgame press conference, Williams\u2019 eyes were red from the tears. He groaned as he sat down, in evident pain stemming from the injury. It was pain that caused Williams grief when he did a task so simple as sitting, yet he played football on that leg for three whole quarters.\n\n\u201cI definitely thought about taking him out, and I think he wouldn\u2019t have let me. He wouldn\u2019t even let me take him out at the end,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cIn terms of guys I\u2019ve coached at that position, that was maybe the gutsiest performance I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Few quarterbacks have had a game more exemplary of diligence, perseverance and hard work than that. The final score shouldn\u2019t be considered in the slightest when factoring that performance into Williams\u2019 Heisman candidacy.\n\nWilliams entered the game as such a heavy favorite to win the award that it would have taken a disastrous performance to lose it. Williams completed 28 of his 41 passes for 363 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. On one leg, that\u2019s pretty good. Williams has had much better performances, and that\u2019s why Friday\u2019s bout didn\u2019t matter for his Heisman Trophy prospects. He didn\u2019t need to create a \u201cHeisman moment.\u201d He\u2019s got plenty. Look at Williams\u2019 503 total yards against UCLA \u2014 the most by an individual player in the history of the rivalry. Look at Williams\u2019  16-second, 19-yard run  against Notre Dame in which the quarterback dropped back, shed a tackle and ran up the field all while juking defenders left and right. Look at  Williams cashing in his third rushing touchdown  of the night on a fourth-down option play to silence any hopes of a Fighting Irish comeback \u2014 the moment I knew Williams deserved the prestigious award.\n\nWilliams\u2019 regular season was more than enough to warrant a Heisman. Everything else is gravy. Williams\u2019 message since the first day of spring camp has been consistent: It\u2019s about the team, not him. Even when he was less than two months removed from announcing his transfer to USC \u2014 a move some deemed to be selfish and everything wrong with the sport \u2014 Williams\u2019 attention was on building up those around him. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Williams said of the hype surrounding him on the first day of spring camp. \u201cFocus on the guys here. Focus on leading these guys ... I don\u2019t really focus on my own goals. Obviously, I mean who wouldn\u2019t want to have a Heisman? It\u2019s one of my goals but not really a goal of the team. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on here.\u201d\n\nHis message in the Pac-12 Championship defeat was as unwavering as it was over eight months prior. \u201cI also had a group of guys that was looking at me to lead them to victory,\u201d Williams said, \u201cand that didn\u2019t end up happening.\u201d\n\nIf the Heisman Trophy voters get it right \u2014 and I have every reason to believe they will \u2014 Williams will leave New York City with a shiny piece of hardware that\u2019s making the same pose Williams made several times in that win over Notre Dame. And what\u2019s crazy is he\u2019ll be coming back for another year to try to win it again.\n```"}

Morgan is third in the country with 3.62 blocks per game. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have another Florida Gulf Coast incident,\u201d Morgan said, referring to USC\u2019s loss to FGCU to open the season. \u201cWhen I was up there in the press, I just thought \u2018We\u2019ve got to close this game out.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth offenses struggled out of the gate with the score being 11-10 Beavers after ten minutes of play. Oregon State heated up first, going on an 8-0 scoring run to put themselves up by 11 at the half. In the first half, the Beavers hit six threes in twelve tries from beyond the arc, well above their 30.6% season average. The Trojans made just one 3-pointer in six attempts in the first half.\n\nHowever, the Trojans were able to turn the tables in the end. \u201cIn the second half, we locked in and said, \u2018Okay, this team is really shooting threes,\u2019\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe made the adjustment, and their three-point percentage went down.\u201d\n\nWith the score at 53-50 with 2:42 to go, fifth year guard Drew Peterson heaved the ball to Johnson. The sophomore drained a game-tying three from the right side, holding three fingers close to the ground in celebration. Beavers\u2019 junior guard Dexter Akano\u2019s inbound pass tipped off the hands of senior guard Boogie Ellis who saved the ball from going out of bounds by passing it to Peterson. The fifth year then passed it to Johnson again, who made the layup to give USC its first lead since 9:55 in the first half. Peterson capped off an 8-0 Trojans run by recovering the ball off the glass and putting one in to make it 57-53, a lead that USC held on to for the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cOur defensive intensity changed in the final minutes,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cOur press and our zone defense really helped us win tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will face off against 4-4 Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday in a non-conference matchup. USC is 6-0 all-time against the Titans. \u201cJust like every other team, we\u2019re going to take them seriously,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhatever the record is, we\u2019re not going to make anything of it.\u201d\n```"}

Thursday\u2019s quarterfinal game was not close \u2014 the No. 1 USC Trojans handily defeated the No. 9 Princeton Tigers 11-8. Following some excellent second-half defense, the Trojans rode senior driver Marcus Longton\u2019s four goals to a victory and a showdown with the crosstown No. 3 UCLA Bruins in the semifinals.\n\nSaturday\u2019s Crosstown Showdown was different from the previous three matchups \u2014 USC controlled the pace the entire game. An early score from graduate driver Massimo Di Martire gave the Trojans a lead which they would never relinquish. Di Martire finished with five goals and redshirt senior Jake Ehrhardt contributed two. The soggy conditions of Saturday\u2019s game left the Trojans unfazed. Heavy rain fell, which caused a solid layer of steam to rest above the water for the entire match.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much adversity up to this point,\u201d Ehrhardt said. \u201cTo come play in this kind of environment where you can barely see five feet in front of you is no different than what we\u2019ve been dealing with all season.\u201d\n\nDealing with adversity has been a common theme for these Trojans throughout the season. They were forced to overcome three straight losses to the Bruins to start the season, to eventually defeat them in the final two. For many outside of the program, a trip to the NCAA Tournament was not even guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people counting us out, even making it to [the] tournament,\u201d Ehrhardt said. Yet, USC persevered and proved a lot of people wrong.\n\nSunday\u2019s match should have been a culmination of an entire year\u2019s worth of hard work; a final chance for the Trojans to cement their names in the history books. Unfortunately for the Trojans, however, for the third straight year, USC was unable to come out of the championship game with a win.\n\nUltimately, the Trojans had no answer for star junior center Nikolaos Papanikolaou. His three goals in the final five minutes opened up more opportunities for various other Cal players, as the Trojans placed an extra emphasis on keeping him in check. Sophomore attacker Roberto Valera scored with 41 seconds left \u2014 a goal that sealed the Trojans\u2019 fate and sealed the Golden Bears\u2019 victory, 13-12.\n\nWhat makes the loss even more heartbreaking for the Trojans is the fact that USC held the lead going into the final five minutes of play. They rode the backs of Di Martire, Ehrhardt and junior 2-meter Max Miller, who each contributed two goals apiece. But just as they surrendered three goals in the final 1:02 to UCLA during their Nov. 11 matchup, the Trojans just could not stop the Golden Bears\u2019 momentum on Sunday.\n\n\u201cMomentum is the strongest force in the universe,\u201d Longton said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re rolling and they\u2019re scoring, and the crowd is getting them going even more \u2014 it\u2019s hard to stop that. We did the best we could to kinda pause that energy and get ourselves going. At the end of the day, we weren\u2019t able to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t switch the momentum in the fourth quarter,\u201d head coach Marko Pintaric said. \u201cWe tried to stop it on a couple of timeouts. We couldn\u2019t get that ejection we were looking for. We couldn\u2019t put the ball in the net.\u201d\n\nNow, Cal becomes the first back-to-back champion since the 2014 and 2015 UCLA Bruins. While Sunday\u2019s outcome is not the one the player wanted, there are still some positives to take away. Senior driver Chris Sturtevant had nothing but good things to say on the progress the team made this season.\n\n\u201c[We] developed a ton over this past season,\u201d Sturtevant said. \u201cWe bought into the culture and the process more so than anything. It really takes a whole family. Not the outcome we wanted, but the journey we wanted more so than anything. All these guys would say it, but this is the best season we\u2019ve ever had. I wouldn\u2019t trade anything for it.\u201d\n\nNow, the Trojans must look ahead to next season, where they will hunt for their first national title since 2018.\n```"}

(Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nDecember 03, 2022 at 7:38 pm PST\n\nIt had been three years since USC women\u2019s volleyball last participated in the NCAA Tournament, a run that culminated in a second-round sweep by Baylor in 2019. This season, the Trojans met a similar fate. They took all three sets on Friday in the first round against High Point before No. 3 seed Ohio State swept USC in Saturday\u2019s second round.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bummed for these kids. [They] have worked so incredibly hard and we\u2019ve gone through so much to get to this space,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cWhen you put so much into something like that, it\u2019s just tough no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe USC offense was rolling in its first postseason matchup, hitting .394 for the game against the Panthers on its way to a 25-19, 25-19, 25-20 victory. Senior outside hitter Skylar Fields was the primary threat with a game-high 14 kills, but it was the Trojans\u2019 supporting cast that was arguably more impressive. The three W\u2019s \u2014 freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson, senior opposite hitter Emilia Weske and graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams \u2014 all had wonderful performances to give USC three W\u2019s in three sets. The trio combined for 28 kills to just two attacking errors and all hit over .500.\n\nAdditionally, in just her second game of the season, freshman Adonia Faumuina got the start at setter over sophomore Mia Tuaniga. Faumuina stepped up well into the role with 40 assists, two block assists and five digs for the match.\n\nFields started out strong in the first set with four early kills, and Wilson helped finish the job with five kills on eight attacks as USC pulled away late in the opening frame. The Panthers outside hitters, junior Dylan Maberry and sophomore Sydney Palazzolo, tried to keep up with 10 combined kills in the first set, but it wasn\u2019t enough to match the Trojans\u2019 high-powered offense.\n\nThe second set played out similarly, though USC took a little longer to find a groove due to five service errors. Still, the Trojans had their most efficient set of the weekend with 15 kills and two errors on their way to another 25-19 set victory.\n\nThe third set was a bit more streaky for both sides, as High Point slowed down USC for some stretches. However, the Panthers\u2019 defense wasn\u2019t up to par, only accruing three blocks for the match. High Point tied the score 20-20 thanks to some Trojan errors, but yet again, USC had its way at the end of the set, going on a 5-0 run to finish the match.\n\nSaturday\u2019s second-round matchup was a much different story for USC. Though Fields again led all players with 14 more kills, she didn\u2019t have a secondary effort around her. In comparison to the first match of the weekend, those three W\u2019s regressed to 17 kills and seven attacking errors, with none hitting higher than .273 in the match.\n\n\u201cOhio State was a really good team, a really well-coached team,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI thought they were electric in front of their crowd. They hit the ball really well, and they dug so many volleyballs in transit.\u201d\n\nWhile USC found its rhythm in the back end of sets against High Point, it was a 6-1 run to end the first set by Ohio State that set the tone for the match. The Buckeyes won the opener 25-21 and cruised through the next two sets 25-17 and 25-16.\n\nThe Trojans simply couldn\u2019t find an answer for Ohio State, who held a comfortable lead for most of the second set. Keller inserted Tuaniga at setter to try and change things up, but that wasn\u2019t the solution USC needed.\n\n\u201cThis season has guided us through a lot together and we grew together as a team,\u201d Weske said. \u201cWe definitely were expecting more of ourselves in this moment. It sucks right now.\u201d\n\nEarly in the third set, a dramatic save by the Buckeyes followed by the first kill of the season for junior defensive specialist Sarah Sue Morbitzer put Ohio State up 7-3. The wild point gave the Buckeyes even more momentum to put the Trojans away, as the No. 3 seed led by as many as 13 points in a dominant third set.\n\nTwo consecutive successful challenges on match point by Keller briefly prolonged the Trojans\u2019 season, but it was nowhere near enough to keep up with the easily superior Buckeyes on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI love this team, I love the direction of where this program is going,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI think this program is in an unbelievably better place than where it started, and I can\u2019t wait for what the future holds.\u201d\n\nUSC ends the season with a 22-11 record \u2014 its first 20-win season since 2018 \u2014 including 13-7 in Pac-12 play.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nBy Paige Shea\nDecember 03, 2022 at 4:59 pm PST\n\nGeorgia\u2019s early-voter turnout for the Dec. 6 Senate runoff election between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker has broken records in anticipation of the contentious election. On Monday, Georgia counted more than 300,000 in-person ballots, breaking the state\u2019s previous single-day early voting record of 233,000 votes. In total, as of Friday, more than 1.4 million votes have been cast \u2013 including absentee ballots and in-person voting \u2013 according to the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\n\nAdditionally, more than 55% of the early voters are white and about 32% are Black, with Black voters showing up to vote early at a higher turnout rate than before. Asian and Pacific Islander and Hispanic voters both account for less than 2% of the votes.\n\nWarnock received about 37,000 more votes in the midterm elections than Walker but did not meet the threshold of the 50% of votes needed to win the election under Georgia\u2019s law, sending the race into a runoff election. Voters who favor Warnock seem to be voting in larger numbers now than in the general election. A recent poll commissioned by AARP has Warnoff with a slight lead over Walker, leading 51% to 47%.\n\nAnna Purcella-Doll, a resident of Forsyth County in Georgia, said the youth vote is the most important aspect of the runoff election. \u201cYouth power is going to be key,\u201d said Purcell-Doll. \u201cKids and young adults are seeing the power that they have and that they have a voice. They are the ones who are going to save us, and the ones that saved us nationwide. They can do it again in Georgia.\u201d\n\nPurcella-Doll is a member of the state committee of the Democratic Party of Georgia, and serves as head of candidate recruitment and second vice chair of the Forsyth County Democrats.\n\nThe results of the runoff are a deciding factor in the Democrats\u2019 aim to secure a majority outright in the Senate instead of the current power-sharing agreement. If Walker wins the runoff race, the parties will be split 50-50 in the Senate, and Vice President Kamala Harris will provide a tie-breaking vote to give the Democrats the majority. But if Warnock holds his Senate position, the Senate balance would fall to 51-49, in favor of the Democrats.\n\nThis is not the first time that the nation\u2019s eyes fell on Georgia after a neck-and-neck midterm race. The 2020 midterm elections saw Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock defeat Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, which gave Democrats 50 seats in the Senate and control with Harris\u2019 tie-breaking vote. In both 2020 and 2022, the fate of the Senate balance has been decided, or almost decided, by Georgia.\n\nAdditionally, President Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992, marking a large shift in Georgia\u2019s political landscape, as the purple state continues to become a critical state in national politics.\n\n\u201cI knew [the runoff] would happen,\u201d said Elizabeth Adkins, a USC sophomore from Athens, Georgia studying public policy. Adkins voted by absentee ballot in the midterm elections and stayed in Georgia for an extra day over Thanksgiving break to vote in-person during the first early voting day. Adkins said that based on the 2020 midterm elections, most Georgia voters expected the runoff because there\u2019s a large divide between Atlanta, which usually votes blue, and rural Georgia, which tends to vote red.\n\nHowever, Adkins enjoys Georgia\u2019s shifting political landscape. \u201cI think it just goes to show how the economy of Atlanta and the city of Atlanta is growing, and smaller cities like Athens are turning blue as well,\u201d Adkins said.\n\nIn the high stakes race, high-profile Democrats and Republicans alike have flocked to Georgia to campaign for both Warnock and Walker. Former President Barack Obama headlined a rally for Warnock on Thursday, aiming to energize the Democratic voters ahead of the election. \u201cPlenty of folks haven\u2019t voted yet,\u201d said Obama at the rally. \u201cTomorrow is the last day for early voting and then we need to get people out to the polls on Tuesday, which means we still got work to do.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump-backed Walker has campaigned with prominent Republicans such as Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), and Rick Scott (Fla.). \u201cThere is a big difference between a 50-50 Senate, which is what we have if Herschel wins... If the Democrats grow their majority, they get a majority on every single committee,\u201d said Cruz, encouraging Georgia Republicans to vote for Walker.\n\nThe recent overturning of Roe v. Wade has also been an influential deciding factor in the midterm elections. Warnock has ran on a pro-choice platform, signing federal legislation that would protect women who travel across state lines to receive abortions. Walker has since changed his previous no-exception stance on abortion by supporting Georgia\u2019s abortion law that bans abortions after six weeks but makes exceptions for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest.\n\nIt is worth noting that Walker has faced two accusations from former girlfriends who said that Walker had pressured them into getting abortions, which he paid for. However, Walker has denied those claims.\n\nIn the midterm elections, NBC exit polls showed that the 26% of Georgia voters who ranked abortion as their top issue on the ballot backed Warnock by a margin of 77% to 21%. Adkins said that abortion was one of her top issues on the ballot this year, as well as the education system and economic policy. Purcella-Doll said that the most important issue for her in the midterm elections was democracy, followed by abortion rights.\n\n\u201cIn my lifetime, I\u2019ve never \u2013 during childbearing age \u2013 [not had] access to abortion, to healthcare. And so that is so critical,\u201d Purcella-Doll said. \u201cHowever, for me, I was so worried that Democrats would lose both the House and Senate. Even though my preferred candidates did not win in Georgia, we have a chance to give President Biden a fighting chance in the Senate.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Valerie Fang\nDecember 03, 2022 at 3:53 pm PST\n\nMany USC students gathered at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street on Tuesday, Nov. 29 for a candlelight vigil held in remembrance of the Urumqi Fire\u2019s victims. The attendees ranged from protestors holding signs and chanting slogans against China\u2019s \u201czero-Covid\u201d policy to quiet observers holding candles as they stood outside the crowd. Although it was held on a college campus, the event was organized by a non-USC student organization.\n\nStudents either brought their own or were given blank sheets of A4 papers to demonstrate their support for the \u201cA4 Revolution\u201d (\u767d\u7eb8\u8fd0\u52a8), a series of protests sparked by the Urumqi Fire, where an apartment fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang led to 10 confirmed deaths and 9 injured. According to The New York Times, many people suspect that the strict Covid lockdowns in the neighborhood hindered rescue efforts and led to the deaths.\n\nProtestors shout slogans against China's zero-Covid policy. (Photo by Michael Chow)\n\n\u201cI was very shocked [when I first saw the news on YouTube]. Man-made disasters have completely overtaken natural ones,\u201d said Guoxiang Hu who was one of the organizers. He further stated: \u201cThe protests happening in Shanghai have been fierce. As a fellow Shanghainese, I want to do my part for democracy and freedom in Shanghai.\u201d Hu was referring to the series of protests taking place on Shanghai\u2019s Wulumuqi Road, named after the city of Urumqi. As reported by the BBC, during a protest on Nov. 26, people in Shanghai chanted by far the boldest slogans: \u201cXi Jinping, step down\u201d and \u201cCommunist party, step down.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what their hoped outcome of the event at USC was, an active student participant who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons commented, \u201cOur power is in fact very limited, but we can still let the foreign media see that Chinese people are rising up. I think only if international forces pay enough attention to this matter can sanctions be imposed to some extent.\u201d Holding a protest sign plastered with slogans, the student continued, \u201cFor our compatriots at home, their situation is even worse. We hope we can provide them with some moral support across the ocean. We hope they don\u2019t feel alone in this.\u201d\n\nA student holds a candle and a piece of blank A4 paper in protest. (Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nThis feeling of solidarity was a sentiment shared by many during the vigil. Besides student protestors, there was also Chinese We-media (\u81ea\u5a92\u4f53) present live-streaming the event to Internet users. We-media refers to online news sources that are operated by individuals or collectives, who are often citizen journalists rather than professional reporters. One anchor, who owns an account called \u201c\u52a0\u5dde\u58a8\u8336,\u201d stated: \u201cMy We-media platform mainly calls for democratic movement, or helps some powerless people like me to \u2018run\u2019 abroad.\u201d The anchor specifically used the word \u201crun,\u201d echoing the increasingly popular \u201crun philosophy\u201d in China. According to The Guardian, \u201crun philosophy,\u201d also known as \u201crun xue,\u201d is a coded way of talking about emigrating. It has become a buzzword on the Chinese internet as a response from young people to China\u2019s declining economy, strict lockdowns, and \u201ca social order that has become hyper-competitive, exhausting and unpredictable.\u201d\n\nRight outside the crowd, a USC graduate from Urumqi was handing out free T-shirts that said \u201cGoogle \u2018Uyghurs\u2019\u201d to people passing by. Near the end of the vigil, the T-shirts were already running out. \u201cIt\u2019s very heartbreaking. The building [where the fire broke out] was literally about 5 miles away from my own apartment. So that\u2019s the place I grew up. My high school was there. My middle school was next to it.\u201d They further shared their message to fellow protestors: \u201cI just hope this thing won\u2019t remain as shouting, slogans, or words. I hope actual actions can happen, not just words.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Media speaks with a student demonstrator. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nAround 8:30 PM, the crowd was chanting its demands for the Chinese government to recount the death toll. While the official number of victims announced by the government is 10 people, some speculate that the number of casualties is actually higher. At this point in the protest, the organizers welcomed anyone, with an emphasis on college students, who wished to speak up to step forward and make public speeches. Some protesters shouted chants that are not directly related to the Urumqi Fire but focused on the wider dissent against the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s authoritarian regime, such as \u201cthe revolution of the times, the liberation of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nAs the event was drawing to a conclusion, the organizers did not forget to remind the protesters of their personal safety, saying, \u201cEveryone must stay safe because there are many hostile forces that will turn on us. The CCP\u2019s minions are still attacking everything. Do not assume you are free even if you are in the free world.\u201d\n\nSome protestors, however, also expressed a skeptical attitude towards the nature of this event and a relatively more pessimistic outlook on A4 Revolution\u2019s direction in the future. One student who was standing at the far edge of the crowd commented, \u201cI think these activities are somewhat extreme. When such gatherings are held outside China, the participants might not only be those who only wish to mourn the victims, but also those who are unable to return home for some reason. Some people here want to destroy the regime, some others just want chaos. But if there is too much chaos, or if there is not an effectively organized discussion, these things can go astray.\u201d\n\nOther students just expressed plain frustration and ridicule regarding the event and its organizers. An anonymous USC student of minority descent from China complained, \u201cThis event is of no use. These people are like clowns. Protesting itself is a good thing because it lets the CCP hear people\u2019s demands. But it is capitalizing on the deaths of those victims. If people are to mourn the dead, they should focus on the fire itself and not other events. I definitely will not participate in similar protests after I return to China either because I live a comfortable life.\u201d\n\nAs of December 1st, the Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged the growing anti-lockdown protests. As reported by The Guardian, the spokesperson of China\u2019s foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, took a long and awkward pause before answering a journalist\u2019s question on the demonstrations. Zhao stated that what the reporter had mentioned does not reflect what actually happened and continued to defend the zero-Covid policy. However, the Chinese Communist Party has also loosened some of the unpopular Covid restrictions, as reported by The New York Times. Many neighborhoods in Guangzhou announced the easing of the lockdown while some residents in Chongqing are also no longer required to take Covid tests on a regular basis. But as protests continue both within China and globally, the country\u2019s citizens anxiously await a resolution to the seemingly daily social and political struggles.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Limage)\n\nBy Viktoria Capek\nDecember 03, 2022 at 2:40 pm PST\n\nWhen Yasna Vismale was a little girl, she followed her mother as she cleaned the house and mimicked the vacuum cleaner\u2019s rumbling noises as it whirred across the carpet. She often stole her mother\u2019s flip phone to make songs by mashing buttons on the keypad and produced touch tones into a voice recorder. Vismale used the recordings to underscore any live sounds that she could make such as whistling, making her a self-proclaimed expert by age 8.\n\nTogether, Vismale and her mother watched animated Studio Ghibli films such as \u201cPrincess Mononoke,\u201d leaving the sounds of composer Joe Hisaishi\u2019s score stuck in her head until she sang her own melodic remixes later on. That memory always made her mother smile.\n\nVismale couldn\u2019t settle on an instrument to play until she was 12. She had to pick the perfect one, which hinged on her mother\u2019s only condition: Whatever instrument her daughter chose, she had to commit to being the best she could be. And Vismale chose trumpet. Not because it was her first choice, but because her cousin had an extra that she could use, and a brand new instrument would cost her family money they couldn\u2019t spare.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that people never tell you: It\u2019s very expensive to be a musician,\u201d said Vismale, battling to be heard over a crowd of bustling college students leaving classrooms and weaving around us like a hurdle to get to their next stop.\n\nVismale is unbothered by the resources she lacked growing up in a low-income, immigrant home. At 23, she\u2019s comfortable in her surroundings \u2014 exhibited by the sweat suit she wore to our early morning interview at USC, where she\u2019s pursuing a master\u2019s in film scoring at the Thornton School of Music.\n\nVismale\u2019s response to her achievements as a young music producer, film composer and author are poised. She looks back on her short life with incredulous pride \u2014 no thanks to money \u2014 but to the confidence her mother instilled in her to follow her dreams wherever they may lead.\n\nVismale was raised in Seattle by her Japanese mother, Chiemi Yamaoka. When Yamaoka was pregnant with Vismale, she promised two things: to speak to her daughter in Japanese and to hug her every chance she could.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my treasure. And I\u2019m always there for you,\u201d Yamaoka recalls saying to her daughter whenever they embraced.\n\nWhen Vismale was 17, Yamaoka drove her to the farmer\u2019s market on Sundays to busk with her trumpet. Never rely on other people\u2019s money, she\u2019d say, and whatever Vismale earned improvising jazz sets and performing covers of famous Disney songs would be hers to spend however she liked.\n\nOver the years, Vismale\u2019s natural talent revealed itself while playing with her middle and high school jazz bands. That experience afforded her opportunities to perform as the opener for Disney\u2019s Humanitarian Award Ceremony and as a guest artist for the Japanese musical group Continued in the Under Ground Jazz Orchestra during her senior year of high school.\n\nBut as Vismale got older, she felt burdened with responsibility to enter a career that would allow her to make enough money to support her family, something playing the trumpet never guaranteed. She chose to sideline her musical dreams during a break from school following graduation and instead chased what she called the \u201cimmigrant dream,\u201d \u2014 a good education at an Ivy League school.\n\nThe following year, Vismale entered Columbia University in New York to study religion, sustainable development and finance on a full-ride scholarship.\n\n\u201cTo me, it didn\u2019t matter what she wanted to do because I knew she would succeed,\u201d Yamaoka said over Zoom, though she secretly wished her daughter would continue playing music in college.\n\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vismale began producing music on her computer to occupy time indoors. Her first opportunity to score a film fell into place when she was asked to compose for a Columbia documentary on nuclear warfare and climate change. She found a love for making music such as the Hisaishi compositions for Studio Ghibli that had lingered in her brain ever since she was a little girl.\n\nVismale felt inspired to create an independent piece of music that personified the story of her life growing up. \u201cTo my love\u201d was more atonal and experimental than the soothing, melodic pieces of brass and synth music that she was accustomed to making. The haunting composition of untuned string instruments, African drums and whispering Japanese voices became Vismale\u2019s most personal and proudest construction \u2014 a story of loneliness, but also a testament to her mother\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cHow she raised me is why I\u2019m here today,\u201d Vismale said. \u201cWithout her, I wouldn\u2019t have had the confidence to apply to USC.\u201d\n\nVismale submitted \u201cTo my love\u201d with her application to the music school. With no conservatory background or a Bachelor\u2019s degree in music, mother and daughter were cautiously optimistic about Vismale\u2019s acceptance to USC. But the day they learned Vismale was offered a full-ride scholarship left them wondering why they were worried in the first place that spring.\n\n\u201cShe always amazes me. Whatever she does, she makes it happen,\u201d said Yamaoka, gleaming with pride, exhibiting the dimpled smile her daughter inherited.\n\nFollowing her acceptance, Vismale, an ambitious polymath, published her first book, \u201cWerk Your Net.\u201d The book of advice, published by New Degree Press, contains more than 40 interviews with leaders from underrepresented backgrounds. Vismale wrote it to encourage readers who faced hardships growing up to never let their lack of resources stop them from chasing their dreams, and she hopes those following in her footsteps find someone to advocate for their future the way her mother always did.\n\n\u201cOftentimes you\u2019re told to reach for the stars, but if you don\u2019t know what to reach for \u2014 if you don\u2019t know what to imagine \u2014 then sometimes that can be very limiting to what you think you\u2019re capable of,\u201d Vismale said. \u201cYou are more than capable of doing more than what you are able to imagine, and you have to be ok with that.\u201d\n```"}

Mike Garcia of California\u2019s 27th district, defeated his opponent, Democrat Christy Smith, for the third time, deciding GOP control of the House of Representatives. The race was called on November 16 with Garcia holding 54% of the vote to Smith\u2019s 46%, despite Democrats having a 12.5% registration advantage in the district. The district comprises Santa Clarita, Palmdale and portions of Lancaster, north of Los Angeles.\n\nThe House balance ended up in the hands of a small number of tight races, but the district race in L.A. County tipped the Republicans to the 218 seats needed to secure victory. Garcia won for the first time against Smith in 2020 by only 333 votes.\n\n\u201cIt is the honor of my life to continue to serve #CA27 in Congress,\u201d Garcia said in a Twitter post Tuesday. \u201cI ran to fight for California families and protect the American Dream, and I look forward to working hard every day to continue that mission.\u201d\n\nThe change in the House majority pushed Nancy Pelosi to step down as speaker of the House after leading House Democrats for two decades. She was the first and only woman to ever hold that position.\n\n\u201cI will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday, speaking in the House. \u201cFor me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect, and I\u2019m grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.\u201d\n\nPelosi will continue to serve in the House for California\u2019s 12th Congressional District, representing most of San Francisco.

In fact, I was fighting the institutional power of my own party from the outset of this race,\u201d her tweet stated. \u201cI decided to take the big political risk to take on Garcia again when he voted not to certify the 2020 election results. But, despite the very close outcome of our 2020 contest, DC wasn\u2019t interested in a rematch. But #CA27 was.\u201d\n\nDespite narrowly winning the House, Republicans underperformed this election cycle, with the expected \u201cred wave\u201d not coming to fruition thanks to an uptick in the number of Gen Z voters. Democrats were able to not only hold onto their Senate majority, but now hold a gubernatorial majority as well. Without the House, however, it will be more difficult for Democrats to pass legislation.\n\n\u201cPersonally, it\u2019s a little concerning because I know that the way that we\u2019re going now, I don\u2019t want anything to change and things to become harder to be passed in the House or in the Senate,\u201d according to Brianna Rivas, a junior studying psychology. \u201cSo I am a little concerned, but hopefully it doesn\u2019t affect us too much.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were able to take back the House by outperforming Trump in over 300 districts, including areas that Biden won in 2020. In New York state, a known Democratic stronghold, Republicans gained four seats.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to see that there is now shared power in government,\u201d sophomore John Belton, a public policy major, said. \u201cI believe it is best when power is split, so the best policy solutions get passed.\u201d\n\nAlthough Republicans only have control of the House, it remains to be seen how this fact will affect Biden\u2019s agenda.

Somehow, though, the hotel\u2019s busiest group walks about unnoticed and unheard: its staff. That is, until our narrator, the Sofitel\u2019s manager, Susan, steps in and begins introducing us one-by-one to the true movers and shakers at the hotel.\n\nStylized as a story told in first-person from the perspective of playwright Susan Soon He Stanton, the play follows the case of Nafissatou Diallo, a real-life former housekeeper at the Sofitel, who accused French presidential hopeful and head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, of brutally sexually assaulting her in his room in 2011. The character of Susan, the playwright Susan and the play itself all center on Diallo. Susan the character has worked at this hotel for much longer than she had hoped, even after attending graduate school to become a playwright. The playwright Susan even went so far as to take a job at the Sofitel to attempt to interview Diallo.\n\nIt\u2019s also no coincidence that this story was told at USC now. Coming on the heels of protests for living wages for custodians at the university, the power imbalances that exist in these cities of industry and places where society\u2019s wealthiest people gather are front of mind during the show. \u201cThese stories are not unlike the stories of the janitors, cooks, and other workers at many of the establishments and institutions we patronize and work at...much like USC...who remain invisible to those of us privileged to enjoy the university\u2019s benefits,\u201d the artistic team writes in the program notes.\n\nThese stories do ring true when compared to the instances that have occurred at USC: in April of 2022, a custodian was accused of stealing a backpack while on campus. While Diallo left the hotel in the case of Strauss-Kahn, the USC custodian was fired. While the piece starts and ends with Susan\u2019s story, what was meant to be a closer look at one instance of the abuse of power over society\u2019s most vulnerable turns into a mosaic. Susan takes us through the small, anecdotal stories of the hotel\u2019s employees, and by the end of the performance, the audience sees a fuller, more vibrant picture of what it means to be an invisible part of elite New York high society.\n\nThe cast of \u201cwe, the invisibles\u201d does a phenomenal job capturing the lives, friendships and tragedies of the hotel staff. The show\u2019s 19-person cast plays more than 60 characters, including immigrant workers who run the bar and restaurants, housekeeping services and human resources. Not to mention the depiction of politician Strauss-Kahn as a sort of villain who returns throughout the show to remind Susan what the elite are capable of. \u201cThe characters are based on real people, and the play attempts to tell their stories,\u201d the artistic team writes. \u201cSome of the characters are based on verbatim interviews; some are told from memory; some are dramatized or come from combinations of stories.\u201d\n\nSoon He Stanton reportedly conducted dozens of interviews with her co-workers from all corners of the globe to put this story together, and thus the play is chock full of anecdotes about the lives of various workers. Waitresses argue with chefs in the hotel dining room about whose role is harder, immigrants from around the world recount how and why they made their way to New York, and tensions arise between supervisorial staff and the people that report to them. The audience hears accounts of housekeepers who were separated from their children during immigration, their security guard\u2019s dreams of becoming a police officer being shot down because of his disability, and even in one particularly tense moment, Susan herself imagines what might happen if she let a man through hotel security who may have been attempting to harm a conference room full of pharmaceutical executives.\n\nDespite the tremendous work of the ensemble, Diallo remains at the center of the picture Susan paints. Almost framed as a detective working to solve a mystery, Susan asks anyone she suspects who knew of Diallo\u2019s whereabouts. She speaks to reporters familiar with the case and attempts to find her online. At the same time, Susan makes references to the hate and something of a smear campaign that Diallo faced in the media, suggesting she lied about her attack, taking a brief pause to have the cast read out comments posted online about the Senegalese worker, most of them filled with hate speech and horrific language.\n\nBy the end of the play, we learn of Diallo\u2019s new life away from the hotel industry. She owns a cafe in New York, and she and Susan don\u2019t speak about the attack, but about what\u2019s good on the menu instead. (Criminal charges against Strauss-Kahn were dropped, but he later settled a civil suit that had been brought by Diallo.)\n\n\u201cwe, the invisibles\u201d is a story of money and power and how these things are used to abuse the hardest working people in society. At its emotional core are the people like Diallo \u2014 the people who keep the world turning despite everything they\u2019ve been through. \u201cwe, the invisibles\u201d ran from Nov. 10 through 20 at the Scene Dock Theatre.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Adam Jasper\nDecember 02, 2022 at 11:22 pm PST\n\nThe result of Friday night\u2019s Pac-12 Championship game didn\u2019t matter. It was already set in stone. USC is back. It sounds pretty shameless \u2014 especially after a demoralizing, soul-crushing, life-draining 47-24 loss at the hands of Utah, one which killed the Trojans\u2019 College Football Playoff chances \u2014 but it remains true.\n\nFor USC to be playing in its conference championship game for a spot in the playoff was already more than anyone could have expected. You don\u2019t have to look too far back into the past to find a basement-dwelling, discipline-devoid squad that couldn\u2019t even muster a bowl-eligible season. Just over a year ago, we all watched the Trojans and wondered when the suffering would end.\n\nUSC is now 11-2, destined for a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game. It\u2019s an unprecedented leap, putting the team right back in the mix with some of college football\u2019s perennial powerhouses.\n\nThe success didn\u2019t come without some close calls. In Corvalis, Oregon State nearly slowed the season to halt. Then the Neilon Nudge happened. In Pasadena, UCLA almost ended the dream. Then Korey Foreman made the play of the season to recapture the Victory Bell.\n\nEvery step of the way, USC just kept on pulling the rabbit out of the hat, even when things looked grim. On Friday night in Las Vegas, the magic ran out all at once.\n\n\u201cYou come as far as this team has come, this program has come in the last 12 months, you get that close to winning a championship and possibly much more \u2014 obviously to not get it done is a tough pill to swallow,\u201d Riley said.\n\nThe loss was an indictment on a team that, in the end, wasn\u2019t sustainable. The defense folded, allowing Utah to rush for 223 yards and post 47 points. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams\u2019 injury stalled the offense, all Utah needed to go on a 44-7 scoring run to close out the game.\n\nI\u2019ll reiterate: the loss was gutting. No getting around it. I recognize it\u2019s not the best look to be singing the praises of a team that just got systematically outplayed in the biggest moment of the season. But we simply must put this in perspective.\n\nNow is not the time to furrow our brows and turn away in disgust, even after an admittedly disgusting performance. Riley said it himself: \u201cObviously there\u2019s a much bigger picture and outlook here of the progress that\u2019s been made here in the last 12 months,\u201d Riley said. \u201cSo we\u2019re not going to walk around like this is some funeral.\u201d\n\nI implore USC fans to heed these words. This season must be celebrated for what it is: a historic overachievement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made some great progress to be in this moment,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe expected to win tonight. We didn\u2019t get it done. But that changes nothing in terms of the direction and trajectory of this program.\u201d\n\nMore than ever, things are looking up for this program. If you think Riley and USC hit the portal hard last offseason, just imagine how many players will want to come play for a revitalized team in sunny Southern California.\n\nAnother year of Heisman shoe-in Williams won\u2019t hurt, either. He makes the impossible seem routine, and now he gets quite the chip on his shoulder to bring into next season. If he wasn\u2019t required to stay another season to be eligible for the NFL draft, he would be long gone to the pros.\n\nApart from his undeniable talent, Williams\u2019 mentality is the gold standard for a leader. \u201c[Kobe] always said the game is bigger than what you\u2019re feeling,\u201d Williams said after playing most of the game with an injured hamstring. \u201cI was in my head encouraging myself.\u201d\n\nHow could you hear that and bet against him? His team\u2019s season isn\u2019t over, with a bowl game on the horizon and a chance to reach 12 wins for the first time since the 2008 season.\n\nRegardless of how the season ends, USC now has to walk the walk. The timeline has been shot to warp speed; most fans would\u2019ve been content with such a season in year three of Riley\u2019s tenure. Now, much more will be expected of them.\n\nThe Trojans will need to rise to an increasingly difficult task. I\u2019ll call my shot now. You will see USC back in the Pac-12 Championship Game 364 days from now. Maybe then the entire nation will understand what I already know: USC is back.\n```"}

A one-point loss at Utah on Oct. 15 thrust USC\u2019s fate into the hands of the committee, and just as destiny had finally been delivered back to Southern California, the boogeyman from Salt Lake City returned to send the Trojans\u2019 playoff fate right back to a meeting room in Grapevine, Texas.\n\nNo. 4 USC fell 47-24 to No. 11 Utah in the Pac-12 Championship Game at Allegiant Stadium Friday night. The Utes\u2019 second title in as many years sends them back to the Rose Bowl and all but eliminates the Trojans from playoff contention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough pill to swallow,\u201d USC head coach Lincoln Riley said after the game. \u201cYou come as far as this team has come and this program has come in the last 12 months, you get that close to winning a championship and possibly much more.\u201d\n\nTrailing 17-3 with just over 12 minutes to play in the first half, Utah looked every bit a team that had qualified for the title game in each of the last four full seasons. The Utes rattled off 14 straight points to close the opening half, knotting the game at 17 apiece on a four-yard toss from junior quarterback Cameron Rising to senior wide receiver Jaylen Dixon with two seconds left in the half.\n\nRising backed up his mid-October performance with an MVP showing in Vegas, throwing for 310 yards and three scores \u2013 two of which went for 55-plus yards in a second half the Utes dominated 30-7.\n\n\u201c[Utah] certainly played better than us today,\u201d Riley said. \u201cPart of when you get to these moments and these big games, is groups that have been there before, and they certainly have. You got to play well to beat them.\u201d\n\nUSC sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams entered the night as the Heisman Trophy favorite, and he looked every bit of it early on. A pair of 50-plus yard pickups \u2013 a 50-yard connection to redshirt junior wide receiver Tahj Washington and a 59-yard scramble on the ground \u2013 set USC up for its first two scores of the night.\n\nWilliams found Washington again for the first \u2013 who finished the night with a game-high 93 receiving yards and six catches \u2013 and a three-yard toss to freshman running back Raleek Brown put the Trojans up 14-3 with 2:52 to play in the first quarter.\n\nBut the Heisman hopeful injured his hamstring on the aforementioned scramble, and neither Williams nor the Trojan offense was the same the rest of the way.\n\n\u201cYou ever have an old rubber band?,\u201d Williams said of the injury. \u201cYeah, it kinda felt like that.\u201d\n\nWilliams still managed to end the night with a game-high 363 yards through the air with three touchdowns, including a 12-yard toss to sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams that brought the Trojans within three with 10:52 to play.\n\n\u201cIn terms of guys I\u2019ve coached at that position,\u201d Riley said, \u201cit was maybe the gutsiest performance I\u2019ve ever seen. Most guys wouldn\u2019t have even played, and he still gave us a chance.\u201d\n\nBut the Trojans never scored again, managing just 10 points in the final 43 minutes of the contest. USC converted just one of its 12 third-down opportunities Friday night, and the defense could only hold for so long.\n\nThe Utes broke a pair of big runs in the closing six minutes to ice away the Pac-12 Championship \u2013 a 53-yard sprint from redshirt freshman running back Ja\u2019Quinden Jackson and a 23-yarder from sophomore running back Micah Bernard that thrust Utah ahead by 23 points with just under two minutes to play.\n\n\u201cWe kind of held serve there defensively for a while,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI felt like we were in position a lot defensively tonight. We dropped two or three very easy interceptions ... We got way too focused on trying to strip the ball or trying to make big plays as opposed to just getting them on the ground.\u201d\n\nOne year removed from a 4-8 disaster, USC entered the final week of the season inside the committee\u2019s top four. It was just one win from its first-ever appearance in the College Football Playoff. And while the Trojans will not be leaving Las Vegas with that victory, year one of the Lincoln Riley era will still finish with at least 11 wins and a New Year\u2019s Six bowl berth \u2013 both program firsts since 2017.\n```"}

Annenberg Media previously found that three students died over the span of just 17 days from drug-related causes in fall 2019.\n\nAccording to USC\u2019s Chief Student Health Officer Sarah Van Orman, the program aims to provide students with a secure way to dispose of drugs, prescription or otherwise \u2014 no questions asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder as you\u2019re getting ready to clean out your dorm room or apartment to make sure that you properly dispose of any drugs to make sure that they\u2019re not entering the supply or getting into people\u2019s hands for whom they\u2019re not prescribed,\u201d Van Orman said in a student health briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe organizers of the event hope anonymity will encourage students to discard any drugs they have because there is no threat of repercussions or disciplinary actions, as they believe the students\u2019 health comes first.\n\nThis drug take back program is not the first of its kind. The Drug Enforcement Administration also sets two dates each year for nationwide \u201ctake back\u201d days. \u201cThe drug overdose epidemic in the United States is a clear and present public health, public safety and national security threat,\u201d according to the DEA. \u201cDEA\u2019s National Prescription Drug Take Back Day reflects DEA\u2019s commitment to Americans\u2019 safety and health, encouraging the public to remove unneeded medications from their homes as a measure of preventing medication misuse and opioid addiction from ever starting.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the programs provided by student health for students to return their drugs, there are also community-based organizations at USC working to help students struggling with drug-related issues. A team of students founded Team Awareness Combating Overdose (TACO) in 2020 in light of the campus deaths due to overdoses in 2019. Since then, the organization has worked to provide students with research-backed graphics and statistics about drug use.\n\nThe team\u2019s main goal is to maintain a neutral stance on drug use, focusing on educating students about drugs, the potential danger involved and how to use them safely. TACO also provides a service that allows students to order fentanyl test strips for only one cent. According to TACO, fentanyl is involved in about two of every three drug overdoses. It is often laced into other drugs, meaning people accidentally ingest it. Because just two milligrams of fentanyl is lethal, this often results in an overdose.\n\nTACO is creating awareness of this drug\u2019s fatal repercussions as well as informing students about the realities of other mind-altering substances. The test strips, available for just a penny on USC services like Duffl, allow people to quickly test their drugs to make sure that whatever they might take isn\u2019t laced with fentanyl.\n\n\u201cAccording to the CDC, 107,375 people in the United States died of drug overdoses and drug poisonings in the 12-month period ending in January 2022. A staggering 67 percent of those deaths involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl,\u201d according to the DEA.\n\nWith initiatives like Drug Take Back Day and student-run organizations like TACO, the university hopes to combat overdoses and drug abuse within the campus community.

Aimed at the pediatric patients of the LAC + USC Medical Center, the group hopes to provide holiday cheer by writing holiday letters and collecting gifts to send to hospitalized children. Pre-pandemic, Skull and Mortar (SAM) members donated and delivered toys for the toy drive and held fun-filled, in-person hospital visits for kids in need. Since 2020, though, the group has had to limit in-person contact with children and restricts the number of volunteers to only one \u2014 someone who can deliver the toys.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of heartbreaking in a way because although we were able to collect so many toys for them, we weren\u2019t able to be there physically with them,\u201d Natty Sutthirat, the coordinator of last year\u2019s Operation Santa explained. \u201cI feel like our main mission with this event is to make them feel like they\u2019re not alone during this holiday season. So that [was] the only thing that was very difficult for us to see.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to get the USC community more involved this year, SAM expanded Operation Santa\u2019s mission to include writing letters to hospitalized children in addition to collecting toys to be donated to the LAC + USC. \u201cI love being able to see the community come together and donate...to help these kids who really could use a little joy in their life,\u201d Fiona Goh, the president of SAM, said.\n\nThe group plans on delivering all the collected gifts to the children at the LAC + USC Hospital on December 15. \u201cI hope that we can let them know that we are supporting them from afar and bringing the holiday spirit into their hospital room,\u201d Goh said.\n\nFounded in 1930, SAM is one of the oldest service organizations at the USC School of Pharmacy. The group aims to serve the \u201cgeriatric, pediatric and underserved communities of Los Angeles,\u201d according to their website. Reflecting on the organization\u2019s mission and how it relates to Operation Santa, Goh said that the club hopes their efforts will bring some hope to the children whose holiday season might look different this year.\n\n\u201c[The idea behind this initiative] was to bring some joy and some smiles and holiday spirit to these kids who are battling all kinds of sickness,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to be that light for them and hopefully bring some joy to their day with these toys.\u201d\n\nSutthirat hopes that in addition to bringing some much-needed support to vulnerable children, members of the USC community can come together and make an impact. \u201cOperation Santa is not just focused on the people that we\u2019re donating the toys to, but it\u2019s also targeting the entire community to be involved,\u201d Sutthirat said. \u201cIt makes a big impact [because] our community really comes together in this holiday season to try to make a difference in others\u2019 lives.\u201d\n```"}

This small sanctuary of trees with plenty of room for play, sits right on the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and the 2. Cars rush past and a rather unique-looking building that is half former historical post office, half modern theatre with bright orange windows.\n\nToday, in this little oasis amongst the hustle and bustle - and the wealth - of Beverly Hills, kids run to the front to sit right in front of a stage decorated with costumes, instruments and scenery meant to look like a Broadway show. There\u2019s hubbub as staff and performers get everything ready to go. Parents make a final push to corral their kids and finally\u2013 \n\nBackground: \u201cOkay, without further ado - Broadway Babies!\u201d\n\nThis is Sunday Funday, put on monthly by The Wallis Annenberg Center. Aimed at kids - and parents - of all ages, this event is entirely free.\n\nBackground: \u201cWhat is a sitzprobe? Well, a sitzprobe is when the singers rehearse with the orchestra. Oh, when the singers rehearse with an orchestra!\u201d\n\nEspecially considering the nature of what it means to be located in Beverly Hills, parents attending this event - and the artists performing - know just how important free arts programming means.\n\nTiffany, one of the parents who brought her kids and some of their friends along to this month\u2019s Sunday Funday, says she adores opportunities like this.\n\nTiffany: \u201cI think something about things being free just gives opportunity for everyone to experience culture and arts, and I think it\u2019s a privilege. So I\u2019m very grateful that we have this opportunity.\u201d\n\nShe also says free, high-quality arts education was something she was thrilled to find, and something that\u2019s hard to come by in L.A.\n\nTiffany: \u201cWe\u2019re coming from Culver City, but originally from Toronto. We\u2019ve been here for nine weeks now, and we love our arts and culture. We love dance. Two of the girls in our group dance.\u201d\n\nThis month, the program has two acts. The first is a group called Broadway Babies. They teach the basics of live theater to kids of all ages.\n\nNicole Mangi, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, says that arts education is at the heart of their show.\n\nNicole Mangi: \u201cWe really wanted to teach kids about Broadway and...and being.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Leah Sprecher, Broadway Babies\u2019 other co-founder.\n\nLeah Sprecher: \u201cUsing your imagination to create a show wherever you are in your home that you don\u2019t have to have a stage to perform and explore these things that we love, like singing and dancing and acting.\u201d\n\nAnd all the kids get the opportunity to sing, dance and act. On stage, Mangi and Spreker perform against a backdrop of whimsical faux-Broadway sets complete with costume boxes and ukeleles.\n\nRight now, we\u2019re learning about characters though the use of animal puppets.\n\nBackground: \u201cIs this a cow? And what does a cow voice sound like? Moo! Thank you so much I\u2019m very moo-ved to be here.\u201d\n\nMangi and Sprecher say that especially after that pandemic, kids need these live performance outlets to explore creativity and have their own voice. It certainly helps that it\u2019s free.\n\nNicole Mangi: \u201cWhat the Wallis is doing is incredible because it\u2019s offering this free opportunity for anyone to come bring their kids, be exposed to music, theater, arts at such a young age. And it\u2019s it\u2019s so special.\u201d\n\nLeah Sprecher: \u201cTo not only that but have some production value like we have a whole tech crew, like the sound\u2019s great, like it\u2019s that they\u2019re putting effort into it as opposed to just like, you know, out at a park with like none of that infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThey both say that their show in particular encourages teamwork and community. Even a one-man show has a lighting designer, after all.\n\nBackground: \u201cMake sure, as well... (music begins) it it, level wise, good for everyone? We\u2019re good?...\u201d\n\nSunday Funday then moves on to its other and pretty prominent act - teachers from the Emmy winner Debbie Allen\u2019s dance company. Which made an impression on parent Tiffany.\n\nTiffany: \u201cAnd so I used to be a dancer and so I just love being here.\u201d\n\nA recurring guest at Sunday Fundays, the acclaimed Debbie Allen dance company doesn\u2019t just draw in kids. Parents and grandparents also join in for the classes.\n\nBackground: \u201c(music begins) 5, 5, 6, 7, 8.\u201d\n\nThis month, the dance class is on salsa.\n\nBackground: \u201cOne, and two!\u201d\n\nThe most important part of this program, though, is, of course, its target audience.\n\nMelanie: \u201cMy name\u2019s Melanie and I\u2019m seven and a half years old.\u201d\n\nSoleil: \u201cI am Soleil and I am seven years old.\u201d\n\nSoleil says she likes the movement of both theater and dance.\n\nCharlotte Phillipp: \u201cHow did you like the class so far?\u201d\n\nSoleil: \u201cIt was pretty good.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Phillipp: \u201cYeah? What did you like about it?\u201d\n\nSoleil: \u201cThat you got to move your body around a lot.\u201d\n\nAs the show ends, guitars and costumes are packed up along with diaper bags. The only thing most people are thinking about is how tired they are after a morning of play.\n\nBut Mangi says she hopes they were able to provide an outlet for both play and growth for the kids who attended.\n\nNicole Mangi: \u201cThe arts are really a welcoming place for all types of people, and I think a lot of people identify that with that and find a home there and they feel comfortable that they can start to come out of their shell more and feel confident.\u201d\n\nAfter a long day of performance and fun, it becomes clear why programming like this matters. The pandemic, coupled with cuts made to arts programs around the country have made it all the more important to make sure that children have avenues to be creative.\n\nSo, what could be more important than opening this up to all kids for free?\n\nFor the Sunday Funday schedule, check the website at thewallis-dot-org. This program takes place once a month, and, as always, it\u2019s completely free.\n\nFor Ampersand Radio, I\u2019m Charlotte Phillipp.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Nina Moothedath\nDecember 02, 2022 at 2:24 pm PST\n\nWith finals on the horizon, USC students will head into the libraries to do some last-minute cramming and paper writing. While these students likely know that there are librarians that can help them find books and track down academic papers or even films, they might not know about subject librarians \u2014 whose work can help them both inside and beyond the classroom.\n\nSubject librarians, as USC Libraries define them, are specialists in different disciplines and programs at USC. Altogether, they cover over 100 subjects, from robotics and clinical research to family therapy and cinema. They can also help students navigate the over 1,800 databases that USC has access to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think there\u2019s pretty much a librarian for every or almost every area of study [at USC],\u201d science and engineering librarian Cari Kaurloto says. \u201cIf students are doing specific assignments, they can reach out to a librarian who has a really good grasp of the resources needed in that subject area.\u201d\n\nFor USC alum Christopher Aranda, who was recognized with a USC libraries research award for his paper on Disneyland as an example of idealization of the American West, the help he received from reaching out to librarian and instruction coordinator at USC libraries\u2019 special collections Michaela Ullmann was very helpful.\n\n\u201cShe showed me... the little things you can look at when looking at these cultural memory depictions of local histories,\u201d Aranda says. \u201cAll these photos...even correspondence between certain builders, construction workers, Disney himself, his diary entries \u2014 these were all digitized.\u201d\n\nThrough getting help at special collections, Aranda was even able to find a special broadcast that Disneyland put on for its first parade. According to Aranda, getting this help in navigating digital resources, including how to phrase his searches, was a crucial part of the research process.\n\n\u201cThese databases aren\u2019t like going into Google and typing something in,\u201d librarian and visualization specialist Andrzej Rutkowski says. \u201cIf you get guidance from a subject librarian... then you can become sort of a power user of these resources...that your tuition dollars are going to.\u201d\n\nSubject librarians also work in developing online research guides that provide starting points for research. The engineering research guide, for example, includes a citation style guide for students to help with paper writing, and a monthly newsletter with library events and new book announcements.\n\n\u201cWe have access to a lot of information in all types of formats...and it can be overwhelming,\u201d Kaurloto says. \u201cThe thought process behind a research guide is...'how can I curate information into a package?\u2019 My hope is with the research guide if you\u2019re an engineering student, there\u2019s everything you need to know.\u201d\n\nA subject librarian\u2019s work in providing assistance starts even before anyone reaches out to them, according to Rutkowski. They make decisions behind the scenes to select the books and databases that the library purchases, taking into account student and faculty needs, then ensure those resources are made available to the people that need to use them.\n\nFor Rutkowski, who works specifically with social sciences data and information in Los Angeles, part of his behind-the-scenes work includes guiding students to the right datasets to use in their projects. One of these is CalEnviroScreen, which according to the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, helps identify California communities most affected by pollution by measuring statistics like air quality and children\u2019s lead risk from housing.\n\n\u201cI love doing... a workshop on that specific data set with students and seeing how they apply it to different research topics,\u201d Rutkowski says. \u201c[We] see these variables and how [they] might apply it to understanding asthma in South L.A. or understanding pollution between different counties or cities.\u201d\n\nFor Kaurloto, a lot of her work centers around providing support for engineering sections of Writing 340. She gives presentations to these classes on library resources, how to come up with ideas and how to do basic research.\n\n\u201cAfterwards I\u2019ll always get emails from students,\u201d Kaurloto says. \u201cThey\u2019re usually asked to write an \u2018ethics in engineering\u2019 research paper and have to find scholarly resources, so in my sessions, I try to get everyone started...But of course, you don\u2019t know [what you might struggle with] until you do it.\u201d\n\nAside from her work assisting students in writing papers, Kaurloto also receives questions from those seeking assistance outside of their classwork. She says these projects are part of what informs her when she\u2019s deciding what books and resources to bring into the library.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not just a research paper for a class, but you\u2019re interested in extracurricular work, co-curricular work, you\u2019re in a student club or you want to do anything, really,\u201d Kaurloto says. \u201cI really like working with students and hearing directly what people are researching and working on...[so that I can] ensure that the libraries have what you need.\u201d\n\nStudents who need help on papers as they finish up the semester can consider reaching out with their questions.\n\n\u201c[The librarians] definitely love to see any student come in and have a research question, and they help them with it,\u201d Aranda says. \u201cHonestly, it makes the process so much easier and so much more efficient, so don\u2019t be afraid to talk to them.\u201d\n```"}

So we got here extra early. We were the first people at council chambers and we waited at the door for the doors to open. And lo and behold, no one else was here.\u201d\n\nBut the four bench buffer between the public and the council remains as thick as the disconnect between ongoing proceedings and the persistent call for accountability.\n\nAudrey Georg, a member of White People for Black Lives, insists that despite that, its necessary to persist.\n\nAudrey Georg: \u201cWell, yeah, like we could decide it\u2019s not worthwhile to show up when we don\u2019t really have a voice. But when you don\u2019t show up and speak, you\u2019re just normalizing that the community isn\u2019t going to take a stand.\u201d\n\nAnd with that in mind, each activist plays their role arriving to the meeting, calling out the hypocrisy they see taking place until finally being escorted out of the hall. And then they come back to the next meeting, making sure the council members do not get the chance to forget.\n```"}

CNN has quoted world cup chief that at least 450 migrant workers have died as a result of numerous unhealthy and unfair working conditions during the construction of the stadiums in Qatar.\n\nSoccer fan George Gutierrez, a junior studying accounting, expressed concerns about the games in Qatar, but explains why he continues to watch the sporting event.\n\nGeorge Gutierrez: \u201cI\u2019m Latin American and it kind of brings the whole world together in a place. I\u2019m Ecuadorian and the first match was Qatar versus Ecuador. The commentator is speaking about it, but like, when was the last time you seen people from Qatar and people from Ecuador sharing the same space? And I thought that was a really beautiful thing to witness.\u201d\n\nBusiness administration major, Samuel Ramirez watches avidly with some regrets.\n\nSamuel Ramirez: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just like the workers are getting treated with no respect. And not getting like the wages that they deserve. And honestly, the Qatar World Cup shouldn\u2019t have been in Qatar. Like everything is like it was just a money grab for FIFA. I\u2019m a soccer fan and I want to see Messi win a World Cup. I\u2019m also Latino. Like soccer\u2019s a huge thing and Latino culture. Plus, I\u2019m in the middle of finals season and this de-stresses me.\u201d\n\nMarshall senior Jimmy Ong believes that future games should not jeopardize the lives of migrant workers anywhere.\n\nJimmy Ong: \u201cI know Qatar has a lot of Filipino migrant workers, so it\u2019s something that I would be interested to know about and read about. I think the board for the World Cup should reconsider where they host these games in the future, especially in a place where there are a lot of human rights issues.\u201d\n\nOther students addressed the various hardships surrounding the way Qatar has handled hosting the world cup thus far while still rationalizing the importance of the games.\n\nConnor Castro: \u201cI\u2019m a pretty big soccer fan.\u201d Says Psychology major Connor Castro.\n\nConnor Castro: \u201cSo I follow a lot of news agencies who have been reporting primarily about things like the LGBTQ laws and how they\u2019ll kill them if they commit those actions, the migrant workers and how many have died, the poor work conditions they\u2019re going through, the poor equipment that they\u2019ve been using. And just how in Qatar they\u2019ve just been brushing it under or they just don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nBut even those who care can put the atrocities aside in order to root for their team. Castro continues...\n\nConnor Castro: \u201cI think because at the end of the day, it\u2019s still just a sporting event, the location, it doesn\u2019t really matter because it\u2019s just, again, it\u2019s a game. Obviously, the political landscape of how it occurred is very it\u2019s obviously horrible. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s still just 11 people playing soccer.\u201d\n\nThat being said for a lot of people, human rights is not a game.\n```"}

Here\u2019s USC senior Morgan Hill-Edgar.\n\nMorgan Hill-Edgar: \u201cYes, I was definitely patriotic before. I have a lot of belief in America, but I\u2019ve seen more U.S. jerseys pop out.

And everyone is shouting, everyone is speaking with each other. Everyone is talking about the World Cup. Who you support if your country is not in the competition like Greece or Italy or Egypt or Turkey, who will you support? Who is your favorite to win the cup?\u201d\n\nMany countries have already punched their tickets onto the knockout stages and are awaiting their opponents for the next round.

The people marched through campus, stopping at Tommy Trojan. They received many inquisitive stares as participants chanted \u201cZan Zendegi Azadi!\u201d which means \u201cWoman Life Freedom\u201d in Farsi. Mixing English into the mix, they also chanted \u201cSay Her Name\u201d and \u201cNo Iran Regime,\u201d along with \u201cMahsa Amini.\n\nStudents from many different Iranian and Persian student organizations on campus also protested despite fears of retaliation. \u201c[Students are] scared of showing their faces because they don\u2019t want the Iranian government to see. The Islamic Republic can just prohibit them from coming or they can threaten their families,\u201d Chloe Penycae, a graduate student studying global health, said.\n\nOne international Iranian undergraduate student, who chose to remain anonymous for the safety of herself and her family in Iran, said her mother, who was born before the regime began, remembers a time of freedom in their country. The same student then recalled her recent experiences and struggles contacting her family who live in Iran. \u201cWithin the last two weeks, we have [had] no contact with them just because of the internet\u201d she said. The student then says that when phone calls have gone through, oftentimes they have been recorded by the government, who even end her calls mid-sentence at times. \u201cThere has been days where I just could not focus and have to go through my day, just living my life here while also being in constant worry,\u201d she said.\n\nWoman stands in front of Hecuba statue, delivering a speech (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nSome protesters held the old flag of Iran, which depicted a lion and sun in the center, changing in 1980 after the current Iranian regime began in 1979. Protests began in Iran after the death of Mahsa Amani, a 22-year-old Persian woman killed by Iran\u2019s morality police for not wearing clothing in accordance with their laws on September 16, 2022. Since then, there have been daily protests in Iran and movements inside and outside of the country with over 400 dead and 18,000 arrested in over 10 weeks. The most recent and notable protest is the silence by the Iranian national soccer team, who did not sing the national anthem during a match at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nAround 200 universities in the United States and throughout the world rallied in solidarity with the Iranian people. The Iranian Scholars of Liberty organized this movement. It is composed of 76 universities in the US, 22 in Canada, and one in Mexico. Their mission, according to their website, is to \u201camplify the voice of the people of Iran through our network in the diaspora.\u201d\n\nThe Persian community in Los Angeles is one of the largest in the diaspora with over 130,000 living in the region. Following the rally at USC, many rallied at UCLA at 4 p.m. There was also a rally at Cal Poly Pomona.\n\nMany of these rallies are organized through social media. Iranian students at the rally are calling their peers to repost everything they see on their Instagram stories. \u201cCoverage is what we need. The more coverage you get, the more national the more international news coverage will be,\u201d said the international undergraduate student. The rally members recommend using hashtags like #womenlifefreedom, #ZanZendegiAzadi and #MahsaAmani.

You\u2019re welcome. If you haven\u2019t seen it by now, then be warned: there are spoilers ahead. \u201cWakanda Forever\u201d, at its core, tells a story about grief\u2014specifically what grief can do when it goes unaddressed. We watch it turn our irreverent and friendly protagonist into a vindictive war general. We see it isolate friends and foes alike from the people they love in their darkest moments. We even see it divide two nations with common goals and enemies, which serves as the central conflict.\n\nOn November 11, \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d premiered nationwide and immediately broke box office records. Audiences and critics alike had an overwhelmingly positive response to the film\u2014amassing a critic score of 84% and an audience score of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, but the success did not come without its challenges and scandals. USC alum (MFA \u201811) Ryan Coogler returned as director and co-writer, along with Joe Robert Cole as co-writer and USC alum Kevin Feige (BFA \u201895) and Nate Moore as executive producers. Between the star-studded cast and the success of its predecessor, it is a massive understatement to say that this film had large shoes to fill.\n\nIn addition to the typical pressures placed on sequel films, Chadwick Boseman\u2019s unexpected and untimely death presented a unique challenge for the cast and crew: constructing a well-developed and entertaining action film that addresses his passing without folding under the weight of his absence. Was the film successful? Yes...and no.\n\nThe film is just as visually stunning as its 2018 predecessor. The soundtrack, while not as acclaimed as the first film\u2019s, fits the somber mood of the film. However, the factor that elevates \"Wakanda Forever\" beyond being yet another gorgeous but mediocre Marvel film is its stars. Angela Bassett commanded every scene she was in with an effortless ease, perfectly emulating a grieving mother projecting a strong regal image to protect both her kingdom and the remnants of her family. Watching Ramonda\u2019s death at the hands of Namor in theaters felt unnecessarily dark and cruel in a film so saturated with loss in the moment, but it proved to be the blessing in disguise that catalyzed Shuri\u2019s ascent to Black Panther.\n\nLetitia Wright, for all of the behind-the-scenes drama and negative press she fielded, delivered a commendable performance as the grieving young princess forced to take up the mantle of Black Panther. Her journey of learning to process her trauma rather than try to outrun or outwork it is one many will find relatable, along with the descent that follows her refusal to lean on her circle for support. Tenoch Huerta was equal parts magnetic and menacing as the Mayan sea god Namor, who is haunted by the loss of his mother and the threat of exploitation and murder to his community Talokan. Like Killmonger before him, his reasons for being a menace to society are justified enough; his worries for his people reflect many of the issues Wakanda faces following the in-universe death of T\u2019Challa.\n\nFor the most part, the supporting cast showed out. Danai Gurira is excellent as Okoye, imbuing the general\u2019s trademark stiff and aloof demeanor with a subtle melancholy that works to the character\u2019s advantage rather than its detriment. Lupita N\u2019yongo brought a similar nuance to Nakia opposite the grief-ridden Shuri and Ramonda. Dominique Thorne as Riri Ironheart was an excellent addition to the cast. Michaela Coel\u2019s Aneka brought much-needed levity to the Dora Milaje. Winston Duke\u2019s M\u2019Baku, for his part, was the perfect blend of the voice of reason and comic relief. I look forward to his implied villainous turn in the third installment.\n\nUnfortunately, that is where the commendations end. Several members of the cast failed to move me due to poor narrative choices. Namora (Mabel Cadena) is a formidable second-in-command to Namor and interesting to watch, but her character isn\u2019t given enough to do to invest the audience in her lore or her place in Namor\u2019s story beyond her fight scenes and brief dialogue. Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) is charming and bumbling as ever, but his scenes and storyline felt inconsequential and tonally misplaced within the film\u2019s generally somber atmosphere. Luckily for them, their questionable narrative use does not detract enough from the main story to leave a lasting impression in either direction; in a film like this, no lasting impression is better than a bad one.\n\nI found Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s character to be wholly unnecessary. If they were going to try to convince the audience that this woman was a compelling force of conflict or a genuine thorn for Ross, they could have given him a scene partner he had at least comedic chemistry with. Despite decent acting from both Freeman and Louis-Dreyfus, I found their history difficult to believe and counted down the minutes until their scenes ended.\n\nI was disappointed by Michael B. Jordan\u2019s performance. Though his screen time was brief, he had an opportunity to act as a compelling foil of a man consumed by the need for vengeance and an omen for what Shuri could (and briefly did) become if she didn\u2019t properly contend with her grief. Instead, Killmonger appeared as a self-righteous, bloodthirsty, and mildly irritable man who Shuri understandably would not and could not see herself in.\n\nAdditionally, I found myself frustrated by the concessions the plot made to accommodate the ghost of T\u2019Challa. There was an understanding entering the theater that T\u2019Challa\u2019s presence would be felt though Boseman is no longer with us\u2014a recurring sentiment echoed throughout the film\u2014but the amount of scene time allotted for paying tribute bordered on overkill. The funeral sequences were apt and appropriate. The mural of him in the Golden City made sense for the setting. The frequent mentions were inevitable. But having him abandon a son\u2014also named T\u2019Challa\u2014in death for reopened the door for a male Black Panther hindered the effectiveness of Shuri\u2019s Black Panther arc and essentially undermined her position as the new Black Panther; rather than celebrate the significance of a woman taking up the Black Panther mantle, her progress was now in a position to be understood as a temporary solution until the traditional Black male successor can take over.\n\nIt is also very possible that my frustration about the handling of Shuri\u2019s arc stems from the fact that the staggering amount of care and attention that went into honoring T\u2019Challa at her expense wasn\u2019t enough to halt the progression of the #RecastTChalla movement. A Change.org petition advocating for the role of T\u2019Challa to be recast, which is still active as of publishing, has received over 62,000 signatures. Support for this movement, referred to in online spaces as #RecastTChalla, grew momentum as Chadwick Boseman\u2019s brother Derrick claims that recasting the role is what Chadwick \u201cwould have wanted\u201d in a TMZ article\u2014only noting at the very end that Chadwick never expressed any opinion on what should become of T\u2019Challa before his passing.\n\nIn a film riddled with on and off-screen casualties, the most disappointing was the opportunity for fans to mourn their expectations for T\u2019Challa\u2019s \"Wakanda Forever\". Instead, they\u2014much like Shuri in the aftermath of Ramonda\u2019s death\u2014are too blinded by their grief of the \u201cBlack male superhero\u201d to understand the implications of leveraging Boseman\u2019s passing in protest of a nearly two-year-old decision.\n\nGripes aside, \u201cWakanda Forever\u201d is not an experience you want to miss out on. Bring tissues and prepare to witness an emotional reckoning\u2014perhaps, one that challenges you to be more intentional about your own healing journey.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Adam Hunger)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel\nDecember 01, 2022 at 10:51 pm PST\n\nAfter a Thanksgiving full of football and a very eventful Sunday slate, we\u2019re back to diving into fantasy football as the playoffs quickly approach. I may have two final exams tomorrow, but you didn\u2019t really think that\u2019d stop me, right? As we head into Week 13, allow me to bring to your attention possibly the most exciting afternoon slate of the season coming this Sunday.\n\nFirst, the Miami Dolphins are making the cross-country trip to take on the 49ers. Miami head coach Mike McDaniel, another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 from the Kyle Shanahan coaching tree, gets his first crack at his former mentor. The Dolphins have had one of the league\u2019s most explosive offenses, but they\u2019ll get a real litmus test this weekend \u2014 the San Francisco defense is arguably the best unit in the NFL.\n\nThen, the Chiefs and Bengals will kick off in Cincinnati. These two teams played two absolute classics last season, one in Week 17 and another in the AFC Championship. Both ended with the Chiefs just falling short. Kansas City will have a chance to exact revenge, and we\u2019ll get to see another duel between Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes, two of the league\u2019s most exciting young QBs. You can bet these games have some fantasy ripple effects.\n\nMike White Magic is Back\n\nEveryone remembers \u201cMoney Mike\u201d from last season, right? When Zach Wilson was injured last year, the Western Kentucky alum saw his first career NFL start against the Cincinnati Bengals. White led the 1-5 Jets to a 34-31 victory over the Bengals in a complete shootout. Yes, the same Bengals who went on to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. He was unfazed by one of the NFL\u2019s best offenses and beat them at their own game, going 37-of-45 passing for 405 yards and three touchdowns. He also threw for the most yards of any NFL QB that week.\n\nThis season, the Jets are much improved, but Wilson seemed to be holding them back all season. After some poorly worded comments (to put it nicely) in his press conference following the Jets 10-3 loss to the Patriots on Nov. 20, Wilson was benched. Enter Mike White once again.\n\nIn his first start of the season, White gave Jets fans just what they wanted. He went 22-of-28 passing for 315 yards and 3 touchdowns as his name echoed throughout the MetLife Stadium crowd. His performance earned him 24.8 fantasy points last week, and he is the starter for the foreseeable future in New York.\n\nThis Jets team is legit, and while White likely is not the franchise guy, he\u2019s a smart QB who can run offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur\u2019s offense. Also, he\u2019s got new toys like receiver Garrett Wilson around him. He\u2019s still barely rostered and is a solid option if you need to stream a QB or are just looking for a signal-caller with high upside. He has some favorable pass defenses coming up on the schedule.\n\nComeback Corey\n\nThe return of Mike White coincided with Corey Davis\u2019 return from injury as well. The wideout was the WR1 for the Jets when White played last season, so the chemistry is already there. It has been a disappointing season so far for Davis, but look for that to change now that there\u2019s another QB in New York.\n\nDavis is clearly the WR2 now behind the rookie stud Wilson, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t help your team out. Last week White showed he wanted to distribute the ball, completing passes to 10 different players! While Davis was only targeted three times, he played a large majority of the snaps, so more touches will come. Plus, Wilson really breaking out means that there will be less attention on Davis than there was last season, likely giving him more opportunities to find open space.\n\nDavis is also a tall pass-catcher and has proven to have big-play ability. He is available in most leagues, and as I said with White, the Jets are playing some weak pass defenses to round out the year. So, he could have some huge games down the stretch.\n\nReally? Another Niners\u2019 Running Back?\n\nThat\u2019s right. We might have a new viable fantasy running back in San Francisco. Elijah Mitchell is expected to miss the rest of the fantasy season with an injury, and Christian McCaffrey is questionable for Sunday\u2019s contest against the Dolphins after not practicing on Wednesday. This leaves Jordan Mason.\n\nA rookie who has seen only 10 carries all season as the possible RB1 for San Francisco. Even if McCaffrey suits up, we all know that the second running back in a Kyle Shanahan offense sees their fair share of touches. This means that Mason is not only a great handcuff opportunity for this coming week, but is a high-risk/high-reward player going forward.\n\nHe\u2019s rostered in a miniscule 1.5% of ESPN leagues, so if your playoff spot is locked up and you\u2019re looking for some possible depth at running back, let him fill that open slot on your bench.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still over a month away from the NFL playoffs, we\u2019re only a few weeks away from fantasy playoffs. Whether you\u2019re going for first place or just trying to avoid being last, the next few weeks are key for bolstering your lineups before the postseason.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

While the bill has been praised as a step forward for LGBTQ equity, there are underlying implications that may have serious impacts on future couples. Colton Lucas has more details on where the bill may fall short.\n\nWith passage of the Respect for Marriage Act in the Senate, current and future granted marriage licenses for interracial and same-sex couples will likely soon be recognized in every state under federal law. Democratic members of Congress have pushed for passage of the Respect for Marriage Act since 2009, when the bill was first introduced by New York representative Jerold Nadler. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to reverse Roe v. Wade, the bill has seen a resurgence. Democrats and republicans alike have feared the court\u2019s ability to reverse the legalization of same-sex and interracial marriages.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor this morning the bipartisan bill would prove to be a step in the right direction.\n\nCHUCK SCHUMER: \u201cThe Senate will vote to pass the Respect for Marriage act, putting it on the brink of reaching the president\u2019s desk. In many ways, the story of America has been a difficult but an execrable march toward greater equality. Sometimes we\u2019ve taken steps forward, other times, unfortunately we\u2019ve taken disturbing steps backward. But today after months of hard work, after many rounds of bipartisan talks and after many doubts that we could even reach this point, we are taking the momentous step forward for greater justice for LGBTQ Americans.\u201d\n\nIf passed by the House and signed by President Biden, the bill would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, make same-sex and interracial marriages federally recognized and provide additional liberties for religious groups. While Democratic leaders have praised the bill, there\u2019s also growing concern it wouldn\u2019t do enough to protect LGBTQ people. Every state would have to federally recognize same-sex marriage licenses, which is already the practice thanks to the 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. But if the Supreme Court\u2019s current conservative majority reverses that ruling, the right for same-sex couples to obtain a marriage license would be null in states where it hasn\u2019t already been legalized.\n\nAdditionally, the bill would allow religious non-profits to refuse services to same-sex couples. The bill gained support from several religious organizations, including the Church of Latter Day Saints, which has praised the bills religious exemptions.\n\nWith bipartisan success in the Senate, it\u2019s likely to pass in the House, where it previously passed by a vote of 267 to 157 in July. Though the future of the Respect for Marriage Act still remains unknown, there\u2019s no denying the bill will have major impacts for queer and trans folks nationwide.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Colton Lucas.\n```"}

The new format will consist of 12 total teams, with slots for the six highest-ranked conference champions, as well as six at-large slots for the best remaining teams. This introduces an interesting wrinkle to the often-repetitive playoff, as at least one non-power five team is guaranteed a bid.\n\n\u201cMore teams and more access means more excitement for fans, alumni, students and student athletes,\u201d CFP director Bill Hancock said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate the leaders of the six bowl games and the two future national championship game host cities for their cooperation. Everyone realized that this change is in the best interest of college football and pulled together to make it happen.\u201d\n\nThe expansion was first announced in September to begin in 2026. CFP\u2019s Management Committee had aimed for an earlier start, but the Rose Bowl remained as a final holdout over a disagreement on television time slots. Traditionally, the Rose Bowl has always been guaranteed its preferred time slot of 2 p.m. PST / 5 p.m. ET, ensuring the sun would set over the San Gabriel Mountains during the game. But as reported by ESPN yesterday, the Rose Bowl was essentially given an ultimatum: give up their guaranteed time or give up their role in the playoff.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re partners with the Rose Bowl and I have great respect for the Rose Bowl,\u201d Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren said in an interview with ESPN. \u201cI didn\u2019t take it at all personal that they were holding anything up. They\u2019ve been one of the key components of the college football postseason championship, from the BCS to the CFP.\u201d\n\nHome playoff games will also make their debut to the CFP under the new format. The expansion provides four byes for the four highest-ranked conference champions. The next four highest-ranked teams will host first-round matchups in their home stadiums (or another site of their choice) for advancement to the quarter finals, which will take place at \u201ccontract bowls\u201d like the Rose Bowl.\n\nThe decision should provide a bit of solace for Trojan fans who are worried about USC\u2019s future in the Big Ten. The new format is the first one which makes it feasible for non-conference champions to win a national championship, meaning that USC will have room for error to make the playoffs in their first year as a member of a more competitive conference.\n\nThe new format provides more teams with a fair shot at the playoff by reducing the drastic impact of conference championships. If the new format were to be applied to this year\u2019s rankings, three total teams from the Big Ten \u2014 Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State \u2014 would compete in the playoff. This fixes a long-criticized flaw in the current CFP system: under the current four-team format, a team that does not play in their conference\u2019s championship can gain advantage over a team that makes the championship, but loses. This essentially punishes some teams for earning a berth in their conference championship, as they would\u2019ve been better off not participating to avoid an additional loss.\n\nFor example, if either TCU or USC were to lose their conference championship games this weekend, Ohio State would make the playoff without even competing for, let alone winning, a Big Ten title. Under the new format, Ohio State would have already clinched a playoff spot regardless, and neither USC or TCU would be at risk of losing their slot with a loss in their respective conference championships.\n\n\u201cA new era of college football is about to begin,\u201d said Hancock. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Christian Fulton and Cami Twomey\nDecember 01, 2022 at 5:03 pm PST\n\nThe Trojans made it to the Pac-12 Championship where they will face Utah in their fourth championship game on Friday at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. With USC advancing to number four in the College Football Playoff rankings, many USC students are making the trek to Las Vegas to support their team and enjoy the last weekend before finals.\n\nFor Jack Doss, a junior studying business, attending the game was a no-brainer, especially as the Trojans usher in a new era under Coach Lincoln Riley. \u201cI got my $150 plane ticket and I\u2019m going in and out [of] Vegas in 14 hours,\u201d Doss said. \u201cWe gotta show out for our team and Heisman candidate to get Allegiant rocking.\u201d\n\nAfter several years of less than stellar performances, the prospect of securing USC\u2019s first Pac-12 win since 2017 \u2014 coupled with the potential for star quarterback Caleb Williams to cement his Heisman campaign \u2014 has generated buzz around the upcoming game.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere of the game and the entire 24 hours is bound to be sensational,\u201d Avery Bystrom, a sophomore studying environmental studies and cinematic arts, said. Las Vegas is over 270 miles from Los Angeles but many passionate USC fans have no qualms about traveling to support the team.\n\nBlaze Maier, a junior business major, is eager to watch the Trojans secure a spot in the College Football Playoffs. \u201cThe excitement surrounding this team is palpable,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get out to Vegas and watch our Trojans rebound off our only loss of the season and stomp all over the Utes.\u201d\n\nUSC has something to prove with this particular game. When USC played Utah earlier in the season, Utah managed to triumph with a 43-42 win, USC\u2019s only loss of the season. The Utes hope to achieve back-to-back Pac-12 Championship wins after they secured the title in 2021.\n\nSophomore Katherine Beagan explained that she was traveling to the game to show her support for the team from the stands. \u201cI think this is a really special year for USC football because of their successful record which definitely helps to excite students and motivate them to travel with the team and cheer them on,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile many students are only taking a short day trip for the game, some students are planning to spend the weekend and enjoy all Las Vegas has to offer before finals week. Luckily, Las Vegas has no shortage of attractions for students of all ages to experience.\n\nFor students under 21 who are thrill seekers, the SRAT Skypod offers three rides: STRAT\u2019s Insanity, Big Shot and Scream X. These rides are designed to shake, drop and terrify people over 1,000 feet above the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nIf you want to enjoy Las Vegas from new heights without an adrenaline rush, the High Roller Ferris Wheel gives participants a 360 view of the Strip and the Las Vegas skyline in glass cabins 550 feet above the ground.\n\nThe Strip and Fremont Street allow visitors to experience all the energy, eats and entertainment Las Vegas has to offer with their feet still safely on the ground. Another attraction is Meowulf\u2019s Omega Mart, an immersive psychedelic art experience hidden behind a secret entrance in a fake grocery store.\n\nFor USC students over 21, it\u2019s well known that the Strip has no shortage of fun to offer. Many students are looking forward to attending a Martin Garrix performance at the Omnia Nightclub to hopefully celebrate the Trojans\u2019 triumph over Utah.\n\nIf students are planning to indulge in the gambling capital of the world, they can try their luck at sports betting at the MGM Grand. Win or lose, Friday is bound to be an unforgettable experience for Trojan fans in Las Vegas.\n```"}

His musical style has evolved from his first single \u201cSenior Spring\u201d to his most recent release \u201cBig MF Energy\u201d as he grew up himself. Each of Sumit\u2019s songs develop an emotion, energy and feeling that relates to the experience of being at his live shows. He creates a \u201chigh energy\u201d brand from his music to performances to merch.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with Sumit to learn more about his inspirations, creative process and musical goals.\n\nSumit: My name is Sumit. I grew up in Shanghai, China, and I am in the Iovine and Young Academy. I\u2019m a senior. I guess I would say broadly speaking, I\u2019m an artist, which for me that\u2019s mainly recording vocals and, obviously, the songwriting and then a little bit of production, usually with a producer.\n\nI don\u2019t believe I make uniquely great music. I think I\u2019m a uniquely energetic performer, and so I structure my songs with that in mind. They\u2019re all really short. They\u2019re all very punchy. They\u2019re all very energetic and I always imagine how I would perform it live.\n\nWhen I was 10, I found the Kanye album. God, this is just, it\u2019s just not the right time and place to be saying these artists\u2019 names. But when I was ten, in 2010, I found the Kanye album, \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\u201d which is like a basic answer for like the greatest hip-hop album of all time.\n\nBut I was this little Indian kid, and I was being raised in a very classic Indian household of like, you\u2019re going to be an engineer, you\u2019re going to be a doctor, you\u2019re going to be a lawyer. And I\u2019d play, obviously, violin and classical piano.\n\nSo hearing that album, I was blown away. Even at 10 years old when you don\u2019t know anything about sampling or the music industry, which, knowing this stuff now, I\u2019m amazed when I hear that album.\n\nBut the fact that as a 10-year-old, I could hear the album and still be like, \u2018damn, this is incredible.\u2019 Because, you know, using people\u2019s voices as instruments and sampling things from the \u201870s and \u201860s, it blew my mind.\n\nAnd so I think that taught me to look at music from a much broader lens than classical piano and violin. And from there, I started listening to mainly, hip-hop, rap, R&B and it was just natural that I started writing my own stuff and a lot of it was butt, like it was really bad.\n\nAnd so I would just get beats from YouTube and have this really bad mic, just really bad equipment and I would just record a song and be like, \u201cWow, this is sick.\u2019 And everyone would be like \u2018mmm.\u201d\n\nAnd 15-year-old me was like, \u2018Dude, check out my SoundCloud.\u2019 Which you still can, some of the demos are still up.\n\nAnd I think when I got to college, I realized that there are a lot of people around me that are much better at the sides of music that I didn\u2019t know much about, like production and making artwork and marketing things.\n\nAnd so I learned from a lot of these people and I didn\u2019t do anything by myself. Even though as an artist, I\u2019m the brand. Like, I work with my buddy Simon on almost all my songs and he produced the first one and the second one and the third one.\n\nMy friend Mya did a lot of the artwork, and Joel and Shantanu did a lot of the videos and stuff, and so having that sort of team around me really helped me make a much more, I would say professional artist brand.\n\nAnd once again, it was literally all based off of emotion and energy. My first song to the song I just released last night. It doesn\u2019t sound extremely different in terms of the feeling you\u2019re getting.\n\nThat was called \u201cSenior Spring.\u201d Yeah, so that was at my high school. I went to a really preppy high school called Exeter. It\u2019s a boarding school. But they had a music studio and I was like, \u2018This is kind of lit.\u2019\n\nSo I found like the three people there out of this, like a 1000-person school that actually also liked making music that wasn\u2019t classical music. And this one kid named Hoj, shout out him. He had this beat that had a guitar, and I was like, \u2018Whoa. Like, I could try, not just rapping for a second.\u2019\n\nAnd so I didn\u2019t really sing, but I tried and it ended up not half bad. And I took a picture of my dog in my backyard and my girlfriend at the time drew a crown on it. And that was the cover art.\n\nAnd I think that shows how little I knew about music and branding, and I didn\u2019t even know how to put it on Spotify until I got to college. And when I put it on Spotify, which is crazy because I now work for a distribution startup that does all this stuff and like I know all that by heart now, but I used this thing called TuneCore and they uploaded it to a profile of someone named Sumit, but not me.\n\nSo I had a mini release party in my dorm room and then everyone was confused because it was on some random person\u2019s Spotify page. And yeah, it was, it was an experiment, but it taught me a lot in terms of like distribution, blah, blah.\n\nAnd there\u2019s like three people who still message me to this day like, \u2018I love this song so much. I play it every pre-game.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Really? Like you can listen to my newer songs or other music\u2019 and they just love it.\n\nI think that\u2019s the unique thing about music is that, you know, like this song might speak to three people randomly and my next song might speak to another three people randomly, and they\u2019ll just stick with it.\n\nOh, man. I was just trying to make a song. Again, I knew nothing about styles. I didn\u2019t even tweak the beat at all. This was the stage where I knew so little that I just got a beat and put vocals on it and tried to mix my vocals well.\n\nBut yeah, it\u2019s pretty chilled. It\u2019s relaxed. It gives West Coast energy, even though I\u2019d never been to the West Coast before.\n\nMy friend Simon, he showed me Baby Keem when I first came to college, and he was not famous at all. And he has a song called \u201cMOSHPIT.\u201d And I was like, \u2018This is incredible.\u2019 Like, I don\u2019t care at all about what he\u2019s saying. I\u2019m only listening to his voice as kind of like another instrument on this beat and I\u2019m getting a really energetic feeling, and this is what I love about music.\n\nAnd so I was like, \u2018Simon play a beat,\u2019 and Simon played a beat, and it was literally just heavy 808 like... It was like \u2018It\u2019s a mosh pit\u2019 and it\u2019s the dumbest lyric and it\u2019s the dumbest thing ever. But it worked and it carried a lot of energy.\n\nAnd that was our first song. And so Baby Keem inspired me to put out that first song. And I think even up until now with, you know, him being a big mainstream artist, like, I love the way he gets bored and switches things up in his songs.\n\nThat really inspires me. I love the way he changes his voice and uses a lot of vocal range, even though he\u2019s not a singer. And I\u2019d say he\u2019s definitely my biggest musical inspiration.\n\nYeah, that one\u2019s unique, because I think that that one stands out in the songs I\u2019ve put out in that it\u2019s not a trap, like hip-hop rapping song. It\u2019s more instrumentation. It\u2019s a little bit more funky. And there\u2019s this producer, who goes by ROHO. He\u2019s lit. Check him out.\n\nOr another friend of mine, Aly, who goes by Lackhoney currently, but I think that will change, sent me this pack by this kid, ROHO. And it was all beats I\u2019ve never heard that style before. It was very\u2013I don\u2019t even know how to describe it- like a little bit, not funky, but very instrumentation driven, like very alternative percussion.\n\nAnd it really helps me as an artist to find like pockets when I\u2019m writing and stuff like that and find melodies and, and find little flows that I wouldn\u2019t normally find in like a classic 808 and hi-hats beat.\n\nAnd I think that was really cool because when I heard it, like I make music, again going back to the performance things, I make music around sound bites. Right, like I want like a 5, 10 second snippet. This is not the same as TikTok marketing. I want like a bunch of 10 second snippets in the song that sound really fun.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, I want to hear that again,\u2019 Right, so I literally sat with the beat and I tried to come up with different hooks. And then finally I was just like, [lyrics]. \u2018Oh, wow, that might sound fire.\u2019 And it did and I recorded it, and that\u2019s all I had.\n\nAnd I just sent the demo of me going, \u2018She don\u2019t.\u2019 That\u2019s also how right by the way I write by mumbling. And then I put lyrics in which you can tell because my lyrics suck. I\u2019ll just be like [lyrics] and then I put lyrics in that went with that flow.\n\nAnd I sent it to my friends and I didn\u2019t put any verses or anything and they\u2019re like, and I fell asleep and I woke up to like six FaceTime calls and they\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, I didn\u2019t even know you can make music like that. And I was like, \u2018All I do is mumble.\u2019\n\nAnd [they were] like, \u2018No you got to finish. You got to finish it.\u2019 So I was like, \u2018Okay, okay.\u2019 And then I heard the beat and I wrote the verse like, \u2018Let me step into the limelight.\u2019 Again, just purely going off of like nodding my head, what sounds good? What kind of flow would I listen to?\n\nSo when you actually asked me like what my role is in music, I think above all else, I\u2019m a consumer. And I think that really shapes the way I shape my shows and my songs that like if I\u2019m listening to this, would I enjoy it?\n\nSo I purely, purely approach it from that perspective. And so that\u2019s how I write. Right, if I\u2019m listening to this, what would I want to hear? And then I put lyrics on it and then send it back to the guy, Aly, Lackhoney, who sent me the beat and he put a verse on it, he\u2019s fire.\n\nAnd then I made some cool artwork. Again, artwork in the style that I\u2019d never done before because it was a song I\u2019d never done in that style before and I think it worked really well.\n\nI think a lot of people like that\u2019s their favorite song of mine because it\u2019s not just me, you know, rapping on a trap beat, even though I love that, but yeah.\n\nAnd so yeah, I love experimenting. I really wanted to get into, like, rock music pretty recently. So Paris Texas, they\u2019re dope hip-hop rock artists.\n\nYeah, because again, what drew me to a lot of rock music was like the moments. Like in \u201cThunderstruck\u201d by ACDC, basic song, people are going to hate me after these. There\u2019s like [sings]. And I was like, \u2018That gives me a feeling like I want to recreate that feeling.\u2019 [sings] It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, I want to recreate that.\u2019\n\nAgain, and it\u2019s shaped around live. Like, I played my last show with the band, but, it was really fun being able to, like I played rock covers. I opened to \u201cSeven Nation Army\u201d and I closed with \u201cAin\u2019t No Rest For The Wicked\u201d by Cage the Elephant.\n\nAnd people had so much fun. And I was like, \u2018Man, what if I made music like this?\u2019 Yeah, but that was some of the favorite live sets I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nI approach performing from the lens of if I have no idea who this kid Sumit is, which most people don\u2019t because I\u2019m small. So, I try and stay humble in that way of like, and I\u2019m coming to this show. How do I make that person, that like mom from Kansas, have fun?\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s how I approach every live show. So I did a skit at the beginning of my Springfest set. I think my Springfest set is the primary example of like the perfect set.\n\nI did a skit, right? So immediately you\u2019re watching and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s happening on the show? It\u2019s not just music playing with the band.\u2019 And I\u2019m trying to think about who inspired me to do a skit and it\u2019s not anything new.\n\nA lot of people have done it. And then on the second, oh, I started with a cover- kind of a cover. I used to do these TikTok remixes, which semi-blew up, like I did one on Rico Nasty\u2019s. \u201cOHFR?\u201d song.\n\nBut I open with that because I got like two million views on TikTok and Rico Nasty commented and reposted it. That\u2019s again it\u2019s like half my music half not my music. So people are like, \u2018Wow, this is sick.\u2019\n\nAnd then for one of my songs, I have a bunch of people just mob on stage in like the same uniform and everything and it\u2019s crazy energy because even if you don\u2019t know the song, I mean, A, you\u2019re jumping because it\u2019s really fun energy and B, you\u2019re like, \u2018Whoa, what\u2019s going on? Like, what is happening?\u2019 It looks so cool.\n\nSo I think what inspired me there was Kanye\u2019s 2015 BET performance, where he did, I know there\u2019s a clip of him doing \u201cAll Day,\u201d his song, and he has just like 50 people on stage behind him just wearing black and half of them are really famous, so it\u2019s kind of cool.\n\nAnd then what inspired me again to do that was AG Club when they performed at Welcome Back, shout out AG Club. They had just dudes running around on stage the whole time and it was sick. I didn\u2019t even know who was performing and it was like, \u2018This is insane energy.\u2019 It looked really cool.\n\nSo that\u2019s what inspired me there. Yeah, it\u2019s just really fun seeing people, like, sing your songs back to you, even if it\u2019s like 10 out of a 500-person crowd and you, like, make eye contact. \u2018Wow, they know the lyrics.\u2019 So I think that\u2019s really cool. That\u2019s really rewarding.\n\nAnd, this is such a stupid thing to brag about, but I\u2019m just going to say it. Sometimes I\u2019ll be somewhere, like on campus. Oh, actually, this is the coolest thing. I went to a party two weeks ago. It was this rave thing downtown, mainly USC kids.\n\nAnd this dude was wearing my shirt like a merch piece of mine and didn\u2019t know who I was. I didn\u2019t know how he had it. My friend was like, \u2018Do you know, like, the person on that shirt?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u201cThis is a person?\u201d And so I think it\u2019s cool that my merch has reached people that don\u2019t even know who I am, which I guess is a good thing and a bad thing, \u2018cause yeah, I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\nLast night I dropped a song after a year. And I think a big thing is that, because I like doing live so much, I hated making music. And it\u2019s just, any artist will tell you this, like to be a full, committed artist you have to fall so in love with the process of not just jamming and finding a cool new melody or hearing a new beat for the first time.\n\nBut, sitting with one verse and rewriting it and rerecording it and remixing it for hours. And that was just something where I was like, I\u2019m working two jobs. I\u2019m in school. I didn\u2019t have the mental, I had the time maybe if I carved it out. I didn\u2019t have the mental energy to just sit in a room and finish a song.\n\nSo the song I released last night, I recorded the first version of it like a year and a half ago, and it\u2019s been in my notes and I was like, \u2018What do I have to do to finish this?\u2019 So I was like, \u2018What are some moments that I think are fun?\u2019 So I added an intro, a radio intro.\n\nI added this part where I just cut the beat and change the flow entirely, and I think it sounds cool. And I added a clip of Springfest into the song.\n\nAnd I sat with the mix and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m just going to do this once.\u2019 So I sat with the mix, mixed it. And then I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to change this.\u2019 Because I think with all art like movies, music, everything, there\u2019s never a final version. There\u2019s just a version that you put out, right?\n\nAnd then you kind of just stop working on it. I think directors will say this, every artist of kind of any sort of medium will say this, is that you\u2019re never done working on something there\u2019s just a moment where you put it out and that\u2019s just what we call \u2018done,\u2019 right?\n\nIt is like when everyone else is consuming it. Because for every one of these songs, I could have sat there and made it better. That\u2019s the really hard process about making music.\n\nAnd also to that effect, like, I don\u2019t even make that high quality of music per say, so I don\u2019t even care that much about that. But it\u2019s torturing to just sit in a room and like, \u2018How do I make this better? How does this reverb on this ad lib at this part of this song match with whatever?\u2019 Like, it\u2019s just like it\u2019s so in the weeds.\n\nAnd I think my biggest challenge as an artist was finding the time to make the music I need to make. I think a lot of artists have, like, hundreds of demos, and I don\u2019t. I maybe have dozens and I don\u2019t like a lot of them.\n\nAnd so yeah, for me it\u2019s been being in the studio and being a musical artist. I just like, I like a lot of the other stuff. I like performing. I like branding myself. I like making skits. I like doing live shows.\n\nAnd so, yeah, that\u2019s probably my biggest challenge is like getting in the studio and making music.\n\nIt\u2019s really fun. So the song in my notes was called \u201cBing Bong Freestyle.\u201d And literally, when you listen to it, I think you\u2019ll understand that it\u2019s not what it\u2019s called now.\n\nSo I"}

The team earned a 1-0 victory thanks to an intense goal by forward Christian Pulisic. In his follow-through, Pulisic collided with Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand. Pulisic was transported to the hospital before the end of the game and was diagnosed with a pelvic contusion. In an interview with Jenny Taft, Pulisic said he is doing everything he can to prepare for the next match.\n\nIn Group B, the U.S. team finished second behind England\u2019s national team. Evelyn Paniagua, a junior studying communication, was watching the game when the U.S. scored the winning goal. \u201cI thought it was pretty good that the U.S. is developing in a sport that they\u2019re not very prominent [in],\u201d she said. Many viewed the USMNT as \u201cunderdogs\u201d going into the competition. The U.S. team began competing in the inaugural World Cup in 1930, but have not qualified for 11 of the 21 games including the previous tournament in 2018. The team is yet to win a World Cup.\n\n\u201cPeople have them as the underdog to win it all, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d freshman Marco Alvarez said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that really happens.\u201d U.S. fans are excited to see their team this far into the competition. \u201cI feel like my patriotism is really coming out every four years with the Olympics and the World Cup,\u201d Miles Collins, a junior studying business, said. \u201cSo right now, my patriotism is here to stay.\u201d\n\nWith the U.S.\u2019s presence in the World Cup this year, many fans are hopeful that the sport will pick up more popularity domestically. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a strong male team for most of what I remember, so it\u2019s exciting. I mean, I\u2019m personally not a huge U.S. fan,\u201d Haylie Murray, a junior who backs Germany, said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s cool to see soccer become a little bit bigger in the U.S. just because of that.\u201d\n\nLola Mafoud, a junior studying cognitive science, was skeptical about the U.S. team advancing. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to get knocked out in the next round,\u201d said Mafoud, who played soccer for 14 years and is a fan of the Brazilian team. \u201cI think they\u2019re done there unless Pulisic pulls out a miracle, and I don\u2019t know that he has it in him at the current moment.\u201d Other students expressed similar sentiments. For example, senior Lauren Faust who has played soccer for 15 years said that she doesn\u2019t think the team has the \u201ctalent\u201d to go much further.\n\nIn the knockout stage that begins with 16 teams, the U.S. faces a make-or-break situation in which winners advance and losers are eliminated. They play the Netherlands at 7 a.m. PST on Saturday. The match can be streamed on FOX and Telemundo.\n```"}

The protests were sparked by the deaths of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini and 16-year-old Nika Shakarami at the hands of Iranian morality police in September. Those who go against the stringent rules enforced by the police risk arrest or even death.\n\nGroups at USC have been holding weekly protests in solidarity with those protesting in Iran. USC biomedical engineering student Niki Tavakoli, whose family is from Iran, joined the protest on USC\u2019s campus today, waving the lion and sun flag. This flag was an emblem of Iran for thousands of years, but was replaced by a flag representing the Islamic regime during the Iranian Revolution in 1979.\n\nNiki Tavakoli: \u201cTwo months ago, a young woman was killed, murdered in Iran because some hair was showing outside of her hijab, which is mandatory to wear in Iran. There is no freedom to wear what you want. You say what you want.

Not only was the design concept changed with monogrammed designs being at the forefront, but there is the added element of users being assigned a listening personality.\n\nWhereas previous drops of Spotify Wrapped gave users the hard data\u2013 their most listened-to artists, their most played songs and how many minutes they spent listening to music\u2013 Wrapped 2022 delves into a deeper understanding of each individual user by giving them listening personalities. Resembling the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Spotify\u2019s personalities are based on four unique metrics: familiarity vs. exploration; loyalty vs. variety; timelessness vs. newness; and commonality vs. uniqueness. Each Spotify user receives an enneagram-style personality with four of these letters. Going off these metrics, a variety of different personalities can be assigned such as the \u201cEarly Adopter,\u201d the \u201cAdventurer,\u201d the \u201cDeep Diver\u201d and the \u201cDevotee.\u201d\n\nSpotify went beyond a simple regurgitation of gathered data this year in order to personalize the experience and students are taking notice of it now more than ever. Michael Newman, a sophomore studying real estate development, appreciates the technology behind the experience, while also seeing its faults in providing accurate information.\n\n\u201cThe algorithms do a really good job, but at the same time I think it could not be accurate sometimes based on just the algorithm not always being correct,\u201d Newman said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really cool and new way for technology to tell people a little bit more about themselves that maybe they may not have noticed based on their music tastes.\u201d\n\nThe audio streaming company has many loyal customers and continues to gain more every year in light of its trending Spotify Wrapped feature. Samantha Salem, a sophomore studying public relations, looks forward to the release of the holiday feature each year.\n\n\u201cSpotify Wrapped is my favorite Spotify feature and it gets me excited for the end of the year,\u201d Salem said. \u201cI love seeing who my favorite artists are and if there are any surprises.\u201d\n\nDespite Spotify Wrapped\u2019s large fan base, not every user looks forward to the release of Spotify Wrapped. Brianna Graham, a senior studying human biology, wasn\u2019t impressed by her listening data this year.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a little overhyped and I\u2019m just so used to getting it every year at this point that I\u2019m kind of over it,\u201d Graham said.\n\nThe success of Spotify Wrapped inspired its top competitor, Apple Music, to release Apple Music Replay.

(AP/Julia Nikhinson).\n\nBy Kelsey Goldbach and Tatiana Sataua\nDecember 01, 2022 at 4:19 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year! With the holiday season around the corner, many find themselves scrambling to get the best deals and are dazzled by 30% off \u201ceverything must go\u201d sales. Unfortunately, these big sales can be wasteful and harmful to our environment. According to Brightly, a website promoting sustainable living, Americans toss out 25% more trash during the holidays than any other time during the year. This includes food waste from trying out holiday recipes, endless wrapping paper, shopping bags, bows and ribbons.\n\nUSC Environmental Studies Professor, Douglas Becker, explains the environmental impacts that overbuying has on our planet and how to live sustainability during this season. Douglas Becker: \u201cWhenever comes to any sort of trash, remember that the order that we need to consider our trash when that\u2019s the issue is reduce, reuse, recycle, when whenever possible, reduce that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easier said than done. Just this Black Friday, Americans spent around $9 billion, and on Cyber Monday alone, online sales hit a record of $11.3 billion. Douglas Becker: \u201cOverspending reinforces norms that will lead to environmental degradation, overuse of resources, etc.\u201d\n\nTo avoid overspending during this holiday season, you can get creative with your gift ideas. Professor Becker gives another option by encouraging us to move away from materialism. Douglas Becker: \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in in gifting experiences. Go out and, you know, go do something fun together as the experience and let that be the gifts that you, you know, that that that you exchange. It doesn\u2019t always have to be stuff.\u201d\n\nAnd when going holiday shopping, Professor Decker advises to... Douglas Becker: Seek out companies that have less of a carbon footprints. Seek out companies that promote sustainability. And whenever possible. Again, if you\u2019re buying stuff, buy from local producers, buy local.\n\nSo this holiday season, walking in a Winter Wonderland also means being aware and mindful of how much you\u2019re spending on holiday preparations.\n```"}

This podcast was created by USC student Nicole Barron, who was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in 2020, and premiered this past September. The podcast has a new episode every Monday and covers topics such as diabetic social networking apps, continuous glucose monitors, and insulin pumps.\n\nNicole Barron: \u201cI started your diabetic basically because I initially looked for podcasts that were about type one diabetes, but a lot of them were geared towards older audiences. I wanted to create one that was more targeted at Gen Z diabetics and something that their friends and their loved ones could listen to and not feel so overwhelmed by the heavy topic that it can be.\u201d\n\nShe offered some advice for those friends and loved ones. Nicole Barron: \u201cJust like don\u2019t tell someone what they can and can\u2019t eat and then if someone is struggling just prolly just be there for them. And you can always offer support but just be careful about how you approach it.\u201d\n\nAnother tool for diabetes data and advice comes directly from USC researchers. Mark Harmel is a research coordinator at USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine and USC\u2019s Westside Center for Diabetes. The Center conducts extensive clinical trials and technological reviews to transform how diabetes is treated today.\n\nAlthough navigating the holiday season with diabetes can be difficult, Harmel offers advice to those who might need it. Mark Harmel: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be eating different foods. You need to do a lot more checking. So people who are using a glucose meter, make sure you bring extra test strips and bring your meter with you. And then we recommend people have continuous glucose monitors because continuous glucose monitors are really important to pay attention to what your glucose levels are during the day. The trick of managing diabetes is to sort of balance out your medications and exercise with the carbohydrates that you\u2019re bringing in to sort of keep it all in balance.\u201d\n\nWith the CDC reporting that 28.5 million United States adults are diagnosed with diabetes and 96 million adults possess prediabetes, the general education of symptoms and blood sugar levels is of paramount importance as a season of holiday dinners is underway. Keeping the dialogue open during this time of the year helps keep diagnosed diabetics from feeling isolated and can even save lives.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Newsroom)\n\nBy Ian Roddy December 01, 2022 at 2:48 pm PST\n\nFor the US Men\u2019s National Team yesterday, the potential on-field outcomes were incredibly simple: win, and you advance; tie or lose, and you go home. But that was about the only simple aspect of this game. Over the weekend, the US Soccer Federation posted altered images of the Iranian flag on its social media accounts, scrubbing the Islamic Republic emblem from the center. They said it was in an effort to show support for the nationwide protests going on in Iran for women\u2019s rights. Needless to say, the Iranian regime wasn\u2019t happy. They accused the US federation of racism, called for FIFA to disqualify or suspend them from the Cup, and have since had their own journalists pushing US players and coaches with difficult political questions, despite them not being involved.\n\nAt a press conference, an Iranian reporter asked 23-year-old US player Tyler Adams this question: Reporter: First of all, you say you support the Iranian people, but you\u2019re pronouncing our country\u2019s name wrong. Our country is named Iran, not Iran. Please, once and for all, let\u2019s get this clear. Second of all, are you okay to be representing a country that has so much discrimination against black people in its own borders?\n\nTyler Adams: My apologies on the mispronunciation of your country. Yeah. That being said, you know, there\u2019s discrimination everywhere you go. You know, one thing that I\u2019ve learned, especially from living abroad in the past years and having to fit in in different cultures and kind of assimilate into different cultures, is that in the U.S., where we\u2019re continuing to make progress every single day, like you just educated me now on the pronunciation of your country. So, yeah, it\u2019s a it\u2019s a process I think is as long as you see progress.\n\nEven though Adams responded thoughtfully, head coach Gregg Berhalter made it clear in his press conference that the US coaches and players had no part in the social media post. Gregg Berhalter: The players in the staff knew nothing about what was being posted. And, you know, sometimes things were out of our control. We believe that it\u2019s going to be a match, that the result will depend on, you know, who puts more effort in, who executes better on the field. And, you know, we\u2019re not focused on those outside things. And all we can do on our behalf is apologize on behalf of the players and the staff. But it\u2019s not something that, you know, that that we are part of.\n\nThe posts have since been deleted, but Iran wasn\u2019t happy, accusing US Soccer of removing the name of God from their national flag. When it comes to soccer, the United States and Iran have... a bit of a history. The countries faced off back in the 1998 World Cup in a game that\u2019s been described as the most politically charged in the tournament\u2019s history. This had to do with tensions originating from the Iran Hostage Crisis in 1979, as well as the US\u2019s support of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Iran came out on top in that 1998 game, defeating the US 2-1 and knocking them out of the World Cup. Yesterday\u2019s game served as the sequel to that historic matchup. The faceoff was further amplified by the fresh political tensions stemming from this social media fiasco. This time, the U.S. came out on top on the field, but it\u2019s unclear how things will play out off the field.\n```"}

Photo Courtesy of Instafest.App\n\nBy Josh Flowers and Jack Hallinan\nDecember 01, 2022 at 2:39 pm PST\n\nHave you ever imagined what a Coachella lineup featuring your 36 favorite artists would look like? Imagine no further; Instafest is here to help. Designed by Anshay Saboo, a junior studying computer science at USC, Instafest generates custom festival lineups based on users\u2019 music listening activity. Instafest has already garnered over 11 million users \u2014 including celebrities like Questlove and 24kGoldn \u2014 since its launch on Nov. 22. In just a week, Saboo blew through his development goal of one million users. Thinking it would take months to get such high volume traffic on the site, he was both pleased and surprised by the software\u2019s immediate success.\n\n\u201cI feel really lucky to have that kind of growth,\u201d Saboo said. \u201cWith absolutely no marketing effort put in from my side, it\u2019s just been really incredible to watch it go.\u201d\n\nFor those looking to get their own lineup, the process is simple. Users sign in using their Spotify or Apple Music accounts and get a customized festival poster in a matter of seconds; the free Instafest app can be accessed here. Saboo says inspiration struck last spring when he found his social media feeds bombarded with posts from Coachella.\n\n\u201cIf I was planning Coachella, if I was planning [any] music festival, who would I want my headliners to be? Who would I really love to see if I could plan my perfect music festival?\u201d Saboo asked himself. Now it\u2019s his designs that are flooding feeds. Anyone who has scrolled through Instagram or tapped through stories recently has likely seen dozens of vibrant festival posters.\n\nPart of Instafest\u2019s unique design is how it allows users to personalize their posters by changing the time range of their top artists. \u201cI think it\u2019s fun,\u201d Helenna Eyobe, a freshman business administration major, said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice for people to have a creative outlet.\u201d Listeners can base their posters off their most streamed artists from the last four weeks, six months or all time. They can also choose from the themes Malibu Sunrise, L.A. Twilight and Mojave Dusk, designed by Saboo himself in Adobe Illustrator.\n\n\u201cIt was cool to see for myself who I\u2019ve listened to because it often invites reflection about why I was listening to that artist at a given time,\u201d Lola Gilmore, a sophomore studying theater, said. \u201cThe lineup and Spotify Wrapped feel like personal pieces that cater to the person who went through life experiences that then informed their music choices.\u201d\n\nAs the site continues to gain popularity, Saboo hopes to continue adding attributes that will bring in new users. One of the website\u2019s newest features, dubbed the \u201cBasic Score,\u201d gives users a rating from 0-100 based on how niche their taste in music is; the higher the score, the more \u201cbasic\u201d someone\u2019s lineup is. While he does plan on taking a little break to see where this project will take him, Saboo says Instafest isn\u2019t the last people will see from him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see myself stopping developing stuff like this any time soon,\u201d he said, adding that he is almost always working on a new project. For now though, Saboo says he\u2019s got some papers and finals he needs to focus on.\n```"}

The song jokingly references and questions the validity of Grammy award-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s alleged aggravated assault by Tory Lanez.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of Drake\u2019s lyrics: This bitch lies \u2018bout getting shots, but she is still a stallion. She doesn\u2019t even get the joke, but she still smilin.\u2019 Shorty says she graduated, she ain\u2019t learn enough Play your album, track on\u0435, \u2018kay, I heard enough.\n\nThere have been heated debates on social media, mainly Twitter, claiming these lyrics were simply a play on words or a double entendre. However, jokes about violence aren\u2019t usually coincidental. It was an intentional choice made by Drake to say Megan was lying about her assault.\n\nOn July 12, 2020, Megan Thee Stallion (also known as Megan Pete), Canadian rapper Tory Lanez (also known as Daystar Peterson), and associates gathered at Kylie Jenner\u2019s house in Los Angeles for a poolside hang. While leaving Jenner\u2019s house, Peterson and Pete got into a verbal altercation in their car. As the argument escalated, Pete asked to be released from the vehicle. \u201cI asked the driver to pull me out of the car. Like, \u2018I\u2019m done with this.\u2019 I should have stayed out of the car,\u201d said Pete to CBS Mornings\u2019 Gayle King. \u201cI should not have gotten back in the car.\u201d\n\nUpon exiting the vehicle, Pete was allegedly assaulted by Peterson. \u201cSo I get out of the car, and everything happens so fast. And all I hear is this man screaming; he says, \u2018Dance, bitch,\u2019 and starts shooting. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God!\u2019\u201d Pete says the shooter aimed through the SUV\u2019s open window and fired multiple rounds in her direction. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to move too quickly because I thought, \u2018Oh my God, if I take the wrong step, I don\u2019t know if he can shoot something super important, I don\u2019t know if he could shoot me and kill me.\u2019 I was scared because I\u2019d never been shot at before.\u201d\n\nPete was unaware of what was happening, but felt her injuries. She saw her feet bleeding and decided to duck for cover in a nearby driveway. Pete\u2019s response? Shock, confusion, and hesitation. She thought, What are you talking about? Why are you offering me money right now? Help me.\n\nWith the police on the way and eyewitnesses in the neighborhood, Pete panicked and felt anxious for her safety. Remember, it was the summer of 2020, two months after George Floyd\u2019s murder and demonstrations against racial injustice. \u201cThere were so many of them, there were helicopters, and I just thought, Oh my God, we\u2019re all about to die,\u201d she said. \u201cThe George Floyd incident had just happened, the police are very much, Shoot first, ask questions after, so I think, \u2018there\u2019s a hot gun in the car, I am bleeding, I\u2019ve been shot...they\u2019re about to kill somebody. Something bad is about to happen,\u2019\u201d Pete recalled.\n\nInstead of telling the police the truth about being shot, Pete focused on de-escalating the situation and saving their reputations, and Peterson\u2019s life. She told the police that she stepped on glass and stuck with this story until she landed in the hospital. The doctors disclosed that they removed bullet fragments from each of her feet, which remain there to this day.\n\nPete\u2019s assault remains controversial two years later because of her star power. The case is still open, and even with evidence, testimony from Pete, and an ongoing trial, most people are convinced that Peterson didn\u2019t shoot Pete or that she was never shot \u2014 especially members of the hip-hop community.\n\nAccording to Okayplayer, 50 Cent and Cam\u2019ron poked fun at the alleged altercation by sharing various memes on their Twitter accounts in 2020. 50 Cent eventually apologized, taking to Twitter to write: \u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t think this shit was real; it sounded so crazy @theestallion. I\u2019m glad your feeling better, and I hope you can accept my apology.\u201d\n\nSo, why aren\u2019t Black women believed when we dare to voice our assaults? The answer is easy: Our personhood isn\u2019t valued outside of our appearance and perceived sexuality in the hip-hop community. Also, it could be that Black men secretly don\u2019t like us and resent our successes.\n\nNonetheless, violence towards Black women in hip-hop isn\u2019t new, whether the survivors are artists, management, executives, or listeners. The more we witness violence against Black women in hip-hop, the more we encounter a deaf ear.\n\nFemale rappers such as Latto, Lil\u2019 Kim, and Yung Miami have all been victims of physical assault, including sexual abuse or unwanted advances. Unfortunately, these violent cases are never a big deal within the community. They are often swept under the rug or considered part of the game, something these female artists signed up for to achieve fame and success in a male-dominated industry.\n\nThe alleged abuse is often celebrated and used to torment the victim further. For example, in a recent song titled \u201cBoogeyman,\u201d DaBaby, a former friend and collaborator of Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s, insinuated that he had a sexual relationship with her, rapping: The day before she said that Tory Lanez shot her, I was fuckin\u2019 on Megan Thee Stallion / Waited to say that shit on my next album / Hit it the day before too.\n\nWhile many male rappers make light of female rappers\u2019 abuse, they also capitalize on it by mentioning abusive incidents in songs to keep their names circulating in the press and to drive song streams. As insidious and cruel as it is, the strategy is winning. Not only does this increase song popularity and garner attention, but the action casts doubt over the victim\u2019s truth \u2014 ultimately watering down the severity of the abuse.\n\nPete and Peterson\u2019s alleged altercation has sparked a larger conversation around Black women\u2019s protection in the hip-hop industry and against misogynoir, the term queer Black feminist Moya Bailey coined to define the contempt and ingrained prejudice that black women routinely experience.\n\nAre Black women ever protected, or do we continue to live at the intersection of sexism and racism? In 2021, the Protect Black Women and Girls Act was introduced in Congress by Robin L. Kelly. The bill established an Interagency Task Force to cover issues involving Black women and girls in education, economic development, health care, justice and civil rights, and housing.\n\nThis involves examining the conditions and experiences of Black women and girls to identify and assess the efficacy of policies and programs of federal, state, and local governments designed to improve outcomes for such individuals, subsequently making recommendations to improve those policies and programs.\n\nIn parallel with the racial injustices the Black community experienced in 2020, the #ProtectBlackWomen movement was born from tragedy, such as the murders of Breonna Taylor and Oluwatoyin \u201cToyin\u201d Salau. But one wonders if the #ProtectBlackWomen movement can be more than a hashtag in the male-dominated hip-hop industry.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think so because the intention to protect isn\u2019t there from hip-hop artists. Although Pete was brave in speaking up about her abusive incident, it wasn\u2019t received well by her male counterparts. Her voice caused friction, anger, and ridicule. She\u2019s also been vocal about her mistreatment in the music industry.\n\nFrom a faulty contract leading to a restraining order against her previous indie label, 1501 Certified Entertainment, to violent attacks, the performer hasn\u2019t shied away from putting her abusers on blast. And she\u2019s not the only one.\n\nBlack women in hip-hop, whether on stage or in the boardroom, bear the brunt of backlash or \u201ccancel culture\u201d if they speak up. From Drew Dixon to Dee Barnes, who alleged physical and sexual abuse at the hands of, respectively, Dr. Dre and Russell Simmons, the consequences are still the same \u2014 speak up, and you\u2019ll be blackballed and pushed out of the industry.\n```"}

By   Yannick Peterhans December 01, 2022 at 11:58 am PST   \n\nAs USC fans drove home victorious on Saturday, another Angeleno became unhoused as the smell of burning plastic and metal inundated the chilly South Central night air. The incident was first broadcast on the Citizen app, which showed fire and smoke billowing from the RV. At the time of the fire, the RV was unoccupied, and no injuries were reported. The RV \u2014 now reduced to a mangled metal frame blackened from the heat \u2014 was drenched in water and foam. The fire created an electrical hazard for the two neighboring RVs parked on Olive Street. The fire caused telephone wires to fall and hang from the sky, the ends laying on the cold, gray concrete. Further west down West 30th Street additional RVs were parked but were not directly affected by the fire.

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)  Police responded to the fire at approximately 9:30 p.m., according to Officer Dominguez, who declined to give his first name. Another LAPD patrol unit observed the flame and called in additional support from the fire department. LAFD Station 15 responded, and finished fighting the blaze at 11 p.m. The RV, parked across the street from John Adams Middle School, left a large black smoke scar on the building behind it. After the fire department finished fighting the fire, mounds of Class A foam, fire deterrent used for building and wildfires, covered the RV and spread into the surrounding street. Moisture filled the air as the curb, street, RV and surrounding areas were drenched in water. Firefighter Landen with LAFD Station 15 inspects the RV after the fire was put out. (Photo by Yannick Peterhans)  Firefighters have fought numerous RV fires across the county in November. On  November 3 , five RVs were destroyed in a fire in Wilmington, as wind whisked the blaze through the Pacific RV Park. Then a day later on  November 4 , an RV in the parking lot of a Bargain World 99 Cent Store caught fire in Panorama City. And on  November 19  over 80 firefighters responded to a blaze in Garden Grove. No injuries have been reported from any of these fires. These RVs join the  2,000 RVs  that burn annually in the United States. Officers at the scene said many RV fires are caused by the production of methamphetamine, but the cause of this fire remains under investigation.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nDecember 01, 2022 at 9:00 am PST\n\nAfter yet another otherworldly performance by sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams \u2014 when he decimated the Notre Dame defense through running, passing and even punting \u2014 the Trojans only need one more win to claim the Pac-12 Championship and likely send themselves to their first ever College Football Playoff. The one thing standing in the Trojans\u2019 way is the only team that has bested them this year: the Utah Utes.\n\nSo what does USC need to do to beat Utah?\n\nPriority 1: Slow. Down. Kincaid. Senior tight end Dalton Kincaid exposed the Trojans\u2019 defense last time the teams faced off, going for 16 receptions, 234 yards and one touchdown. Even though the USC game was a career game for Kincaid, he has not slowed down at all since then, and is currently leading all tight ends in the FBS in receiving yards this year with 850. The USC defense just needs to slow Kincaid down and prevent him from going for another huge game. If the Trojans can do that, it will be harder for the Utes\u2019 offense to get cooking.\n\nKeep Caleb Williams safe\nThough Williams was incredible at escaping pressure against Notre Dame \u2014 and had arguably his best play of the season where he zigged and zagged away from pressure to pick up a first down with his legs \u2014 Notre Dame got to him way too easily. Though the Irish only ended up with two sacks and two quarterback hurries, it seemed Williams was on the run often he dropped back. If USC is to win this game, Williams needs to be protected well by the offensive line.\n\nGet into the Utah backfield\nAgainst Notre Dame, freshman quarterback Drew Pyne had all the time in the world to throw, which is why he had arguably his best game of the season. The Trojans had just two sacks and zero quarterback hurries, allowing Pyne to account for 318 pass yards, three touchdown passes and only three incomplete passes. Against Utah on October 15, the USC defense had zero sacks and zero quarterback hurries. That is unacceptable for a team that is tied for 16th in the nation for total sacks. Though the Trojans\u2019 front seven held Notre Dame to only 90 rushing yards, their pressure on Pyne was lackluster and should have been much better compared to the season\u2019s standard. If USC wants the outcome to be different than last time, the defense will need to get sacks and tackles for loss.\n\nPut on an offensive spectacle\nThe USC offense has been incredible, especially the past two games against the Trojans\u2019 two toughest opponents, averaging 542.5 yards per game. Williams has been killing it over the past two games, and if he can continue his recent play, the pass game should roll. Let\u2019s also not forget about one of the most underrated pieces to the offense\u2019s success lately: senior running back Austin Jones. While Williams has been the star of the USC offense, Jones has quietly put up some of the best games of his career with redshirt senior Travis Dye being sidelined the rest of the year with a leg injury. Jones is averaging 137 rushing yards per game over the last two games and had two rushing touchdowns against UCLA. The USC offense needs to keep cooking this week, and it should look to build off Williams and Austin.\n\nDefense needs to do what it does best: force turnovers\nThe USC defense is ranked No. 91 in the country in total yards given up but fourth in turnovers forced this year with 27. USC forced zero turnovers against Utah last time around; this time, the Trojans will need to force turnovers. USC will need to build momentum and keep its offense on the field, and that is exactly what creating turnovers will allow.\n\nUSC seeks revenge and a possible first-ever College Football Playoff berth against Utah in the Pac-12 Championship this Friday at 5 p.m. on FOX.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nNovember 30, 2022 at 11:49 pm PST\n\n15 seconds. 15 seconds into the second half is all it took for the Trojans to tie the Cal Baptist Lancers at 27-27 off of a layup from graduate forward Kadi Sissoko. After that moment, USC would forget about its poor first half and win the game 69-58 at Galen Center. The Trojans never trailed again after those first 15 seconds of the second half.\n\n\u201cWe just had to take care of the ball,\u201d graduate guard Destiny Littleton said. \u201cWe had 17 turnovers in the first half and that\u2019s unacceptable by any means.\u201d\n\nLittleton took the team on her back and scored 14 of her 16 points in the second half on her way to a double-double, also recording 14 rebounds. The rebounding duties shifted to Littleton for the game because the team\u2019s season rebounding leader, sophomore forward Rayah Marshall, went down with an injury in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really expect one of your rebounders to go out,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cBut a lot of people stepped up and it was gang rebounding tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans made tonight a team effort with Marshall\u2019s injury and key players having off nights.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re a team for,\u201d junior guard Kayla Williams said. \u201cWe have each other\u2019s backs. So when one goes down, another person steps up. And I think we all did a great job of that.\u201d\n\nBesides Marshall being out with injury, the Trojans also overcame an unusually poor shooting night from Sissoko, who went 1-for-5 from the field for two points in the first half. Just like her team, the leading scorer for USC picked it up in the second half and ended up scoring 15 points for the game.\n\nWilliams was one of the players who stepped up, scoring a season-high 13 points. Prior to this game, Williams had only averaged 4.5 points per game, but scored a team-high eight points in the first half. She was an important reason why the Trojans were only down by two points going into half.\n\n\u201cI played a solid game, but there\u2019s always room for improvement,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut as a team, we need to do better, so regardless of how one individual person played, I think as a team you need to come back better for next game.\u201d\n\nThis was only the second game the Trojan defense \u2014 which has been stout up to this point in the season \u2014 has allowed more than 50 points. The team turned up its defense in the third quarter though, among other aspects of its game. Despite allowing 27 points in the first half, the Trojans only let the Lancers score nine points in the third quarter.\n\nThe Trojans ended up allowing 22 points in the fourth quarter, but 12 of those points were in the last four minutes of the game after USC had already established a 14-point lead.\n\n\u201cI think our defense is good, I think we have some lapses,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cSo if we could just get rid of those, I think we could be a really good defensive team.\u201d\n\nWhat the Trojans did well for the entirety of the game was fast breaks on both offense and defense. They outscored Cal Baptist 5-0 in fast break points in the first half and ended the game with 13 fast break points compared to three for the Lancers.\n\nThe Trojans hope this slow start does not turn into a trend as they start conference play in the middle of December. USC still has Merrimack on December 3 and San Jose State on December 6. before the Trojans play UCLA on December 15.\n```"}

While it was challenging to keep up with the craziness from this past weekend, don\u2019t worry \u2014 I have you covered in my Week 13 edition of \u201cUnpack The Pac.\u201d\n\nUtah 63, Colorado 21\nUtah came sprinting out of the game and never slowed down. The Utes even led by 42 at one point in the second quarter. Despite only playing the first half, junior quarterback Cameron Rising posted an unbelievable stat line, as he was 17-for-19 with 234 passing yards and three touchdowns. Moreover, the blowout victory for Utah was their second most meaningful win of the day. Utah clinched an appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game as Oregon State defeated Oregon 38-34. Utah has a date with USC for a Pac-12 title in Las Vegas this weekend.\n\nUSC 38, Notre Dame 27\nComing off the program\u2019s biggest win in recent memory at UCLA, USC didn\u2019t slow down as they beat their arch-rival Notre Dame. Sophomore quarterback and Heisman favorite Caleb Williams had a signature game as he continued his historic season. Williams was 18-for-22 with 232 passing yards and four total touchdowns. Senior running back Austin Jones also gave the Trojans\u2019 offense a powerful spark as he rushed for 154 yards. On the other side of the ball, USC\u2019s passing defense struggled as Notre Dame sophomore quarterback Drew Payne was 23-for-26 and threw for 316 yards and three touchdowns. However, Notre Dame\u2019s two turnovers were crucial, and they eventually lost them the game. The Trojans finish the regular season 11-1 as they look to get into the College Football Playoff if they can beat Utah in the Pac-12 Championship Game.\n\nWashington 51, Washington State 33\nThe Apple Cup will be with the Huskies this year, as they just had too much offensive firepower for the Cougars to endure. After a back-and-forth first half, Washington led 28-27, but the Huskies came sprinting out of the gate in the second half and outscored the Cougars 23-6. Junior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. continued his spectacular season as he threw for 485 yards and had five total touchdowns. The Huskies\u2019 offensive line has been one of college football\u2019s best units in the entire country. They didn\u2019t allow a single sack the whole game, which allowed Penix Jr. to deliver a dazzling performance. Despite scoring 33 points, Washington State had severe offensive struggles during the game. They were very inefficient on third down conversions, as they went a dreadful 8-for-20. The Cougars also managed 2.1 yards per rush and had 75 rushing yards. It was a promising season for Washington State in their first full season with head coach Jake Dickert. As for Washington, with a 10-2 record, they are very much looking at a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game after a terrific regular season.\n\nArizona 38, Arizona State 35\nIn a battle for the best team in Arizona, the Wildcats found a way to squeak out a win at home. Sophomore quarterback Jayden de Laura had one of his worst outings of the entire season, as he was 12-for-23 with 200 yards and an interception. However, junior running back Michael Wiley put the team on his back and had 214 yards and three touchdowns on a ridiculously efficient 12 carries. Arizona\u2019s defense was also able to force five Sun Devil turnovers. With a 5-7 record, Arizona finished one win short of being eligible for a bowl game. While it is disappointing for Wildcat fans to miss out on a bowl game, they should be highly optimistic about the future of Arizona football. They have potential to be a sleeper team next year, assuming they get some defensive players in the transfer portal next year. And as for Arizona State, they hired 32-year-old Kenny Dillingham over the past weekend, making him the youngest Division I coach in the country. His awful experience should pay dividends to the Sun Devils in the future.\n\nOregon State 38, Oregon 34\nOregon State was down 34-17 at one point in the fourth quarter but managed a heroic 17-point comeback in one of the most thrilling Pac-12 games in the past decade. After a solid first quarter from Oregon State, in which they led 10-7, they completely fell apart in the second and third quarters. Oregon State redshirt freshman quarterback Ben Gulbranson immensely struggled as he was 6-for-13 with 60 yards and two interceptions. His opposing quarterback, senior Bo Nix, was excellent in the game but couldn\u2019t deliver a play to seal the game and kept giving Oregon State chances to come back. They capitalized on every opportunity they got. Oregon State\u2019s last three touchdown drives consisted of no passing plays, which made their comeback even more impressive. The loss stings for Oregon as they entered the fourth quarter looking almost sure to win this game and clinch their ticket to the Pac-12 Championship Game. However, now they will be looking at a high/mid-level bowl game which is a disappointment for a team with such big hopes for the year. On the other hand, Oregon State fans should be very proud of their team, who wildly succeeded expectations this year.\n\nUCLA 35, Cal 28\nCal has had a strange trend of losing to lousy football teams but playing outstanding teams down to the wire. That trend continued on Friday night as they missed a chance to upset UCLA. Cal even led by 11 at one point in this contest. UCLA continued its successful recipe of winning the game in the trenches as the Bruins rushed for 352 yards and three touchdowns. Senior running back Zach Charbonnet continued his superb season by leading the team in rushing yards with 119. It would be a good morale boost for Cal to finish a below-average season with a massive upset over one of their rivals. However, if redshirt senior quarterback Jack Plummer elects to use his extra year of eligibility to return to Cal next season, I expect a much-improved team. With the mix of young players and a solid recruiting class coming in, I expect at least a bowl game appearance next year for Cal. UCLA finishes with a 9-3 regular season record, their best since 2014.\n\nBYU 35, Stanford 26\nWhat a disaster of a season for Stanford. After losing to BYU, they finished the season 3-9 with only two wins over FBS opponents. BYU was able to exploit Stanford\u2019s horrid run defense, which has been exposed almost every weekend. It became apparent early on that Stanford lacked talented personnel across the board. It will be a massive rebuild to bring a historic program back to national relevance after beloved head coach David Shaw resigned this weekend. Shaw had been with the team since 2011 and it will be a tall task to replace the charisma he brought to the table.\n```"}

The Trojans are set to face off in the PAC-12 Championship game Friday against Utah, who gave USC their lone loss on the season. A win in Friday\u2019s showdown would likely propel USC into the College Football Playoff. After beating longtime rival Notre Dame last weekend, the team is ranked fourth in the latest weekly rankings with an 11-1 record.\n\nFor students, the football team\u2019s resurgence has brought excitement and pride back to the school. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty awesome,\u201d sophomore Yasmin Valiente said. \u201cIt is a very cool feeling to know that you go to a school that\u2019s really good and doing very well.\u201d\n\nFollowing a disappointing 4-8 season last year, USC fired head coach Clay Helton and hired former Oklahoma Sooners head coach Lincoln Riley last November. Freshman Jack Clark credits Riley\u2019s hiring for the team\u2019s success this season. \u201cIt\u2019s a good turnaround from last year,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see a new coach bring a new program to life.\u201d\n\nRiley has been able to rebuild the program through the transfer portal. USC received 20 transfers before this season, which ranked first in the country according to 247Sports. Sportswriter Dennis Dodd called USC\u2019s success in the transfer portal this year \u201cthe greatest transfer class in history.\u201d\n\nDorian Edwards, who is also a transfer student, said the new crop of transfers were the not-so-secret ingredient to the team\u2019s fast success. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised because I kind of saw a lot of the transfers and I knew about a lot of the players coming here,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cSo I kind of expected a lot from USC.\u201d\n\nAmong those transfers, sophomore Caleb Williams stands out as the premier player in college football. Williams, who transferred from Oklahoma and already spent one year in Riley\u2019s system, is currently the overwhelming favorite to win the Heisman trophy, awarded to the most outstanding player in college football. Williams has thrown for 34 touchdowns and 3,712 yards while also rushing for 10 touchdowns. His current odds to win the award is -2500 at MGM Sportsbook.\n\nWilliams has orchestrated an electric offense, which students said has brought renewed excitement to fans in the Coliseum. \u201cI think having the Heisman front runner is big because I mean, it\u2019s just exciting to watch,\u201d said sophomore Eric Sheng.\n\nStudents said the team\u2019s success has reignited school spirit as more Trojans are stepping up to demonstrate their support during this magical season. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to every home football game so far,\u201d Clark said. \u201cJust being there for the team is a big support factor.\u201d\n\nUSC started the season 6-0, defeating Rice, Stanford, Fresno State, Oregon State and Arizona State before suffering their first loss against Utah in Salt Lake City. Still, students said they were quick to see the team\u2019s potential after getting off to a blistering start to the season. \u201cI think once people realized that we could get there, like people started talking about it more and just the conversations were going around,\u201d Sheng said.\n\nAfter the Salt Lake setback, the Trojans quickly bounced back from the loss by winning their next five games. That streak included monumental wins over rivals UCLA 48-45 and Notre Dame 38-27 the past two weeks. Junior Hannah Abualhaj believes that back-to-back wins against UCLA and Notre Dame have brought immense pride and passion to the atmosphere on campus. \u201cI do think that the win against Notre Dame and UCLA has added that little extra bit of pep in everyone,\u201d she said.\n\nUtah, the 12th ranked team in the country, scored the go-ahead touchdown in the final minute of the game in a 43-42 battle to hand USC its only loss of the year. Abualhaj did warn that the team must not let the past two weeks get to the team\u2019s head. \u201cWe could lose if we let it get to our head,\u201d Abualhaj said. \u201cWe need to stay humble. We need to stay focused.\u201d\n\nThe game is scheduled for Friday December 2 at 5 p.m. at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas and will be televised on FOX.

In the last two months, hundreds of students have signed a petition to build a skatepark at USC, citing community building and improved well-being as potential benefits of the project.\n\nThe movement for a designated space for skaters at USC has been in the works for over a year, said Smith Shute, the president of USC\u2019s skate club and a contributor to the petition\u2019s creation, but the official petition for the park was just released this semester.\n\n\u201cThe petition is step one of proving to the university that there\u2019s actually a substantial backing in the student population for something like a skate park,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNow we have the numbers behind us. It\u2019s not something that, you know, a group of five people want. It\u2019s something that over 500 people want.\u201d\n\nThe petition was spearheaded by Maggie Bowen, the president of a skate club for women, nonbinary people and the LGBTQ+ community called Aunt Skatie. Bowen could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe nearest skate parks to USC are Trinity Skate Park and Gilbert Lindsay Skate Park, and both parks are more than two miles away from campus. If students want to practice skateboarding close to campus, they risk skating in unsafe areas like parking lots and uneven ground or even restricted areas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to actually have just genuine time to practice without worrying about getting kicked out by other people,\u201d said Zaki Cole, a freshman who is part of an informal skate group. \u201cAt the end of the day, people are still going to skate. It just depends on where.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the movement to build a park argue that it would provide a safe space for the diverse community of skateboarders on campus to practice their sport and improve their mental health.\n\n\u201cA skate park is more of a community center than anything else because skateboarding is a very amorphous sport nowadays,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou can kind of come from any walk of life, you can represent whatever you want and like you\u2019re going to get accepted.\u201d\n\nZo\u00eb B. Corwin is a USC research professor for the Pullias Center of Higher Education and part of the USC Skate Studies research team. According to its website, the Skate Studies project aims to \u201cinform the skate community about challenges, needs and strategies experienced by skaters\u201d and \u201ctake lessons learned from skateboarders \u2013 about a wide range of topics \u2013 and share them with the broader society.\u201d\n\nCorwin said building a skate park at USC would have a variety of benefits.\n\n\u201cIt has a positive impact on mental health,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cWhen people skateboard, they tend to put their phones away, they tend to focus on the moment and they are outside, they are exercising and they are pushing themselves to work through challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really organic place for people to communicate across differences. So you oftentimes will have people from different racial backgrounds, different socioeconomic classes, different genders and different age groups,\u201d she added.\n\nSupporters of the park say that building this skate park would connect the university to South Los Angeles neighborhoods in addition to giving USC students a communal meeting space.\n\n\u201cI think it would provide that space, not just to us, but to everyone in the surrounding community that would want to use it, which I think is very important here,\u201d Shute said. \u201cIf we\u2019re like a private university coming on to like this public space and we don\u2019t provide anything back to the community, I don\u2019t think that is very fair, honestly.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy AC Shick and Jason Pham\nNovember 30, 2022 at 5:19 pm PST\n\nSanta\u2019s workshop might need to move online as holiday online shopping becomes the norm. As more and more people are shopping online this holiday season, in-person stores are losing business, and local business owners are ho-ho-hoping for more holiday shoppers.\n\nAfter two of the biggest sales days of the year, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it is clear online shopping and holiday gifting isn\u2019t slowing down. In a survey conducted by NerdWallet, more than two-thirds of reported Americans partook in Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, with 84% of consumers purchasing gifts for the holiday season.\n\nFor Sachi Lee, owner of the online boutique Au Courant, the holidays are a crucial time that business increases. Her boutique, which sells different jewelry and chains, has pop-up stands at the Trojan Farmers Market on Wednesdays. During Black Friday festivities, Lee mentioned how the sales mean a lot to her small business.\n\n\"People really do seek out deals during that time,\" she said. Lee said she sees a mix of business online and in-person as well and aims to sell more products during the holiday season.\n\nHowever, online-dominated stores are taking over sales this year, with Adobe estimating a 2.5% growth in online shopping from November 1 to December 31 and a 5.1% increase in Cyber Monday shopping. Amazon even hosted a second Prime Day event this year to accommodate the massive amount of consumers during the holiday season.\n\nThis can also be seen when it comes to millennial consumers, 29% of whom do their shopping from their smartphones, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. For all other age groups, that number is 22%.\n\nMichelle Pham, a graduate student studying global supply chain management, claims online shopping is increasing in popularity due to convenience and avoiding crowds, especially during the holidays.\n\n\"It\u2019s just easier to browse to see the selection,\" Pham said. \"It\u2019s kind of hard sometimes, in person, [it\u2019s] a little overwhelming.\"\n\nThough, Pham explained she does not usually partake in Black Friday shopping, noting some stores disguise price inflations as can\u2019t-miss Black Friday deals.\n\nBut the preference for online shopping may present difficulties for out-of-state and traveling students, who would have to fit their holiday gifts in their luggage.\n\nJamie Wilhelm, a sophomore studying psychology, speculates the increase of online shopping might be an after-effect of COVID-19 since many shoppers became accustomed to contactless shopping.\n\n\"Because of COVID, a lot of people online shopped more and probably got in the habit,\" Wilhelm said.\n\nOnline shopping during the holidays is significant for small business owners who rely solely on their business\u2019s profits as income. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate, 59% of holiday shoppers plan on purchasing from a small business this winter season.\n\nWilhelm said she enjoys the Cyber Monday festivities because \"the sales are fire,\" mainly the holiday deals this year.\n```"}

(Photo Courtesy of Spotify)\n\nBy Citlalli Ch\u00e1vez-Nava November 30, 2022 at  4:47 pm PST\n\nWhen singer-songwriter Ileana Cabra Joglar \u2014 better known as iLe \u2014 describes the definition of the Puerto Rican colloquialism that titles her latest album, \u201cNacarile,\u201d she explains that the term refers to firmly rejecting a certain thought or idea. \u201cIt\u2019s about accepting those moments where you feel a little lost \u2014 embracing that, but not staying in that feeling. It\u2019s like saying, \u2018Thank you, I learned a lot, but no. I\u2019m not going to stay there,\u2019\u201d she said via Sony Music Latin regarding the album\u2019s release.\n\nThe impressive 11-track compilation comes in the wake of widespread demonstrations that swept the island in 2019 when protesters rallied against Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3's failed emergency response following Hurricane Maria. During the social uprising, iLe, alongside Residente (Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Joglar, who is iLe\u2019s brother and former Calle 13 bandmate) and Bad Bunny released \u201cAfilando los Cuchillos\u201d (\u201cSharpening the Knives\u201d), a song that became the battlecry for the movement leading to the governor\u2019s eventual resignation.\n\nHence, the spirit of \u201cNacarile\u201d feels like an extension of that pivotal political moment fused with the multi-layered, anti-colonial feminist spirit that has guided iLe\u2019s musical career. At the same time, some songs in the compilation, with their experimental nature, also offer a window into the fogginess of living and evolving amid a global pandemic and at a tumultuous time in our history.\n\n\u201cAlgo Bonito\u201d (\u201cSomething Beautiful\u201d), a reggaeton-style track made in collaboration with the genre\u2019s distinguished pioneer, Ivy Queen, is unapologetically bold and upbeat. The power duo staggers incisively metaphorical and combative lyrics with a catchy chorus against patriarchal forces on the backdrop of a military-style cadence: \u201cSe soltaron ya/Las yeguas del campo/Bajando cuestas/Cur\u00e1s de espanto/L\u00e1grimas secas/Y sin quebranto/Grito que se vuelve canto\u201d  (\u201cThey are already released/The mares of the field/going downhill/cures of horror/dry tears/and without break/Scream that becomes a song.\u201d)\n\nThe hip-swaying rhythms hold deep-seated strength that transcends song and becomes an anthem to liberate women from the oppressive silence in society.\n\n\u201cDonde nadie m\u00e1s Respira\u201d (\u201cWhere no one else breathes\u201d), released as a single in 2020 just before the election to replace Rossell\u00f3, opens with the sounds of an exasperated runner \u2014 immediately calling to mind the island\u2019s oppressive state of political reality that is further tainted by its colonial past. \u201cNos abrieron el tejido/Y desangraron la aldea/Degollaron las palabras/Para matarnos la idea\u201d  (\u201cThey opened the tissue/And they bled the village/They swallowed the words/To kill the idea\u201d). Yet, as the song progresses, it presents more hopeful lyrics that foreshadow the potential political change as an election nears: \u201cSe pensaron inmortales/Hasta que lleg\u00f3 su d\u00eda/Que el sol nos dio de su fuego/Y la mar su valent\u00eda\u201d  (They thought they were immortal/Until his day came/That the sun gave us from its fire/And the sea its bravery).\n\nIn \u201c Traguito ,\u201d a duet with Chilean singer and composer Mon Laferte, the two deliver sultry lyrics over an adaptation of Julia de Burgos\u2019 poem, \u201cYo Misma Fui Mi Ruta\u201d (\u201cI Myself Was My Route\u201d). Their rendition presents a feminist outlook on the poem\u2019s verses over nostalgic acoustic guitars, countering the traditional portrayal of a woman who is \u201cnot easy\u201d to love.\n\nThe song\u2019s bolero-inspired elements hearken to iLe\u2019s 2012 rendition of \u201cLa Pared\u201d (\u201cThe Wall\u201d) and infuse the album with the deep-seated appreciation for the genre that has been central to her craft and a key element to all of her musical projects.\n\n\u201cNacarile\u201d is also tinged with an airiness provided by ballads such as \u201c(Escap\u00e1ndome) De Mi\u201d (\u201c(Escaping) From Myself\u201d) and \u2018\u2019No Es Importante\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s Not Important\u201d). Both speak of a lover\u2019s vulnerability when gripped by powerful emotions and the disorderliness that ensues when things don\u2019t work out.\n\n\u201cEn Cantos\u201d (\u201cIn Songs\u201d), the intriguing duet released in 2020 with Grammy Award-winning Mexican alt-rock and folk star Natalia La Fourcade, also forms part of the compilation.\n\n\u201cNacarile\u201d is a masterful representation of iLe\u2019s consistent socially conscious artistry and an experimental tour of ballads, synth pop, boleros and reggaeton \u2014 alongside a power lineup of genre-bending musicians who are challenging the social and political status quo. As the album\u2019s title alludes, listeners are reminded that as tough as the last few years have been among life\u2019s ups and downs, finding hope and moving through the darkness is not only necessary, but an act of resistance.\n```"}

When she was 13, already with eight years of competitive experience, she told her family she wanted to leave the bat and glove behind. Her team was getting ready to compete at the national tournament in Monterrey. Vanya was the No.1 pitcher, and now she wanted out.\n\n\u201cYou go and talk to your coach yourself,\u201d she was told by her aunt, who figured she wouldn\u2019t dare. \u201cTell him you\u2019re not going.\u201d Her aunt figured wrong. Vanya did so. Her coach was furious. He felt she was leaving her team adrift. But she stuck to her decision.\n\n\u201cShe was always very disciplined,\u201d says Karina Fonseca, Vanya\u2019s mom. \u201cShe always listened to her coaches and managers.\u201d That, it turns out, was the real problem. Vanya had gotten tired of always doing the right thing. Of listening to everyone. Perhaps she just needed to start having fun again. For that to happen, she needed time, and her family\u2019s patience and support.\n\nWithin the context of a close-knit Mexican family, Vanya Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez has been able to flourish as a very talented baseball player. Without the support of those closest to her, Vanya may not have had the same success. That support has been very much there, as the 23-year-old can now say she was part of the first-ever Mexican women\u2019s baseball national team in 2018, while also helping to win the country\u2019s first medal during the 2022 WBSC Americas Women\u2019s Baseball World Cup Qualifier.\n\nVanya, a center fielder, carries a big smile on her face most of the time. Come game time, she\u2019s calm and measured. Her teammates describe her as \u201ccool\u201d on the field. That coolness has taken her far as an athlete. Her humbleness and strong family bonds also keep her grounded.\n\nFor Vanya Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, it\u2019s all about family. Indeed, her baseball and softball talent comes directly from family. That is, a strong line of women with direct ties to baseball. Mother Karina, aunt Erika and grandmother Elsa played baseball in college, and all urged a 6-year-old Vanya to pick up softball.\n\n\u201cAt first,\u201d Vanya says now, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get in the field.\u201d Without question, Vanya considers the three the most influential people in her life. The grandmother-mother-aunt-daughter quartet spends every weekend together. They don\u2019t just share a passion for the game. The weekend routine does not vary: Vanya\u2019s game, dinner and movies together at aunt Erika\u2019s house.\n\nVanya considers them a team of three that\u2019s always there to offer their advice and support. If, for example, plane tickets to go to a tournament need to be bought, mom, aunt and grandma will organize to help out.\n\nThat support has always been there. When Vanya was young, her parents got divorced. Karina moved in with her partner, but Vanya wasn\u2019t ready to go with them, so she went to live with grandma Elsa. Later, Elsa went to Europe for some time and Vanya went to live with aunt Erika.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re very close,\u201d says Karina, who also considers her daughter to be as generous as the rest of her maternal family. \u201cIn the family we\u2019ve always tried to be that way, trying to help other people.\u201d\n\nOn the field, Vanya considers herself mentally strong and poised. \u201cOf course, I still feel nervous and anxious at times, but I can also feel myself taking control of those emotions,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the years of experience have helped me with that.\u201d\n\nFor her mom, what sets Vanya apart from the rest is determination. Vanya, Karina says, has always been extremely disciplined with the way she eats, with her training, with going to the gym and with everything that will make her a better athlete.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very much like her father in that sense,\u201d Karina says. Octavio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Vanya\u2019s dad, played American football during college and kept doing so until his forties, setting an example of consistency as an athlete to her daughter.\n\nIn 2017, Vanya made the switch from softball to baseball. Growing up in a baseball-loving family, it was something already intuitive. \u201cBaseball is about getting dirty, throwing yourself around,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little rougher than other sports, and that\u2019s what I love about it.\u201d\n\nNot only does she love the game, but she became good at it very quickly. Just a year after starting with baseball, Vanya was named to Mexico\u2019s first-ever female national team.\n\n\u201cIt was some mixture of being nervous, anxious, but also proud,\u201d she says. Only four years into existence, that national team is set to take part in the 2023 Women\u2019s Baseball World Cup after winning bronze during the August 2022 qualifiers in Venezuela.\n\nVanya was one of eight Mexican players to record a hit in the last two innings of the game, sealing a 9-5 comeback victory over Cuba. It gave her country its first medal in women\u2019s baseball history.\n\nThat, she says, is still an indescribable feeling for her. \u201cI just can\u2019t find the words to describe what I felt at that moment.\u201d\n\nHer mom, though, acknowledges that not everything was perhaps so magical about the experience: \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause we couldn\u2019t be (in Venezuela).\u201d Usually the mom-aunt-grandma trio attends every single of Vanya\u2019s tournaments; this time only grandma Elsa could make the trip to South America.\n\nThere were only, the grandmother declares, eight Mexicans in the stadium for that game. Elsa says they still made themselves heard. Back home, purportedly because of a poor signal in the stadium, the rest of the family struggled to keep watch of the game on the internet. The image kept freezing.\n\nEach time, Karina and Erika immediately tried to make contact with Elsa to hear what was going on. Cuba jumped out to an early 4-0 lead. When, as part of the late Mexican rally, Vanya finally got her hit, her people back home went crazy.\n\n\u201cWe were all screaming and shouting,\u201d Karina says, knowing also that more emotions are still ahead for the young athlete and her family.\n\nThe official date for the World Cup has not yet been announced. Nonetheless, Vanya Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez is already thinking about it. \u201cWe want to be in the top three,\u201d she says.\n\nShe has come a long way since being that young girl who was ready to get away from the sport, and a lot has to do with her family having her back. So how, after all, way back when, did her mom manage to give Vanya the time and space to find her way back to the game that she knew was Vanya\u2019s destiny?\n\nTruly, she gave her a break. Vanya joined her aunt\u2019s and mom\u2019s softball team. She pitched. She played first base or whatever position she wanted. So simple. She started to have fun again.\n\nAnd after two years, Vanya told her mom that she was ready to go back. Since then, her commitment has never been put in doubt and her achievements continue to accumulate one after the other, with her mom, dad, aunt and grandma always by her side.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely proud and happy of her,\u201d Karina says, \u201calways.\u201d```"}

Ten people died, and nine were hospitalized after rescue workers failed to reach the site of a fire at a high-rise building in downtown Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, according to CNN.\n\nVideos shared on social media showed that due to COVID barriers put into place, responding fire trucks could not get close enough to the building. \u201cThey are blaming the residents of the building, saying there is no lockdown and you can leave the building as you want, but that is a lie, we know that is a lie,\u201d a student protestor said.\n\nThese videos, which are now censored in China, sparked anger not only among USC students, but also the residents of China and people around the world. \u201cThe tragedy of the building fire was the culmination of frustrations for the public given the past three years of severe policies that they have been subjected to,\u201d a student protestor said.\n\nIn response to the videos, protests erupted against the government\u2019s lockdown measures across the country in cities like Beijing, Hotan and Wuhan.\n```"}

{"key": "/2022/11/29/primed-for-pressure/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES -- Kimberly Harris knows the meaning of pressure and adversity. She grew up less than an hour from the stony, stoic gaze of the 90-foot-tall carving of Confederate generals Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee at Stone Mountain State Park, which defined life for Black Americans below the Mason-Dixon line. The Civil War monument represents bondage for Black Americans from the red hills of Georgia to Lookout Mountain in Tennessee and up and around every hill and molehill of Mississippi. It remains a perpetual testament to a sordid history for Black Georgians. The crestfallen, stodgy monument is an ode to times when the Confederates saw life and their slave-owning traditions enforced with terror, force, and brutality. Slaves were raped and abused, separated, and sold like cattle, human beings beaten or lynched at the whim of owners, overseers and onlookers. From the Reconstruction era to the rise of Jim Crow, Black bodies dangled from branches by their necks throughout the Confederate South. The brunt of the ideology, policies and practices of Jim Crow and the terrorism of the Klan left droves of Black people in terror.\n\nKimberly Harris is not like most people; she\u2019s a fighter. She has collided with racism head-on and has sprinted around it. And as the track world will soon discover, athletes like her don\u2019t come around often. Fearless and Focused \u201cKimbie\u201d is the eldest of four daughters to parents who played college sports. Her father, James, played football at North Carolina A&T, and her mother, Cortina, played softball at J.F. Webb High School in Oxford, North Carolina. The track star set the standard of excellence in the house for her siblings. Her bedroom was a temple dedicated to winning and excellence. The soccer and basketball trophies and track medals adorn the walls and are entombed by her certificates and awards for her top grades. She wore her hair naturally -- sometimes in twists and braids and others in rainbow-colored barrettes that flummoxed the little boys she sprinted past in football and basketball games. Her rich, deep, milk chocolate skin tone is a ballad of blackness, complimented by her gregarious spirit and infectious smile. But beneath the bubbly personality and warm charm lies a quiet, tenacious fierceness.\n\nKimberly \"Kimbo Slice\" Harris takes 2nd place in the 400m at the 2012 AAU Junior Olympic Games. Although Harris cannot recall the year, she vividly recalls one of her first crashes with racism. While Cortina was taking Kimbie to soccer practice, a white man in a pick-up truck adorned with a tow hitch and Confederate regalia ran the Harris women\u2019s minivan off the road. The man veered into their lane, the vehicles swapped paint, and the man spewed hate. Trying to get a handle on the situation, Cortina pulled off the highway into a parking lot to tend and check on her daughters. But, unbeknownst to her, the angry white driver followed the Harris women into the parking lot. A worried Kimbie had the presence of mind to call her father on the phone for advice. He was in Charlotte, two-plus hours away, where he spent half his time working as an engineer. He urged Kimbie and her mom to not allow the man to approach the car. But the livid driver came toward their vehicle, beet red and seething with anger, berating Cortina. Her father, trying to gain control of the situation hundreds of miles away from his family, told Kimbie to reach into the glovebox and hand her mother a licensed Springfield Armory 9mm pistol. As the tension escalated, Kimberly could hear her father\u2019s constant advice to protect her mother and sisters while he was away. She calmly climbed over her sisters to the front seat, reached inside the glove compartment, and handed the weapon to her mother. Cortina brandished the gun to ward off the incensed man. His eyes widened when he saw the brandished pistol. His face turned pale white with shock and fear, and he got into his truck and left the Harris women alone in their minivan to sort through their emotions.\n\nBlocking Out the Noise Kimbie has grown older. A young woman, \u201cKimmie,\u201d has been forced to block out voices and the brunt of racism. Yet, the Communications major learned and understands the salience and ability to code-switch. Code-switching, changing one\u2019s linguistic style, tone, and syntax, is a survival skill that communities of color learn to assimilate and gain acceptance in white spaces. Harris responded with grace and love but built a shield as white students ridiculed her dark skin and the texture and coils of her thick, jet-black, cotton-like crown. Her adolescent years forced her to think about how she would define blackness and what it meant to be a Black woman for herself in high school. In August 2018, Geye Hamby, the former superintendent of the Buford school district, was recorded, unbeknownst to him, where he called a group of Black workers the N-word and threatened to kill them. Upon the leaked conversation to the press, Hamby initially denied that his voice was on the recording. However, he eventually resigned from his $308,000 per-year position after protests demanded his resignation. As tensions rose within the city, students at Buford High School opted to organize to speak out against Hamby and racism. Students that condemned the embattled superintendent organized and opted to wear all black, which the school deemed \u201cgang colors,\u201d in support of Black students and Black lives. The next day went as any other day -- some students were dropped off in big, red pick-up trucks with Confederate flags flapping in the wind and on license plates, some in minivans or indiscreet compact cars, while other students filed off the school bus. For years of her life, foes that masqueraded as friends opted to combat the all-black protest; they showed up to school wearing all-white and championed Hamby\u2019s retention. Hence, \u201cKimmie\u2019s\u201d response -- she noted both supporters and detractors. Although the overt displays of racism that typified the Jim Crow South were gone, the insidious vestiges and tentacles were still displayed for her to perplexingly process and work through.\n\nA true competitor \u201cKimbo Slice\u201d is drawn to competition -- regardless of the sport. So, it\u2019s common for her to frantically yell at the television while she watches football, cornhole, and table tennis. Now a woman, she enters her junior year on USC\u2019s track and field team with the frustration of having her first two seasons cut short due to torn hamstrings. Yet, despite it all, her confidence remains unflappable. She and adversity have an intimate relationship. Kimberly learned discipline and loyalty from her best friend -- her father. James read books and watched soccer coaching videos to help her improve her footwork, touch, and shooting, after his commutes from Charlotte to Buford, to take her to soccer practices and games. Before coming to USC, Kimberly was a cornerstone in the Buford JackRabbit Track Club. Her coach, Mark Moxley, gave her the nickname \u201cKimbo Slice,\u201d named after the Miami street fighting legend for how she sliced and diced her opposition. However, when it\u2019s time to race, Kimberly is no longer gregarious and easygoing. Instead, she transforms into a speed demon born to sprint that went undefeated her junior year in high school -- an unheard-of feat. In 2019, Kimbo competed at the New Balance National Indoor Championships, seizing the 400-meter title in the Championship Girls with a No. 6 all-time record with a time of 52.62 seconds. At the Emerging Elite sprints, Harris claimed titles in the 55m in 6.94 and the 60 in 7.45 -- the eighth fastest all-time in the race. Her performance was so dominant that she drew comparisons to Olympic champion Sydney McLaughlin. After two years off, Harris enters the season feeling the best she\u2019s felt in years and looks to reclaim the dominance she is known for in the 400 meters. But, as Kimbo displayed throughout her budding career, her only competition is herself. Nevertheless, she has the fuel and resilience to silence her detractors. If she remains healthy this season, she has the ability and potential to join the pantheon of USC track greats. And, if Kimbo Slice performs at the levels she knows she can, it won\u2019t be odd to see her slice things up in the Olympics.\n\nDespite her youth, Harris has a keen take on what she\u2019s seen. \u201cAlthough those are horrible experiences that no one should endure, I refuse to allow them to define who I am. I want to succeed on the track so I can grow my platform and raise awareness of the various situations Black people endure,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMy experiences taught me to be resilient, push through hard, sad or scary times -- to turn my anger into energy to master my craft. I want my life to teach people that they can turn these encounters into fuel to be better versions of themselves each day to prove people wrong.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)  By   Cl\u00e9mence-Maureen Feniou November 29, 2022 at  8:00 pm PST \n \n \nMusic blasting on the speakers and bursts of laughter were heard on Howard Jones Field Tuesday. But one whistle blew, and all players were relentlessly back to work on their intense drills. The Trojans ended their regular season perfectly, winning against rival Notre Dame for the first time since 2017, 38-27. With five touchdowns and 436 yards of offense, the Trojans put on a complete performance and head into the Pac-12 Championship Game with plenty of confidence. On Friday, the Trojans will meet again with the only team that could defeat them this year \u2014 and by only one point \u2014 the Utah Utes. \u201cIt\u2019s a championship game. I mean, you\u2019re going to play a good team regardless,\u201d USC head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would be any more or less excited if it was anybody else.\u201d USC lost 43-42 to the Utes on October 15, the first loss during the Riley era, which was a disappointing result after the Trojans were ahead during the entire game. Even though that defeat prevented the Trojans from having a perfect season, Riley refuses to see Friday\u2019s game as revenge for the earlier loss. \u201cThis is not a revenge game,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThey got us that time. But this is not about that game. This is a new game, a new challenge and a new setting. Teams have evolved. Both teams have changed \u2014 certainly \u2014 throughout the year.\u201d The USC defense will indeed play a significant role in the matchup against Utah. As has been preached since the beginning of the season, the Trojans are convinced turnovers will be key in winning this weekend. \u201cWe talk about it every day [the turnover importance], like all day, every day...So it\u2019s embedded in the language and the culture,\u201d senior inside linebacker Shane Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we pride ourselves on and take seriously.\u201d Ahead of the Pac-12 title game, focusing on the ball and stripping drills were highly repeated during practice. \u201cIt gives you confidence as a defense when you\u2019re able to come up and make big plays like that and get the ball back to the offense,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re able to come up and make a big play and make an impact like that is huge \u2014 especially in these tight and close games.\u201d It\u2019s especially impactful when the ball comes back to an offense led by sophomore Caleb Williams. Against the Fighting Irish, Williams broke the single-season rushing record for a USC quarterback. With 18 passes completed on 22 attempts, four touchdowns of his own and a few scrambles totaling 35 yards, Williams again proved his capacity to carry his team to victory. On the training field, his Heisman-worthy season is on everyone\u2019s mind except his own. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed anything for me. I\u2019m sticking to my same routine. I\u2019m still trying to lead these guys because we have bigger goals in mind towards the end of the season,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI want to go win. I want to go win championships with the team that I\u2019m on.\u201d Although Riley made it clear this is not a revenge game for the team, Williams still remembers the loss from more than a month ago and the awareness of adversity it brought to the team. \u201cAfter that game, we lost, and that was one of the main things that was being said in the locker room,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe have this adversity in our life right now that we just lost. And I know we didn\u2019t want to lose, but we did lose, and a great book or story can\u2019t be written without it.\u201d Williams may not like talking about his own performance, but his teammates remain impressed with him and have faith in what he will do in Las Vegas. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he was cocky,\u201d redshirt senior offensive lineman Justin Dedich said. \u201cHe just kind of had this swagger about him, and it is just something that you can believe in and trust in and know that he\u2019s gonna get the job done. But it\u2019s just unbelievable the things he can do out there.\u201d With a defense that finished the season strong and a star quarterback playing at a high level, the Trojans very well could claim their first Pac-12 title since 2017.\n```"}

Though people might not think of the Steel City as a music industry hub, it has a vibrant DIY music scene. The casual community-oriented environment was the perfect place to get her start.\n\nThe DIY scene refers to a music sub-culture where local bands work together to put on shows outside of mainstream venues. \u201cI think just being exposed to creative people all the time was influential,\u201d said Schmeler. \u201cIn Pittsburgh, there are definitely multiple [shows] every weekend, and it\u2019s small enough that everybody knows each other.\u201d\n\nSchmeler has had a love for music ever since she could remember. As a child, she dressed up as Gene Simmons every year for Halloween and begged her parents for guitar lessons. She started playing in bands in her early teens and was eager to break into the music scene.\n\nWhen Schmeler was 15, she saw her family friend Benito Countouris playing in the band Wild Blue Yonder at a Bernie Sanders rally. Countouris recalled the event. \u201cI saw [Schmeler] in the crowd and I pointed at her, and because I knew she played guitar, I was like, \u2018next time you\u2019re going to be up here,\u2019\u201d Countouris said. The following week Betsy was playing in the band.\n\nFor the rest of her high school career she spent her weekends playing basement shows, performing at open mics with the band and learning the ropes of the DIY scene. Pittsburgh DIY subculture gave rapper Mac Miller and indie darlings like Merce Lemon and Short Fictions their starts.\n\n\u201cPlanning something within 24 hours was common, and if 10 people showed up in the basement, that was cool,\u201d said Schmeler. Countouris and Schmeler clicked as collaborators and started writing music together on the side. When the pandemic hit, the two broke away from the band and started playing and releasing music as a duo.\n\nSchmeler knew she wanted to pursue music beyond Pittsburgh, even though that meant leaving her beloved DIY scene. She came to USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music to study music industry and discover a new sound. \u201cBeing in college and separated from the Pittsburgh music scene has allowed me to actually figure out what I want to sound like and what I want to do,\u201d says Schmeler.\n\nAs a spring admit, she spent her first semester trying to find her footing in the USC music world. Thornton gave Schmeler access to a brand new community of collaborators and friends. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool cause we\u2019re all friends now at the beginning of the day, and then at the end of the day, we have this opportunity to make music together,\u201d Schmeler said. \u201cWe would do a lot of sitting in the living room writing songs together, and that was fun.\u201d\n\nShe used songwriting as a way to document her new experiences and feelings during this big transition in her life of going to college and experiencing a different music scene. Dorm room songwriting sessions became band practices, and her new music identity \u201cMy Betsy\u201d was born.\n\nIn October, Schmeler had her debut performance, where she was backed up by a band of her friends at a house show sponsored by KXSC, USC\u2019s student-run radio station. Over 200 people clamored in an overflowing backyard on South Hoover street, dancing to the band\u2019s never before heard original songs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful that Betsy showed me some of this music as it was in production. And getting to see her process really made me appreciate her art even more,\u201d said Ava Kalenze, the Live Session Director at KXSC, who helped Schmeler book this performance.\n\n\u201cMy Betsy\u201d will play a solo set on KXSC Radio\u2019s weekly live session this Friday. Whether in Pittsburgh or Los Angeles, Schmeler is grateful for the community she has found in music. \u201cWe\u2019re all friends, we\u2019re uplifting each other.\u201d```"}

When looking for a break from studying, students have found unassuming napping spots around campus.\n\nAlumni Park\nLocated in the center of campus and established in 1935, Alumni Memorial Campus or Alumni Park is the picturesque green space that all aspiring college brochure makers wish they had.

And with in Hawaii, the volcanoes, they have flowing lava and not really like spitting lava.\n\nCornwell said, for Hawaiians, the volcanoes erupting holds a significant meaning. Sir Cornwell: When Mauna Loa was erupting, yesterday was actually L\u0101 K\u016b\u02bboko\u02bba, which is a within Hawaii, which is a celebration of sovereignty and independence. So it\u2019s like Hawaii\u2019s Independence Day.\n\nCornwell said the fact that several of the volcanoes erupting comes as a sign of reassurance to Hawaiians. Sir Cornwell: The fact that that Mauna Loa, K\u012blauea, and also Mauna Kea was snowing as well played a significant part, a significant part within my culture, because this eruption comes as a Ho\u2019ailona to our people and a Ho\u2019ailona is like a sign or omen\n\nCornwell said this lets them know that a new change is on the way after everything native Hawaiians have been through. Sir Cornwell: I feel extremely more connected just knowing that like through everything um native Hawaiians have gone through, it\u2019s nice knowing that we have this reassurance and sign that our gods are still working hard and a time where um a new change is gonna to come.\n\nIts neighbor volcano, Kilaeua, has also been erupting for more than one year.

And that secret is called Section 14.\n\nMya Mariey Vinnett: Survivors of Sections 14 are upwards of 60 years old but they haven\u2019t forgotten what happened.

My father worked hard and built our home and we had to leave it behind. My childhood innocence, fun and happy going life was taken from me when we moved into a neighborhood that was filled with racism, hate and anger.

But I later found out that we were forced out of our home.\n\nAreva Martin: And someone asked me, Well, how come the city didn\u2019t use eminent domain? How come they didn\u2019t use a legal eviction process? I don\u2019t have the answers to that. I can tell you there\u2019s no evidence that they did that, that they did use any legal process to remove these families. We do know that they were driven by greed.\n\nMya Mariey Vinnett:: Economist Julianne Malveaux who was hired by the victim\u2019s legal team values the damages of survivors and their descendants at $400 million to $2 billion. Julianne Malveaux: It\u2019s a modest number, frankly An apology is fine. But you can\u2019t put butter on an apology and make it edible.

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Hayes Flanagan, Sam Bitman and Aaron Goldstein\nNovember 29, 2022 at 5:57 pm PST\n\nA year ago yesterday, USC made a move that would change the program\u2019s outlook for the foreseeable future: Lincoln Riley was hired as the head coach. The surprising hire sparked an immediate change in USC football\u2019s culture and recruiting. The former University of Oklahoma head coach helped the Trojans flip the switch from last year\u2019s 4-8 season, drawing in 19 new transfer athletes including current Heisman Trophy frontrunner, quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nNow, after going 7-0 at home and 11-1 overall, the Trojans secured their spot in the PAC-12 Championship and have national championship aspirations on the horizon. For USC students, the change is not limited to the football program, as it has also extended to fan culture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a lot more entertaining to watch because we\u2019re winning,\u201d said Rishab Iyer, a junior computational neuroscience major. \u201cI think there\u2019s also a lot of fans that are more into the games. It\u2019s more exciting to go to the games because I feel like last year a lot of people were against the coach and against the team just because they felt like they were doing badly. It\u2019s more exciting now.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans are ranked fourth in the nation, behind only Georgia, Michigan and TCU. The team is heading to Las Vegas where they will face off against the Utah Utes at 5 p.m. on Friday at Allegiant Stadium. It will be the first time that USC is competing in the PAC-12 championship since 2017 excluding the COVID year, when the Trojans lost to Oregon at the Rose Bowl. It\u2019s also the first time USC will be facing Utah since the Utes handed the Trojans their first and only loss of the season in Salt Lake City on Oct. 15.\n\nSince then, the Trojans have been on a hot streak that has broken records both on the field and in the stadium. The Coliseum was 94% full on Saturday for the final home game of the season against Notre Dame, the most highly attended home game since the pandemic began in 2020. This attendance figure came over Thanksgiving break, a stark contrast to last year\u2019s attendance of 72% for the last home game.\n\n\u201cI think [the energy has] shifted massively,\u201d said Emily McDougal, a senior communication and theatre major. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for a while, and I remember it got to a point where our stadium was not very well filled mid-game. But I think this semester it\u2019s been so fun to see it get filled to the brim. The Notre Dame game was hugely packed and that was awesome to see and it\u2019s cool to see people really get excited about USC football.\u201d\n\nThe turnaround for former seasons is visible not only to older students, but also to underclassmen who will likely experience a winning program for the majority of their years at USC.\n\n\u201cThe energy I feel around campus is excitement and joy for the team, future and insanely good quarterback Caleb Williams,\u201d said Darren Hanna, a sophomore health and human sciences major. \u201cWe are just ready to win and be great.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will be looking to redeem their midseason loss to the Utes, and students and fans will be traveling in hoards to Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cIn my four years at USC, this is the most excited I\u2019ve seen the student body about a team,\u201d said Emily Duijser, senior majoring in biomedical engineering. \u201cI feel so lucky to be in the conference title game my last year. Even though it\u2019s during finals, I can\u2019t miss the trip to Vegas to support the team.\u201d\n\nFrom Las Vegas or South L.A., Trojan fans are witnessing a momentum shift the likes of which have not been seen in years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m carpooling with my fellow Trojans to the game,\u201d said Eli Gingold, a junior business administration major. \u201cIt feels great that I\u2019m attending college at the start of such an incredible era of USC football. I always wanted to go to a school where I had an incredible football team to support, and in Lincoln Riley\u2019s first year, it is great to see where the team is.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Trojans look to clinch their first ever trip to the College Football Playoff since its inception in 2014.\n```"}

(Photo by Lauren Nash)\n\nBy Maddy Brown November 29, 2022 at  5:35 pm PST\n\nThe Dornsife Prison Education Project--which offers USC classes to incarcerated students--will finally allow these students to receive academic credit for taking these courses. Maddy Brown has more on how the program hopes this change will provide greater support to incarcerated students, and work to dismantle the misconceptions surrounding the prison system.\n\nFor the first time in USC\u2019s history, the university will be offering a class to incarcerated students in which they can actually earn credit. Since 2017, the Dornsife Prison Education Project, or USC PEP, has offered various classes to incarcerated students. These classes teach various subjects, from physics to film studies. They meet once a week for 8 weeks and are taught by USC professors, who are typically aided by five to ten USC students acting as TAs.\n\nFor the last three years, USC PEP has been running a Writing 320 class. They call this class an inside out writing workshop, meaning its a combination of students on the \u201cinside\u201d at The California Institution for Women and students on the \u201coutside,\u201d meaning they attend USC. In this class, USC students don\u2019t play the role of the TA, but rather take the class with the incarcerated students. Now for the first time, incarcerated students that take this class will earn credit just like their peers at USC do.\n\nKate Levin, the co-director of USC PEP and one of the professors that teaches the Writing 320 class, explains why this new development is an improvement on the previous system. Levin: But what it hasn\u2019t offered them is any credit, any academic credit that they can, let\u2019s say, put towards a degree or have a transcript for anything like that. So we\u2019ve wanted to give them that because that can make a huge difference in people\u2019s lives, whether they want to continue their education or whether they simply want to, let\u2019s say, show a parole officer, you know, that they\u2019ve taken the class from you to see it really matters.\n\nNow, I think it\u2019s still, you know, made a difference in the students lives because, you know, they you know, for one thing, what the research shows is that if an incarcerated person takes even one college class while they\u2019re in on the inside, they are almost half as likely to recidivate or end up back in prison.\n\nLevin believes the classes will not only positively impact incarcerated students, but USC students as well. She believes that when USC students learn alongside incarcerated students, it helps dismantle their misconceptions about prisons and incarcerated people. For Levin, these classes help all the students gain a richer understanding of each other and the world around them.\n\nNicholas De Dominic, who is also a co-director of USC PEP and a teacher of the Writing 320 class, addressed why in some ways it\u2019s USC\u2019s responsibility to offer this for-credit class. De Dominic: USC is in South L.A. and South L.A. is a community that\u2019s been over affected by incarceration. USC\u2019s relationship to South L.A. is really, really complex, too, right? And it\u2019s responsible for some of the overpolicing, it\u2019s responsible for some of the gentrification. It\u2019s responsible for fewer opportunities in some ways. I think over the last 20 years, through programs like the neighborhood academic initiatives, the work that JAP is doing, the university\u2019s gotten better about sort of understanding its relationship and its commitment to the people that live outside our doors. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily redress all the harm that it\u2019s performed. And so programs like this begin to sort of answer for some of our previous sins.\n\nStudents enrolled at USC and incarcerated students will be able to take the Writing 320 class in the spring.

The \u201cKnives Out\u201d series, a nostalgic nod to the era of murder mysteries and detective films of the past, boasts a star-studded cast and high-quality execution. The newest big-budget Netflix film, which opened in theaters on November 23 for a limited run and is set to stream on December 23, attracted many prominent names in Hollywood for its premiere. Attendees included composer Nathan Johnson, producer Ram Bergman, Jamie Lee Curtis (star from the first \u201cKnives Out\u201d film), Barbara Palvin and the stars of the movie.\n\nThe Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in the La Brea neighborhood was the perfect venue to reflect the pristine aesthetic of the film industry. The tall glass windows and deep red carpets surrounding the entire museum were elegant. Attendees were dressed in beautiful long gowns and fancy suits, and they paraded along the halls prior to the screening. Once the event started, Scott Stuber, the head of global film at Netflix, came out and gave a short message of thanks and gratitude for the film. Then, writer-director Rian Johnson came out and gave a brief statement, as well, and he introduced the cast up on stage. The cast and audience members alike recorded a \u201cWe love you, Daniel\u201d message for Daniel Craig who was ill and unable to attend the festivities.\n\n\u201cGlass Onion,\u201d created by writer and director Rian Johnson, is the sequel to the thrilling mystery movie \u201cKnives Out.\u201d Johnson had a high bar to meet following the massive success of \u201cKnives Out.\u201d Fans were left to wonder how Johnson could follow such a unique and intricate mystery as the first film in the franchise. The movie stars Daniel Craig, Kate Hudson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Leslie Odom Jr., Kathryn Hahn, Madelyn Cline, Jessica Henwick, Dave Bautista and Edward Norton. It also features cameos from the late Angela Lansbury and Stephen Sondheim, Jackie Hoffman, Serena Williams, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Natasha Lyonne and Hugh Grant, to name a few.\n\nThe movie follows the same structure as the previous, featuring a complex mystery that seems to flip on itself midway through the movie and reveal a surprise twist to the initial mystery at hand. Johnson did not disappoint fans, especially with the film\u2019s production quality, as the movie did live up to expectations as per the standing ovation and cheering during the credits. The high quality is no surprise, given that the original and the sequel both utilized a $40 million budget, and neither is its acclaim, as the first film received awards and worldwide praise. Still, the film felt as if it was of a higher caliber than some of Netflix\u2019s more recent original productions.\n\nFrom left, Kathryn Hahn, Madelyn Cline, Edward Norton, Leslie Odom Jr. and Kate Hudson in a scene from \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\" (Photo courtesy of John Wilson/Netflix via AP).\n\nThe film begins when each of the characters receives a mysterious box with a complex puzzle for them to solve in order to open it. Inside the large wooden box is a small, blue notecard indicating an invitation to a murder mystery party from their wealthy friend Miles Bron, played by Edward Norton, on his private island in Greece. His massive coastal mansion features a literal glass atrium in the circular shape of an onion where the party takes place. Each character in the film portrays a different ditsy personality with an interesting career, but throughout the movie, you can see how they all contribute to the overall mystery of the film.\n\nDaniel Craig plays detective Benoit Blanc, the only recurring character from the previous \u201cKnives Out\u201d film, and continues using his cartoonish but phenomenal southern accent. Actor Janelle Mon\u00e1e, also known for her R&B music career, was also an incredible choice for the film, as her performance through her character Cassandra Brand revealed a great range in her acting skills to fans. Mon\u00e1e and Craig share perfect chemistry through their on-screen friendship in the film as they both team up together to uncover the true motive behind the murder-mystery party.\n\nThe film\u2019s title is apt considering its exploration of life\u2019s complicated layers. A \u201cGlass Onion\u201d (yes, from the popular Beatles track off of the \u201cWhite Album\u201d) in itself is a dichotomy. As the popular movie \u201cShrek\u201d says, \u201conions have layers.\u201d What makes this movie complex is that it alludes to the false sense of the intricacy of life when in reality one can look past the layers and see it \u201ccrystal clear.\u201d The sequel acts as a slight social commentary on the pandemic as well, because it takes place during the early days of the lockdown in 2020. There are jokes made about masks and social distancing as well as a jab at the lockdown in general, as Miles throws an extravagant party with his friends during a time when no one could gather together in one place.\n\nThere are also elements of the movie that comment on the privilege that comes with extreme wealth and the contrast between \u201crich\u201d culture and \u201cpoor\u201d culture. The film was incredible because of the complex storyline. The movie forces the viewer to ask \u201cwhy?\u201d until about midway through when the motive for the elaborate \u201cwhodunit\u201d is revealed. For instance, \u201cWhy does he invite all of his old friends to his private island?\u201d \u201cWhy this \u2018murder mystery\u2019 party?\u201d \u201cWhy invite these oddly specific party-goers?\u201d \u201cWhy was Benoit Blanc in attendance as well?\u201d Uncovering each of the characters\u2019 backstories as the murder mystery unraveled is thoroughly enjoyable in Johnson\u2019s films.\n\n\u201cGlass Onion\u201d has more of a comedic tone than \u201cKnives Out\u201d\u2013 something that attendees seemed to enjoy at the screening with their chorus of laughs. After \u201cGlass Onion\u201d will likely receive massive success, fans are sure to clamor for another film in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise, as they did in 2019 for the original. \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\u201d opens in theaters for a limited run on November 23.

Renovations are effective immediately, the Office of the President announced Tuesday. Stationed in the center of the University Park Campus inside the Gwynn Wilson Student Union Building on Trousdale Parkway, the new space will host collaboration between students, researchers and the USC sustainability staff, the release said. The Sustainability Hub is set to open in April, which coincides with Earth Month, a time dedicated to the recognition of environmental issues. The building will inherit the plot currently occupied by the USC Pharmacy, a centrally-located area with plenty of foot traffic and high visibility. The pharmacy will move to a \u201cstate-of-the-art facility\u201d near the USC Engemann Student Health Center. The university made the decision as part of its campus-wide initiative, Assignment: Earth, to address the impacts of climate change, as well as create a more sustainable future. The construction of the Sustainability Hub is one of many environmental initiatives USC is actively spearheading this year. Over the summer, the university halted the purchase of single-use plastic bottles, saving an estimated 32 tons of plastic waste, according to USC Sustainability. The university also dedicated millions of dollars to similar projects, such as recycling efforts at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and research into alternative energies and pollution reduction in the L.A. Community and beyond. Even with its pledge to create a greener campus and planet, there is still progress to be made with educating the USC community on environmental topics. In USC\u2019s first annual sustainability survey conducted in April, over 5,000 respondents scored an average of 61.5% on general sustainability questions and just 52.3% on sustainability behavior and culture questions. In the same survey, 47% of respondents were interested in getting involved with USC sustainability efforts but had not yet done so. By April, USC students and staff will have a sustainability education resource within walking distance.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nBy Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan and Alexis Lara\nNovember 28, 2022 at 8:05 pm PST\n\nEnthusiastic online-shoppers couldn\u2019t resist enticing deals this Black Friday. According to Adobe Analytics, Black Friday sales saw a record $9.12 billion from online holiday-giddy consumers compared to the previous year\u2019s $8.92 billion. Thanksgiving in the U.S. was followed by a spending spree on Black Friday and Cyber Monday despite an increase in inflation from last November.\n\n\u201cOften in inflationary times, people try to buy as quickly as they can, knowing that things will be more expensive later on,\u201d Lans Perner, associate professor of clinical marketing at USC\u2019s Marshall School of Business, said.\n\nIn recent years, even pre-pandemic, Americans have shifted to online shopping. A 2022 study found that almost 80% of American consumers prefer to shop online.\n\nSome students believe that Black Friday\u2019s sales period is their one time to buy things they have always wanted. \u201cI generally know what kind of things I\u2019m looking for. This year it was sweaters,\u201d Kira Liljegran, a junior double majoring in international relations and theater, said.\n\nFor some people, shopping during Thanksgiving is an economic decision. For others, tradition drives their spending. \u201cBlack Friday is tradition, it\u2019s as big of a deal to us as Thanksgiving. It\u2019s something we [as a family] do every year,\u201d Sarra Hussien, a junior majoring in psychology and political science, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there has been a year where we have not participated in Black Friday shopping. We look forward to it every year.\u201d\n\nAccording to Perner, online shopping is rising, especially around holidays when it is convenient to get many things at once. \u201cYou can hit a lot more places,\u201d he said. Consequently, a whopping $11.2 billion was spent on Cyber Monday alone.\n\nData released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics projected around 166.3 million Americans rushing to get a bite of the deals available from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday.\n\nIn economics, the law of supply and demand states that when there is an increase in demand, the price for the demanded good goes up and vice versa. However, Perner points out that during the holiday season, especially Thanksgiving, an opposite of this phenomenon is observed. \u201cWhen people are looking to buy a lot of gifts \u2013 rather than raising prices, the merchants actually compete to put on massive sales,\u201d Perner, a bargain-hunting enthusiast himself, said.\n\n\u201cI remember one year our neighbor bought four TV\u2019s for $50 each,\u201d Hussien said.\n\nBut again, the reasons for the Black Friday shopping-binge vary.

They are now headed to Las Vegas this Friday where they will play the Utah Utes for the Pac-12 championship. It was a party at the Coliseum Saturday night. Over 70,000 fans packed the stadium jumping up and down and cheering as USC finishes the season 11-1. This is a complete 180 after finishing 4-8 a year ago.\n\nMany attribute USC\u2019s success this year to head coach Lincoln Riley who was hired last fall after the season. One of these people is USC accounting sophomore Alex Mainville. He gives his reactions on what Riley has accomplished this year.\n\nALEX MAINVILLE: I didn\u2019t expect him to turn the program around so quickly. I thought it was going to be something that would take like three or four years, maybe by the time I was a senior, but obviously I took just one season.\n\nRiley had great success in Oklahoma with an overall record of 55-10 before coming to USC. Director of Annenberg\u2019s Institute of Sports media and Society Daniel Durbin explains how Riley was able to continue his success.\n\nDANIEL DURBIN: You could see him turning around the team and potentially getting it in the top ten. Getting it into the top four might be a bit of a surprise, especially given the continued prejudice against Pac-12 teams. But it\u2019s not surprising that he was able to to put together a much better team. I mean, the big tipoff that he was going to be able to do so was the fact that he was able to bring over so many players from Oklahoma. And the portal helped him immensely in that he was essentially able to pick and choose the best players from USC and the best players from Oklahoma and put them together and create kind of a hybrid team.\n\nThe turnaround has brought a lot of excitement back to football. Here is Mainville again on what this year has meant.\n\nMAINVILLE: The experience was very good this year because I remember last year people were showing up to the games and then kind of just leaving after like a quarter or two, especially once USC started losing a lot. Nobody wanted to go to the games, and it was boring and it sucked. And then this year they\u2019re winning like every single game and it\u2019s very fun. And I\u2019m even staying \u2018til the end of the fourth quarter for a lot of these games, so I think it\u2019s a lot better than it was last year.\n\nFor the first time in five years, USC has made it back in to the top 10 in AP rankings being placed at number four. Students now have more to celebrate and look forward to with the success. Neuroscience sophomore Abel Santa feels the hype for this team and has been enticed to go to the Pac-12 championship in Las Vegas.\n\nABEL SANTA: I will go with with my friend group. And we were thinking about connecting it with a road trip. So we will probably drive there, and I\u2019m not sure how we will get the tickets. I think the other guys, we\u2019ll figure it out.\n\nProfessor Durbin agrees that the future for USC is bright as the Trojans get ready to move to the Big10.\n\nDURBIN: The good news is, is that, number one, we will have what will be perceived as a higher level of competition and a better level of competition. So it\u2019ll make it easier. Should USC be successful, it\u2019ll make it easier to get higher rankings for the championship. Number two, the games will be much more visible.\n\nWhat\u2019s more is that Ohio State and LSU, two teams ranked higher than USC both lost Saturday potentially allowing U-S-C to get in the college football playoffs. We will have to wait for the CFP rankings which come out tomorrow at 4 p.m.\n\nFor Annenberg Media I\u2019m Eric Yeh.\n```"}

Located on the fourth floor of the Student Union building, La CASA provides Latinx-identifying students with a sense of community while allowing them to further embrace their cultural identities.\n\nOne of the main goals of La CASA is to raise awareness on the importance of Latinx issues as well as highlight the level of diversity that is portrayed within the Latinx community through hosted events and services. These events include meet and greets, where \u201cstudents come in and we just play Loter\u00eda with them. Seeing the students mingle with each other, that\u2019s our goal,\u201d student worker, senior Daniel Recinos states.\n\nAnother event that La CASA hosts is Loter\u00eda Night, \u201cI think we can all get together, learn more about each other, and a little competitiveness. I\u2019ve seen, in the two events that I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve seen multiple different people that I haven\u2019t seen at La CASA,\u201d recalled junior Anahi Jimenez.\n\n\u201cFor me it means seeing students have a safe space, Latina students especially,\u201d said Recino. Placing special emphasis on the Latina population, Recinos also noted that for Latina students, at a predominantly white institution (PWI), it may not always be welcoming. Having a center such as La CASA provides a safe space because it is specifically built for them and being surrounded by other Latina students provides a certain level of comfort.\n\nStudent Worker, Daniel Recinos at the front desk of La CASA center\n(Photo courtesy of Yulianna Moran)\n\nIn addition to providing the Latinx students with a safe space and community, La CASA allows Latinx students to embrace their cultural backgrounds without fear of judgements. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t feel like I had a space on campus, I struggled a lot with imposter syndrome,\u201d said Jimenez. Before finding La CASA, Jimenez recalled how it was challenging to express her Latinidad as she had worn her Mexican hair on campus and received microaggressions. However, \u201cLa CASA provides a space where you can listen to your Spanish music, talk in Spanish, where you can just embrace everything that is being a Latino,\u201d Jimenez said.\n\nCultural appreciation for Latinx Backgrounds\n(Photo courtesy of Yulianna Moran)\n\nThroughout previous La Casa events, it gives Latinx students the opportunity to get to know one another within the Latinx community as well as getting more in touch with their cultural backgrounds. \u201cI always want our events to be diverse and capture the entirety of Latin America,\u201d says Recinos. To maintain the diversity of the events, one important factor is food. This aspect is one of the main ways that people of all Latin American backgrounds can come together to appreciate their individual cultures and learn more about the different Latinx heritages that reside within Latin America.\n\nMural Art within La CASA\n(Photo courtesy of Yulianna Moran)\n\nIn addition to allowing students to have a safe place where they can embrace their cultural backgrounds, La CASA offers numerous resources for its students ranging from academic resources, resources for undocumented and first generation students and even resources for mental health and wellness. La CASA has become a second home for many generations of Latinx students over the past 50 years and will continue to do so as more Latinxs students are getting admitted into USC each year.\n```"}

Citizens say Covid protocols prevented residents from escaping and receiving assistance. Vigils are happening not only across China but across the U.S. as people gather and mourn in solidarity.\n\nSullivan Barthel has the story. Large-scale protests have broken out in cities across China following an apartment fire last Friday which killed ten people and injured another nine. Chinese commentators shared footage and reports of the fire in Urumqi, Xianjiang on social media, infuriating citizens who said that Covid restrictions had impacted the rescue and stopped residents from escaping the building.\n\nProtesters in Shanghai and Urumqi have called for the government to lift lockdowns and restrictions on the press, and have even called for China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, to step down. These protests are the latest flare-up of widespread frustration about the country\u2019s stringent zero-Covid measures.\n\nJonathan Aronson, professor of communication at USC Annenberg and international relations at USC Dornsife, said that China\u2019s zero-tolerance Covid policies were a political and economic decision.\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly successful on one level, which is that Chinese deaths from Covid have been much, much lower than anywhere else of similar size and scale. It has been less successful in that people are fed up. They do get the news that around the world there have been much less restrictive policies.\u201d\n\nThe protests represent the biggest challenge to the government\u2019s power since Xi Jinping took office a decade ago. Outbursts like these have not been seen in China since the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, which were crushed by the Chinese army.\n\nAronson says that although it\u2019s rare for Chinese citizens to question their president, our digital world makes it easier to do so.\n\n\u201cIn an age of the Internet, it\u2019s more frequent. It\u2019s always been okay to criticize at the local level. Well, what happens is when you get up to the Politburo level, when you get up to the ruler\u2019s sitting in Beijing and particularly to Xi, that\u2019s what\u2019s new and that\u2019s what\u2019s not been tolerated before.\u201d\n\nSo far, protestors have been met with tear gas, and Chinese social media sites have been scrubbed of any anti-government messaging. On Sunday afternoon, a demonstration at Tsinghua University in Beijing drew a crowd of hundreds of students. Protesters noted that the gathering was not immediately shut down by police.\n\nAlthough Aronson thinks that Covid restrictions in China may ease over time, he is less optimistic that the government will change their policy because of protests.\n\n\u201cOver time they will recalculate. Over time, there will be some relaxation. I do not expect the Chinese government to say, \u201cOh, we\u2019ve suddenly seen the light, we are now going to make it easier because you\u2019ve asked us to.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government has blamed \u201cforces with ulterior motives\u201d for connecting the Xinjiang fire to Covid protocols. The government has said that it is reluctant to ease restrictions in the interest of stopping public transmission. China has a very low vaccination rate, as it has refused to offer any mRNA vaccines developed by Western countries.\n\nFor Annenberg News, I\u2019m Sullivan Barthel.\n```"}

Some stores have opted out of door busters in favor of prolonged online sales. Convenience reigns supreme for many shoppers whether they\u2019re on the hunt for a new family flat screen TV or a special gift for a special someone...even if it\u2019s only at a 10% discount. Sophia Hammerle spoke to USC students about how they get the best deals. Here\u2019s the story.\n\nUsually Black Friday conjures images of crowded stores, long lines, and fights over coveted merchandise. But as online shopping takes the lead, that image is changing. The COVID-19 pandemic launched online sales revenue to record levels. But the growth of online shopping appears to be a permanent change. Online shopping revenue this past Friday reached 9.12 billion dollars, surpassing the record set in 2020. And today\u2019s revenue from Cyber Monday is projected to be a record 11.2 billion dollars, according to Adobe Analytics.\n\nThis growth is on par with consumer preferences. Omar Salah-Eddine, a junior studying aerospace engineering at USC, says online shopping is preferable to waiting in long lines at stores.\n\n\"I used to do Black Friday and actually like wait out in line and do all that stuff. And then eventually I got over it. So much time, big waste. And I kind of enjoyed having dinner with my family over spending the entire night out in front of Target. Not a big fan.\"\n\nSasha Hussain is a junior majoring in health and human science. She went shopping in-person on Black Friday but admitted that the cost of transportation makes online shopping more accessible.\n\n\"I got one thing from Lululemon and then we came back. Like we only bought one thing total from the both of us, and we just Ubered back. We spent more money on the Uber than actually shopping.\"\n\n\"I think online shopping can be convenient because you don\u2019t have to go in person and you don\u2019t have to pay for an Uber, and it takes less time.\"\n\nDespite online shopping\u2019s undisputed rise in popularity, it retains certain downsides. LeeAnna Villarreal, a junior majoring in journalism, said it\u2019s less favorable to buy clothes online.\n\n\"It\u2019s convenient, and I can stay in bed and shop. But the only downside of that is I can\u2019t really order most things because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll fit, and I have to return it and it\u2019s a whole thing.\"\n\nWhen individuals do choose to shop online, many turn to the online-shopping giant Amazon. Despite consumer concerns over the company\u2019s environmental and labor practices, Amazon continues to top charts as the most-visited online shopping website in the U.S. One of these people is Anthony Slade, a junior studying journalism.\n\n\"I do feel a little guilty, but I would say Amazon\u2019s probably my number one just because it\u2019s so convenient and they have everything.\"\n\nWhile this year\u2019s projected revenue is on par with pre-pandemic levels, the rate of growth has actually slowed. In the three years prior to the pandemic, there was a consistent 20% growth in Black Friday online sales revenue from year to year. This year\u2019s Black Friday revenue increased by only 2.4% from 2021. Similarly, the projected revenue for Cyber Monday is only 5% greater than last year.\n\nThis slowed growth could be due to increased inflation. There is greater hesitancy to spend money, Omar Salah-Eddine explains.\n\n\"I know a lot of people are trying to hold on to their money kind of because of inflation and then kind of fearing a recession.\"\n\nThis is reflected in consumers\u2019 mindsets, including that of LeeAnna Villarreal.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t really shopped as much as I have in the past just because everything\u2019s more expensive.\"\n\nChristopher Holmes Smith is a USC Annenberg professor and directs the media, economics, and entrepreneurship program. He explained why Americans are still spending this year, despite these concerns.\n\n\"Prior to the pandemic, the labor market was in a historically strong standpoint and we saw trillions of dollars flowed into the economy during during the pandemic. And all of that money has not yet been exhausted. People still have money to spend.\"\n\nSmith said that these spending holidays also have significant cultural power to motivate spending.\n\n\"I still think that Black Friday and Cyber Monday still send behavioral signals to the average consumer... it still represents kind of like the true beginning of the holiday shopping season.\"\n\nThere\u2019s still a few hours left this Cyber Monday to snag a Holiday gift for family and friends... or for yourself.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sophia Hammerle.\n```"}

It\u2019s a group that includes Texas transfer senior outside hitter Skylar Fields \u2014 the Pac-12 leader in kills per set \u2014 along with top-ranked recruits outside hitter Jordan Wilson and libero Gala Trubint \u2014 two-time conference Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nUSC was announced as the No. 6 seed in the Texas Quadrant of the 2022 NCAA Tournament Sunday.

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Adam Jasper\nNovember 26, 2022 at 10:04 pm PST\n\nThere\u2019s no place like home \u2014 especially when home is a packed-out Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a rarity in the last decade of Trojans football. It was a monumental occasion, as the Coliseum finally started to look and feel like head coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s vision of a \u201cmecca of college football.\u201d In a stadium 72,613 fans strong, his team was up to the task.\n\nTrojan fans had much to be thankful for on Thanksgiving weekend, as No. 6 USC finished its regular season with an emphatic 38-27 rivalry win over Notre Dame Saturday night.\n\n\u201cThese guys brought it to life,\u201d Riley said about the Coliseum environment. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since it was like that, but it was electric in there.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I knew this was gonna happen, but at the same time, I don\u2019t believe in putting limits on what you can accomplish, especially if you get the right people in the building.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the game, you could tell who the Coliseum crowd thought should win the Heisman. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams cooked up a masterpiece in his first USC-Notre Dame rivalry matchup. Williams was comfortable in the chaos of the game. He was playing backyard football \u2014 scrambling all over the place and slinging daring passes anywhere and everywhere.\n\nWith his first run of the game, he became the leading quarterback rusher in USC single-season history. It was a tone-setting play to say the least, as the Heisman hopeful-turned-favorite went on to accrue 267 total yards with four total touchdowns, three of which came on foot. And, in true backyard football fashion, Williams even sneaked in a pair of punts.\n\n\u201c[My dad and I] have a rule: take what\u2019s in front of you, and if it\u2019s not there, scan the field. He also reminds me that I\u2019m a little bit athletic, so sometimes take off,\u201d Williams said. \u201c[He] always talks about it, \u2018take off, take off, take off.\u2019 Extending plays is a part of football; the play doesn\u2019t stop until the whistle is blown.\u201d\n\nThe Irish wouldn\u2019t go down peacefully, repeatedly matching the Trojans\u2019 scoring drives but never coming within one score in the second half. It was an interception by sophomore safety Calen Bullock with 4:56 remaining in the game that sealed the deal.\n\nRiley scripted the first USC offensive drive to perfection. The Trojans came out with trickery, running a fake reverse for 31 yards then a real reverse for 13 on the next play. It was Wiliams who finished off the drive, avoiding defenders like politics at Thanksgiving dinner and finding redshirt junior receiver Tahj Washington, who forced his way into the end zone.\n\nThe momentum was palpable in the packed Coliseum; on Notre Dame\u2019s ensuing first drive, a third-down tackle for loss by senior linebacker Shane Lee had the stadium bumping.\n\nThe USC defense picked up a key fourth-down stop early on in the second quarter, when it stuffed Notre Dame redshirt sophomore quarterback Drew Pyne inches short of the chains.\n\nA slow tempo and committed run game fueled a methodical Notre Dame offense \u2014 but the yards just weren\u2019t coming in the early going. The Irish rushed for 2.5 yards per carry in the first half.\n\nInstead, it was Pyne who showed up out of the gate. He was a perfect 8-of-8 passing with 106 yards and a touchdown in the first half, and he didn\u2019t stop there. Pyne didn\u2019t throw his first incomplete pass until the beginning of the fourth quarter. He finished 23-for-26 with 318 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nJunior tight end Michael Mayer kept up this season\u2019s trend of tight ends slicing open the USC defense like a Thanksgiving turkey. Midway through the second quarter, he elevated his 6-foot-4 frame to grab a 22-yard touchdown pass and put Notre Dame on the board.\n\nMayer kept eating in the second half, totaling 98 yards on eight receptions with two touchdowns.\n\nUSC\u2019s defense has taken its fair share of criticism throughout the season. But, it held its own against the Irish, forcing two turnovers and holding a proficient rushing attack to just 90 yards.\n\n\u201cI honestly got sick and tired of hearing how we were just gonna get pounded in the run game,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe takeaways have just kept coming for the Trojans this season, putting their turnover margin at plus-22 on the season, the top mark in a single season in FBS since 2018.\n\n\u201c[The doubters] tried to make it seem like it\u2019s lucky,\u201d sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really worried about the outside [opinions]. We\u2019re worried about what we got going on.\u201d\n\nWhen the defense let up, it was the offense which buoyed the team.\n\n\u201cThe time is right now,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of leaders on this team, and one of the things that we talked about when we first got here is [that] great teams; their players lead.\u201d\n\nSenior running back Austin Jones continued to avenge his teammate Travis Dye\u2019s season-ending injury. The Stanford transfer was hotter than an apple pie fresh out of the oven, torching the Irish for a career-high 154 yards on 25 carries.\n\n\u201cI had to step up,\u201d Jones said. \u201c[Travis] is a great player, he did great things at the beginning of the season. I just have to add on to what he\u2019s been doing.\u201d\n\nThe win closes out the regular season of a magical first year under Riley, including a pair of rivalry wins the last two weeks. Last season\u2019s 4-8 record seems a far cry from the product on display this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stood right by what I told you our expectations were from day one,\u201d Riley said. \u201cA lot of people thought I was crazy, that\u2019s fine. People within the walls knew what we were about and had a sense of what we were building. It\u2019s been a fun run.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans now await the result of the Washington vs. Washington State game to see whether they will face Oregon or Utah in the Pac-12 Championship game on December 2 in Las Vegas.\n\nRiley\u2019s words before the game summed up the collective mood around the USC program regarding its success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a vision anymore, enjoy it.\u201d\n```"}

In that same time frame, he\u2019s topped 200 yards twice and thrown a pick in three games.

Although he may be forgetting about Georgia sophomore Brock Bowers, it\u2019s not unlikely that Mayer will be a first round draft pick in April. USC has already been taken to task by one top tight end this year, allowing Utah senior Dalton Kincaid to catch 16 passes for 234 yards and a touchdown. Slowing Mayer down will be essential to beating the Irish.\n\nThe run\nWhen Notre Dame trounced Clemson 35-14, Pyne threw for a mere 85 yards against the then-No. 4 Tigers. Clemson\u2019s issue defensively was that both sophomores Audric Estime and Logan Diggs ran for over 100 yards. The backs average 5.8 and five yards per carry on the season, respectively. USC has allowed the 66th most rush yards per game, but that vaguely respectable figure is heavily influenced by teams often opting to pass instead \u2014 USC faces the 19th fewest rush attempts per game. On a per carry basis, USC is 101st in the country. The only teams USC has faced that average more rushing yards per game than Notre Dame are Utah, UCLA and Oregon State \u2014 the Trojans\u2019 three closest games. If Notre Dame can continue its past success on the ground, USC is in for a tough day.\n\nReturning players from injury\nUSC sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry was injured against Utah, and barely played in his return last week against UCLA. The 6-foot-6, 200-pound inside linebacker was a vital piece of the Trojan defense before his injury. His return will be vital in USC\u2019s efforts to stop both the Notre Dame run and pass game. Notre Dame senior safety Brandon Joseph was a massive addition for the Irish through the transfer portal. Joseph has played well, but has not been as big a difference maker as expected, with only one interception this season after nine picks in the two years prior at Northwestern. Joseph was injured against Clemson and is likely to return this week. Will he be able to turn around his turnover luck against the team with the best turnover margin in the nation?\n\nSpecial teams matter too!\nUSC has barely punted this year \u2013 junior Aadyn Sleep-Dalton hasn\u2019t even punted enough to qualify for Sports Reference\u2019s yards per punt rankings. When the Trojans have had to punt, though, it hasn\u2019t been very pretty. Sleep-Dalton would be tied for 105th in the nation in Sports Reference\u2019s yards per punt standings if he qualified. Notre Dame has blocked a nation-leading seven punts this year. If Notre Dame can stop USC\u2019s offense, far from a small ask, the Irish will have a chance to bring out their biggest strength.\n\nThe Trenches\nThe Trojans and Fighting Irish have each sacked opposing quarterbacks 33 times this year, good for 13th in the nation. Both have star pass rushers: USC junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu ranks second in the nation in sacks and Notre Dame senior defensive lineman Isaiah Foskey is seventh. Both are expected to go off the board early in April. Both offensive lines have had excellent seasons as well.  Per football outsiders , USC\u2019s offensive line generates the most rush yards per carry in the nation, with Notre Dame at eighth. Notre Dame has allowed fewer sacks \u2014 only 17 on the season \u2014 but many of USC\u2019s 20 sacks have been coverage sacks, with sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams looking to make a big play long after the snap before finally being swallowed up. USC and Notre Dame will kick off at the Coliseum Saturday at 4:30 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Nolan Ezzet\nNovember 25, 2022 at 3:42 pm PST\n\nIn its final matchup of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament Friday, USC shot lights-out except for when it mattered most, failing to top Wisconsin in a 64-59 loss that dropped the Trojans to 4-3 and gave them a fourth-place finish in the tournament.\n\nSenior guard Boogie Ellis and fifth year senior guard Drew Peterson led the Trojan offense and were explosive in the first half. Ellis shot 5-for-9 and totaled 13 points, and Peterson provided 3-for-4 shooting, which was good for eight points.\n\nAfter a tight five minutes to begin the first half, Ellis drained two straight 3-point shots to give the Trojans a 14-10 lead. But the Badgers\u2019 offense had an answer to everything and took a 19-17 lead midway through the half.\n\nSophomore guard Kobe Johnson drilled an Ellis-assisted 3-pointer to begin an eventual 12-3 run. However, the Trojans struggled to close out the half, scoring five points in the last six minutes and turning the ball over one too many times.\n\nThe Badgers took advantage of a lackluster Trojan offense and went into halftime leading 36-34.\n\nThe second half was lower scoring, partly due to strong defensive efforts by both sides but also because of poor execution. Ellis shot 1-for-7 in the second half, while Peterson didn\u2019t fare much better at 3-for-11.\n\n\u201cOur playmakers and leading scorers have to be able to produce for us down the stretch of a game,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cBoogie\u2019s been terrific for us all season, and so has Drew...They\u2019ve done a lot of great things for us this short season, but for us to be good, [their shooting] percentage is not quite good enough in the second half.\u201d\n\nJohnson stepped up and shot 2-of-4 in the second half and racked up five points off the bench. But more importantly, he provided a handful of hustle plays and a great defensive effort by blocking two shots in the second half.\n\nAlthough Johnson didn\u2019t produce any steals, his pick-pocketing presence was felt.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always going to be in the gaps. He\u2019s always going to go for the steals \u2014 the smart steals,\u201d redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan said of Johnson. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good player defensively and offensively ... Even if he\u2019s not scoring he\u2019s going to be doing something that\u2019s positively affecting the game.\u201d\n\nMorgan was another key defensive player for the Trojans. His paint presence made the Badgers settle for tough shots, and he recorded a block \u2014 continuing his streak of blocking a shot in each game this season.\n\nHeading into the game, Morgan ranked fourth in the nation with 3.5 blocks per game this season.\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t shoot well in the half, Peterson found a rhythm in the middle of the second half. He drained three straight from beyond the arc to keep the game competitive until the end. This gave the Trojans a 57-54 lead with 5:42 remaining, but they scored just two points in the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cWe have to find a way to be able to score in the last couple of minutes of a game,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cAnd we had good looks tonight in the last four minutes. Everybody had a chance. It seemed like everybody missed a shot.\u201d\n\nUSC had the ball down three with 20 seconds left, but Peterson turned the ball over and Wisconsin scored a layup, eliminating USC\u2019s chances for overtime.\n\nThe Trojans look to bounce back as they face Cal, their first conference matchup of the season, on Wednesday at 7 p.m.\n```"}

In the Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament, the talent reared its inexperienced side as the Trojans committed 20 turnovers in a 73-66 defeat against the Tennessee Volunteers.\n\n\u201cWe were just trying to force some stuff here and there,\u201d sophomore guard Kobe Johnson said. \u201cI think those turnovers definitely affected the game. We all played into it.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans also committed 23 fouls, with Tennessee converting those into 22 made free throws.\n\n\u201cIt was disappointing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe had 23 fouls to their 10, and they were the most physical team we\u2019ve played. There were also some calls that didn\u2019t go our way.\u201d\n\nVolunteer freshman forward Julian Phillips led the game with 25 points while also collecting eight rebounds. Phillips was responsible for one of just three successful attempts from behind the arc for the Volunteers. The Trojans\u2019 zone defense limited the Volunteers to a 17% mark from 3-point range.\n\nOn the other side, senior guard Boogie Ellis had 21 points in the losing effort after dropping 27 against BYU last night. The former Memphis Tiger leads the team with 18.5 points per game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been staying in the moment, taking it play by play,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nWith 1:17 left to go in the first half, Ellis tried to pass to redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan. Tennessee sophomore guard Jahmai Mashack picked the ball and took it all the way to the rim for a slam dunk and one to put the Volunteers up 36-29. Mashack flexed in celebration, while Enfield called a timeout.\n\nEllis responded by hitting a 3-pointer from the right side as the buzzer sounded to make it 37-34 Tennessee at the half. Then right out of the gates, Ellis tied the game with another three.\n\nThe Trojans took their first lead since the first half when Volunteer senior forward Uros Plavsic fouled Dixon-Waters, leading to two successful free-throws. The freebies were part of a 9-0 run that put the Trojans up 43-39 with 16:55 to go.\n\nThe hot hands became ice cold as the Trojans did not score for another six minutes. Tennessee sophomore forward Jonas Aidoo grabbed the lead back on a floater to make the score 46-45 Tennessee with 13:55 to go.\n\nThe back and forth continued for several minutes. With under 90 seconds left, Tennessee senior forward Olivier Nkamhoua leaped up and put back a shot from the left side of the basket to tie the game at 62 apiece.\n\nPeterson would go on to miss a potential game-winning buzzer-beater from half-court, sending the game into overtime. After an Ellis jump shot tied the game at 66, Vescovi hit the only three pointer of the extra period to put the Vols up 69-66 with 1:45 to go.\n\nA five-second violation by the Trojans denied them the chance to tie the game with under 90 seconds left. On the next USC possession, freshman guard Tre White bounced a pass out of bounds, putting the final nail in the coffin for the Trojans.\n\n\u201cOur players played hard, and they played well for most of the game,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cBut we had six turnovers in overtime. It\u2019s tough to continuously turn the ball over that many times.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will play Wisconsin in the Battle 4 Atlantis third-place game on Friday at 10 a.m. The Badgers are coming off of an overtime 69-68 loss to No. 3 Kansas.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Will Camardella\nNovember 23, 2022 at 7:38 pm PST\n\nLate into the second half, the USC men\u2019s basketball team appeared completely in control of the ball game. The Trojans had a lead as large as 18 points with four and a half minutes to go, and seemed to be cruising to a convincing win over the BYU Cougars. Aided by some USC turnovers down the stretch, BYU gave USC a run for its money in the game\u2019s final minutes. However, the Trojan lead was too large for the Cougars to overcome and USC hung on for an 82-76 win in the quarterfinals of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in The Bahamas.\n\nThe Trojans, who were doing a decent job protecting the basketball for the overwhelming majority of the game, turned the ball over five times in the game\u2019s final three minutes. BYU had switched into a press defense that USC struggled to counter, leading to a 10-second violation. Coupled with a few bad passes in the backcourt that gave the Cougars extra possessions, BYU whittled the lead down to single digits. BYU was not efficient enough on their extra chances however, and never cut the lead to anything less than seven until hitting a meaningless three-pointer as time expired.\n\n\u201cTowards the end, it\u2019s just a few mistakes we have to clean up,\u201d fifth-year guard Drew Peterson said after the game. \u201cWe\u2019re working on taking care of the ball and making the quick decisions, including myself. I can\u2019t turn the ball over down the stretch like that. We were fortunate to have a big lead because we executed real well on both ends.\u201d\n\nBYU\u2019s four triples in the final three minutes were enough to concern head coach Andy Enfield about how the Trojans finish games. \u201cWhen we have a lead, we need to play like it\u2019s a tie game or we\u2019re down,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cOur sense of urgency to the three-point shooters was not as great as it was in the first 36 minutes.\u201d\n\nTo build such a dominant lead, the Trojans relied on one of their best team offensive performances of the season, as four of their five starters scored in double figures. Leading the charge for USC was senior guard Boogie Ellis, who matched his career-best 27 points on 7-of-9 shooting from the floor. Much of Ellis\u2019 success in this game came by getting to the line; he made 13 free throws on 17 attempts, the most makes and attempts of his career. When asked what led to such a strong night offensively, Ellis said, \u201cStaying locked in, knowing that I was going to make shots and staying confident.\u201d\n\nPeterson and redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan each recorded their second double-double of the season. Morgan recorded 11 points and 10 rebounds, and was the Trojans\u2019 top force in the paint all night. Peterson had 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, while only turning the ball over once. \u201c[Morgan] has been battling illness, so he played terrific basketball,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s our best shot blocker and defender in the interior...Our two centers today did an outstanding job of outplaying their bigs in the paint.\u201d\n\nSophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters also had a strong performance, scoring nine of his season-high 13 points in the second half. Dixon-Waters, like many of his teammates, thrived from mid-range. The Trojans shot over 60% on two point shots and that efficiency was key, as the team was 2-of-10 from three and only attempted two triples in the second half.\n\nUSC\u2019s zone defense kept the Cougars at bay for much of the second half. While the Trojans were on a 19-7 run to start the second half, BYU missed 11 of its first 16 shots coming out of the break after shooting over 45% from the floor in the first half. The Cougars had a better three-point shooting night than their opponents, making 12 in the game, but a bevy of turnovers kept USC in front consistently. BYU turned the ball over seventeen times in this game, including 11 in the first half, gifting the Trojans 17 points of offense. Those giveaways were not all unforced errors, as USC recorded eight steals throughout the night. While the Trojans gave the ball away a lot late in the game, they were taking it away much more than turning it over for the bulk of the contest.\n\nUSC\u2019s fourth consecutive win moves its record to 4-1 on the season. The Trojans will advance to the semifinals of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament on Thursday morning, where they will face either the Tennessee Volunteers or the Butler Bulldogs.\n```"}

One minute into the second quarter, the Trojans trailed by nine points and were shooting 4-for-19 from the field. It wasn\u2019t how USC expected to start against the 1-4 Quakers.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t start the way we wanted to,\u201d coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cI felt like Penn really asserted themselves.\u201d\n\nThe shooting improved as the game went on \u2014 but not by much. The Trojans were shooting 13-of-36 from the field and 3-for-13 from 3-point range at halftime. USC managed to go into the half up 34-33, but the Trojans were by no means out of the woods yet.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a stellar team performance in the first half, but one Trojan stood out: sophomore forward Rayah Marshall. With 13 points and 10 rebounds \u2014 eight of which were on the offensive boards \u2014 Marshall had a double-double in the first half alone. To just about any other coach, a first half double-double would be cause for celebration. But Gottlieb wasn\u2019t thrilled with some of Marshall\u2019s defensive plays, which she made clear to her star forward during halftime despite the flashy stat line.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone who\u2019s had a double-double at half has had their coach get on them before, but I sure did,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAnd I thought she responded.\u201d\n\nMarshall ended the game with 19 points, 18 rebounds, three steals and five blocks. The 19 points and 18 rebounds each set career highs for her. Marshall dominated in nearly every facet of the game, but Gottlieb expects her to only improve as the season goes on.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so young, and we rely on her to be a veteran,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge growth step for her, and she\u2019s so incredibly coachable, which means she\u2019s gonna continue to get better.\u201d\n\nMarshall\u2019s main supporting cast came in the form of graduate forward Kadi Sissoko and graduate guard Destiny Littleton. Sissoko also had a double-double with 18 points and 11 rebounds, while Littleton scored 13 points and led the team in assists with five. Both have scored double digits in each game this season.\n\nThe second half was more of the same from USC. The Trojans shot 13-for-37 from the field and 1-for-6 from beyond the arc in the second half, bringing USC\u2019s shooting rates from the game to 26-for-73 from the field and 4-for-19 from 3-point land. It was USC\u2019s worst shooting night of the season in terms of field goal and 3-point percentage \u2014 35.6% and 21.1%, respectively.\n\nGottlieb attributed the poor shooting to Penn\u2019s zone defense that gave the Trojans fits at times.\n\n\u201cI do think we have really good shooters,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think it\u2019s on me; I have to make our zone offense cleaner ... I do think we\u2019re a team that can dominate the paint but also make a lot of threes.\u201d\n\nUSC trailed 46-45 with under four minutes left in the third quarter, but a 3-pointer from senior guard Alyson Miura kicked off a run that all but sealed the win for the Trojans. With an 11-0 run that cut into the fourth quarter, the Trojans jumped out to a 10-point lead with 8:45 remaining and squashed Penn\u2019s hopes of an upset.\n\nDespite leading for longer than USC did, Penn fell short of taking down the Trojans. USC improved to 5-0 on the season, with the Quakers dropping to 1-5.\n\nUSC\u2019s physicality on the glass was the difference-maker. The Trojans out-rebounded the Quakers 52-33 and 27-12 on offensive boards. Those offensive rebounds allowed USC to take 13 more shots than Penn, which helped the Trojans make up for their shooting struggles.\n\nIt was a tight game against an opponent the Trojans could have beaten by more, but Gottlieb isn\u2019t concerned in the slightest. Gottlieb expects the team \u2014 consisting of more transfers than returning players \u2014 to figure things out as the season goes on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of new players. We\u2019re not young, but we\u2019re very new,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cSo that chemistry is continuing to grow. I think our communication is getting better.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s next test will come against Utah State on Saturday at 1 p.m. at Galen Center.\n```"}

(AP Photo/John McCoy, File)\n\nBy Jaydelle Herbert November 23, 2022 at 2:13 pm PST\n\nLos Angeles is known for its rivalries, from the Lakers versus Clippers to the Angels versus the Dodgers. But nothing beats the USC and UCLA rivalry, which dates back to 1929. The first reported prank that sparked the rivalry was when USC students stole a 295-pound bell from UCLA, according to USC Athletics. Each year the Victory Bell is given to the winning team.\n\nWith over 75,000 fans attending the game last Saturday, there were many tailgates outside of the stadium before kickoff. A diehard USC fan was waiting for the Rose Bowl Stadium\u2019s gates to open. The white-haired man, a USC alumnus, wore a red button up. His son said his dad, Gary Blasiar, has been a fan of USC for over 50 years and graduated in 1974.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the best rivalries you could possibly have with two Crosstown teams,\u201d Blasiar said. \u201cUCLA is going to lose.\u201d\n\nStarting around 11 a.m., older fans of both teams already had their USC and UCLA tents hanging above their heads in Jackie Robinson Memorial Field. In one area, there was a display of about 50 stuffed animals \u2014 Bruin Bears. The UCLA fan said it is their 37th year being a ticket holder for UCLA football and collected bears ever since.\n\nAs the sounds of the UCLA band practicing the National Anthem faded by Jackie Robinson Memorial Field, younger crowds headed to the parking lot at the Rose Bowl. The stadium was filled with students, big families, rap music and lots of barbecue.\n\nThree college students were walking through UCLA\u2019s tailgates to find USC\u2019s. The three were representing USC by wearing red shirts that read \u201cFUCLA\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t BRUIN Your Life.\u201d Lily Leonard, Makkonen Haile and Michael Saccone voiced their hatred for the Bruins. If Saconne had the opportunity to tell UCLA one thing, he would say, \u201cGet your own stadium.\u201d\n\nLeonard and Haile hollered in excitement over Saconne\u2019s dig against UCLA. UCLA students weren\u2019t holding back from the heated rivalry. The Bruins\u2019 student section chanted about how much they despise USC throughout the tailgate.\n\nIn front of the Rose Bowl, a USC fan with a red sweater tied around his neck and sunglasses covering his eyes was buying a watermelon-flavored ice cream. Next to him was a woman with a black jersey and \u201cEpps 19\u2032\u2032 written on the back. Michelle and Wisley Epps, the parents of redshirt senior tight end Malcolm Epps, traveled from Houston, Texas to watch their son play against UCLA.\n\n\u201cI am super duper excited, peacock proud, too excited to watch our son play,\u201d Michelle Epps said. The Epps offered words of advice to their son. \u201cGo hard or go home,\u201d Wisley Epps said. \u201cWe love you,\u201d Michelle Epps said. \u201cPlay hard just like you always do, son and fight on.\u201d\n\nBut there was a couple who was sitting away from the tailgaters, Frederick Carr and his wife Christine. The married couple had a picnic set up in front of a gate facing the entrance of the Rose Bowl. The Carrs were eating cubed cheese and wine in their lawn chairs as they were \u201cpeople watching.\u201d Frederick\u2019s silver fox hair shined in the light as he wore a baby blue UCLA button up with a white long-sleeve. Christine wore a navy blue UCLA zip-up sweater, which matched the color of her eyes. They have been attending UCLA games for 52 years.\n\n\u201cUCLA breaks your heart so many times, you can\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d Frederick Carr said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Charlie Brown with the football. I\u2019m always optimistic when kicking the football, but usually I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d\n\nWhile studying for a master\u2019s degree in journalism at UCLA in the 1970s, Christine said she enjoyed seeing \u201ccrude\u201d comments on USC shirts. \u201cWhen I went here, I would see shirts that said, \u2018My maid went to UCLA,\u2019\u201d Christine Carr said. \u201cI am seeing less crude shirts now than I did before.\u201d\n\nFor the game itself, the veteran UCLA fan, Frederick, believed the final score would be 54-28 with USC defeating UCLA. The 92nd meeting between the L.A. teams had Pac-12 title game implications. If the Bruins would have scored another touchdown in the fourth quarter, UCLA and USC would have been tied with conference records of 8-2. The game ended with USC beating UCLA by three points, 48-45. And with the win, USC avoided the tiebreaker drama and punched its ticket to the Pac-12 championship game.\n\nThe Trojans last chance to enjoy quality time, loud music and barbecue will take place before the home game versus Notre Dame on Saturday, November 26.\n```"}

Redshirt senior offensive lineman Justin Dedich\u2019s approach to Saturday\u2019s game is to not be overly confident.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t come out there thinking we got it just because we won last week\u2019s game against UCLA,\u201d Dedich said. \u201cWe have to go out there and dominate.\u201d\n\nSaturday will also be Senior Day for the Trojans. Plenty of seniors such as redshirt senior defensive lineman Nick Figueroa stuck around for another year after the 4-8 season and are thankful for what this group has accomplished.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful for all the moments I\u2019ve had and grateful for this year in particular,\u201d Figueroa said. \u201cWe have a big final game of the season and I am excited to go compete in there for the last time.\u201d\n\nAlthough the season isn\u2019t quite finished, Riley is proud of what his team has achieved. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling throughout Tuesday\u2019s practice.\n\n\u201cIt is never going to be a perfect climb. There are a lot of ups and downs but I do see mental progress and I see us finding cool ways to win and beating good opponents,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThis team is serious about getting the job done.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Terence Holton November 22, 2022 at 3:27 pm PST\n\nWhen USC announced it would be moving to the Big Ten in 2024, it was widely regarded as one of the biggest moves in NCAA history. Frequent readers of The Big Ten Breakdown are well versed in my opinions of why moving to the Big Ten is the best thing for the USC athletic department and school itself. However, I think it\u2019s time we take a look at some of the negatives of the Trojans switching to a conference halfway across the country.\n\nOne thing many fans are looking forward to is seeing the various Trojan sports play teams they rarely played before such as Ohio State, Michigan or Penn State, to name a few. An underlying problem in playing these teams is the travel involved. For sports such as football, travel is less of a problem, as teams usually fly out on Friday and fly back on Sunday anyway. This wouldn\u2019t be an issue. However, for sports played on weekdays such as basketball or volleyball, it\u2019s a lot trickier.\n\nHypothetically, if men\u2019s or women\u2019s basketball were to have a game on a Tuesday night at Penn State, the athletes would most likely have to miss at least three days of school. This may sound ridiculous, but a plausible scenario would be to fly out on Monday and get a good night of rest before the game the next day, then play on Tuesday, and then fly home on Wednesday. A flight from LAX to State College is about five to six hours. Unless USC is to subject its athletes to grueling late-night home flights, athletes could be missing three days of school a week, and that is not even counting the time missed to play the second potential road game that same week.\n\nQuite possibly the biggest criticism of USC and UCLA moving to the Big Ten is that the move was made entirely for money. It has already been reported that UCLA and USC will be making 100 million dollars a year just by joining the Big Ten, a vast improvement over the measly 30 million the two programs make in the Pac-12. From a financial standpoint, this move makes sense, but it really does not make sense for USC\u2019s athletes, and there is truly no driving factor for leaving the Pac-12 other than money.\n\nThough it sounds like a blast to be playing a bunch of new teams from across the country, leaving the Pac-12 is leaving USC\u2019s history behind. The Trojans joined the Pac-12 back when it was the Pacific Coast Conference in 1922. Since then, countless conference championships have been won along with 11 national championships. The Pac-12 (or the \u201cConference of Champions\u201d as Bill Walton calls it) is USC\u2019s roots and as someone who grew up in Oregon, I am going to miss having the opportunity to watch the Ducks and Trojans potentially square off in conference championships.\n\nMany of USC\u2019s rivalries will be hard to keep as well. Notre Dame and UCLA should be easy to continue scheduling, but what about Stanford and Cal? The Trojans\u2019 unofficial California rivals will most likely be slotted out of USC\u2019s schedule and replaced by teams like Nebraska or Iowa. Though it is interesting to play new teams, I will miss some of the Trojans\u2019 old rivalries back in the Pac-12.\n\nUSC and UCLA moving to the Big Ten will end up being good for the two athletic departments in my mind, however there are definitely negatives that shouldn\u2019t go unreported. I believe that USC\u2019s athletic department will be able to figure out how to avoid having its athletes miss three days of school in some weeks, as well as fit in some of the Trojans\u2019 old Pac-12 opponents for out of conference games. Personally, I\u2019d love to see the Trojans decimate Stanford a few years down the road \u2014 just for old time\u2019s sake.\n\nIt is still unclear how exactly USC will navigate joining the Big Ten. Hopefully it ends up benefitting the athletes, not just the athletic department. The Big Ten Breakdown runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

The kind of lies that convince us photographs can come to life, that the good guys can come out on top, that we can ride our bicycles across the moonlit sky \u2014 we\u2019ve eaten them up from the hands of Steven Spielberg. Yet, he waited 60 years to mythologize his own childhood with \u201cThe Fabelmans.\u201d He found the grounds to make the film after constantly revisiting the idea and rejecting it over the years. Conveniently, it\u2019s a film that he could only make in his senior years and after a lifetime of mastering a cinematic language that has never ceased its wondrous qualities.\n\nSammy Fabelman, played by Mateo Zoryon Francis-DeFord, stands in as 6-year-old Spielberg. Sammy feels art and his relationships deeply, a theme that permeates the film as he ages. In 1952, those feelings coalesce when his Jewish parents, concert pianist Mitzi (Michelle Williams) and electrical engineer Burt (Paul Dano), take Sammy to see Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth\u201d \u2014 his first film on the silver screen. The film spellbinds Sammy enough to venture into filmmaking by recreating the \u201cpersistence of vision\u201d \u2014 the illusion of motion \u2014 of DeMille\u2019s crash sequence with a set of toy trains and Burt\u2019s 8mm camera.\n\nConceptually and thematically, Sammy\u2019s films grow in complexity with time, but so do the needs between his parents and his likable surrogate uncle, Bennie (Seth Rogen). Meanwhile, an emphatic 16-year-old Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) struggles with the growing burden of adulthood when he unintentionally captures hints of an affair between Mitzi and Bennie on film \u2014 a secret that eventually surfaces and forces Mitzi and Burt to split. The reckoning leads Sammy to a short-lived hiatus from moviemaking.\n\nSeveral antisemitic encounters at school precede Sammy\u2019s chance to helm a 16mm camera for the first time while filming \u201csenior ditch day\u201d at the beach, subsequently demonstrating his natural eye for the frame and illustrating the birth of an auteur. He films his main antagonist as practically a god among men and garners the respect, and tears even, of his bully at the screening \u2014 in the most impactful \u201cmagic of cinema\u201d moment in the film.\n\nMichelle Williams as Mitzi Fabelman in \"The Fabelmans.\" (Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures)\n\nThe film maintains its digestibility thanks to the Spielberg tone, but doesn\u2019t stop at simply communicating \u201cthe magic of cinema.\u201d Spielberg has gone on record about his fear of \u201ceverything\u201d as a child, which is palpable in the film, but in \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d he wants us to know that not all of his fears were irrational. From that comes a new avenue to explore for the director. While cinema reflects and provokes the best aspects of ourselves, it can also have dire consequences. In haunting foreshadowing, Mitzi\u2019s estranged Uncle Boris (Judd Hirsch) makes a surprise visit to the Fabelman residence, and reminds Sammy that \u201cFamily, art \u2014 it\u2019ll tear you in two.\u201d\n\nCoupled with Spielberg\u2019s ability to gauge the rhythm of a scene, Michael Khan and Sarah Broshar\u2019s seamless and inventive transitions to different periods of Sammy\u2019s life feel earned. Frequent Spielberg collaborator and screenwriter Tony Kushner coordinated with his leads in \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d by allowing Williams and Dano to channel their authoritative screen presence to their fullest. Mitzi is one of the more interesting portraits of the Fabelman bunch, a woman caught in the throes of balancing her individuality and duty to her family. Williams fits Mitzi\u2019s shoes finely, gliding across the screen with the same elegance and impulsiveness of her piano movements. More often than not, it\u2019s as if music is playing, but she\u2019s the only one who can hear it.\n\nThe Spielberg-Kushner partnership is especially strong in the film\u2019s third act, when Burt receives a photograph from Mitzi in his mail sometime after their divorce. Spielberg frames Dano\u2019s shattered expression in a close-up with negative space above the actor\u2019s head, making room for Burt\u2019s thoughts in his loss of words. It\u2019s one of the more poignant scenes of Spielberg\u2019s filmography and a career defining moment as a maestro of emotion.\n\nAs much as the film is about what cinema can do to us, it\u2019s about seizing the life we think we deserve. Early in the film, Burt tells 6-year-old Sammy, \u201cYou can\u2019t just love something, you also have to take care of it.\u201d Spielberg hasn\u2019t just loved the movies, and \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d is a testament to how well Spielberg is taking care of this craft.\n\n\u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d nationwide release in theaters is on Nov. 23.\n```"}

Now at 20-9 overall and 12-6 in conference play, USC fell to fourth place in the Pac-12 standings with the loss. With the NCAA tournament approaching, the team\u2019s chances for a tournament spot are slipping. This is USC\u2019s best season since 2018 with head coach Brad Keller. The Trojans have two conference games left this upcoming week to determine their fate this season.\n\nMatthew Knight Arena was silent when senior outside hitter Skylar Fields opened the first set with a strong kill down the middle of Oregon\u2019s court. Fields scored three out of four points for her team, giving them a 4-2 lead. Oregon saw what Keller described as USC\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d playing style early on and started executing quick back-to-back kills and a block to tie the game early at four points. When the Ducks were ahead of the Trojans by one point, the Trojans\u2019 fast offense during senior opposite hitter Emilia Weske\u2019s serving run pushed them back to a 16-10 lead. When Fields\u2019 spikes were blocked by the Ducks, Fields quickly changed her approach to help USC win the first set 25-21. The senior tipped the ball over the net late in the set, and Oregon\u2019s front row scrambled on the ground unsuccessfully to try and keep the ball in play.\n\nThe Trojans started the second set with straight kills to the Ducks\u2019 back row. Oregon\u2019s confused back row defenders couldn\u2019t bounce back until they went on a serving run of four to lead 16-15. The subsequent exchange for kills between the Trojans and Ducks resulted in a tie at 20 points. The tie happened after Fields\u2019 quick set for Weske\u2019s kill was blocked by Oregon freshman outside hitter Mimi Colyer and redshirt junior middle blocker Karson Bacon. Two points later, graduate libero Kelli Barry\u2019s dig gave sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga the opportunity to set the ball to Fields. Oregon\u2019s front row completely missed Fields\u2019 fast swing and hit Bacon\u2019s head to make it 22-20 Trojans. Two swift blocks by Oregon for two points pushed the Trojans to fight for a win, but USC held on to win 25-23.\n\nThe momentum of the game shifted in the third set. USC was struggling to maintain a lead on Oregon after nine ties and three lead changes throughout the set. Keller said the team\u2019s mistakes weren\u2019t a representation of their playing style. \u201cWe made a couple of non-USC errors in the third set,\u201d Keller said. The last tie at 19 points determined which team would win the third set. Oregon\u2019s block made the Trojans\u2019 back row scramble. The Ducks weren\u2019t expecting the ball, but quickly regained control of the ball for Colyer\u2019s kill to make it 21-19. Keller called two timeouts to help his team stay focused and secure a win. \u201cMost of our timeouts are about staying in the moment, what we are going to do next and talk about the next defensive situation for them to prepare for it,\u201d Keller said. \u201cKeep their heads up, keep going and compete. But Colyer switched up USC\u2019s plans. The freshman executed another kill and two service aces to help Oregon win 25-20 in the third set.\n\nThe Ducks took control over the Trojans early in the fourth set, leading 3-0 early. Fields swung her arm back to smack the ball at Oregon\u2019s defense on the next point. Officials thought the quick kill was out of bounds, but Keller challenged the call and gained a point for USC. The Trojans were determined to find a rhythm as sophomore middle blocker Katelyn Smith\u2019s kill grazed across the fingertips of Oregon\u2019s blockers to close the Ducks\u2019 lead to 15-11. Later, freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson, who scored 15 kills, jumped a couple of feet off of the ground to hit the ball for a kill, though Oregon still led 19-15. Although USC fought throughout long volleys, there were no ties or lead changes in this set. The Ducks went on to win 25-20.\n\nKeller believed his team became reserved and started overthinking the way they were playing. \u201cThat was disheartening,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI felt like when we fell behind, our body language and mood changed, we became cautious instead of playing aggressive.\u201d\n\nAfter Oregon won the third and fourth set, the home crowd screamed in excitement to start the fifth set. Nevertheless, USC\u2019s front row of graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams and Fields evenly exchanged kills to help gain a lead 4-2. The Ducks fed off of service aces and the Trojans\u2019 attack errors to throw USC\u2019s game off. Oregon was leading 8-6. Weske, who had 15 kills, jumped above the right side of the net to hit the ball onto Oregon\u2019s court in the middle of the fifth set, though it was initially ruled out of bounds. Keller challenged the officials\u2019 call for the third time and was successful. USC was still down by a point 10-9. When Oregon redshirt freshman middle blocker Colby Neal hit the ball, the ball bounced off of Williams\u2019 head and went close to the scoreboard. The impact of the ball made a few tears fall from Williams\u2019 eyes. Once the ball landed on their side, the Ducks continued to volley, but the officials whistled to stop the play. They called it a dead ball because the ball skyrocketed near the scoreboard, putting Oregon ahead 13-11. Since there wasn\u2019t a camera angle that showed whether the ball hit the scoreboard, Keller was left with his hands tied. \u201cThere was no way of challenging this, and there was nothing I could do about it,\u201d Keller said.\n\nThe intense crowd rose to their feet when a kill by Colyer touched a USC defender\u2019s arm. Weske returned the favor and made her quick kill touch Oregon\u2019s back row. But Oregon\u2019s last kill hit the corner of USC\u2019s court, to give the Ducks a 15-12 victory in the fifth set and win the match.\n\nKeller reflected on USC\u2019s execution and what they need to do better to win against Washington on Wednesday evening. \u201cIt comes down to our mentality. We need to learn how to finish games off,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWe have two more shots to learn those lessons and hopefully get ready for the tournament.\u201d USC is on the road against Washington on Nov. 23 and plays a home match against UCLA on Friday, Nov. 25 to cap off the regular season.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nNovember 21, 2022 at 4:30 pm PST\n\nAfter a rocky start, the 3-1 Trojans are headed to The Bahamas for the annual Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. This tournament consistently brings in some of the nation\u2019s best teams to compete in a single-elimination tournament (with a consolation bracket) all while at the luxurious Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island in The Bahamas. With the Trojans dropping their first game of the season, some big wins this week would bolster their resume, so it\u2019s time to take a look at some of USC\u2019s possible opponents.\n\nBYU (Record: 3-1)\nThe Cougars are the Trojans\u2019 only guaranteed matchup as the pair faces off against one another in the first round of the tournament. BYU started the year with two close wins over Missouri State and Idaho State, while also dropping a close game to No. 17 San Diego State. The Cougars are led by sophomore forward Fousseyni Traore and junior guard Spencer Johnson, both averaging over 11 points per game. BYU is usually one of Gonzaga\u2019s few competitors in the West Coast Conference, so this game versus USC should be a good challenge.\n\nKansas (Record: 4-0)\nThe reigning national champs enter Battle 4 Atlantis as the clear favorite. The Jayhawks have looked strong but also shaky at other times. Last Tuesday, they knocked off No. 8 Duke and then on Friday proceeded to barely escape against Southern Utah. Nonetheless, Kansas is still elite. Redshirt junior forward Jalen Wilson is averaging a whopping 24.5 points per game and is the clear leader of this team after the Jayhawks lost three of their four highest scorers from last year. The Jayhawks replaced their stars with even more firepower, bringing in talented freshman guard Gradey Dick and Texas Tech transfer, redshirt senior guard Kevin McCullar Jr.\n\nTennessee (Record: 2-1)\nTennessee has already hit a slight bump in the road after falling to Colorado, however the Volunteers are still a very talented team and ranked No. 22 in the country. The Volunteers\u2019 last game was a blowout win versus Florida Gulf Coast who trumped the Trojans at home two weeks ago. Tennessee has a plethora of players who can score, including leading scorer senior guard Josiah-Jordan James, who is now averaging 13.7 points per game.\n\nNorth Carolina State (Record: 4-0)\nNC State comes into this tournament as a huge dark horse. They are led by guards graduate Jarkel Joiner and sophomore Terquavion Smith who are both currently averaging double digits in points, with Joiner at 17 and Smith at 19. Smith was thought by many to be heading to the NBA draft last year, but opted to stay and is now one of few players on the Jerry West Award watch list for the nation\u2019s best shooting guard.\n\nWisconsin (Record: 3-0)\nThe Badgers lost their leading scorers from last season in Johnny Davis and Brad Davison, but so far this season has started off strong. Wisconsin has already picked up a solid win over Stanford, and the Badgers are clear contenders in the Big Ten. The Badgers have four players averaging double digits, but are led by senior forward Tyler Wahl and sophomore guard Chucky Hepburn, who is praised as the heir to Davis\u2019 throne.\n\nButler (Record: 3-1)\nButler dropped its second game of the year to Penn State but still could easily make a run in this tournament and later on in March Madness. The Bulldogs\u2019 entire starting five is averaging double digits, with their leading scorer being junior guard Chuck Harris who is averaging 15.8 points per game. Butler\u2019s biggest downfall is its depth; after the starting five, the next leading scorer is redshirt freshman guard Pierce Thomas who is averaging just 4.8 points per game. Still, this team is talented and the Bulldogs could be dangerous if underestimated.\n\nDayton (Record: 3-1)\nThe Flyers started off last week ranked No. 21 in the country, but dropped a bad one to a mediocre UNLV team. Dayton is led by sophomore forward DaRon Holmes II who leads the team in scoring and is second in rebounds with 13.3 points per game and six rebounds per game. The Flyers also have the sixth best rebounder in the nation with junior forward Toumani Camara, who averages 12.3 rebounds per game.\n\nAfter losing their first game of the year to Florida Gulf Coast, the Trojans will need to pick up some big wins in this tournament if they are to gain any traction in the rankings. Catch USC men\u2019s basketball taking on BYU at 2 p.m. on Wednesday on ESPN2.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP)\n\nBy Alexandra Donovan\nNovember 21, 2022 at 4:19 pm PST\n\nAs Thanksgiving break swiftly approaches, it is important to go in with the right headspace to make sure you are making choices that benefit your mental and physical health. The holiday season is a constant flow of celebrations and events surrounding food, which can lead to unhealthy extremes of binge eating and restriction. Oftentimes people, whether they are struggling with disordered eating or not, can slip into bad habits surrounding the holidays. Comments from family members and friends on what you\u2019re eating and how much of it, as well as changes in your body from last holiday season only make this worse.\n\nHere are some tips to get you through the holiday season:\n\n1. Stop Labeling Foods as Good and Bad\nWhen we label foods as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d we create a barrier of mental restriction that our subconscious picks up on. So, when we eat those \u201cbad\u201d foods we feel like we have to punish ourselves or restrict ourselves, which can create a toxic cycle between restricting and bingeing. Remember that holiday foods can be had all year long, so there is no need to \u201cstock up\u201d on them and eat as much as you can before they \u201cgo away.\u201d\n\n2. Stick to Your Normal Eating Routine\nIt is easy to skip breakfast or lunch on holidays when we eat at different times and in larger quantities, but try to stay on your normal routine. Drinking water and eating balanced meals throughout the day, instead of saving up calories for the holiday meal, will prevent that binge-like meal. You will feel less out of control with food, and it will be easier on your body to digest, leaving you feeling better overall.\n\n3. Don\u2019t Let Others Comment on Your Weight or Food Choices\nI know it\u2019s easier than it sounds, but feeding into others comments about your body and eating habits only makes it easier to fall into a toxic relationship with food. There are easy ways to shut down food commenters without making it awkward. For example, if someone is commenting on your weight or how much food you are eating you could say:\n\u201cThank you for your concern, but I actually know my body really well and this works for me.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t live a full life on an empty stomach!\u201d\n\u201cYup! I gained a lot of memories and experiences with friends trying food this semester.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m really enjoying this pie right now! You should try some too!\u201d\n\n4. Remember to Stay Present\nAlthough there are a lot of great foods to enjoy during the holidays, try to stay present. This is a chance for a lot of us to see family and friends we haven\u2019t seen in a while. Focusing less on food will help you enjoy their presence and the activities you do together. Seeing family and friends can also be stress inducing for some people, so instead of turning to food try to genuinely feel your feelings. This could include taking space from others, going on a walk or run to clear your head, or journaling\u2014 do what works for you!\n\nIf you are struggling with healthy eating habits, you can find more help here:\nNATIONAL EATING DISORDER ASSOCIATION HELPLINE (800) 931-2237\nNEDA TREATMENT PROVIDERS https://map.nationaleatingdisorders.org/\n```"}

Not only do they bring a nice and comforting aroma into a plain old room, but they also give us a hygge lifestyle type of vibe. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 when we explore the candle market, we always see the same old scents such as cinnamon, pumpkin spice, vanilla, and lavender. Sure these scents are classic but we need to spice things up a little! Where are the other amazing scents like horchata, cafecitos, and churros?\n\nMarcella Gomez, the business owner of Oh Comadre! Candles loves candles so much, she decided to go the extra mile when she created her candle business. Six years ago, right before the birth of Oh Comadre! Candles, Gomez noticed the little to no Latinx-inspired candle scents on the market. \u201cOne of the reasons [why] I started Oh Comadre! Candles [was] because I realized there [were] no Latino flavors out there in candles.\u201d\n\nAs Gomez created her candle business, she experienced many obstacles along the way. With a background in nursing, she felt as if she did not carry the right knowledge when starting her business. \u201cI can do CPR on you, I can help you with your wounds and heal you. But oh boy, this is such a different thing from nursing. And I wish I had more of a business background. Today [I am learning] how to delegate responsibility. That\u2019s difficult because you want to do everything,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nGomez also describes that the intensity of working on a small business feels like working on a major college-level assignment. \u201cJust imagine you\u2019re always studying for a final piece. That\u2019s what a small business is like.\u201d\n\nThe stress of managing a business as an owner is worth it to Gomez. When asked about her greatest achievement, Gomez readily mentioned building a community of comadres that support not only her business but also care for her well-being. \u201cI built a community on social media, and you\u2019re probably thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019 Well, when I was diagnosed with cancer [in] 2020 during the pandemic, as isolated as I was in my home, I had a community of comadres, messaging me, sending me flowers, sending me cards and sending prayers. And that is awesome. This support from [these] so-called strangers, helped me get through such a rough time. And that\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m very grateful for \u2013 the support of the comadre community.\u201d\n\nThe comadre community expresses their loyal support for Gomez and her products. Daniela Rodriguez, the owner of Social Cat and a loyal customer of Oh Comadre! Candles, admires how the candles bring her immense joy. \u201cShe has candles that remind me of my grandma\u2019s cooking on the holidays, just warm and fuzzy feels or when I\u2019m in need of fruity scents. She has candles for every occasion,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nGomez is also a cancer survivor. While diagnosed, she emphasized how it put her life into perspective to the point where she wants her comadre community to take care of themselves. \u201cI tried to remind the community to check themselves. It\u2019s because my cancer was found very early, and I\u2019m in remission, and I\u2019m very lucky. I know as a mother and as a woman, we put everybody\u2019s [needs] first and we always tend to leave ourselves last, so I try to push that we check ourselves.\u201d\n\nGomez posing with her \u201c\u00a1Viva la Vida!\u201d candle (Photo Courtesy of Marcella Gomez)\n\nToday, Gomez\u2019s candle business continues to thrive. With over 70,000+ followers on Instagram, both an online and a brick-and-mortar store, and the many uniquely scented candles that are handmade with love, Gomez wants to let her customers know that as long as her candle brings a smile to your face, her mission as a business owner is accomplished.\n\nGlossary:\n*Comadre: In this context, it is defined as a friend, companion, or close associate.\n*Hygge: The feeling of coziness and being surrounded by what makes life feel good i.e. warmth, friendship, etc.\n```"}

Reader discretion is advised.\n\nHollywood has taken an interest in notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. This September, Netflix released an original series titled \u201cDahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\u201d starring Evan Peters as Jeffrey Dahmer. The series shows a terrifying walkthrough of how Dahmer killed and ate many of his victims. Though the stories of many victims have been brought to light, a handful of the other victim\u2019s stories have been ignored.\n\nOne of the victims rarely talked about includes Richard Guerrero \u2013 Dahmer\u2019s only Hispanic victim. Guerrero\u2019s story has been in the dark for decades, but here is Guerrero\u2019s story and how it came to a tragic end:\n\nRichard Guerrero was born in 1967 and is of Mexican descent. Not much was disclosed about his childhood, or where he grew up. On March 24, 1988, at just 21 years old, Guerrero had been reported missing. According to police reports, Guerrero had $3 in his pocket and carried no proof of identification when he was last seen leaving his family\u2019s home in Madison, Wisconsin to go to a friend\u2019s house an hour away in Milwaukee. He never arrived at the friend\u2019s home nor returned to his own.\n\nAuthorities believe that Guerrero met serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer sometime that evening at a bar in Milwaukee and went with Dahmer back to his home in West Allis, Wisconsin. It is believed that Dahmer lured Guerrero to his house similar to his past victims, by offering them payment in exchange for a photoshoot. Guerrero might have consented to appear for Dahmer\u2019s photos that night to earn some additional cash. Dahmer then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and then strangled him with a leather strap. After the strangulation, Dahmer had intercourse with the dead corpse prior to dismembering it.\n\nAfter Guerrero has been declared missing, his sister, Janie Hagan, already had a feeling that something was off about her brother\u2019s disappearance. \u201cIf he had wanted to leave, he would have at least called my mother and let her know that everything was fine, instead of leaving us in the dark, with my mother praying to God every day to send her son home,\u201d Hagen told the Sentinel Journal, a local Milwaukee newspaper years after his disappearance.\n\nThe family hired a private investigator to look into Guerrero\u2019s case since Hagen felt, at the time, that the police were not taking her brother\u2019s case seriously, likely due to their ethnicity. Richard\u2019s father, who worked at a golf course, lost a large portion of his life savings since the private investigators scammed the family and ran away with their money.\n\nGuerrero\u2019s remains were never found but his death was confessed by Dahmer himself during interrogations in 1991. Hagen addressed her brother\u2019s murderer in Spanish at Dahmer\u2019s trial in 1992, during which numerous families of the victims testified. Hagen called Dahmer \u201cdiablo, el puro diablo\u201d (the devil, the pure devil).\n\nTwenty years after the trial, in 2012, Hagen continues to feel the burden of losing her brother right in the public eye. She spoke to her local FOX affiliate about the loss of her brother. \u201cHe was only 21. I have a son that\u2019s 21 now. I can only imagine what my mother went through. That was her child. That was her baby,\u201d Hagen said. The memories remain to haunt Hagen to the point of tears. \u201cMy mind is like a VCR - it just pauses and it rewinds and it always takes me back to that courtroom.\u201d\n```"}

Trends inspire how we pass time, locate our next meal, and inform what we consider beautiful. The impact of trends on a deeper level, including how we understand current events, groups of people and our self-image are more often than not nuanced and/or overlooked.\n\nSlicked-back hair, hoops and neutral makeup are a part of what TikTok creators have coined as the \u201cclean girl look.\u201d The idea of looking put together and feminine by being polished brings up issues of its own in how it impacts the perception extended to women of colors\u2019 natural features, including hair, skin and fashion as cultural signifiers. The trend tends to be defined by a near constant forward-facing representation of white women with straight hair and western, European features.\n\nFor women of color, especially in Latinx and Black communities, this style of hair and jewelry has been worn for decades, long before mainstream media and white creators decided to enculturate the look. I had the opportunity to speak with Chandra Delano, who carries many titles. Delano is a Spanish and Portuguese TikTok creator/influencer with 52.9k followers and a second-year psychology student at USC.\n\nDelano shared her perspective and experience with TikTok trends and Hispanic culture. In our discussion, I asked Delano to describe how she believes these trends impact Hispanic communities and women of color.\n\n\u201cThe recent but also historical ties of the \u2018clean girl\u2019 aesthetic and trend are very harmful to marginalized women and to women of color in general. A recent trend within this niche was the \u2018inventing\u2019 and capitalizing off a drink called \u2018spa water\u2019 by a white creator. However this \u2018new anti-inflammatory drink full of benefits\u2019 has been around for years. This drink is called agua frescas and has existed in Latin American culture, most commonly and originally from Mexico for over a century.\n\nAt the same time as this \u2018spa water\u2019 controversy, \u2018cowboy caviar\u2019 was also \u2018created\u2019 which is a variation of ceviche or salsas. This is harmful because it perpetuates the white-supremacist and colonizer mentalities which are very prevalent in social media, by taking ethnic dishes, renaming them, and taking credit for their creation,\u201d Delano said.\n\nDelano also noted the response from Hispanic creators, \u201cHispanic and Latinx creators started calling out these creators and educating them about how this was a form of cultural appropriation.\u201d Delano described the counterarguments from non-Hispanic and Latinx creators as a tactic to ignore \u201cthe blatant colonization of these items through these \u2018clean girl\u2019 trends.\u201d\n\nThis reality of social media being a space where rightful credit is not prioritized came up in our conversation in the context of dance as well. Delano pointed out the experiences of Black creators on TikTok, \u201cTo further illustrate how women of color are affected and damaged by trends such as these, let\u2019s take a look at the most famous creator on the Tik Tok platform with 147 million followers, Charlie D\u2019Amelio. She grew this platform by following TikTok dance trends, most famously for the \u2018renegade\u2019 dance created by Jalaiah Harmon, a Black woman. This dance along with many others created by Black dancers were used (without credit) by white creators to gain millions of likes, followers and curated cash.\u201d\n\nDelano said. Social media trends not only impact who we credit but also what is accepted and normalized within societal standards and superstructures. While examining the racial implications of the clean girl aesthetic only becoming popular once white women claimed the styles, Delano highlighted the exclusion based on socioeconomic status/class formations as well.\n\nAlthough the clean girl aesthetic is supposed to be \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201csimple,\u201d the tutorials usually involve pricy makeup, hair and clothing products. Delano illustrates how this makes the look even more unattainable to lower-income women saying \u201cIt perpetuates that you need to spend excessive amounts of money on beauty products to be beautiful. This affects the self-esteem and self-worth of women, especially those who do not have the financial means to buy these expensive products.\u201d\n\nMy experience when slick buns and hoops weren\u2019t fashionable\n\nThe pressures that come from these trends, particularly on women of color, are felt from childhood to adulthood. I remember first seeing this trend circulating and being brought back to my memories of growing up in a predominantly white community and how my experience was very different from that of the 7-second Tiktoks.\n\nI would sit patiently at the feet of my mother, grandmother, or older sister as they carefully tied my hair into a tight bun. From the age of two my ears were pierced and always decorated with gold earrings passed down from my grandmother who carried them from her homeland of Ecuador.\n\nAs an Indigenous, Ecuadorian mixed child living in a predominantly white town, the way I did my hair, dressed and existed was a different reality than what has become a trend for the masses to enjoy. Instead of proudly wearing my hair in the tight buns and hairstyles that are now celebrated and taught, I would feel unsure about how my hair wasn\u2019t sleek and straight like my classmates.\n\nI would worry that the hoops I wore would be a focus of girls who hadn\u2019t gotten their ears pierced yet. I was acutely aware of my differences and the commentary that would accompany them; this was not and is not a trend for me but who I was and who I still am.\n\nAs I grew up I understood the pressures I was under as someone who did not fit the Western beauty standards plastered all over my lived reality. I realized that the beauty reflected in my hair, my jewelry and my culture was rooted in my family traditions and history.\n\nI learned how to put my hair up the way my mother did; proudly, I represented the many women who came before me. This is my childhood and my life; my traditions and memories are not just a trend.\n\nThe issue is not that others are learning to do the same things we grew up doing but that the credit has been completely lost and erased. It takes practices that are personal and important to us and presents them in a way that makes them popular and celebrated because of their newfound proximity to whiteness.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to give credit where credit is due, meaning social media as a whole and creators especially, should find ways to celebrate, honor and have real conversations surrounding the impact people of color have had on so many aspects of what becomes popular in the mainstream from music to fashion and beyond.\n\nIt is more than just an aesthetic or trend, it is the experiences and histories of women across cultures who are too often diminished when the beauty comes from within the complexity and traditions we have created for generations.\n```"}

(Photo by Cooper Brown)\n\nBy Drake Lee November 20, 2022 at 10:43 pm PST\n\n\u201cUnderdog\u201d is not a word one usually uses to describe a team led by a 15-time NCAA champion coach. And yet, the Trojans embodied that word over the weekend, becoming the lowest tournament seed ever to win the MPSF Championship and stamping their ticket to the NCAA Tournament. Playing Austin College, UCLA and Stanford, the Trojans never trailed for the entire weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of our team,\u201d head coach Marko Pintaric said. \u201cOur guys improved every single game, and it\u2019s a pleasure to coach and watch this team.\u201d\n\nPintaric\u2019s squad remained undefeated at home for the entire season, going 7-0 at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of our guys,\u201d redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt said. \u201cOur team going undefeated at home is such a special moment.\u201d\n\nIn the first game, 13 different Trojans contributed to a season-high 30 goals in a 30-3 victory against the Austin \u2018Roos. Junior 2-meters Max Miller and Tony Nardelli each scored a career-high six goals.\n\n\u201cThis game, they pressed us more, gave us more opportunities to put away our shots, and we adapted to that,\u201d Nardelli said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t have scored without my teammates. I mean, I was just playing water polo.\u201d\n\nJunior driver Tom McGuire added a career-high four goals while also notching three assists. Overall, the Trojans swiped the ball 37 times from the \u2018Roos, a season-high for the Trojans.\n\nOn the defensive side, graduate goalie Kyle McKenney allowed just one goal in a quarter before passing off the cage to redshirt sophomore goalie Blake Jackson. Jackson blocked four \u2018Roo strikes and allowed just two goals for the remainder of the game.\n\nFrom the first sprint, the Trojans were in control. Redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen tipped the ball to sophomore driver Jake Carter for USC\u2019s first goal. After a \u2018Roo turnover, Ehrhardt received a pass from Molthen and smashed another goal. Ehrhardt struck again, scoring in a one-on-one matchup with \u2018Roo senior goalie Zachary Griffith.\n\nWith that goal, Ehrhardt moved to seventh all-time on the USC scoring list with 168 career goals. After Ehrhardt\u2019s back-to-back strikes, the Trojans never let up for the rest of the game.\n\nUSC advanced to play UCLA. In a 12-11 victory, the Trojans claimed their first win against the Bruins this season after dropping the previous three matches. Ehrhardt and junior driver Carson Kranz each recorded three goals with Nardelli contributing two more.\n\n\u201cTo come back from what happened last weekend says a lot about this team,\u201d Ehrhardt said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just myself; my whole team has been putting me in position to score goals, and I\u2019m just trying to capitalize on those opportunities.\u201d\n\nSteals were once again crucial for the Trojans\u2019 victory. USC swiped the ball 12 times from its crosstown rivals with senior driver Marcus Longton leading all players with three grabs.\n\nWith 1:09 left to go in the third quarter, Ehrhardt lured three defenders, including Bruin senior goalie Bernardo Maurizi, on him. Ehrhardt then threw the ball into a vacant goal to put the Trojans up 11-6.\n\nAfter back-to-back strikes by the Bruins, graduate driver Massimo Di Martire heaved the ball to Nardelli. The junior from Mountain View tipped the pass off his hand and into the goal to give the Trojans a 12-8 advantage with 5:35 to go in the fourth quarter.\n\nBruin senior attacker Tommy Gruwell and graduate attacker Jake Cavano both answered to bring the game to within two. With under a minute left, Gruwell\u2019s final attempt hit the goal post. Cavano\u2019s strike with six seconds to go found the net, but the Trojans played keep-away for the closing moments to claim victory.\n\nUSC\u2019s final game was a 14-10 victory over Stanford. Di Martire and Ehrhardt both recorded four goals with Longton tacking on two more.\n\n\u201cI just stepped into opportunities that I saw coming my way,\u201d Ehrhardt said. \u201cIn games like this, you want to let the game open up for you. You don\u2019t want to force anything, and that\u2019s just what I did today.\u201d\n\nIn the cage, McKenney played all four quarters and racked up nine blocks.\n\n\u201cFrom the first game to the last one, our defense has come a long way,\u201d McKenney said. \u201cI really think it\u2019s a mindset that the guys bought into, and they\u2019ve done a great job protecting our goal.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans held a narrow lead until Miller drew an exclusion with 3:02 to go in the fourth quarter. After a Trojan timeout, Ehrhardt tossed the ball to Di Martire who fired a bullet past the outnumbered Cardinal to put the Trojans up 12-9.\n\nThe deficit forced the Cardinal to empty their goal and play with a seven-man offense. Even with numbers, Cardinal junior 2-meter Ike Love failed to force his way through the Trojan defense, coughing the ball up to freshman utility Andrej Grgurevic and putting an end to Stanford\u2019s strategy.\n\nThe Trojans will play either Fordham or Princeton in Berkeley on Dec. 1 in the NCAA quarterfinals. It will be the 18th straight tournament appearance for USC.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that 18 straight would put a lot of pressure on us,\u201d McKenney said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. I think this team has nothing to lose, and we\u2019re playing as one unit right now.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Newsroom)\n\nBy Adam Jasper\nNovember 20, 2022 at 1:54 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming. Tomorrow is the day the United States plays in the World Cup again. Let that one breathe. We\u2019ve been waiting for the return since the heartbreaking loss against Belgium in 2014, since the soul-crushing Trinidad implosion and failure to qualify in 2017, since the U.S. finally qualified again in March after a grueling qualifying campaign. It\u2019s finally here. Not a moment too soon.\n\nThe last time the United States played in the World Cup, I was a mere middle schooler carrying around my aggressively neon red backpack. During the Belgium game, I was forced to go to swimming lessons despite already knowing how to swim, a decision which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forgive my parents for (Mom, if you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m kidding). Since that fateful loss in 2014, so much about myself, about this national team, about this country has changed since then. Can you tell I\u2019m feeling existential ahead of this next game?\n\nSo far in this column, I\u2019ve dished out my roster picks, I\u2019ve given my game-by-game predictions for the group stage and I\u2019ve even mulled over manager Gregg Berhalter\u2019s status as the tactical leader of the team. But now, all of my analysis is set aflame. None of it matters anymore. We\u2019re officially in World Cup mode, and anything can happen.\n\nThis is going to be a World Cup like no other. There are countless concerns about host-country Qatar and its, to put it very lightly, suboptimal views on certain marginalized groups. Injuries are abundant due to the tournament being held in the winter. There will be a lot of distractions and hurdles for the players. There will be a lot of drama. Every second will be must-watch television.\n\nMake no mistake, my brain is screaming, \u201cAdam! Don\u2019t let yourself buy into this U.S. team!\u201d If you\u2019ve read any of my previous columns, you know just how little faith I had in this team based on its most recent performances. Key word: had. It\u2019s time to let go of the pessimism that\u2019s become so second nature to us as fans of this team. It\u2019s time to support each and every player and coach as representatives of our nation. It\u2019s the least we can do to support them.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from watching this USMNT, it\u2019s that you can never count them out when the lights are brightest. They survived the \u201cgroup of death\u201d in 2014 and nearly made the quarterfinals. Today\u2019s talent pool is the Golden Generation of American soccer. The pieces are absolutely there.\n\nGetting out of the group won\u2019t be easy by any means. The U.S. is faced with a make-or-break matchup against Wales in their first game. A loss would likely mean it can\u2019t afford to lose to England or Iran. The energy early will set the tone for the rest of the tournament.\n\nOne thing for certain, the energy here in the States will be unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen as soccer fans in this country. Soccer is gaining momentum and popularity by the day. I expect more people to watch the games than ever before. This competition couldn\u2019t come at a better time for viewership. Most will be home for Thanksgiving, including myself, and the highly-anticipated England game will be on Black Friday. It simply doesn\u2019t get more electric than this.\n\nGoing home to watch the first two games with my two younger brothers will be special for me. We\u2019ve bonded together over this soccer team for as long as we can remember. We\u2019ve gone from crying on the floor of the living room to running around the house in ecstasy. It wouldn\u2019t be the same watching without them.\n\nIt is truly a gift to be able to appreciate the beautiful game on the biggest stage, and it makes it all the more special to have our nation in the mix. Let\u2019s appreciate this monumental moment in U.S. sporting history. Don\u2019t take it for granted. I can\u2019t help but be emboldened with an immense sense of pride and optimism. Although I know I\u2019m just setting myself to be disappointed, I\u2019m living blissfully in ignorance. Better, it will be, to recklessly believe than to have never believed at all.\n```"}

Thanks to the Trojan Knights, that\u2019s never going to happen. Whether in the sweltering heat or the biting cold\u2014during a bustling class-ridden day or the middle of the night\u2014the Trojan Knights can be found listening to music, doing school work and most importantly, keeping an eye out for the enemy.\n\nGuardians of tradition, protectors of the Troy spirit and defenders of cardinal and gold, the student organization annually gathers the week of the highly anticipated UCLA-USC football game. The Knights spend seven days camping out next to a wrapped Tommy Trojan to protect the sacred monument from threatening UCLA egg-throwers, water-balloon bandits and whatever outlandish source of vandalism our rivals can get their hands on.\n\nYou might be wondering how the Trojan Knights are able to survive the tumultuous stretch of time spent guarding the statue. To find out, we interviewed members to tell us about what spending a week outside is like.\n\n\u201cThe first two or three days is just figuring out how to stay in the cold \u2013 no one has sleeping bags, no cots, everyone just has sweaters,\u201d Ruben Nunez, a junior majoring in math and economics, said. \u201cYou get sick after, like, four or five days.\u201d\n\nLast year, Nunez stayed every night for the entire week, explaining that his love for the Trojan Knights is ultimately what got him through it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this since the forties...and when you\u2019re upright here at 2 or 3 a.m., you feel this strange connection to the past,\u201d Nunez said.\n\nIn desperate times, energy drinks, catered food and the bathrooms at Bovard come to the rescue of the knight-watchers. Their efforts are paying off, and the proof is in the unmarred Tommy Trojan.\n\n\u201cWe had people come last year and try some funny business, but thankfully through our persuasive powers and the number of people who camp out here from day to day, it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Will Chambers, a senior studying philosophy, politics and law, said. \u201cNormally just the sight of this encampment is enough to drive [people] away.\u201d\n\nBut is the rivalry all bark and no bite? Chambers, who has guarded Tommy Trojan for 15 nights since joining the student organization, hinted at past battles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d ask you to go back and look at records of pumpkins and paint being thrown on the Bruin bear,\u201d Chambers said.\n\nBeyond guarding Tommy Trojan, the week is a time for members to connect with one another and take a break from academic stress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s honestly just kind of a moment to be fun,\u201d Hudi Potash, a junior studying political science, said. \u201cI feel like this is really just a week where you\u2019re meant to enjoy your time.\u201d\n\nThe club, which was founded in 1921, celebrated their 100th year anniversary last year, allowing alumni and current students to connect with each other and see the tangible legacy the organization has left.\n\n\u201cSeeing people from the fifties, sixties come back and interact and be able to talk about the same traditions has just been really, really gratifying to me,\u201d Chambers said.\n\nThe Knights remain hopeful of USC\u2019s victory against the Bruins in the long awaited rivalry football game.\n```"}

Tuaniga\u2019s only ace of the game put the nail in the coffin, closing the third and last set of the game to give the Trojans a road win against Oregon State.\n\nFriday\u2019s evening game was entertaining, and it came down to mistakes and defense. Even though the Beavers had the same amount of kills as the Trojans (39), the USC squad had significant advantages in blocks (10 to 5) and attacking errors (27 to 9). This allowed the Trojans to win three straight sets by at least five points: 25-20, 25-19, 25-18.\n\nEarly in the opening frame, USC and Oregon State had an even fight, each team scoring points back and forth. As the set progressed, the Trojans started to press on and freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson put the USC squad six points ahead late in the set after spiking the ball and finding the floor to record her sixth kill of the evening.\n\nOregon State seemed to turn on the jets halfway through the evening. The Beavers obtained their biggest and only lead over the Trojans when they gained a three-point lead, 13-10, midway through the second set. But after multiple errors from the Oregon state squad, kills by senior outside hitter Skylar Fields and defensive efforts from the Trojans, USC came from behind. It gained a one-point lead late in the second set, 20-19, forcing the Beavers to call a timeout.\n\n\u201cThey called the time out; I saw that our team was good at taking away some of the things they wanted to do at that moment, which didn\u2019t make them predictable but allowed us to take more risks,\u201d USC head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cI love it when my team takes risks that way, and I think we capitalized on that.\u201d\n\nWhen the game resumed, graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams was up to serve. She proceeded to lead an impressive 5-0 run that allowed USC to take the second set.\n\nOregon State came in to what would be the last frame of the night with dedication. Up until late in the third set the Beavers managed to stay within a single point from the Trojans, but the trend continued. USC went on another late 5-0 run which crushed the home team\u2019s dreams of taking a set.\n```"}

The Trojan offense struggled in the first half but found a rhythm in the second, as senior guard Boogie Ellis led the way with 19 points. That second-half offensive push helped USC beat Mount St. Mary\u2019s 83-74 on Friday at Galen Center.\n\nBy starting four guards, USC tried to rely on the three-point shot. But that strategy wasn\u2019t successful, as it went 2-for-11 from three-point range in the first half. But the Trojans adapted and focused on inside scoring. Eighteen of their 32 points in the first half were scored in the paint. Redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan led the Trojans in first-half scoring, racking up nine points on 4-of-5 shooting. All four baskets were dunks, including back-to-back slams in the middle of the half. Morgan also scored on an alley-oop assisted by Ellis with 1:52 left in the half, breaking a near four-minute scoring drought for USC.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of inconsistency with everybody,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said in reference to the USC offense. USC gave itself good looks with second-chance opportunities, racking up eight offensive rebounds compared to the Mountaineers\u2019 three. But the Trojans only recorded six points off second chances. Overall, the Trojans had an ugly half offensively. They shot 11-for-29 from the field, compared to the Mountaineers\u2019 12-for-28. The half remained tight; it finished with the Trojans leading 32-28, and each team\u2019s largest lead being four points.\n\nEllis gave USC the spark it needed to improve its shooting from deep, going 3-for-5 in the second half. He finished the game shooting 5-for-12 from the field and 4-for-8 from three. He has now recorded over 1,000 collegiate points in his career. \u201cOne thousand points is a really great milestone, and it\u2019s nice to do that early into your senior year,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe has a long way to go here to try to lead us to be a team captain [and] be a leader the rest of the season.\u201d\n\nAs a team, the Trojans shot 15-for-27 from the field and 5-for-11 from 3-point range in the second half, recording 51 points. USC defended well, as Mount St. Mary\u2019s shot 13-for-40 from the field in the second half. No team has shot over 38% from the field against the Trojans this year. \u201cWe\u2019re defending. We\u2019re challenging shots,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cBut it\u2019s our offense that has affected our performance. And it is frustrating when you have so many open shots and none of them go in.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans drew 15 fouls in the second half and capitalized, going 16-for-20 from the charity stripe. Free throw shooting was a strength the entire game, as they went 24-for-32 . \u201cWe definitely tried to get to the foul line,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe attacked the basket. We put pressure on their defense. And then we made our free throws.\u201d\n\nMorgan continued his success in the second half. After the Mountaineers cut the deficit to two points at the beginning of the second half, Morgan gave the Trojans some momentum with a key layup. Through the next 10 minutes, the Trojans went on a 25-12 run and reached a 15-point lead. Morgan finished the game with 15 points on 6-for-8 shooting, 12 rebounds and five blocks. \u201cHe\u2019s always gonna block shots and rebound, and then it\u2019s our job to get him the ball,\u201d Ellis said about Morgan. \u201cWe want him to score and look to score because we need that inside presence in the paint.\n\nThe Trojans had great ball movement throughout the game, and fifth-year senior Drew Peterson led the team with 12 assists. \u201cWe keep trying to space the floor really well, and Boogie is always in the right spot and was able to knock down those shots, especially late-game,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nUSC now travels to the Bahamas for the Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament next week, opening with a matchup against a tougher BYU team on Wednesday at 2 p.m. The Trojans will hope to extend their three-game win streak to make a good impression on Collier and the rest of their 10th-ranked 2023 recruiting class.\n```"}

Then came the turnovers \u2014 four of them \u2014 the last of which ensured the Victory Bell will be receiving a new, cardinal coat of paint. No. 7 USC came from behind to top No. 16 UCLA 48-45 Saturday night at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Trailing by as many as 14 points, the Trojans found the end zone on four of their final five drives to take the Crosstown Showdown and a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of momentum swings, and you have to be able to ride the wave,\u201d USC head coach Lincoln Riley said after the game. \u201cHonestly, too many examples to list of that. Just both sides of the ball kind of battling back when we weren\u2019t at our best.\u201d After a scoreless first quarter that saw a failed fourth-down conversion, a missed field goal and an interception, the USC offense finally broke through on the ground in the second frame. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams got USC on the board with a 6-yard scamper less than four minutes into the second quarter. It was the Trojans\u2019 first successful trip inside the UCLA 30-yard line after coming up empty on their first two. Williams\u2019 backfield partner, senior running back Austin Jones, received the bulk of the carries stepping in for the injured Travis Dye, churning for a game-high 120 yards on 21 carries and two touchdowns. His first score came on an eight-yard dive with 1:42 to play in the first half, sparking a 24-point run by the Trojan offense only stained by a UCLA field goal. That run culminated with Jones\u2019 second touchdown, a two-yard plunge midway through the third quarter that put USC ahead by 10 points \u2014 the Trojans never trailed again. \u201cThere\u2019s not one person in that locker room surprised about the way he plays,\u201d Riley said of Jones. \u201cHe was huge ... He\u2019s another great example of the unselfishness of this team.\u201d Williams finished the night with 503 total yards and three touchdowns \u2014 two through the air and one on the ground. His first touchdown toss of the night didn\u2019t come until the 8:50 mark in the third quarter, a 35-yard connection with junior wide receiver Jordan Addison to put USC ahead 27-24 \u2014 its first lead of the night. In his second game back from injury, Addison racked up a game-high 178 receiving yards on 11 catches \u2014 more than double all other receivers on the night. \u201cAfter [Addison] scored I said, \u2018Welcome back. Glad to have you,\u2019\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guys that have stepped up in other big games ... It\u2019s awesome having these guys out here.\u201d On the other side, Thompson-Robinson finished the night with 309 passing yards \u2014 the only Bruin to eclipse the 300 mark against USC four times \u2014 to go along with 81 yards with his feet. UCLA\u2019s signal caller tallied six total touchdowns, matching his mark from a season ago, but it\u2019s his mistakes that will define his performance in the 2022 edition. Trailing for the first time all night, the UCLA offense managed just two yards before Thompson-Robinson coughed the ball up on a sack from senior defensive lineman Tyrone Taleni. Sophomore defensive back Latrell McCutchin corralled it at the UCLA 9-yard line, and the Trojans went ahead 34-24 two plays later on Jones\u2019 second touchdown of the night. That fumble was Thompson-Robinson\u2019s third giveaway of the night, and it gifted the Trojans with the lead they never relinquished. That fate was sealed with the redshirt senior\u2019s fourth turnover \u2014 an interception from sophomore edge Korey Foreman with 1:26 left to play. \u201cIt was really cool for him,\u201d Riley said of Foreman\u2019s interception. \u201cYou just never know when it\u2019s going to be your moment, and he was ready. He dropped back and made a great play on the ball.\u201d Foreman\u2019s takeaway sends USC back to the Pac-12 Championship Game for the second time in the last three seasons. The triumph at the Rose Bowl also clinches the Trojans\u2019 first 10-win season since 2016, a campaign that ended with a victory at the very same venue. With No. 5 Tennessee\u2019s loss to South Carolina earlier today, USC likely controls its own destiny to make its first-ever appearance in the College Football Playoff with two games left to play. The first of those last two hurdles will be the Trojans\u2019 regular season finale against No. 18 Notre Dame at the Coliseum Nov. 26.\n```"}

(Photo by Weiwei Huang)\n\nBy Weiwei Huang\nNovember 19, 2022 at 12:02 pm PST\n\nStrident posters opposing China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping have appeared around USC since late October. From lamp posts at the intersection of South Hoover and West Jefferson, to bulletin boards at the Law School, to the glass doors of the USC Bookstore, the posters are part of a larger political protest by students at universities around the world.\n\nThis movement grew out of an incident in China in which an unidentified man in Beijing hung two banners from Sitong Bridge in central Beijing on Oct. 13 to denounce China\u2019s \u201czero-Covid\u201d policy, which required lockdowns and mass testing to get one area down to zero infections. Towns and cities shut down overnight, many desperate people couldn\u2019t get food or access to hospitals and pleaded for help on social media, and a bus carrying people to quarantine crashed, killing 27 people.\n\nThe posters at USC were inspired by the original banners that had phrases like, \u201cElections Not Dictatorship; Citizens Not Slaves.\u201d They argue that the regime is authoritarian and call for democratic elections. They also demand the resignation of Xi, who was recently re-elected by the seven-member Central Committee of the Chinese Committee Party to a third five-year term.\n\nA video posted online shows the man who posted the original banners being detained by authorities moments later. Some journalists focusing on China believe that a Twitter account under the pseudonym \u201cPeng Zaizhou\u201d belongs to the man. The account was deactivated following his arrest.\n\nChina\u2019s online censors attempted to remove any digital trace of his act of public dissent, including discussion groups and social media accounts that spread word of his exploits. Young Chinese people living abroad still learned of this protest and spread the word by posting on social media sites that Chinese authorities cannot censor as well as putting up similar posters in other parts of the world, including here at USC.\n\nA poster at USC\u2019s Leavey Library in late October (Photo by Weiwei Huang)\n\nOne USC student who was born and raised in Beijing said in an interview that, \u201cWe can\u2019t let this hero bleed for nothing.\u201d The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of persecution, has for the past month been posting anti-Xi posters around campus. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my parents in China will be affected negatively,\u201d she said. \u201cI might even get detained.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo media is free from government interference, but I think the interference level in China is no longer acceptable.... Protesting in China is a very courageous and committed action.\u201d\n\nAnother Chinese-born Trojan who attended high school in the United States, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s more vital that we, the Chinese students studying abroad, do something because we live in a more liberal environment,\u201d she said. Explaining that she placed dozens of posters around campus on one recent night, she added, \u201cIf we don\u2019t speak out, should we just expect people in China to sacrifice themselves? We take a smaller risk, so we need to do more.\u201d\n\nPrior to agreeing to an interview, both Trojans said they largely remained quiet about their silent protest on campus, only telling their closest friends.\n\nHan Wang is a Chinese graduate student at USC who has been involved in anti-Chinese Communist Party activities for the past two years despite possible consequences back home. Wang spent several hours marching around campus one late-October afternoon with a large sign showing an obese and naked Xi Jinping along with the words: Emperor\u2019s new clothes.\n\nWang said that people smiled at him during his personal protest, and one Chinese girl even took a photo of him and told him it was cool. The response eased his fears of being attacked by extreme Chinese nationalists who are known as \u201cxiao fen hong\u201d or little pink.\n\nWang says that the poster movement on campus is not a coordinated protest; it is individuals each deciding to take action. \u201cI hope that in the future, the connections between protestors will strengthen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere were actually [a] few Chinese people who I have encountered that strongly support the Communist Party,\u201d Wang said. \u201cMost Chinese people prefer to remain silent because it is the safest action to take, even if they disagree with the government.\u201d\n\nPosters at West Jefferson Boulevard in late October (Photo by Weiwei Huang)\n\nWang said he hoped that political organizations would help to unite the disconnected protestors. But other students were leery of such an idea.\n\nOne USC student who wore a wig and a cap when putting up posters alone at night said, \u201cI\u2019ve been so careful because I don\u2019t want my parents living in China to get in trouble.\u201d The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that she isn\u2019t only concerned about Chinese Communist Party sympathizers. She noted that some organizations that oppose the Chinese government here are made up primarily of men. She said that there are times when she has felt uncomfortable due to misogyny among those group\u2019s male members.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem like a safe space for women,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Chinese student who attended high school in the U.S said that, like many of people with similar positions, she doesn\u2019t like the idea of collectivizing the protests, and she\u2019s afraid of being reported by tools of the Chinese government in the organization. She noted that a loved one in China expressed concern when she put up the anti-Xi posters at USC \u201cbecause she thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to return to China.\u201d\n\nAs for Wang, Chinese police have harassed his parents twice in recent years. He said that police went to their home and demanded that they sign a statement pledging to prevent their son from engaging in anti Communist Party activities again. That hasn\u2019t stopped him.\n\nSeveral people interviewed said that Instagram accounts like Northern Square and Citizens Daily CN, which publish photos of anti-Xi messages posted in public, are reassuring to them because they show that there are like-minded people in the world.\n\nThe student from Beijing tried to explain why making progress is so difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for the western world to understand... how it feels to fight under a regime like this.\u201d\n\nMost interviewees say that putting up posters isn\u2019t enough, but acknowledge that they don\u2019t see a clear solution to the problems they describe back home.\n\nWang said, \u201cWe need to speak up to form a foundation so that more people can have the courage to make a change.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Sarah Ko) \n\nBy Cl\u00e9mence-Maureen Feniou November 18, 2022 at  6:40 pm PST \n\nIt\u2019s time for the conquest of the Victory Bell in Los Angeles. Between No. 7 USC, on the path to the Pac-12 championship and the College Football Playoff, and No. 16 UCLA, out of the playoffs but still hoping for a spot in the Las Vegas final matchup, the game is highly anticipated. The 92nd Crosstown Showdown will be played in front of a sold-out crowd. With Caleb Williams, Jordan Addison and Tuli Tuipulotu on the Trojans\u2019 side and Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Zach Charbonnet on the Bruins\u2019 side, both offenses are expected to put on a high-scoring performance. But before Saturday, let\u2019s look back to the five best matchups between the Trojans and the Bruins throughout history.\n\n1. \u201cThe Game of the Century\u201d - 1967 : USC 21, UCLA 20\nIn front of a crowd of more than 90,000 people, this game is seen as the symbol of the rivalry between USC and UCLA. At the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the fourth-ranked Trojans stunned the No. 1 Bruins with an extremely close win. Bruins quarterback Gary Beban and Trojans running back O.J. Simpson, the best players in all of college football, were ready for a fight. The USC victory was largely due to Simpson\u2019s talent. With 10:38 left in the game, the Trojans were stuck at their own 36-yard line, facing a third-and-7. But Simpson made a miracle happen and ran a 64-yard touchdown in a run that\u2019s still considered one of the best in history and gave the Trojans the 21-20 win. USC went on to win the national title against the Indiana Hoosiers and Simpson won the Heisman Trophy the following season.\n\n2. Upset loss at the Rose Bowl - 2006: UCLA 13, USC 9\nWith a 6-5 record, UCLA was going up against the No. 2 team in the nation on the path to another national title under Pete Carroll. In what was supposed to be a victory for the Trojans, the game turned out to be a defensive battle with future NFL linebackers Brian Cushing, Clay Matthews and Rey Maualuga. In the last minutes of the game, linebacker Eric McNeal dove to intercept a pass from USC quarterback John David Booty and sealed the 13-9 win, blowing up the dreams of another championship for the Trojans.\n\n3. Offensive show - 1996: UCLA 48, USC 41\nThe \u201896 game had both sides firing on offense, with the Trojans leading by 17 points at the start of the fourth quarter. But the Bruins were not giving up the game easily. UCLA had a comeback fourth quarter, forcing the first ever overtime game in the crosstown rivalry. And if this wasn\u2019t enough, the Bruins led by quarterback Cade McNown and running back Skip Hicks won the game 48-41 after a double overtime. This game was also the first and last time that the game between the L.A. teams went to overtime.\n\n4. \u201cThe Measles game\u201d- 1988 : USC 31, UCLA 22\nBoth teams were performing extremely well, with the second-ranked Trojans at 9-0 and the fourth-ranked Bruins at 9-1. For both, the Rose Bowl was on the line. UCLA had been ranked No. 1 before its loss to Washington State. Led by Heisman trophy candidates quarterback Rodney Peete and Troy Aikman, the L.A. rivals played in the Rose Bowl in front of a record 100,000 fans. Unfortunately for the Trojans, quarterback Rodney Peete was struck with measles, transported to the hospital and missed practices for the whole week. No one thought he would play. But he did, leading USC to a 31-22 victory. In the last minutes of the fourth-quarter, Peete threw a pass to wide receiver Erik Affholter. While avoiding UCLA tacklers, he skillfully tiptoed along the line \u2014 even though UCLA fans argued he was out of bounds \u2014 he then sprinted to the end zone and the USC crowd went wild.\n\n5. Pete Carroll\u2019s arrival - 2001 : USC 27, UCLA 0\nAt the start of the 21st century, USC made one of the best coach recruitment decisions in the history of the program. The Trojans hired Pete Carroll, who stayed at USC for nine years. When he faced the Bruins for the first time, his intentions were clear. Let them know which team ran the city of angels. USC displayed its infamous football that became known as the Carroll era and the Trojans humiliated the Bruins 27-0 in the Coliseum. That win started a decade of USC dominance over its rival, allowing the Trojans to win every battle of L.A. except for one season during that time frame. This year, USC is having its best season since the Carroll era with head coach Lincoln Riley. The Trojans are looking to start another decade of wins over the Bruins.\n```"}

USG, Trojan Pride and the USC Concerts Committee attracted a large audience for the highly anticipated event with a Ferris wheel, fireworks, DJs and, of course, the Trojan Marching Band. Students played arcade games, ate from food trucks and rode the highly anticipated Ferris wheel.\n\nEach year, Conquest is open to all members of the USC community, giving them a chance to celebrate with a concert and performances to amp up school spirit before the football game. Opening with a pep rally, USC\u2019s athletic teams and the Trojan Marching Band charged up the crowd with game-day spirit for the battle Saturday.\n\nOne notable performance was from the USC Cheer competition team. Sabina Godes, a member of the cheer team, said the energy of the crowd was palpable. \u201cAfter our routine and even during it, hearing the crowd cheer when we were doing a cool flip or stunts...[was] a rewarding feeling because we work really hard to perform,\u201d Godes said.\n\nConquest also featured special guests such as the men\u2019s basketball team, women\u2019s soccer and other prominent members of the athletic community. \u201cI think [Conquest] is a good way to get the school involved and ready for the game day and rivalry,\u201d Godes shared. \u201cI think the crowd that was there was super enthusiastic. It was fun to perform for them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to tumbling tricks from the cheer squad, other student dance groups like the Trojan Dance Force, Breakthrough Hip Hop, the Song Girls and the Cardinal Divas performed to hype up the crowd and show their school pride. In addition, a wide variety of student-run music organizations such as acapella clubs, Troy Tones and the Asli Baat Acapella group performed. The CreSCendo Music Club, the only Mandarin-speaking music club at USC, also participated.\n\n\u201cThe crowd at Conquest was electric,\u201d Legion leader Ben Polaski said. The Legion is the USC student section that aims to create an energetic environment and build a spirited community at athletic events. \u201cA lot of students showed up and shared their support for USC athletics and were really building culture.\u201d\n\nFor the main event, DJ_Dave, Maddy Davis and headliner Mura Masa performed for the crowd. Assistant director of the Concerts Committee Riley Wheaton said that \u201cas a COVID freshman, not getting the whole rundown of our traditions, I think that [Conquest] is a really easy tradition for everyone to participate [in] that\u2019s genuinely right in their backyard,\u201d Wheaton said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a really awesome opportunity, free of cost.\u201d\n\nThe rivalry game will take place Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.

Students and faculty are encouraged to show their Trojan spirit and drop off their old blue clothing (or really any clothing they want to give up for donation) at one of six drop-off locations around campus.\n\n\u201cWe want to get rid of all of our blue clothes because we are Trojans, and we want to represent the cardinal red and gold colors,\u201d Trojan Pride committee assistant director Dani Zand said. \u201c[W]hile that is the theme, we are accepting all kinds of clothing to support the homeless shelters.\u201d\n\nMembers of the USC community can look out for green drop-off bins positioned around campus with the One World logo through November 20. At the heart of this drive is a call to action for the USC community to provide aid for the surrounding area. Community, Zand noted, was top of mind during this project\u2019s creation process.\n\n\u201cUSC is a school with ample resources...But it\u2019s very clear that the area that we\u2019re in doesn\u2019t have a lot of the resources we do,\u201d Zand said. \u201cSo because we are obviously sharing this land with them, it is our duty as people with resources to be able to give back to the community that we\u2019re a part of.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cBleed Out the Blue\u201d is in its inaugural year, this isn\u2019t the first time One World Clothing has worked closely with USC. Previously, the donation center partnered with USC housing to provide pop-up donation boxes for the USC community in May 2022 during move-out week. With prior success from last school year, the Trojan Pride Committee decided to work with the organization again, this time during rivalry week.\n\n\u201cWe reached out to [One World] and they were very excited about setting up on USC\u2019s campus again,\u201d said Logan Barth, co-executive director of Trojan Pride. One World Clothing is a Southern California-based organization focused on keeping textiles, such as shoes and clothes, out of the landfill and back into the community. The organization partners with schools, churches and other groups to provide a safe and convenient way to give your shoes and clothing a second life.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to find a clothing place that wasn\u2019t going to thrift these clothes back into the public,\u201d Zand said. \u201cWe wanted to have a place where we would be able to directly donate clothes to a place that would directly give it to people, to those in need, free of charge.\u201d\n\nThe Trojan Pride Committee hopes the \u201cBleed out the Blue\u201d clothing drive can become a new tradition and staple of rivalry week. \u201cThere are lots of traditions here at USC, and \u2018Bleed Out the Blue\u2019 is definitely one that we\u2019ll be doing every year in the future just so we can continue incorporating that charity element in our traditions,\u201d Barth said.\n\nIf you have any spare blue clothing, or just some clothes you want to give a second life, look for one of the six donation boxes located around campus at the following locations: New North (McCarthy Side), Pardee Tower, Parkside IRC, Cardinal Gardens (Front Entrance), McCarthy Honors and Cowlings and Ilium.\n```"}

(Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore\nNovember 18, 2022 at 4:39 pm PST\n\nLast season, UCLA beat USC 62-33 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and dropped the Trojans\u2019 record to 4-6. Fast forward to a little less than a year later and the Trojans are in a completely different position heading into this year\u2019s matchup with the Bruins. USC enters Saturday\u2019s contest with a 9-1 record, with one of the brightest offensive minds in college football in head coach Lincoln Riley and a Heisman Trophy candidate in sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nUp to this point, the Trojans have had one of the most explosive offenses in the country as USC currently leads the Pac-12 in points per game with 42.4. Williams has thrown for 3,010 yards, 31 touchdown passes and has ran for another six touchdowns. The statistic that jumps out, however, is that Williams has committed only two turnovers the whole season.\n\nA big theme for USC over the last few weeks has been overcoming injuries on both sides of the ball. Junior wide receiver Jordan Addison made his return to the lineup last week against Colorado, and Riley announced Thursday he expects sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams and sophomore inside linebacker Eric Gentry to play Saturday. However, USC will have to figure out how it will overcome the loss of redshirt senior running back Travis Dye, who suffered a season-ending leg injury in Friday\u2019s victory over Colorado.\n\nDye has been a critical component to USC\u2019s rushing attack this year as he had 884 yards rushing and nine touchdowns. The Trojans will rely on the trio of senior Austin Jones, freshman Raleek Brown and redshirt junior Darwin Barlow to fill the void at the running back position against UCLA. Jones is coming off accumulating 74 rushing yards, 39 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown against Colorado. On the season, Jones has 335 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. Brown is coming off 90 total yards and one receiving touchdown against Colorado. Barlow, who has not seen much action due to USC\u2019s running back depth, is coming off his most productive game of the season with 41 rushing yards against the Buffaloes.\n\nThe Bruins have had one of the better rush defenses in the Pac-12 this season, giving up 124.4 rush yards per game, which is good for fifth in the conference. However, the Bruins are currently giving up the fourth most passing yards per game in the conference, so fans could be in for a very pass heavy offensive attack by USC on Saturday.\n\nThe return of Mario Williams will be a welcome sight for the Trojans as he and Caleb Williams have chemistry going back to last season when both played at Oklahoma. Mario Williams enters Saturday\u2019s game with 493 receiving yards and four touchdowns on the season.\n\nThe expectation is that USC\u2019s offense should play like it has all season, however, USC\u2019s defense faces a tough task ahead against redshirt senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson and UCLA\u2019s offense. USC\u2019s defense is coming off a solid performance against Colorado as the Buffalos only scored 17 points, but that was to be expected against the worst team in the Pac-12.\n\nThe USC defense will face a UCLA offense averaging 39.5 points per game, third in the Pac-12, and a dual-threat quarterback in Thompson-Robinson who has thrown for 20 touchdowns and rushed for seven touchdowns this season. The return of Gentry should give the USC defense a big boost against the Bruins on Saturday. Gentry is third on the team in total tackles and also has one sack, two pass breakups, one interception and a forced fumble on the season.\n\nAt a press conference Monday, Thompson-Robinson said he wants to score 60 points against the Trojans and, although the statement is bold, the Bruins certainly have an offense capable of putting up big numbers against a subpar USC defense.\n\nKickoff for Saturday\u2019s Crosstown Showdown is set for 5 p.m. at the Rose Bowl as USC looks to reclaim the title of best football team in Los Angeles.\n```"}

If you\u2019re reading this in November of 2022, then you know Stanford just lost \u2013 eliminated from the NCAA Tournament on penalty kicks by sixth-seeded BYU. On the surface, there\u2019s nothing notable about the No. 3 seed Cardinal dropping a result to a top-20 Cougars team no stranger to postseason success. But Stanford, after losing just twice all year, had to play this home game in Chapel Hill, N.C. That\u2019s the difference between a second or third seed in the NCAA Tournament \u2013 hosting second and third round games or not. When minor differences in seeding matter this much, the committee must do better. And when it comes to Stanford over the last two seasons, they simply have not.\n\nThe games \u2013 for lack of better words \u2013 have to matter. That pair of aforementioned Cardinal losses both came on the road at the hands of Northwestern and USC \u2013 who each spent extended time in the top 10. Stanford\u2019s only other blemishes came in split-decisions at Santa Clara \u2013 coming off back-to-back College Cup appearances \u2013 and at Cal \u2013 a result that clinched the outright Pac-12 title. Yet, the committee decided the Cardinal were no better than ninth-best when setting the field of 64.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at how Stanford\u2019s resume stacks up with the eight ahead of them, and look just a little deeper than the RPI. We\u2019ll start by eliminating the schools who dropped the same or fewer results, which takes out all four No. 1 seeds in UCLA, Alabama, Florida State and Notre Dame, as well as No. 2 seed Saint Louis. That leaves us with Duke, North Carolina and Penn State. The Nittany Lions lost four games this season \u2013 including a head-to-head 2-0 defeat at Stanford on Sept. 1 \u2013 and drew another three. Duke also lost a quartet of contests while the Tar Heels dropped a trio \u2013 each losing on their home field to top-seeded UCLA. For comparison\u2019s sake, Stanford took down the then-unbeaten No. 1 Bruins 1-0 on Oct. 14.\n\nStanford won more games and lost fewer than three of the committee\u2019s No. 2 seeds, one of which the Cardinal beat earlier this season. Yet the committee slotted them on the No. 3 line, a statement of separation that directly contradicts the results on the field.\n\nA season ago, Stanford finished the 2021 campaign with five losses. Four of those were road losses against top-10 opposition \u2013 No. 5 Duke, No. 2 North Carolina (in overtime), No. 5 UCLA and No. 10 USC (in overtime). It was a schedule that also included a 3-1 drubbing of the defending champions in No. 11 Santa Clara. Their reward for facing five top-11 opponents, winning one of them and forcing overtime in another pair? A first round trip to Santa Clara, who, like Stanford, also dropped five games \u2013 including a head-to-head loss to the Cardinal. Sound familiar?\n\nEven if Stanford had ridden out of Broncos\u2019 Country alive, they were set \u2013 had UCLA avoided a first-round upset to UC Irvine \u2013 to travel to Westwood for their second and third round matchups. The selection committee has made a habit of seeding almost exactly according to the RPI, a useful tool for quantifying some of the nuance that can be missing from a win-loss record. But at some point, the games have to matter. At some point, the committee must be held accountable to look deeper than a mathematical calculation, especially when their decisions have such a massive impact on how the tournament plays out.\n\nThere have been numerous other questionable decisions made by the committee along the same lines \u2013 unbeaten UCLA earning No. 2 seed in 2021, two-loss and No. 2 seed North Carolina having to face South Carolina in round one of the same tournament... Boasting some of the most talented rosters in the country over the last two seasons, no school has been as hard done by the committee as Stanford. And just as it did a season ago, the Cardinal\u2019s 2022 season ended far sooner than it should have.\n\nWhile, of course, Stanford could have rendered the committee\u2019s missteps meaningless by taking care of business inside the lines, poor decisions outside of them made that task undeniably more difficult \u2013 an extra hurdle its regular season resumes should, like other top programs, exempt them from having to clear. The games... have to matter.\n```"}

Uber, Lyft and other app-based ride-hailing and delivery services prevailed at the ballot box in their expensive gamble to keep drivers classified as independent contractors. Proposition 22 pitted the powerhouses of the so-called gig economy, including DoorDash, Postmates and Instacart, against labor unions. The measure creates an exemption to a state law that would have made drivers eligible for benefits that come with being company employees.  (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\n\nBy Sabrina Rubio and Andie Kalinowski\nNovember 18, 2022 at 3:15 pm PST\n\nWith many students traveling to visit home or going on vacation for Thanksgiving break, health care professionals are raising concerns about potential spikes in COVID-19 and influenza. Considering that the past two holiday seasons, most students were required to be masked, the risk of spreading infections is much higher this year, experts say.\n\nUSC Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman says that the tracked percentage of flu cases crossed over the threshold for the starting stages of an influenza outbreak \u2013 rising from less than 1% to 11%. According to Los Angeles County Health, cases have risen from 86 to 100 cases of COVID-19 per every 100,000 individuals in the last week.\n\nDue to the highly contagious nature of the flu, Van Orman is \u201cconcerned about the post Thanksgiving, both COVID and influenza together\u201d and stressed the importance of getting the flu shot to prepare for the holiday season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had influenza around for a long time,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cBut we still struggle to get everybody vaccinated who needs to be vaccinated, and depending on the year, 30 to 50,000 people die every year of influenza in the United States.\u201d She said that many of those deaths are vaccine preventable, because they\u2019re in people who did not get an influenza vaccine.\n\nIn an email sent out Friday morning prior to holiday travel from Student Health Information, Van Orman stated students and faculty can pick up COVID-19 testing kits from the Jefferson Lot and Pappas Quad testing sites, as well as the CSC desks in USC Housing and should test if they are exposed to COVID. She also urged students to get a flu shot and the updated COVID-19 booster and strongly recommends that people wear a high-quality mask when they are in indoor public settings.\n\nAs these numbers continue to rise, students have mixed feelings about the risk that Thanksgiving travel will bring to the USC community. Mimi Geller, a senior journalism major, isn\u2019t concerned about spending Thanksgiving at home because of the small group of people she will be celebrating with. However, she is worried about the risks she\u2019s taking when traveling between home and school.\n\n\u201cI plan on definitely masking in the airports and on my way to the airport and things like that. But thankfully I got my flu shot, I got my booster. So I feel confident that I\u2019ve done all that I can to make sure that I don\u2019t get infected with RSV or COVID,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Geller doesn\u2019t know how many people are going to be taking the same precautions as her when traveling since masks are not required, only recommended in indoor settings, she believes that \u201cpeople should pay attention to public health officials and listen to them when they say that you should maybe mask.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, senior psychology major Christina Merrifield, said she is not concerned about the increase in illness and feels that taking basic sanitary precautions is enough.\n\n\u201cPeople have to go see their families,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s certain cautions that people should take ... to remain safe and not spread stuff. But to a certain extent, you can\u2019t really totally control that without being isolated.\u201d\n\nZachary Guan, a senior studying economics and data science, says one of the reasons that he\u2019s not traveling home to China over break is to try and prevent getting any of his friends or family sick, in addition to the quarantine restrictions overseas. Instead, Guan is \u201cchoosing to travel to a place where there\u2019s not a lot of people\u201d over the break to enjoy the holiday without the crowds and health risks.\n\nAccording to Van Orman, while the flu season is different every year, it historically appears during the winter from December to March. However, this past spring saw flu cases spreading widely, and Van Orman says she believes this is connected to the end of masking. As of April 18, masks are no longer required on public transportation, even though the Center for Disease Prevention (CDC) still recommends that people continue to mask up. All major U.S airlines including American Airlines and Delta Airlines have since dropped their requirements and moved to \u201cmask optional.\u201d\n\nLast year, all USC students taking classes in-person or living in a university residence were required to get the flu vaccine before November 1, in an effort to \u201chelp mitigate the potential simultaneous impact of flu and COVID-19 during the seasonal flu time frame in the fall/winter months,\u201d according to USC Student Health. In lieu of the same mandate this year, USC Student Health and USC Pharmacies organized \u201cVaxchella\u201d last month to create opportunities for and encourage students to get vaccinated, both for influenza and COVID-19.\n\nSchedule your COVID-19 booster and flu shot appointment today through USC Pharmacies.\n```"}

I am somebody who wants to be a journalist as a career. So getting experience in the official newsroom like what Annenberg has was something I really want to do, and the fact I could do it here for Annenberg Media, like a publication I already worked for and kind of know what it is, I was interested in it.\n\nWhy be a USC editor specifically? \nI thought out of all the different sections, I thought [the USC desk] was my strongest suit because I knew that I also wanted to work with MJs. I was MJ so I wanted to help younger people know what to do and be a mentor in some way.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of being a USC editor? \nMy favorite part of it is just like being in the Media Center the whole day from 8am to 5pm, and talking with all the MJs, talking with all the other editors in the Halo, seeing friends [and] getting familiar with people. Everyone I work with is super nice and fun to hang out with and be with [and the] MJs, they\u2019re super fun too. It feels like it\u2019s like a day outside of school where I don\u2019t have any school, classes [or] obligations. But I have my work that I actually enjoy doing for a long time.\n\nHow do you recognize what is or is not a good article? \nWhen it comes to pitches, me and Kennedy, the other editor, will always look at pitches and we\u2019ll think, will people want to read this? Is it important for people to know? Whenever we give a pitch or a story to someone, we have them make sure they\u2019re clear on the angle they want to go into.  Once we get a draft back, we\u2019ll edit it for grammar and maybe some sentence changes like word choice. But in terms of the bigger picture, like  structure of an article, if we can tell that maybe the most important information isn\u2019t like first, or maybe there\u2019s too much background, or you\u2019re missing details. Then we\u2019ll talk with the writer and be like, you should get more of this, or you get more interviews. I will say I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve received an article yet that\u2019s been a bad article.\n\nHow do you edit an article without removing the original author\u2019s voice? \nI know when I was an MJ I was always worried that my articles would not be my voice. So whenever we edit, I\u2019ll always want to not rewrite completely, but maybe restructure some of the paragraphs. If certain paragraphs need rewrites, I would just leave a comment on the paragraph and say, Hey, could you rewrite this so it says something similar to this? And I explain why. I never want to fully edit a paragraph and make it my own writing.\n\nWhat are you hoping to do after school? \nAfter I graduate, I want to go abroad to Europe for a couple months and venture around the world. I\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s looking to join the workforce or get a job right away. I want to explore a little bit and go to some places I haven\u2019t seen. After that, I\u2019d want to become a sports journalist in some way. I could see myself working for a big publication like ESPN or Bleacher Report, The Athletic or something. I\u2019m just definitely someone who really loves sports and really loves writing.\n\nWhat can Annenberg Media do to better engage the surrounding community? \nSomething that I do think we could work on [is] reading different types of newspapers that aren\u2019t the LA Times, or USC publications. I think that we could do a better job at reading smaller publications like LA Taco, or about the communities around us like Exposition Park or South LA and get more stories from that area, because there\u2019s a lot that goes on over there that we don\u2019t really report on too much.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who is looking to become an editor? \nDefinitely become an editor just because it\u2019s really fun. And it\u2019s a really interesting experience to be an editor instead of a writer, especially if you\u2019ve been around here for a long time. It\u2019s cool to be on the other side of it. It opens your eyes to a lot of different styles of writing and it could help you improve your own writing.\n\nWhat would you ask other USC editors? \nWhat motivates you to wake up that early and come to the Media Center? Because I will say a lot of times I\u2019ll wake up at seven, I\u2019ll be in bed and I\u2019m like, I really don\u2019t want to get out of bed, it\u2019s way too early. But for me, I love working here. I love coming in at eight and getting coffee from Illy. The whole routine that we have as editors in the Media Center, I love it personally.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Matt Ludtke)  By   Kyle Frankel November 17, 2022 at  8:51 pm PST \n \n \n I could brag about Justin Fields once again (who was decimals away from reaching 40 points for the second week in a row), but I\u2019ll spare you a repeat of last week\u2019s column. We may have just witnessed the game of the year up in Buffalo and possibly the greatest catch ever in Justin Jefferson\u2019s game-saving one-handed snag. We\u2019re in the home stretch and most fantasy players are in the midst of a playoff push, or at the very least a push out of last place. Given that, let\u2019s try to do our best Taylor Heinicke impression and give ourselves a win to celebrate \u2014 even if it comes on a roughing the passer call. Is Christian Watson Just a One Week Wonder? The short answer? No. The long answer? Well, let\u2019s dive into that. Last Sunday, the Green Bay Packers kept their season alive with a 31-28 overtime victory against the Dallas Cowboys. The most popular storyline that has come from this game is that Aaron Rodgers might be back to normal, as he led a vintage fourth quarter comeback and the ultimate game-winning drive in overtime. However, the larger takeaway, at least for us fantasy football savants, may be the monster game from rookie wide receiver Christian Watson. Watson saw eight targets from his future Hall of Fame quarterback. Though he only caught four of those throws, the wideout was able to pick up huge chunks of yardage. He went for 107 yards and not only scored his first-career touchdown, but picked up a hat trick with three trips to the end zone. All of these stats added up to 32.7 PPR points for the few fantasy owners that started him, a huge jump from his previous season-high of 9.3. It feels like we\u2019ve been waiting all season for Aaron Rodgers to find a receiver he really trusts. There\u2019s been multiple names thrown out during the year as guys with the potential to fill that role, and Watson might be the one to finally take the mantle. Watson saw the second-highest snap count of Packers wide receivers on Sunday, behind only veteran wideout Alan Lazard. He also saw about a 40% target share, good for the most of any Green Bay pass-catcher through the first 10 weeks. The Packers finally leaned on their two-headed monster in the backfield of A.J. Dillon and Aaron Jones. Establishing the run game paid dividends towards Green Bay\u2019s offensive revival and Watson benefited from this Aaron Rodgers offense we\u2019ve become accustomed to over the last decade. He has huge upside for the rest of the season if Green Bay can stay looking like themselves of years past. Despite being a top performer in all of fantasy football for Week 10, Watson is still only rostered in 41.1% of ESPN leagues. Campbell\u2019s Coming in Hot Why is no one talking about Parris Campbell? The Colts wide receiver has put together three of the quietest 18-plus point outings I\u2019ve ever seen in the last five weeks. After a sputtering start to the season, Indianapolis switched up its offense before they hosted Jacksonville in Week 6. In his first two games after that change, Campbell garnered 11 and 12 targets and scored a touchdown in each, good for 18.7 and 23.0 PPR points in back-to-back games. People forgot about Campbell after a couple rough games when Sam Ehlinger replaced Matt Ryan under center. When Ryan returned under new head coach Jeff Saturday this past week, Campbell showed he hadn\u2019t missed a beat. As Indianapolis picked up its fourth win of the season against the Raiders, Campbell was a large part of the Colts offense, catching seven of his nine targets for 76 yards and a touchdown. That means in his last three games with Matt Ryan leading the offense, Campbell is averaging double-digit targets, over 67 yards and a touchdown each time he takes the field. Campbell has proved to be one of Ryan\u2019s two favorite options in the air \u2014 along with former Trojan Michael Pittman Jr. \u2014 and should continue to see a similar workload for the remainder of the season. Yet, while Pittman Jr. is rostered in virtually every league, Campbell is still on the waivers in over 60%. One Moore I\u2019ll end with a nugget for those of you who are already locked into the playoffs. This is a guy with a high ceiling who I almost guarantee you forgot about, unless you\u2019ve been keeping up with the gridiron drama in the Big Apple. Elijah Moore could be poised to return to the waiver-wire stud we remember from the second half of last season. After a rough start to his rookie campaign with the Jets, Moore ended his first year with six straight games of at least six targets and 40 yards. He also scored five touchdowns in that span. There were high hopes for him to be an impact player on the Jets this season, but to say he has not lived up to expectations would be an understatement. Moore was not very effective to begin the season, and after seeing minimal targets following quarterback Zach Wilson\u2019s return, he took to Twitter to express his frustrations. Since then he has sat out a game, requested a trade, had his trade request denied and still not recorded a catch since Week 5. So why am I mentioning a guy who simply doesn\u2019t get the ball? Head coach Robert Saleh recently stated the Jets are moving Moore into the slot, the position he thrived in at Ole Miss. The decision for him to play out wide puzzled many analysts in the first place, and since it clearly has not worked out, the Jets are letting him go back to his college roots. Moore is a smaller receiver with elite quickness, making him a perfect physical fit for the slot position. New York is also coming off of a bye week, so he has had some extra time to get acclimated. We could see Moore play a big role in this offense when the Jets travel to Foxborough and look to snap a 13-game losing streak to the Patriots this weekend. \u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Thousands of Starbucks employees at over 100 locations in the United States went on strike Thursday in the largest ever single-day protest in support of the Starbucks Workers Union. Five locations in Los Angeles are participating in the strike: Cypress Park, Anaheim, DTLA, Long Beach and Lakewood. The protest, dubbed the \u201cRed Cup Rebellion,\u201d coincides with Starbucks Red Cup Day, an annual event where Starbucks hands out reusable holiday themed cups. Many consider Red Cup Day to be Starbucks\u2019 busiest day of the year as coffee drinkers clamber to get their hands on the collector\u2019s edition plastic cups.\n\nTyler Keely, a 26-year-old unionization supporter from a Starbucks location in Long Beach, explained that the strike was in protest of intentional short staffing, labor cuts and refusal to bargain. \u201cWe want Starbucks to know that we\u2019re not playing [around],\u201d Keely said. \u201cWe want them to get to the table so we can negotiate a contract.\u201d\n\nStarbucks workers began a push to unionize stores in the summer of 2021. A few stores in Buffalo, New York filed petitions to unionize that August, and a few months later, the company had its first unionized store. But their progress hasn\u2019t come without hurdles. Starbucks Workers United argues that Starbucks is intentionally suppressing unionization efforts by not bargaining in good faith and delaying workers efforts to obtain contracts and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has accused Starbucks of closing locations which had the necessary support for unionization.\n\nVeronica Gonzalez, 26, a shift manager for the Starbucks location on Figueroa and Cypress, applauded the unionization efforts. \u201cMy store is the busiest store and we were able to shut it down. We\u2019re losing the store between $12,000 to $15,000 solely based on the fact that today is a Starbucks holiday,\u201d said Gonzalez. \u201cWe want Starbucks to come to the table and bargain with us and sit at the table with us as true partners.\u201d\n\nAndrew Salazar, who has worked as a Starbucks barista for the past eight years, explained that his location in Downtown L.A. voted unanimously in favor of unionization. It has been over a year and a half since their vote and the location still has not solidified a contract. \u201cI hope that people would just start to see us more like humans instead of just bots that just make coffee,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile not all employees elected to participate in the strike, many are still dissatisfied with their work experience. A number of Starbucks partners have been reluctant to join the movement out of a fear of losing their positions. \u201cWe have seen the repercussions that have taken place towards baristas and other partners if they were to strike,\u201d said Olivia Sizler, a shift supervisor at a Starbucks in Strongsville, Ohio. \u201cSeeing partners fired because they expressed their views, other partners and I have stayed quiet to avoid being dismissed.\u201d\n\nThe company released a statement Thursday, indicating that they were open to negotiation. \u201cWe remain committed to all partners and will continue to work together, side-by-side, to make Starbucks a company that works for everyone,\u201d the statement read. But Sizler says that she and her colleagues don\u2019t feel that commitment. Starbucks sends out weekly surveys to collect partner feedback, she said, but these surveys aren\u2019t discussed or promoted enough to have any real impact. \u201cOur views are easily passed over,\u201d she said.\n\nIt remains to be seen what impact the strike will have, but partners are hopeful that the loss of business will lead to Starbucks taking contract negotiations more seriously. Micah Lakes, a barista at a Seattle store less than three miles from Starbucks headquarters, sees the strike as a chance to give Starbucks a taste of their own medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost a year since we told Starbucks that we are unionizing this location, and we still have not been able to get them to agree to a time for contract negotiations,\u201d said Lakes in an interview with PBS. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to work the day that is the most important for you if you\u2019re not going to be willing to meet up with us and talk with us about what we need from the company.\u201d\n```"}

Nancy Pelosi: \u201cFor me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect.\u201d Pelosi, who was speaker of the house from 2007-2011 and once again from 2019 until now, will remain serving in the House. Her announcement comes after the Republicans regained a majority in the house.\n\nNancy Pelosi: \u201cWhile we will have our disagreements on policy, we must remain fully committed to our shared fundamental mission, to hold strong to our most treasured democratic ideals, to cherish the spark of divinity in each and every one of us, and to always put our country first.\u201d\n\nShortly after Pelosi\u2019s announcement, both Democratic majority whip Jim Clyburn and majority leader Steny Hoyer also resigned from their positions, paving the way for a trio of new Democratic party leadership in the house for the first time in 20 years. While Pelosi hasn\u2019t endorsed anyone to succeed her yet, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries has emerged as the favorite to serve as the new Democratic leader and he could run unopposed. If elected, he would be the first Black person to lead a party in congress.\n\nIn her speech, Pelosi looks towards what is to come for the party. Nancy Pelosi: \u201cNow we must move boldly into the future, grounded by the principles that have propelled us this far and open to fresh possibilities for the future.\u201d\n\nPelosi has been an image of power in Washington and as speaker has led Democrats during pivotal moments such as the impeachment trials of Donald Trump and helping to pass the Affordable Care Act. She has been a prominent part of the Democratic party for nearly three and a half decades, Nancy Pelosi: \u201cMy friends, no matter what title you all, my colleagues, have bestowed upon me \u2014 speaker, leader, whip \u2014 there is no greater official honor for me than to stand on this floor and to speak for the people of San Francisco.\u201d Pelosi will continue to represent them when the new congress meets in January.\n```"}

Amini\u2019s death sparked a movement in Iran calling for awareness of human rights abuses occurring in Iran.\n\nChants and cries for freedom and women\u2019s rights could be heard from Tommy Trojan to USC Village as a group of USC students marched on October 7th to raise awareness of the situation unfolding in Iran. A small group of student organizers wanted to bring Persian students on campus together and provide an outlet to voice their thoughts. One of those student organizers is senior Rana Aghababazadeh.\n\nRana Aghababazadeh: \u201cA group of us wanted to have the protest to provide an opportunity and a space for our Iranian students to express how upset they are and how much they want to see change in Iran.\u201d\n\nIn Iran, violence has only been escalating as more protests are occurring. The Iranian Regime has been violently cracking down on demonstrators. USC and President Carol Folt have issued statements in regard to the crisis. USC\u2019s Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer, Christopher Manning released a statement on behalf of the university. Part of it reads: \u201cAs an international community that values freedom of expression and basic human rights, we mourn the tragic violence in Iran in the aftermath of the death of Mahsa Amini.\u201d\n\nThe university ended the statement by highlighting already existing resources to support students who are affected by violence in Iran. However, some students want more from the university and are questioning why the administration hasn\u2019t done more.\n\nRana Aghababazadeh: \u201cThere are students right now, USC students, with loved ones in Iran who are risking their lives every day by going out into the streets and getting arrested. USC students are not hearing from their loved ones. They get worried. So it\u2019s not Just some foreign occurrence on another planet. It\u2019s very tied to USC students And I think that\u2019s very significant Because the university should be Doing even more to Support those Students.\u201d\n\nStudents aren\u2019t disappointed with just the Administration\u2019s response either. Another student organizer, sophomore Darian A. says the response from the Persian Student Organization more commonly known as PSO has been lacking as well.\n\nDarian A: \u201cNo one\u2019s talking about how no one on the Persian executive board was at the protests or how they\u2019re doing nothing on this. So, you know, it\u2019s time to call people out. It\u2019s time to hold people accountable and move forward and move on.\n\nDarian is a host of the student-run podcast \u201cThe Chai Guys\u201d which tackles how the situation unfolding in Iran is affecting Iranians in Southern California and brings awareness to the crisis in Iran. He said: Darian A: [There is] \u201cno time better than now to push for this. And it requires a push if it makes people uncomfortable to talk about. So what? It should not be taboo.\u201d\n\nAs the situation in Iran continues, Persian students say the main way that their peers can support them is to bring continuous awareness to the protests in Iran and the developments unfolding.\n\nDarian A: \u201cUse your platform because they\u2019re cutting the Internet in Iran. So people can\u2019t post on Instagram, people can\u2019t post on Facebook. So if we can be their voice, that\u2019s really impactful.\u201d\n\nAghababazadeh believes another way to support Iranian students on campus is to reach out.\n\nRana Aghababazadeh: \u201cChecking in on your Iranian friends. I think that\u2019s also an important part let them know that you\u2019re there for them, because a lot of this. Movement is driven by Iranians, and It\u2019s hard to keep a movement alive when it\u2019s eating you up inside. So just supporting them.\u201d\n\nAs the conflict in Iran becomes more volatile, students are looking to the administration and leaders at USC to step up for the Persian community on campus. However, as more violence unfolds and expectations raise for a response, the question that remains is what will USC do? If anything?\n```"}

She was greeted by a crowd of enthusiastic supporters. Bass: \u201cNo matter who you are, no matter where you live, I will be a mayor for you.\u201d\n\nUSC students expressed their relief in finally knowing who the next mayor of L.A. will be, and many Bass supporters talked about their desires to see her policies at work. They also expressed the importance to see more representation in office. Bass will be L.A.\u2019s first female mayor and only the second black mayor in the city\u2019s history.\n\nHanah Abualhaj, a junior studying Communications, said Bass\u2019s role in office can serve as an inspiration for younger girls in the city. She thinks Bass will be able to offer a fresh perspective for the city. Abualhaj: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for a minority to be elected into the role.

Although she\u2019s happy Bass won the election, she says their work is not done. Hussain: \u201cI think moving forward, we want to hold her accountable to her promises. And so there\u2019s a lot of promises that made us want to endorse her, like her homelessness and her opinions on policing. So we want to hold her accountable and make sure that she follows what her plans are.\u201d\n\nHussain talked about Bass\u2019s political experience as an appealing factor for both her and other supporters compared to Caruso\u2019s Republican history. Hussain: \u201cI think a lot of those values that come with like women\u2019s rights and homelessness and policing and all of these issues that L.A. deals with is something that a lot of Democrats also favor on a more liberal approach. So I think those values of like helping people in need is something that Democrats value. And that\u2019s why they chose Bass over Caruso.\u201d\n\nBoth Abualhaji and Hussain talked about their excitement in voter turnout for this election\u2014especially in the younger population. They believe the rise in political participation comes from wanting to have a say in their future. Abualhaji: \u201cI think if you\u2019re not happy with how things are being run, you should definitely use your vote.\u201d Hussain: \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting that young people came out because our voices are so impactful and historically we don\u2019t vote as much as older people and a lot of politics really impact us the most.\u201d\n\nThe LA County Clerk\u2019s office is expected to officially certify the mayoral race result on December 5th.\n```"}

Student organizations at the two schools engage in competition as well, and among them is USC\u2019s satirical newspaper, the Sack of Troy. Founded by a group of freshmen in 2012, the Sack of Troy has since blossomed into a beloved source of laughs and not-so-serious news for USC students; the Sack\u2019s Instagram account has almost 5,000 followers. Among their most recent headlines are \u201cStudy Results Reveal USC Students\u2019 Biggest Fear is Being Asked Their Parents\u2019 Salary\u201d and \u201cDPS Dresses Up as Cops for Halloween.\u201d\n\nThis week, the Sack of Troy has been embattled with their crosstown counterpart, UCLA\u2019s Westwood Enabler. Joshua Wolk, the president of the Sack of Troy, talks about the rivalry.\n\nWolk: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d call it much of a rivalry. You know, sort of hammer and nail. But last year we had a bit of a back and forth last Conquest Week, and this time around they wanted to start it up again.\u201d\n\nDespite the satirical nature of the two publications, the rivalry is no joke. Last year, the publications competed to see who could elicit more pictures of their readers\u2019 feet. This year, The Westwood Enabler made an interesting request.\n\nWolk: \u201cEssentially, they wanted to have a competition to see who could get a, you know, a larger amount of their student base to send pictures of them, like on the toilet and in the bathroom. It was really strange. We didn\u2019t want to do it, but they still put out promotions about it and we just had to make a public announcement that we were not taking part in this and we wanted nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nWolk and the Sack of Troy denounced the Westwood Enabler on their Instagram, saying they \u201cdisavow this egregious request and henceforth reject any affiliation suggested by previous collaboration with the Westwood team.\u201d Wolk was worried the Sack of Troy\u2019s followers would not understand that the statement was serious and would take it just like any other post: a joke.\n\nWolk: \u201cWe put out the serious remark and people think we\u2019re still sort of just messing around with them when in reality we\u2019re trying to distance ourselves for once.\u201d\n\nGillian Smith, a writer for the Westwood Enabler, has a different story about how this collaboration came to be.\n\nSmith: \u201cBoth publications came up with that sort of together. We the Enablers sent a lot of ideas, and the Sack of Troy chose one and that\u2019s basically what we both went with.\u201d\n\nSmith claims she was shocked that the Sack of Troy denounced the rivalry.\n\nSmith: \u201cThen yesterday I think it turned into something a bit different because we started to publish, you know, the rivalry contest and we\u2019ve been flooded with toilets in our DMs, which has been lovely. And then the Sack of Troy actually deleted the message, saying that they wanted to participate in our DMs and pulled out last minute. I think in a way to sort of one-up us.\u201d\n\nAs Conquest goes on, only time will tell if the Sack of Troy truly ends their collaboration with the Westwood Enabler or if this was all part of a joke.\n```"}

Karen Bass, D-Calif., is the mayor-elect of Los Angeles, according to the Associated Press\u2019 race call on Wednesday. She will be the first female mayor of Los Angeles following her defeat of businessman Rick Caruso. With more than two-thirds of votes counted, Bass is ahead with 53.1% of the votes, while Caruso received 46.9%. Her growing lead assures her of victory by AP\u2019s count, making her the second Black mayor of Los Angeles since Tom Bradley who held the position from 1973 to 1993.\n\nUSC students weighed in with their thoughts on the results. \u201cAs a woman, it\u2019s very inspiring to see another woman hold a position of power, especially in such a large city,\u201d said Hanah Abualhaj, a junior majoring in communication. \u201cI think she serves as a good role model, especially to young girls. Also, just as a woman of color, it\u2019s great to see her step into that role.\u201d\n\nThe midterm turnout of young people under 30 was the second highest it had been in three decades, outranked only by the 2018 midterm elections after Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 win. More than a quarter of young people between ages 18 and 29 voted in the 2022 midterm election, according to a research study from Tufts University. Young people accounted for 12% of the votes of the entire election. While the percentage is relatively lower compared to other age groups, the youth vote did not drop off as Democrats feared.\n\nHudi Potash, a junior studying public policy who voted for Karen Bass, said he found it easy to vote in California and registered the same day. Sasha Hussain, the vice president of the Trojan Democrats and a junior majoring in health and human sciences, said that because it is less difficult to vote in California than in some other states, people should be motivated to vote consistently.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really amazing that we had a large turnout of younger voters, especially since we are the ones that laws will be affecting not only tomorrow but far into the future,\u201d Abualhaj said. \u201cI\u2019m very glad to see that people my age are taking the initiative to make the changes that they want to see happen.\u201d\n\nBass was a congresswoman for over a decade before her mayoral campaign. During that time, she focused on pandemic relief, housing programs, small businesses, criminal justice, child welfare and trade with Africa, according to her campaign. Her campaign for mayor ran on a platform of accessible healthcare, affordable housing and improving the unhoused crisis.\n\nBass was endorsed by other prominent Democratic politicians, including former President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cThe people of Los Angeles have sent a clear message: it is time for change and it is time for urgency,\u201d Bass said in a statement Wednesday evening after the race was called. In the statement, Bass promised to solve the unhoused crisis, to prevent crime and fix the response time to crime, and to make living in Los Angeles affordable for working-class families, adding that these changes are \u201con the way.\u201d\n\nPotash is optimistic about Bass\u2019 promise to solve the crisis of the unhoused community in Los Angeles. \u201cI think because of Karen Bass\u2019 political will and political connections, she is able to work with other actors in the space to really make a change,\u201d Potash said about Bass\u2019 future actions within the unhoused community. Bass\u2019 platform addressed the crisis through its direct causes, which her campaign notes as: \u201clack of affordable housing, health care, access to job opportunities and residential alcohol and drug treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ran for mayor to urgently confront the crises our hometown faces,\u201d Bass said on Wednesday. \u201cTonight, 40,000 Angelenos will sleep without a home \u2013 and five will not wake up. Crime is increasing and families are being priced out of their neighborhoods. This must change.\u201d\n\nHussain is hopeful about Bass\u2019 promise to help Los Angeles\u2019 crime. \u201cAs a representative for the House, [Bass] brought the Crime and Policing Act into Congress,\u201d Hussain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen her actually implement it at the national level. Because she already has this experience, I think she can also bring this to the mayoral level and it will have more impact compared to the national level.\u201d\n\nBass\u2019 opponent, Caruso, called her after her win. \u201cThere will be more to come from the movement we built, but for now, as a city we need to unite around Mayor-elect Bass and give her the support she needs to tackle the many issues we face,\u201d Caruso said in a concession statement according to the LA Times.\n\nHowever, electing Bass as mayor is just the first step for Hussain. \u201cOur job is not finished,\u201d Hussain said. \u201cWe also have to hold her accountable to finish those promises.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel November 17, 2022 at 5:39 pm PST\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, a football game\u2019s going to break out at the Rose Bowl on Saturday.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s football practice, that was how defensive coordinator Alex Grinch described the matchup between No. 7 USC and No. 16 UCLA in Pasadena this weekend. One of college football\u2019s premier rivalry games at one of its most historic venues, this game is always circled on every college football fan\u2019s calendar. But this year, there\u2019s far more at stake than bragging rights and a one-year lease of the Victory Bell.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s potentially on the line at the Rose Bowl this Saturday: A College Football Playoff berth and a chance to play for the National Championship, a trip to the Pac-12 Championship in a few weeks and maybe the most sought after prize of them all \u2014 getting to play spoiler to your most bitter rival.\n\nDespite the high stakes of Saturday\u2019s game and the animosity between the two schools, the Trojans are approaching this game with the same mindset they\u2019ve carried throughout every game week this season.\n\n\u201cWinning football is winning football, regardless of what the logos on our helmets are or what theirs is,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cGuys have to know themselves. Some guys have to get themselves up. Some got to make sure they stay even keeled and calm down. That\u2019s every week, but obviously the emotion gets a bit higher in some of these things.\u201d\n\nA large part of the Trojans\u2019 success this season can be credited to the man under center \u2014 sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams. Williams, who transferred to USC in the spring, reiterated Grinch\u2019s attitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another game to me,\u201d Williams stated. \u201cI\u2019ve been in other big rivalry games so far in my career so just treat it like another game.\u201d\n\nOne of these other rivalry games the quarterback is referring to is the Red River Rivalry between the Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns. During his freshman season at Oklahoma last year, he was thrown into the fire by then-Sooner head coach Lincoln Riley. Williams replaced Spencer Rattler at quarterback when Oklahoma trailed Texas by three scores in the second quarter. The now-Trojan answered the call in astonishing fashion, finishing 16-of-25 for 212 yards and two touchdowns while leading the Sooners to a 55-48 comeback win.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m overall a pretty even-keeled guy,\u201d Williams said when asked about how he stays calm in situations like that Red River Rivalry game or the matchup this weekend. \u201cI do know that I\u2019m a leader of this team ... so I have to be even-keeled regardless of what\u2019s going on for the other 100 guys on this team.\u201d\n\nEven though the Trojans aren\u2019t letting the aura of the rivalry deviate them from their normal preparation, those same sentiments don\u2019t seem to be reciprocated in Westwood.

This personality trait is spelled out by each and every track on his latest release, \u201cBakudi Scream,\u201d a careful balance between high-level audio storytelling and blended hyper pop-chip tune instrumentals that draw from video games, fantasy and guilt.\n\n\u201cI harbor a lot of guilt,\u201d the composer said via Zoom. \u201cAround the choices I\u2019ve made professionally and personally and whether it matters to [my parents] that there\u2019s things that have mattered to me, that don\u2019t matter to them...Things I believe are really important that everybody should think about.\u201d\n\nChander\u2019s family is always present in his music the same way they are always present in his life, but their forms morph into fantastical musical abstractions regarding relationships and love. Chander, a first-generation Indian American raised in Rhode Island was given piano lessons from a young age, but didn\u2019t develop a true interest in music until he found himself in the grips of pubescence.\n\nWhen his family acquired a mini-Mac computer, Chander\u2019s older brother was the first devoted to the GarageBand application. The composer admiringly ascribes most of his core musical identity to his older brother\u2019s similar musical disposition and love of hip hop. \u201cHe would make a bunch of old school boom- bap-type hip hop, and was really big on J Dilla,\u201d Chander recalled. He would sit at his older brother\u2019s feet and mimic the styles he heard. Slowly, Black music such as soul and jazz, \u201cstarted to seep into [his] musical language.\u201d\n\nOlder brother didn\u2019t pursue music, but his one-time hobby set Chander off on the trajectory of his life\u2014to the chagrin of his parents. He thinks that maybe there was some kind of artistry a couple generations back...but he isn\u2019t sure. For now, he is it.\n\nChander describes his parents\u2019 relationship to him making \u201cmusician/composer/performer\u201d his full-time career as a culture clash. Even before that career was a possibility\u2014back in high school\u2014they were not fans, hoping that he would become a doctor or lawyer. Their confusion and passive disapproval have only driven him to a pure-heartedly contrarian lifestyle guided by music.\n\nHe recalls months of running on solely power naps so that he could write music during the school week. The experience forced Chander to put everything into music. \u201cI was just working hard because I had to prove to them that I could,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I could prove to them that I can do it, but also to myself, that I was not fucking up in the way that they thought that I was.\u201d\n\nHis parents warmed up to the idea when he began chasing his MFA degree in music from USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music following his undergraduate studies in classical music at NYU. He knows they mean well, but Chander still questions himself. He mythologizes this inner turmoil into his work.\n\nWhatever escape that music couldn\u2019t provide, the young Chander found in stories. He spotlights anime and video games as the intersection of his loves. He names longform story based RPGs such as \u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d and \u201cNaruto\u201d specifically. \u201cBakudi Scream\u201d features a number of samples from and sequences inspired by both.\n\nThe album\u2019s introduction features a robotic voice asking a series of invasive questions that act like security questions protecting your mortal identity. You have selected your avatar and are about to enter the audiophonic universe that Chander has sculpted. The span of his imagination thinly veils a meticulous sense of logic behind an operatic album. By deceiving the ears of those accustomed to relating certain responses to video game-style music, Chander inserts himself into your mind\u2019s eye.\n\nThere\u2019s a story in \u201cBakudi Scream,\u201d if you\u2019re willing to find it. The main character, \u201cThe Architect Prince,\u201d acts as a second body that listeners can use to ask how they\u2019ve become themselves. \u201cIn my case, this idea of self-synthesis is really still tethered to an image of whiteness that has its own damaging colonial archive,\u201d Chander said. \u201cIn whose image am I trying to create myself? And whose image is the architect Prince trying to create? What is this exosuit that you\u2019ve built? What is this mechanism, this engine you\u2019ve created?\u201d\n\nThis conflict grounds the story, which brings \u201cThe Architect Prince\u201d into contact with a hacker and character named \u201cHINDOO WARRIOR.\u201d Chander\u2019s live performance brings even further energy to this concept, embodying the storyline physically. Disguising himself behind a light-up mask, Chander\u2019s frenetic movements turn him into an overexposed human laser.\n\nSo long as those central questions clearly exist, however, Chander doesn\u2019t mind if the journey itself can seem abstract. The journey continues with the sequel record he\u2019s creating, building on the same universe, but around the execution of the architect prince. \u201cThe whole record is confronting questions I\u2019ve had recently in relation to death,\u201d the composer said. \u201cHow death and...the considerations about identity can kind of actually go hand-in-hand.\u201d\n\nThe album will be completed alongside commission-based work and his podcast, \u201cCritic, Critic,\u201d a place that brings artists of color together to discuss the overlooked nuances of their music stemming from their identities\u2014something Chandler believes is missing from music journalism. \u201cI just felt\u2014honestly\u2014white people don\u2019t get it, you know? It\u2019s really good when you are talking to other people of color and you can really bond over and discuss things in a different way.\u201d\n\nChander\u2019s deeply contemplative perspective leads him forward as much as it drags him back. Evolutions are inevitable and he\u2019s aware, but the 2022 version of his innermost self can be found on Spotify under, \u201cBakudi Scream.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Ken Lund via Creative Commons)\n\nBy Christian Fulton, Chris Bibona, Haylee Clophus, and Ethan Inman\nNovember 17, 2022 at 3:47 pm PST\n\nFor better or worse, Saturday will be a season-defining day for USC football. Tens of thousands of football fans are expected to flood into the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena this weekend to watch the penultimate game of the regular season for both No. 7 USC and No. 16 UCLA. In what is always an emotionally charged rivalry week, the stakes are high this season with the Trojans on the cusp of qualifying for the Pac-12 Championship or, with a stroke of luck, the College Football Playoff.\n\nWith UCLA removing four sponsor tarps from the Rose Bowl, capacity will increase to 70,865 for Saturday\u2019s game. The capacity for other Bruins home games this season was 53,170. Even with the addition of seats, space is at a premium. As of Thursday, the cheapest single ticket available for the crosstown showdown was $199 on resale, according to Ticketmaster.\n\nFor USC students who are lucky enough to secure tickets to the game, actually getting to Pasadena can be a challenge on its own. \u201cWe don\u2019t offer any services to the game,\u201d said Marcus Arvizu, senior transit manager at USC Transportation. \u201cIn the past we have serviced [to the Rose Bowl] once, but there were too many issues. It\u2019s a difficult place to get into.\u201d Arvizu said that on the one occasion where transportation was provided, USC Transportation needed a police escort to make the trip to Pasadena possible since they were transporting President Carol Folt.\n\nBoth USC and UCLA students planning to make the trip are most likely to take a ride service or drive themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty far away,\u201d Leena Feda, a UCLA sophomore studying economics, said. \u201cI\u2019m just going with a friend and we\u2019re gonna make a road trip to the Rose Bowl.\u201d\n\nIf you plan on driving up to Pasadena, standard parking at the Rose Bowl is $35 and parking for oversized vehicles is $100. Prepaid online parking is discounted to $30. Alternative parking is also available at Parsons parking lot in Old Town Pasadena for a drive-up rate of $25. A free shuttle service is available to and from the stadium from the lot.\n\nAdditionally, the Metro Gold Line connects Union Station in Downtown L.A. to Pasadena. Students can take the Expo Line from Exposition Boulevard to Union Station and then catch the train to Pasadena. After getting off at Memorial Park Station, students can walk or catch a bus to the Rose Bowl. This is the most cost-effective option by far, since a one-day pass for Metro is currently only $3.50.\n\nStudents may also pursue using rideshare programs to get to the Rose Bowl, but those who do will likely face steep prices \u2014 especially on Saturday night as rideshare prices tend to be affected by demand and availability. These steep prices, however, won\u2019t get you directly to the stadium. Jeffrey Shepard, a junior studying business, says that arriving via Uber or Lyft isn\u2019t the end of the line. \u201cAfter an expensive ride, you\u2019ve gotta make the decision whether to walk two miles to the stadium or pay for the $10 shuttle,\u201d he said.\n\nShepard noted that he and his friends took an Uber to a UCLA game last year and then made the trek up to the stadium, but they would have appreciated a heads up.\n\nUCLA expects 16,700 students to go to Saturday\u2019s game, the largest student section in the history of Bruins football. Nicknamed \u201cThe Den,\u201d UCLA\u2019s student section will take up four of 26 sections at the Rose Bowl.\n\nWhile prices may be high and transportation will cause headaches, many USC students remain determined to travel to Pasadena to support the Trojans. \u201cWhen I saw the prices of the tickets I was shocked, but I\u2019m getting to that game,\u201d Alexa Grenley, a junior studying communications, said. Grenley advised finding USC friends from the area or staying with some cross-town contacts to help avoid a long, expensive ride home.\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie November 17, 2022 at 12:39 pm PST\n\nJoey Logano ended his 2022 NASCAR Championship-winning season where he started it: the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. After winning the NASCAR Cup Series Championship in Phoenix, Arizona, Logano returned to the site of the Busch Light Clash, which he won in February. With the season over, it\u2019s time to look forward \u2014 how could the next Clash at the Coliseum be different?\n\nLogano was one of a short list of drivers who managed to make a pass for the lead at the Coliseum. There were only 11 passes for the lead, all of which came in the last two races of the seven held. \u201cThere\u2019s not pit stops,\u201d Logano said November 8 at the Coliseum. \u201cEventually the fastest cars are gonna get to the front, and they\u2019re going to stay up to the front.\u201d\n\nThe Clash was the first race for the Next Gen car, which brought with it the largest changes to NASCAR\u2019s formula in decades. The new car allowed for much closer racing on 1.5 mile ovals, but that improvement did not extend to short-track races. There will likely be changes made to the cars to improve short-track racing next season, with it being very difficult to pass in most short-track races without putting the car in the wall.\n\nNASCAR Chief Operating Officer Steve O\u2019Donnell says they\u2019re looking into what they can do to make passing more viable. \u201cWe have a lot of dialogue going on with the drivers in terms of potentially looking at some power things. I think that\u2019s a little more complicated,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said November 4 at a press conference in Phoenix. \u201cThere are some things we\u2019ve looked at even through Garage 56 that we found from an aero standpoint that could be put in place as early as next year for both short tracks and road courses.\u201d\n\nGarage 56 is NASCAR\u2019s impending entry into the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The project is led by Chevrolet and Hendrick Motorsports and will modify the car to fit the prestigious race. Changes won\u2019t only be made to improve racing for next year. Some safety changes will also be made in light of Kurt Busch and Alex Bowman suffering concussions this year, forcing both to miss races. Busch retired as a result of his injury.\n\nNASCAR says safety was the \u201cpriority\u201d in the design of the car, but the association was working to improve driver safety on heavy impacts, such as Ryan Newman\u2019s at Daytona last year. Busch and Bowman\u2019s crashes were mid-corner, single-car incidents which most likely would not have resulted in an injury in the previous generation of car. \u201cWhat we\u2019re learning is those smaller hits, which we\u2019ve never seen before in terms of a car that we\u2019ve raced, are the ones we really need to concentrate on,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said November 4.\n\nLogano also floated the idea that not all drivers should be eligible for the Clash. Although drivers had to race their way into the final event, there were no guaranteed spots for the event based on the previous season\u2019s results. In the past, drivers who won pole position in the year prior or had previously won the Clash were eligible, but no one else had a shot. \u201cI feel like you should kind of earn your way in by something you did in the previous years, just from [a] historic way of doing things. Not that that\u2019s always the right way, but it\u2019s just the tradition that I\u2019m used to,\u201d Logano said. \u201cMaybe it doesn\u2019t have to be that way now. I don\u2019t know...I was critical of it coming in. It worked out.\u201d\n\nAlthough changes may be made, there\u2019s no doubt NASCAR views the event as a massive success. \u201cIt was a proof point that we could do something like that, that we could build a track inside a stadium, certainly an iconic one. That was important for us,\u201d NASCAR President Steve Phelps said November 4 at the Phoenix press conference. \u201cEveryone had a smile on their face \u2014 everyone. It was unbelievable. Never seen that at a NASCAR race. Someone is always complaining about something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest wins as an industry, in a sport, that you can ask for, and you think about what we were able to accomplish the first time, racing in a stadium like this is just awesome,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to coming back.\u201d\n\nThe Clash will return to the Coliseum February 5, 2023.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Jacob Hare November 16, 2022 at 8:15 pm PST\n\nWhile it was challenging to keep up with all the crazy upsets from this past weekend, don\u2019t worry \u2014 I have you covered in my Week 11 edition of \u201cUnpack The Pac.\u201d\n\nUtah 42, Stanford 7\nOn paper, this was one of the most jaw-dropping box score differences we have seen in the Pac-12 this season. Utah flat out embarrassed Stanford in every category of the game. Utah junior running back Tavion Thomas, who was about to lose his starting role a couple of weeks ago, was the game\u2019s best player. Thomas rushed for 180 yards and two touchdowns, helping Utah accumulate a total of 279 rushing yards. On the other side of the ball, Utah\u2019s defensive line gave Stanford\u2019s offensive line all it could handle, recording seven sacks and forcing Stanford junior quarterback Tanner McKee out of his comfort zone the entire game. McKee gave a dreadful performance on Saturday, as he was 11-of-23 passing for 155 yards. It didn\u2019t help that Stanford\u2019s collective rushing attack only mustered 22 yards the entire game. It was indeed an awful performance for Stanford all around the board, as the Cardinal are now unable to make a bowl game. Meanwhile, Utah prepares for a massive game against Oregon next weekend, as the Utes\u2019 slim Pac-12 title hopes are still alive.\n\nUSC 55, Colorado 17\nAfter a sluggish start in the first quarter, USC got off to the races and never slowed down. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams continued his promising Heisman campaign with 268 passing yards and five total touchdowns. After redshirt senior Travis Dye went down with a season-ending leg injury, senior running back Austin Jones stepped up in a big way for USC. He had over 100 yards from scrimmage and a receiving touchdown against the Buffaloes, but it will be a formidable challenge to replace Dye\u2019s leadership for the rest of the season. On the flip side of the ball, USC\u2019s defense finally showed up after an extended string of inadequate performances. They allowed 17 points to Colorado and only 124 passing yards. After Oregon and UCLA both lost, USC is now in sole possession of first place in the Pac-12. The Trojans will need their defense to hold up on their side of the field if they want any chance at a Pac-12 title, or even a College Football Playoff appearance.\n\nWashington 37, Oregon 34\nIt would be ridiculous not to label this as the game of the season for the Pac-12. Oregon and Washington continued to trade punches the entire game, as the lead changed six times in the second half. Washington won the game mostly because of its offensive line, which has been astounding the whole season. That unit gave junior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. all the time he needed in the pocket to deliver a sensational performance. Penix threw for 408 yards and two touchdowns to outduel Oregon senior quarterback Bo Nix amid his unprecedented surge. Nix played his heart out, as he threw for 279 yards and had three total touchdowns, but it wasn\u2019t enough for the Ducks to beat the Huskies. This is a gut-wrenching loss for Oregon, as the Ducks\u2019 once-hopeful College Football Playoff chances are now thrown out the window. As for Washington, this is the Huskies\u2019 most impressive win of the year, as it came on the road while doing all of the little things right.\n\nArizona 34, UCLA 28\nIn potentially the most unexpected upset the Pac-12 will see the entire season, Arizona found a way to steal a win in Pasadena. UCLA was fortunate to have senior running back Zach Charbonnet return after missing last week\u2019s contest against Arizona State with an injury. This week, Charbonnet had over 200 yards from the line of scrimmage and three rushing touchdowns. Regardless of Charbonnet\u2019s performance, it just wasn\u2019t enough for UCLA\u2019s offense, as the Bruins committed way too many mistakes to beat Arizona\u2019s high-powered offense. UCLA was 2-for-5 on fourth down, and the Bruins lost the turnover battle. In prior articles, I expressed worries about UCLA\u2019s defense, and Arizona exposed UCLA\u2019s abysmal pass defense. Arizona sophomore quarterback Jayden de Laura was fabulous, as he threw for 315 yards and had three total touchdowns. Junior wide receiver Jacob Cowing was also unguardable, making nine catches for 118 yards. The duo of de Laura and Cowing gave the Bruins too much trouble and ultimately destroyed their slim chances of a College Football Playoff appearance.\n\nWashington State 28, Arizona State 18\nAfter dominating 28-0 in the first half, Washington State permitted Arizona State to score 18 unanswered points. But, Arizona State was too inefficient on third down to win this game, going 3-of-14. Both starting quarterbacks produced mediocre performances, while the running backs stole the show. Washington State redshirt junior running back Nakia Watson had 158 yards from scrimmage and three rushing touchdowns. On the other sideline, Arizona State graduate running back Xazavian Valladay had 189 scrimmage yards and one rushing touchdown. Yet, Watson\u2019s three touchdowns were just too much for Arizona State to overcome despite a serious comeback attempt.\n\nOregon State 38, Cal 10\nAfter narrowly losing to USC last weekend, Cal was embarrassed by Oregon State on Saturday. Cal redshirt senior quarterback Jack Plummer, who threw for over 400 yards last week, wasn\u2019t able to move the ball downfield. The rushing attack supplied no help to Plummer, as the Golden Bears rushed for a laughable nine yards on 16 carries. On the other side of the ball, Cal\u2019s defense gave another horrid performance, allowing 362 yards with zero sacks. With its seventh loss, Cal can no longer make a bowl game; with Oregon State\u2019s win, the Beavers make a stronger push toward a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

Slogans such as \u201c48,000 ready to fight\u201d and \u201cunion power\u201d permeated the air.\n\n\u201cOur most central demand is that we earn enough to live here,\u201d said Sam Hunter, an organizer leading the strikes at UCLA\u2019s campus through Fair UC Now. He is a Ph.D. student studying television and digital media, one of the many graduate workers striking for livable wages. A livable wage in Los Angeles County for childless adults is about $45,536 a year. UCLA TA\u2019s make an average of about $24,000 in an academic year, just below the classification of an \u201cextremely low-income level\u201d according to the U.S Department of Housing and Development.\n\n\u201cMany of us in my graduate program work second jobs in order to make ends meet because the university simply just does not pay us enough to live here,\u201d Aya Konishi, a Ph.D. student studying sociology at UCLA states. UCLA TA\u2019s work up to 20 hours per week, a strenuous workload given their other responsibilities as students or researchers. More than a third of the student worker\u2019s incomes go towards rent, with 40% of the workers even giving back half of their income to the university for housing.\n\nA housing system under crisis and strain has also exacerbated student conditions. Most UCLA students remain on campus for nine months. The cheapest on-campus rent for a single room in graduate housing is $975 per month, with the most expensive being $2781. This leads to a range of $8,775 - $25,029 for rent in a single academic year, with the most expensive housing exceeding the income of a TA.\n\nThe University of California\u2019s unionized graduate student workers began striking on Monday, November 14. The TA\u2019s refuse to teach courses until negotiations have been completed. \u201cWe do the teaching, we do the grading, we do the research, and we make you see the number one public university,\u201d Konishi said.\n\nAlong with the students were UCLA faculty and professors, who came to display solidarity with the workers. Many professors are forced to choose between continuing their classes or stopping to support their students. \u201cI feel with the students, and I feel the pain, and I feel the need, but I also feel sad that students have to do that [protest] in order to make their demands heard,\u201d said Min Zhou, professor of sociology and Asian American studies at UCLA.\n\nUCLA faculty and staff stand in solidarity with students. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nShe continued: \u201cBut they should be taking good care of [themselves] because they are coming to school and they are coming here to get a good education. And they are the next generation of our productive workers in society. So it\u2019s important that they have a good environment to get a good education.\u201d\n\nGraduate students demand better working conditions by negotiating amendments on childcare support, health insurance, guaranteed appointments, class sizes and more that can be seen on the union\u2019s bargaining tracking sheet. Conditions are strained. For example, a tweet retweeted by the UCLA union branch displayed the heavy workload of graduate students, with one TA who had to teach over 60 students.\n\nMany students are in a precarious position because they want to strike in solidarity with graduate students, many of whom are their teaching assistants. However, many professors still require their students to attend classes and turn in homework assignments, leaving them to decide whether or not to support their peers or continue classes despite academic setbacks.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s some people still walking around, but the vibes are just a little off. It\u2019s almost like people are deciding whether to protest or not,\u201d said Patricia Santill\u00e1n, a UCLA senior studying psychology, who noted that the campus was emptier than usual.\n\nThe strike is happening during USC-UCLA rivalry week. Far from being rivals though, UCLA students expressed solidarity with their counterparts at USC. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of energy on our picket lines, so we hope to also bring that to the rivalry week as well. Our coworkers at USC, graduate workers are also unionizing with UAW. And so hopefully, you know, they will be our union siblings too,\u201d Konishi said.\n\nExpressing the same sentiments, organizer Sam Hunter stated: \u201cWhen it\u2019s USC\u2019s turn, UCLA will stand with them.\u201d\n\nUCLA and the president\u2019s office did not respond to requests for clarification on their stance on the graduate strike and the complications that occur because the strike is happening during rivalry week, a time when many alumni visit campus.\n\nSpare protest signs stating \"UAW, ON STRIKE, UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES.\" (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n```"}

So when the United States Supreme Court took up a case earlier this month that carried the potential to strike the act down, it alarmed her. Separating children from their tribes can cause a loss of connection to their community, she said, and a loss of familial ties.\n\n\u201cThere are various studies that show the positive impact of [American Indian and Alaska Native] youth being connected to their culture \u2014 some examples being lower rates of depression, substance use, and delinquent behavior,\u201d Salinas said.\n\nThe Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments in the Brackeen v. Haaland case, in which plaintiffs argue existing law discriminates on the basis of race and does not consider the children\u2019s needs. They say it harms the Native children and the non-Native families who want to provide a loving, safe environment for the kids. But legal experts have said overturning the IWCA would remove a \u201cgold standard\u201d in child welfare policy and practice.\n\nThe federal law, passed in 1978, is designed to prevent Native children from being taken from their homes and tribal communities and put into foster care. According to Salinas, this act preserves cultural and familial ties among American Indian and Alaska Native youth and families and encourages respect for tribal authority in decisions concerning the placement of Native American children in foster care.\n\nUnder the IWCA, if more than one tribe has an interest in adopting a Native American child, a court is called upon to determine which tribe has more significant contact with the children. One of the arguments in the court questions how placing a Native child with a family from another tribe is different from placing them with a non-Native family.\n\nRyder Jiron, who is the communications and policy coordinator for the Coalition to Stop Violence against Native Women, a survivor-led nonprofit, said that a Native foster parent will have an understanding of the importance of the kids\u2019 culture and where they come from. It will also make it easier for them to visit their community and family who may have not gotten custody but are around and maintain connections with them.\n\nAccording to him, although wanting to provide the children with the perfect environment is a well-intentioned thought, there is a complexity to Native identity. Thus, the importance of building self-identity within their own tribes is something particular to Indigenous culture.\n\nThe decades-long \u201cKill the Indian, save the man\u201d ideology of the U.S. and Canada took many forms, including enrolling thousands of Native children in off-reservation boarding schools. Across the U.S. there were around 350 government-funded schools practicing assimilation of Native people into American society.\n\nAs activists put pressure on the schools, the U.S. government forged another approach to separating kids from their tribal homes, basing their methods on the belief that Indigenous children would be better off raised in white homes. The Indian Adoption Project, a 1958 federal program, created by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and administered by the Child Welfare League of America, promoted the adoption of Native children from 16 western states by white adoptive families in the East, pushing thousands of children into the system.\n\nThe idea that Native families are dysfunctional and unable to look after their children has put a disproportionate number of kids in the foster care system. Native families living in poverty as a result of systemic exploitation often lose their children because of the conditions they have no choice but to endure.\n\nJair Peltier, a PhD candidate studying tribal sovereignty and a cultural ambassador to the Native American Pasifika Student Lounge at USC, said that reservations do have problems, ranging from poverty to drug use, that cause kids from the community to be put into the welfare system.\n\n\u201cBut for years and years and years, it was kind of being used as a tool to take Native children from their Native families and being put into white families,\u201d Peltier said. \u201cAnd it became a form of assimilation for these children being put into foster care. And so, [ICWA] was designed to prevent that.\u201d\n\nExperts studying this case and the Act thus also talk about the racialization of ICWA. The Act is constantly being challenged with the argument that this is a race-based law. However, experts cite that ICWA is based on tribal citizenship and political membership.\n\n\u201cThis disconnect negatively affects both the compliance of ICWA as well as the understanding of tribal sovereignty, which has a detrimental impact on the government-to-government relationship that the United States has with tribal nations,\u201d said Salinas.\n\nTo Peltier, from The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, who started studying tribal sovereignty, wanting to solve problems of sovereignty and tribal constitutions, the conversation around ICWA is concerning.\n\nAccording to him, if the Supreme Court agrees to strike it down, then they would be potentially setting the groundwork to eliminate Indigenous sovereignty because it would dismantle all the systems that have been in place.\n\nJiron mentioned that one of the frustrating parts of the whole conversation is the lack of education.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s more so an attack on tribal sovereignty, [and] also not taking into account the complexities of Indian child welfare.\u201d\n\nTribal sovereignty had come into question not long ago when in the summer, the Supreme Court had held that all states have, as a matter of state sovereignty, the power to prosecute non-Indian crimes within Native lands.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the main issue because [ICWA] is not a racial thing,\u201d Peltier said. \u201cNative people do not exist by virtue of a racial category. We exist by virtue of our historic and political realities.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to include background information on the ICWA, on November 28, 2022.\n```"}

Collier, the number one ranked recruit in the 2023 class according to recruiting analysts 24/7 Sports, chose the Trojans over Cincinnati, Michigan and UCLA. And he wasn\u2019t the first top recruit to commit to USC this week. In just a 24-hour time span, USC signed the highest ranked recruits in men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball. Top-ranked player Juju Watkins announced Tuesday that she would stay in her hometown of Los Angeles to play at USC.\n\nUSC students said they are ecstatic, believing these two recruits will significantly help both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s program compete with the top teams in the country. \u201cI think we haven\u2019t had a really strong guard in the last couple of years,\u2019\u2019 said senior Michael Friedman. \u201cWe\u2019ve just kind of relied around a big man down low. We had Evan [Mobley], we got Isaiah [Mobley] and kind of shifting that scheme and having a really strong guard is very important for this team going forward.\u201d\n\nCollier is the highest ranked recruit to sign with USC since now-Cleveland Cavaliers center Evan Mobley signed with the university in 2020.

In late May, he suffered a meniscus injury at the USA Basketball U18 workouts. He was able to return to action for the Steph Curry Camp and Under Armor Elite 24 in August, earning MVP awards in both events.\n\nIn an interview with Sports Illustrated, Collier discussed why he chose USC over other schools. \u201cI just knew that it was the best decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the best relationship with Coach [Andy] Enfield and his whole staff. It\u2019s like a family there, and that\u2019s the situation that I wanted to be in. Plus, it\u2019s got great academics and that\u2019s something that\u2019s really important to me too.\u201d\n\nCollier will join his high school and Amateur Athletic Union teammate, four-star center Arrinten Page, along with four-star combo guard Silas Demary next year, according to Branham. Watkins, USC\u2019s other top recruit, grew up about 10 miles from USC\u2019s campus, where she is currently a point guard from Sierra Canyon High School. Watkins is the No. 1 player in the 2023 HoopGurlz recruiting rankings on espnW and the highest ranked recruit to sign with USC since guard Jacki Gemelos in 2006, according to 2/47Sports.\n\nOne student believes Watkins\u2019 skill set will fit what the team needs. \u201cWe need a little bit more pace, need a bit more spacing,\u201d senior Will Chambers said. \u201cI think Juju\u2019s shot is really going to open up the floor for more opportunities for passes, for looks down low, for just all around scoring.\u201d\n\nThe incoming 2023 recruits suggest an exciting future for the Galen Center. 24/7Sports even called the two commitments the double whammy a \u201cGalen Center coup.\u201d Enfield now has the No. 10 recruiting class in the country.\n```"}

The curators say that instead of limiting the work with additional parameters, they want to create a space without boundaries and give all artists a chance to showcase their talent.\n\n\u201c\u2018Quiet\u2019 is meant to be a space where you do not feel like there\u2019s any barriers. It\u2019s a completely open door exhibit,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cWe want to ensure that whoever is out there who feels like their work doesn\u2019t deserve to be seen or that they don\u2019t have enough clout for their art to be exhibited, that is not true.\u201d\n\nThe show was initially conceptualized by Kim during their curatorial apprenticeship at the Getty and was inspired by the struggles some students have had with applying to the Roski School of Art and Design student galleries.\n\n\u201cComing back [from my apprenticeship] I was talking with friends about how it\u2019s kind of hard to show work around campus,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWhile I was at the gallery, my coworkers told me that it\u2019s actually not as hard as you think to start a curatorial practice. If you have a show, there\u2019s always someone that wants to show their work.\u201d\n\nTo have their art showcased by the Roski school galleries, students must be art and design majors, work with a full-time faculty mentor and file an application that includes a written component and samples of their work. After submitting this application, students will be \u201cselected through a competitive process\u201d and \u201cawarded an exhibition based on the merits of their proposal as well as the strength of their past work,\u201d according to the Roski website.\n\nThis selectivity extends to the world outside of USC as well, which can be discouraging for any students or new artists who don\u2019t know how to break into the industry, according to Zhang.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get into art shows without having clout or having connections already,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cYou have to be a certain level of popularity or have a certain level of people knowing your name in order for you to get recognition.\u201d\n\nAt \u201cQuiet,\u201d which was named after the introverted nature of the curators, every single student who applied will have their work shown. On Friday, roughly 15 to 20 students will be able to get their work into the world without having to jump through any of these hoops.\n\nMarissa Ding, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, is one of the artists whose work will be showcased at the event. She says her photography focuses on the pressures to assimilate in white American culture.\n\n\u201cI wanted to submit because I haven\u2019t had my work exhibited in any sort of exhibition before,\u201d Ding said. \u201cI really was intrigued by just the general atmosphere [of \u2018Quiet\u2019].\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s welcoming environment attracted more applicants than Kim or Zhang ever expected, they said, and because of this the artists\u2019 work will now be split into two shows, with \u201cQuiet Spring\u201d set for sometime after winter break.\n\n\u201cThis fall show is going to be more traditional. There\u2019s a lot more paintings and photos. And then the spring show is a lot more technology based, so there\u2019s more video pieces and installations,\u201d Kim said.\n\n\u201cQuiet\u201d will be held from 6-8 p.m. in the School of Cinematic Arts Gallery Friday.

(Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)\n\nBy Lyla Bhalla-Ladd, Ben Cohen and Jack Hallinan\nNovember 16, 2022 at 5:56 pm PST\n\nAfter a 9-1 start to the college football season, USC has a lot riding on Saturday\u2019s match-up against crosstown rival UCLA, and USC students are itching for revenge after last year\u2019s drubbing at home by the Bruins. With USC\u2019s Pac-12 and College Football Playoff hopes on the line, the stakes are high as the Trojans march into the Rose Bowl seeking their 50th all-time win against the Bruins.\n\nFor Evie Kay, a graduate student studying engineering, winning means atoning for last year\u2019s 62-33 loss and bringing back the Victory Bell, the trophy awarded each season to the football champion of Los Angeles. \u201cWe take a lot of pride in having the Bell at USC, so we\u2019re all pretty stoked to get out to UCLA and start the Lincoln Riley era by getting that bell back,\u201d Kay said.\n\nKay feels a different vibe from this year\u2019s Trojans compared to 2021\u2032s team. \u201cI think even as an onlooker looking at the sidelines and how the football team interacts, there\u2019s a lot more spirit and just camaraderie within all the players,\u201d she said.\n\nUSC goes into its last two regular season games \u2014 at UCLA and home to Notre Dame \u2014 with an outside shot at making the playoffs. The analytics-driven fivethirtyeight.com gives the Trojans a 17% chance of being chosen for a spot in the CFP. But if they can win both games and win the Pac-12 championship game, their odds increase to 82%.\n\nBut UCLA, fresh off a heartbreaking home loss to a 4-6 Arizona team that ended its playoff hopes, will be looking to spoil the party. Well-known L.A. Times columnist Bill Plaschke predicted UCLA to win this weekend, comparing this year\u2019s matchup to that of 2006, when the Bruins upset the Trojans and eliminated them from playoff contention.\n\nDespite the high stakes, Derek Balsamini, a junior psychology major and service director for the Trojan Knights, said he doesn\u2019t feel any added pressure on the Trojans to beat their crosstown rivals this year. \u201cI think the pressure comes with this game every year,\u201d he said. \u201cUSC and UCLA is the rivalry of the West Coast and debatably the biggest rivalry in all of college football.\u201d\n\nBalsamini did acknowledge the heightened implications resting on this matchup. If USC loses, they will most likely be eliminated entirely from playoff contention. \u201cI think there\u2019s higher expectations for sure. This team is definitely much better than our team last year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think this is definitely a team that has a chance to either win the Pac-12 [or] go to the College Football Playoff and those things definitely depend on the game coming up on Saturday.\u201d\n\nThe 2022 edition of this rivalry bout comes with an added wrinkle: a marquee quarterback duel between Caleb Williams and Dorian Thompson-Robinson. Both Williams and Thompson-Robinson have made cases to be in the Heisman trophy conversation, the award for college football\u2019s best player.\n\nWilliams, a sophomore, transferred to USC ahead of this season, having played under Reilly last year at Oklahoma. Thompson-Robinson is in his fifth season at UCLA, where he\u2019s played 46 games for the Bruins and recently became their all-time leader in touchdown passes.\n\nIn October, Plaschke devoted a column to making the case for Thompson-Robinson as L.A.\u2019s best quarterback. Jared Park, a freshman business major, strongly disagreed with Plaschke\u2019s assertion. \u201cThat\u2019s a garbage take,\u201d Park said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing statistically that Dorian Thompson-Robinson did better than Caleb Williams this season. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d\n\nBrandon Arana, a junior cinema and media studies major who is also a Trojan Knight, said he couldn\u2019t disagree with Plaschke more \u201cboth as a USC fan and ... as a football fan in general.\u201d \u201cObviously, Caleb\u2019s got my back,\u201d Arana said. \u201cI\u2019m a Trojan for life. But I think, just statistically too, [Thompson-Robinson] is more mobile than Caleb, but I feel he\u2019s not nearly as accurate as Caleb. He\u2019s thrown more interceptions in the season.\u201d\n\nThompson-Robinson has thrown four interceptions to Williams\u2019 two.\n\nUSC will also be fighting off the injury bug this weekend after star running back Travis Dye suffered a season-ending injury to his left leg in last week\u2019s game against Colorado. Dye\u2019s loss could hamper USC\u2019s offense, but Park said he isn\u2019t too worried. \u201c[We] have a lot of good running backs, so hopefully it doesn\u2019t make that much of a difference,\u201d Park said.\n\nUSC\u2019s second string running back Austin Jones posted 113 yards against Colorado in Dye\u2019s absence.\n\nThe game will kick off at 5 p.m. at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and will be televised on Fox. As of Wednesday afternoon, ESPN\u2019s projections give the Trojans a 60.2% chance of winning, declaring USC 2.5-point favorites.\n\nEven more than winning, USC students said they want their bragging rights back. When asked for any final thoughts ahead of the game, Arana pointed to the pile of shirts the Trojan Knights were selling next to him. In yellow cursive letters, they read \u201cFUCLA.\u201d\n```"}

That\u2019s Jacqueline Chen, one of the Co-Presidents of Trojan Shelter. She\u2019s collecting food for students living at the shelter.\n\nChen: I think the 2020 well-being collective that USC did said that 17% of college students experience housing insecurity at some point in their college career, which is around like one in five people that you meet around college, which is clearly an incredible issue.\n\nChen says this year alone, Trojan Shelter received over 50 applications. Beyond their physical location, Trojan Shelter also offers resources for students experiencing housing insecurity. Natasha Koneru, one of the directors of resources, believes this to be a critical element of Trojan Shelter.\n\nShe recalls an experience she had with a student staying at the shelter. Koneru: Thing\u2019s just felt really difficult for him, and he just felt really behind compared to his peers. In that moment, like, I just really wanted to provide him like any reassurance that I could and let him know that like he\u2019s going through, like homelessness while he\u2019s in college and he\u2019s still, like trying to make better for himself. And like, that alone is something that he should be really, really proud of.\n\nLast year, Koneru started out with the program as a volunteer. But her passion for their mission quickly grew, along with her involvement. Koneru: It\u2019s just very sad for me to think about students who are like in the same position as you and I, who are really just trying to get an education better their lives. It\u2019s just really sad for me to like think about them not having access to food and like not having access to shelter and like just not having access to the things that they need to succeed as students.\n\nWhile most USC students are planning to head home for the holidays, head of fundraising, Lauren Tham, plans on staying in town to help out with this initiative. Tham: So the food today is going right to the shelter. I\u2019m going to take it there right after we\u2019re done. And then on Thanksgiving we\u2019ll cook it all up and whatever extras we have will roll over into the next weeks and probably Thanksgiving food for two weeks straight, hopefully if people are feeling giving.\n\nWhile the holidays are a busy time for Trojan Shelter, it\u2019s not the only opportunity for students to lend a hand. Koneru, Chen and Tham all agree that advocating for more affordable housing is essential to addressing this issue. Tham: The most rewarding part is seeing how me being there makes their life ten times easier and getting to know these people and hearing their stories and, you know, making friends and realizing they\u2019re just like me.\n```"}

So far, COP27 has been focused on reviewing the promises made by various countries during the 2021 Climate Glasgow Pact as well as the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nDr. Shannon Gibson, associate professor of environmental studies at USC, has been following COP27 closely, and has illustrated that these meetings are focusing on reigniting these previous promises and calculating global progress in the fight against climate change.

Relaying the story to Annenberg Media, his description aligns with that of Villanueva\u2019s. Pabich: \"She told me one guy, she said there was blood, but she couldn\u2019t tell what was happening. But she said the bottom of his leg. And I thought, I go, \u2018his foot was amputated.\u2019 Somehow this car tire or somehow just...hit this guy and ripped into him and messed up his foot.\"\n\nThe accident has sent shock waves throughout the community of Whittier. Residents, like Ali Hernandez, were shaken up by the incident. She said if the accident occurred an hour later, students at nearby Howard J. McKibben Elementary School, where she works, could have crossed paths with the driver. The school canceled classes for the day following the accident.\n\nHernandez: \"It was a very heartbreaking, very sad, devastating, especially for the sheriffs who are training to become sheriffs. It was just it\u2019s heartbreaking because I have family members who are sheriffs. So knowing what they went through, it\u2019s it\u2019s terrible.\"\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department adds that the 22-year-old driver of the vehicle was detained, but the cause of the accident is still unknown. However, investigators say his initial behavior suggests that he could have been under the influence.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Grace Galante.\n```"}

Five-star point guard Isaiah Collier delivered the news about joining the Trojans on Wednesday morning on Instagram live with ESPN. He chose USC over a final list that included national powerhouses Cincinnati, Michigan and UCLA. This news comes just one day after Juju Watkins, the nation\u2019s number one women\u2019s basketball recruit, committed to USC as well.\n\nCollier told ESPN a huge reason for deciding on USC was the family atmosphere he felt with the coaching staff and head coach Andy Enfield. Collier makes for the most recent in a steady parade of top prospects to cycle through under Enfield. what makes Collier different, though, is that unlike recent names like Evan Mobley and Onyeka Okongwu, he plays point guard.\n\nRob Parker, co-host of Fox Sports\u2019 \u201cThe Odd Couple,\u201d and Professor of Journalism at USC, says there\u2019s really no negative way of looking at this. Rob Parker: Another banner day for USC to be able to get the number one college recruit to be a Trojan. I mean, Andy Enfield should be thrilled to be able to land this guy and they could change your program whenever you get the top player in the country to wear your uniform. So USC, another big day, the day before they got the number one female recruit and now the number one male recruit.\n\nCollier joins Watkins, along with two other five star athletes -- football recruits Malachi Nelson and Zachariah Branch.

Caroline Finnerty, a sophomore majoring in intelligence and cyber operations, was also able to secure tickets but expressed her shock at the skyrocketing resell prices.\n\n\u201cWe got nosebleed tickets for $140 each, and later that day, they were reselling for $1,400,\u201d Finnerty said.\n\nTicketmaster reportedly crashed 30 minutes before the sale began. During the sale, there were issues with crashing, and people having to wait in a queue for their turn. The West Coast sale was originally intended to begin at 10 a.m. but was pushed back to 3 p.m. to manage the surge in traffic on the website.\n\nGarg knew people who waited seven hours for tickets. \u201cTicketmaster knew how much traffic they would be expecting for the pre-sales. It just seems irresponsible,\u201d Garg said.\n\nAu Chung was a not-so-lucky fan and told Annenberg Media about their frustration about an intense six-hour experience attempting to purchase presale tickets.\n\n\u201cIt was getting so stressful I went outside with my laptop and credit card,\u201d Chung said. \u201cPeople wanted to buy tickets as fast but the queue was so backed up because pre-sale codes weren\u2019t working, credit cards weren\u2019t working and nothing was working.\u201d\n\nChung does not have tickets but is staying updated with Taylor Swift Twitter fan accounts on rumors about when she will release more tour dates.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time blaming Taylor since this is her first tour with her new management, Republic Records,\u201d Chung said. In 2019 Taylor Swift was in a custody battle with her former management company Big Machine Records over the rights to her music, Chung explained.\n\nFreshman Lilah Pate was also unsuccessful with pre-sale tickets but is looking forward to the regular ticket sale. She said she plans to \u201cbite the bullet and eventually spend way more money than I should have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting tickets,\u201d Pate said. \u201cThat\u2019s a no brainer.\u201d Pate said several of her friends missed class in order to get tickets, and they blame Ticketmaster for the mishaps.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone blames Taylor Swift,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is Swift\u2019s first tour in four years.

Many have had issues with Ticketmaster\u2019s \u201cVerified Fan\u201d status, which is used to get pre-sale tickets. It began in 2017 as an attempt to prevent scalpers and bots from buying out the tour with the purpose of reselling.\n\nThe program requires users to enter personal information before they can purchase tickets. Then, they will find out if they are a \u201cVerified Fan\u201d or waitlisted. This is now standard for major artists.\n\nChung also noted the members of Congress who were tweeting about Ticketmaster\u2019s 2010 merger with Live Nation, which many national lawmakers said makes the ticket company a monopoly in the entertainment industry.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, \u201cDaily reminder that Ticketmaster is a monopoly, it\u2019s merger with Live Nation should never have been approved, and they need to be reigned in.

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza November 16, 2022 at 1:42 pm PST\n\nThe storylines for Saturday\u2019s Crosstown Showdown against the Bruins are endless. A win gets the Trojans a Pac-12 title berth and keeps them in the hunt for the College Football Playoff. A win would ensure that USC exacts revenge on a UCLA team who handily beat them 62-33 last year. Also, Saturday\u2019s game marks many of the players\u2019 and coaches\u2019 first times being involved with the USC-UCLA rivalry. On top of all of that, the Trojans must deal with the loss of injured redshirt senior running back Travis Dye, as well as re-incorporating some of their most impactful players who have been recently injured, including sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams and sophomore inside linebacker Eric Gentry.\n\nPutting all of that aside, this is UCLA vs. USC \u2014 one of the most storied rivalries in the history of college football. These games always have some added weight behind them, regardless of the teams\u2019 circumstances. After the team\u2019s practice on Tuesday morning though, head coach Lincoln Riley expressed that he\u2019s focused on what the guys can do on the field and not so much on the extra noise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything too specific,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve acknowledged that it\u2019s going to feel different, there\u2019s a lot of history behind it ... but past that, I think we\u2019re really zeroed in on what we believe will help us play well. That\u2019s where our focus is gonna be.\u201d\n\nPlaying well is the key to putting all the other worries to rest. It\u2019s also the key to coming away with a win, something that last year\u2019s team was unable to do. In order to exorcise those demons, the Trojans must limit UCLA redshirt senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson\u2019s production. As former coach of the Oklahoma Sooners, Riley has played Thompson-Robinson twice before.\n\n\u201cHe was impressive from the jump,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good player, you can tell he had some real ability. I could tell from the second year when we came out to the Rose Bowl. You can tell that he really improved, and it looks like he\u2019s just continued on that trajectory. He\u2019s had a phenomenal year.\u201d\n\nSenior inside linebacker Shane Lee believes that the key to slowing down Thompson-Robinson is being quick to him and being quick to react.\n\n\u201cEverybody just needs to do their job and play fast,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIssues come on when you\u2019re slow to react to things, and you get that first couple steps on you. So just trying to react fast and play downhill.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what the defense can do to silence Thompson-Robinson on the field, sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock said, \u201cHe\u2019s real comfortable back there. We\u2019ve got to put some pressure on him. He\u2019s been in the program a long time. It\u2019s a really talented pass game and receiving core.\u201d\n\nFor a Trojans team that has struggled at containing mobile quarterbacks this year, Saturday\u2019s game will be a much-needed opportunity for defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s defense to step up. One guy who could give the defense a much-needed boost against Thompson-Robinson is Gentry. The inside linebacker has been out since the October 15 loss at Utah.\n\nWhen asked what he would need to do to get on the field for Saturday, Riley was clear.\n\n\u201cThat he\u2019s healthy enough to get out there and function,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThat he understands the plan and the way we want to attack. There\u2019s competitive guys he\u2019s competing with for reps. It\u2019s a reset every week.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be great to have him back,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHis style of play is huge for us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on more long-term goals, Riley was very clear that his staff has had talks with the guys about what could come with a win on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re aware,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked repeatedly, just understand there\u2019s a great opportunity there. They\u2019re in a phenomenal position. If you keep improving, keep giving yourself chances to win ball games, there\u2019s gonna be more opportunities and more things riding on them. We\u2019re right where we\u2019re expected to be. Now the focus is gonna be going in and taking advantage of it.\u201d\n\nNobody needs to tell Riley\u2019s team just how impactful this game can be for the future of the program. But there is no doubt in junior wide receiver Jordan Addison\u2019s mind that the Trojans are up to the task.\n\n\u201cYou just gotta realize that it\u2019s bigger than you,\u201d Addison said. \u201cEverybody is ready for this one. The energy is different, and I can tell from yesterday when we walked in the building \u2014 it\u2019s go-time.\u201d\n```"}

It doesn\u2019t even dare to show the face of the actor playing Weinstein \u2013 we hear his voice, but that\u2019s about it. The focus of the new drama is instead on the journalists who broke the story and the survivors who came forward with stories of their own.\n\n\u201cTo all of us, the story was not about Weinstein,\u201d said Rebecca Lenkiewicz, the film\u2019s screenwriter, on the red carpet of the Los Angeles premiere earlier this month. \u201cHe has had enough airtime, he\u2019s done enough damage. It was about giving space and voice to the women involved from the start.\u201d\n\nJodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times investigative reporters who unearthed decades of abuse, dozens of allegations and multiple settlements between Weinstein and his accusers, are portrayed by Zoe Kazan and Carey Mulligan, respectively. The film\u2019s story is based on the book of the same name that Kantor and Twohey wrote about their experiences during the reporting process.\n\nKantor and Twohey\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning work, which was published in a series of articles beginning on October 5, 2017, is often credited for helping to galvanize the #MeToo movement and spearheading worldwide discussions about harassment in the workplace.\n\nThe film, which opens in theaters Friday, follows classic newsroom procedurals in the sense that a lot of what the main characters do is send emails, make cold calls and even show up at the homes of potential interview subjects. \u201cShe Said\u201d expands beyond other films that explore journalism, such as \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and \u201cSpotlight,\u201d by giving space to the portrayals of real-life Weinstein survivors.\n\nKantor and Twohey listen to the harrowing stories of the survivors they interview throughout the movie, but there are no depictions of assault. Director Maria Schrader guides the audience through the characters\u2019 retelling of their abuse to Kantor and Twohey with intentionally dark shots of long hotel hallways, half-eaten room service and suites in complete disarray. The result is a chilling vision that underpins the fear and dread of the women they interviewed.\n\nThis choice is refreshing. It moves away from predecessors like \u201cBombshell,\u201d which featured disturbing dramatizations of Roger Ailes\u2019 sexual assault of women in the Fox News workplace. The scenes of assault in \u201cBombshell\u201d are purposeful \u2013 you\u2019re supposed to squirm in your seat and see Ailes as a monster. But viewers don\u2019t need to see a dramatization of a heinous act to understand that it is heinous.\n\nIn the most haunting sequence of \u201cShe Said,\u201d Schrader uses Weinstein\u2019s real voice in a recording of him coercing model and actor Ambra Battilana Gutierrez to come into his hotel room. The recording comes from a 2015 New York Police Department sting operation where Gutierrez wore a wire following her allegations of Weinstein inappropriately touching her during a casting meeting. Gutierrez filed a police report, and the recording prompted the NYPD to investigate, but Weinstein was never charged.\n\nWe hear Gutierrez\u2019s voice asking Weinstein to let her go and telling him \u201cno\u201d in as many different ways as she can, and we hear his incessant coercion and pleading, but we only see the long and ominous hallways of the Tribeca Grand Hotel. It\u2019s gut-wrenching.\n\nAt the film\u2019s L.A. premiere earlier this month, many of the women involved in making the film shared that they too were survivors of harassment and abuse. That cemented the decision to keep the spotlight on the women and avoid gratuitous reenactments of assault.\n\nActor Sarah Ann Masse, who plays reporter Emily Steel, is also a Weinstein survivor. She was one of the first women to come forward with her story publicly in 2017, and at the film\u2019s premiere, she said she \u201cnever questioned\u201d that she wanted to be a part of \u201cShe Said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thrilled to know that this film was being made, and I was hopeful that they would be inclusive of survivors in the process,\u201d Masse said. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with my own career retaliation. Things have been difficult in the past few years, so to get this opportunity to be in this film was an obvious \u2018yes\u2019 for me. Yes, there were complicated emotions that go along with this part of my life, but I\u2019ve always loved the saying \u2018turn your broken heart into art.\u2019\u201d\n\nActor Angela Yeoh also spoke about how her experiences informed her performance. She said after she left an abusive relationship, she saw girls in public and thought, \u201cI don\u2019t want you ever to grow up feeling like you should put up with the abusive dynamics that countless women before you have put up with.\u201d\n\nYeoh plays Rowena Chiu, a Weinstein survivor who will testify in his ongoing L.A. trial that began in October. Chiu, who was also at the premiere, weighed in on the #MeToo movement\u2019s legacy five years later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that while this did start off as a film-industry story, it has blossomed and mushroomed beyond that,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cToxicity in the tech industry, on Wall Street and in corporate America in general were exposed, so I think that shows that it\u2019s a much more universal theme beyond just film and just Hollywood. Arguably, maybe the worst excesses were in Hollywood, but those excesses certainly spilled over to other industries.\u201d\n\nIn a post-screening Q&A moderated by Dean Baquet, the former executive editor of the New York Times, he asked the panel of actors and filmmakers if someone like Weinstein could exist so openly in Hollywood today. Veteran actor Patricia Clarkson, who portrays New York Times editor Rebecca Corbett, didn\u2019t miss a beat.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe Said\u201d opens in theaters nationwide starting November 18.\n```"}

(Photo by Gabby Rudy)\n\nBy Grace Harrington, Patrick Warren and Jason Lopez Lopez\nNovember 16, 2022 at 10:26 am PST\n\nWhy did you choose to become an editor? \nI was an editor of my other school paper before I got here and I really liked it. And I just wanted to get more experience even though we are teaching other people how to [write]. You also learn a lot by being an editor.\n\nWhy be a USC editor specifically? \nSomething that I really like about school papers in general is the sense of community. And I\u2019m not confident that we will get that once we graduate. So it\u2019s like, now is a time to try it and do it because USC is always such a small community. It gives me a big sense of belonging.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of being a USC editor? \nI really liked the pitch meeting because I really like the flow of story potential. It\u2019s entertaining. You get an idea of what your day is gonna look like. I really like telling stories. So in a way, it\u2019s like people are telling stories to me.\n\nHow do you recognize what is or is not a good article? \nI think everyone\u2019s gonna have different expectations for an article. To me, the main question is, does it solve a problem or does it [answer] a question? Does it tell you something that you don\u2019t already know?\n\nHow do you edit an article without removing the original author\u2019s voice? \nI actually don\u2019t really think that I do a lot of rewriting. I think I definitely move sentences around. But it shouldn\u2019t change the voice. It should just change the clarity of it.\n\nWhat are you hoping to do after school? \nMy dream job is to be an international correspondent. So I\u2019m really interested in covering Mexico and Latin America or just the global south in general. Right now my actual plan is to have a fellowship next year, and I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m going to grad school. I\u2019m interested in doing a master\u2019s in comparative politics or like something that covers the global south, or maybe I\u2019ll do something like communications. But right now, politics, something in political science is my number one option.\n\nWhat can Annenberg Media do to better engage the surrounding community? \nI think the content part of [Annenberg Media] is great. The community engagement is not great. Like right now someone was asking, where can I watch ATVN? I feel like most people don\u2019t really know that we\u2019re here. So I think we can have like a little bit more publicity on that part.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who is looking to become an editor? \nI think number one would be, don\u2019t get stuck into one beat. Although having a beat is important and having a passion for one thing is very important, I do think that if you want to be an editor, if you want to help others to get journalism, you need to have a more broad set of experiences. And also just really understanding that different people come from different backgrounds and they\u2019re going to have different needs.\n```"}

An accomplished home cook and baker, she kept her recipes on 3x5 index cards, and encouraged Sydney to create her own.\n\nAfter her grandmother\u2019s passing in 2011, Sydney kept her cards and pulled them out to make her recipes when she longed to bake with her grandmother. Last month, Sydney\u2019s mother, Rosanne Karmes, recreated the sour cream orange coffee cake. The warm smells instantly returned Sydney to her childhood\u2014one that was filled with Wednesday night dinners of salmon and steamed vegetables, baking rainbow cupcakes and birthday parties at Chef\u2019s Incorporated, a hands-on cooking school. Karmes sent little Sydney to cooking classes there, and she learned knife skills and how to make chicken schnitzel before she was even old enough to stay home alone.\n\nKarmes, who had inherited her mother\u2019s trouble-free approach to mealtime, wanted to instill good eating habits in her young daughter and refused to let her eat anything from the kids\u2019 menu. During dinner, she and Sydney compared \u201cnotes\u201d about the flavors and textures of their meals. Sydney would continue to explore her love for food with cooking birthday parties at Chef\u2019s Inc. and homemade pizza making parties.\n\nThe culinary joy Sydney once felt faded in college. In 2016, her first year at UC Santa Barbara, Sydney joined the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. The pressures of maintaining a certain aesthetic from social media, diet culture and the other sorority girls made it difficult for Sydney to maintain a positive body image, leading her to develop unhealthy relationships with food and exercise. Sydney slowly began to make changes to her eating habits to fit what the other girls were doing. If other girls in the sorority house cut their bananas and only ate half, so did Sydney. Within her first few months of living in the sorority house, her love of food had vanished.\n\n\u201cI remember being so engulfed with food and thinking about it 24/7 that I couldn\u2019t even be present in a conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what someone was saying. I was acting like I was listening, but I wasn\u2019t listening.\u201d Sydney began to restrict foods and over-exercise in order to fit what others deemed healthy, instead of what worked for her and her body. \u201cI actually became less confident as my body got smaller. Nothing would ever satisfy me. No number on the scale or ideal body type \u2014 I was so self-critical that it didn\u2019t even matter,\u201d Sydney said.\n\nSydney developed an unhealthy relationship with eating \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cclean,\u201d and in the process lost her period due to significant weight loss. When Sydney was a junior, she planned to study in France for a semester in 2018. She was concerned about how she would manage her \u201cclean eating\u201d in a country where buttery croissants and cream sauces are a way of life, so she packed special nut butters and healthy snacks in her suitcase. But once she arrived in Bordeaux, Sydney\u2019s memories of her grandmother \u2013 and of her enjoyment of meals \u2013 snapped back into focus.\n\nAs she explored her new city, each day she made bolder food choices, exploring hidden restaurants and markets. During her first few weeks there, she found comfort in French markets. In her apartment overlooking \u201cLe Quai des Marques,\u201d she started to prepare new recipes with fresh ingredients she bought each day at vegetable, fish and cheese markets. She also ventured out into Bordeaux to find interesting restaurants, where she would snap photos of her meals. Before long, she began to document her restaurant meals and cooking adventures in a food blog on Instagram.\n\n\u201c[The blog was] a way to rediscover my love for cooking again from that childhood experience of just pure joy for food without all those rules,\u201d Sydney said, adding that many of her meals incorporated her \u201cfear\u201d foods like dairy, gluten and meat. \u201cNow I realize it\u2019s just food. Nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Her blog, \u201cFrench Squirrel,\u201d is an homage to her French grandmother, who could not pronounce the word squirrel, something she and Sydney would joke about as a child.\n\nThe grip food had on Sydney\u2019s body and mind began to release with every blog post. \u201cFrench Squirrel\u201d became a visual journal where she could document what foods she was eating, and in what quantities. As she continued to share her recipes and meals, French Squirrel gained a large community of followers on Instagram. One fan-favorite recipe was for her protein bites made from nut butter and covered in 100 percent dark chocolate. She would bring these bites into her office fridge to share with colleagues, and they encouraged her to turn them into a business.\n\nThe influence of her French grandmother, and her experience of the country, paved the way for the development of \u201cFrench Squirrel Co.\u201d Her products, \u201cBerets\u201d(which were her original protein bites) and \u201cBateaux\u201d (nut butter stuffed dates) follow the French styles of cooking through their use of minimal and recognizable ingredients. \u201cWe don\u2019t have grams of protein on the front of the package or all these numbers that Americans tend to focus on,\u201d Sydney said. \u201cWith French Squirrel, it\u2019s really about the quality of the ingredients and the simplicity of them.\u201d\n\nSydney has also incorporated the French style of eating into her lifestyle. \u201cI\u2019m not saying to eat cake every single day, but one slice of cake, how the French do it, is not going to kill you,\u201d Sydney said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve learned that the stress over whether or not you should eat something is actually more detrimental to your health than actually eating that thing.\u201d Following her recovery, Sydney was inspired to help other women and she became certified as a Hormone Specialist for the Nutritional Coaching Institute. She specializes in blood sugar management, which her \u201cFrench Squirrel\u201d products aid, and works privately with women to improve their health through the use of nutrition and exercise.\n\nAs she looks back at her blog posts during her early days of recovery, she is able to compare her portion sizes and how much more strict she was with food than she is today. \u201cFrench Squirrel\u201d became a visual journal that shows the progression of healing her relationship with food. As she reflects on her recovery, Sydney has come to realize her unhealthy relationship with food was less about the food, and more about her relationship with herself. Making sure she was truly happy with herself beyond appearance, she said, was the most important part of her recovery.\n\nSydney has found ways to improve her relationship with herself, through activities like yoga and dance. \u201cIf you\u2019re friends with me, you know I can dance at any moment, any time of the day. I think more people need to dance and just let loose,\u201d Sydney said. She also loves yoga because it serves as her \u201cmoving mediation,\u201d allowing her to heal her mind and relationship with exercise. As a result of healing her relationship with herself, her relationship with her friends and family has significantly improved.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a really good friend and supporter\u201d her best friend, Michelle said. Sydney never says, \u201c\u2018Oh are you eating this? Are you not eating that?\u2019 There\u2019s never any sort of judgment and she\u2019ll always encourage us to eat whatever we feel like eating. So I\u2019m really grateful to have a friend like her.\u201d\n\nSydney uses her social media platform to help girls around the world who struggle with disordered eating and body image issues. She openly discusses her journey of restricting foods and losing her period to show other girls they are not alone. Her current posts show her body posed vs. not posed, healthy post-recovery weight gain and sharing the ongoing struggle of healing your relationship with your body, food and exercise. She shows women that there is so much more to life than being \u201cthin,\u201d and all the amazing friendships and experiences one can cultivate after developing a healthy relationship with food.\n\n\u201cYour relationship with food is forever,\u201d Sydney said. \u201cSo you have to really honor and nourish it and make sure that it\u2019s healthy because you eat three times a day, plus more, snacks and dessert, every single day for the rest of your life. And so you better make sure it\u2019s a healthy one, as best as it can be.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Carly Rieger)\n\nBy Will Camardella\nNovember 16, 2022 at 8:54 am PST\n\nAbout five minutes into the second half on Tuesday night, the USC men\u2019s basketball team appeared to be in dire straits. The Trojans offense had a very poor first half, and early in the second, it looked like more of the same as the Vermont Catamounts built an eight point lead. However, as the game progressed, the offensive floodgates finally opened up just enough for USC to earn a 59-57 comeback win at Galen Center.\n\nAbsolutely nothing was falling for the Trojans in the opening frame; sophomore guard Reese Dixon-Waters, who was 3-for-6 from the field in the first half, was the only Trojan with over two shot attempts to hit at least 50% from the floor. The rest of the team shot a combined 4-for-21 in the first 20 minutes. While USC\u2019s 22 first half points were the fewest it had scored in a half this season, Vermont was not much better. The Catamounts struggled in particular with the three point shot, shooting 1-for-9, and could not take advantage of many of the long scoring droughts the Trojans experienced.\n\nFor instance, when USC missed seven of its first eight shots from the field, Vermont made just two of its first nine. The Catamounts were just slightly more effective than the Trojans, entering halftime with a five point lead. The end of the first half leading into the start of the second was when USC struggled the most as a team, a stretch where the Trojans shot 1-for-17 in over thirteen minutes.\n\nThe end of that stretch is when the team finally came alive. Led by fifth year guard Drew Peterson, USC ripped off a 8-0 run to tie the game midway through the second. Peterson\u2019s shots that had not been falling early on finally began to drop, as he scored 15 of his team-leading 20 points in the final 14 minutes. Peterson thrived from mid-range in the second half, using his length to counter tight defense and get to the basket. Peterson had seven shot attempts in each half, making just one in the first and five in the second.\n\n\u201cI thought Drew played very controlled,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said after the game. \u201cHe made the right decisions, made the right plays. He had eight assists and no turnovers, and in the first game, he had six turnovers. That was a big difference, that was six extra possessions that we had tonight just from him. Also he was able to score the ball.\u201d\n\nSenior guard Boogie Ellis also stepped up his game in a critical way. After a two point first half performance, the senior guard reached double-figures in the second despite falling into foul trouble and knocked down big shots. With 1:20 left, Ellis caught a cross-court pass from Peterson at the wing and promptly nailed a three pointer that doubled the USC lead to six points, its largest of the entire game.\n\nThe Trojans scored 15 more points in the second half than in the first, improving their shooting from the floor by over 20%, from 25.9% to 46.2%.\n\n\u201cAll credit to my teammates,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWe had Boogie hit the biggest shot of the game on the three I kicked to him. We have guys ready to shoot. There\u2019s trust across the board, I know we\u2019re shooting poor right now, but we have a team that can shoot the ball. We showed that at the end, and we\u2019re gonna keep working.\u201d\n\nVermont relied on its seven three-pointers to keep up with the Trojans in the second half. Fifth year guard Finn Sullivan\u2019s three with 52 seconds left brought the game right back to one possession after Ellis\u2019 shot. USC could not cash in on its next offensive possession despite grabbing two offensive boards, and Vermont got the ball back with the shot clock off and a chance to tie the game.\n\nHowever, an awkward three point shot by Sullivan failed with seven seconds to go, and sophomore guard Kobe Johnson made two key free throws to put the game away. Despite shooting under 65% percent on their free throws in their first two contests, free throw shooting was one of the Trojans\u2019 biggest strengths tonight. The team made 18-of-23 from the line, and in such a tight game, all those points mattered.\n\n\u201cOur free throw shooting was outstanding,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cFirst of all, we got to the line a lot. I thought we were aggressive, especially in the second half where we were able to drive the ball, get fouled, and put pressure on the defense. Then, we were able to make them when they counted.\u201d\n\nDespite the frustrating offensive output at times, USC was still able to grind out the victory in its first game of the year decided by single digits.\n\n\u201cI see this as a net positive,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe can learn from this, we can build on it, and we need to get better. We have a young team where guys are trying to find their roles. ... Now, it\u2019s an adjustment period for our players. ... We\u2019re patient with them and very encouraging with them, so hopefully, we\u2019ll build on this win and get better.\n\nThe Trojans improve to 2-1 with the win. They will wrap up their four game home stand Friday night against the Mount St. Mary\u2019s Mountaineers.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Nolan Ezzet\nNovember 16, 2022 at 8:20 am PST\n\nUSC remains undefeated after taking down San Diego 58-50 at Jenny Craig Pavilion on Tuesday in a game dominated by inside scoring. The Trojans and Toreros both entered this game with a perfect 2-0 record, but both teams looked sloppy offensively in the first quarter. With 6:10 remaining in the quarter, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko laid the ball in to give the Trojans a low-scoring 6-0 lead. The Trojans couldn\u2019t hold on to their lead and let the Toreros go on a 9-0 run through the next five minutes. The quarter ended with San Diego holding on to a 9-8 lead, by far the lowest-scoring first quarter for both teams this season.\n\nThe Trojans shot 3-for-11 (27.3%) from the field in the first quarter, and the Toreros shot 3-for-13 (23.1%). Free throws were also a struggle, as USC shot 2-for-4 (50%) from the charity stripe. San Diego didn\u2019t look much better, shooting 3-for-5 (60%). Turnovers were also responsible for the lack of scoring: The Trojans had four, and the Toreros had seven.\n\nThe second quarter started similar to the first, with San Diego scoring the only two points of the first two-and-a-half minutes. However, the Torero offense eventually clicked, as two layups followed by three free throws gave San Diego an 18-12 lead, good for a 9-4 run through five-and-a-half minutes. But the Trojan offense fought back, and an and-one by sophomore guard Rayah Marshall tied the game at 18-18 and gave the Trojans much-needed momentum. The Trojans ended up reaching a 23-20 lead as they went on an 11-2 run in just two minutes.\n\n\u201cAs the game went on, I think we were adjusting to [the flow],\u201d graduate guard Destiny Littleton said.\n\nWith just over two minutes remaining in the quarter, the two offenses kept responding to one another, forcing three lead-changes in the last 1:12. The quarter ended with San Diego\u2019s redshirt senior guard Kiera Oakry nailing an off-balance mid-range jumper as the shot clock expired, giving the Toreros a 26-25 lead.\n\nBoth offenses improved in the second quarter, as the Trojans shot 6-for-15 (40%) while the Toreros shot 6-for-16 (37.5%). Both teams evenly scored 17 points in the period with 10 in the paint.\n\nThe third quarter was a similar story as the second but with more efficient offense and a tighter game. The Trojans scored 16 points on 8-of-14 shooting, and the Toreros trailed narrowly, scoring 14 points on 7-of-14 shooting. Each of the first seven baskets made resulted in lead changes. But two buckets in a row from Sissoko gave USC enough momentum to keep the lead for the remaining 5:19 in the quarter.\n\nDespite coming off a stellar 3-point performance in which USC made 14-35 (40%) shots from beyond the arc against Idaho State, the Trojans did not attempt anything beyond 3-point line in the third quarter. By the end of the game, USC only took five shots from downtown and made two.\n\n\u201c[USD] didn\u2019t allow us to shoot threes,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cSo we relied on our post a lot this game.\u201d\n\nThe fourth quarter remained tight, and it was tied 44-44 with eight minutes remaining. Poor offenses led to two straight minutes of a scoring drought, but a Littleton layup and two free throws from junior guard Kayla Williams gave USC a 48-44 lead and tipped the momentum in favor of the Trojans. The Toreros kept it close for the next few minutes, but a Sissoko layup followed by a steal from graduate guard Okako Adika that led to a Littleton layup extended the Trojans\u2019 lead to seven with 2:30 remaining. USC\u2019s defense stepped up and only gave up two points during the remainder of the quarter.\n\nBy the end of the game, the Trojans were clearly the better offensive team, shooting 22-of-51 (43.1%) from the field, compared to USD\u2019s 21-of-59 (35.6%). What kept the Toreros in the game so long was their 19 offensive rebounds, more than double of USC\u2019s nine. Ultimately, Sissoko proved to be too dominant for the defensive-oriented Torero team. Sissoko shot 9-of-13 (69.2%) and racked up 19 points, her season-high.\n\nThe Trojans will try to stay undefeated as they travel to San Francisco to face USF Saturday. They then fly back home to play six straight at Galen Center, with the final of the six being against crosstown rival UCLA.\n```"}

At the age of two years old, McCurdy\u2019s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, requiring chemotherapy treatments and bone marrow transplants, she said.\n\nAccording to McCurdy, as a means to cover the financial expenses of cancer treatment, Debra pushed her daughter into acting at the young age of six years old. McCurdy stated in an interview with People Magazine as well as in her book that her mother emotionally and sexually abused her and forced her into a child acting career because she herself wanted to be a performer.\n\n\u201cHer parents actually wouldn\u2019t let her,\u201d McCurdy said. \u201cSo, she put me in acting and put all her dreams and expectations of everything that entailed on me.\u201d\n\nHer mother was so obsessed with the idea of McCurdy being a child star that she enforced calorie restrictions on her diet at the age of 11, which she said in the book, led to anorexia and bulimia. McCurdy also said that her mother would routinely conduct vaginal and breast exams on her and never let her shower alone.\n\nThese experiences led her to embark on a journey of self-discovery through therapy and enabled her to come to terms with her past, write her book and find her purpose in her \u201cvalues,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cStarting out in acting when I was so little, I definitely wasn\u2019t prepared to handle the rejection and didn\u2019t know how to navigate it,\u201d McCurdy said. \u201cI think by nature of being a kid, the thought is \u2018What\u2019s wrong with me? What did I do wrong?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many things beyond your control, but my mom definitely didn\u2019t really help with validating that,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also reflected on the evolution of her use of humor as a defense mechanism to a coping mechanism. First using humor to add a sense of levity to her otherwise \u201cheavy\u201d life, McCurdy found herself to be overcompensating through comedy, she said.\n\n\u201cI did a press tour before the book came out, and this came up quite often, [people would ask me], \u2018Do you hate your mom?\u2019 And it\u2019s the furthest thing from that,\u201d McCurdy recalled. \u201cI loved my mom too much. I was enmeshed with her. I lived for her.\u201d\n\nAfter her mom died in September 2013, McCurdy found herself questioning her identity and having to work through the codependency that they shared, she said. This resulted in her break from acting to then venture into writing.\n\nFollowing the speaker event, students expressed how powerful it felt to hear McCurdy be so open and honest about her trauma and therapy.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to hear how she worked through these difficulties in her life,\u201d said Austin Colcord, a junior American popular culture and law, history and culture double major. \u201cWith writing this book and giving these talks, she overcame these obstacles by writing about it and sharing how she went through it.\u201d\n\nDanielle Davidson, a junior business major, appreciated that McCurdy\u2019s discussion mentioned the positives of therapy.\n\n\u201cIt seems like she\u2019s grown a lot, and she\u2019s talking about therapy, so I hope that therapy has helped her,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cIt seems like it has.\u201d\n```"}

I hoped he would just stop.\u201d\n\nIn his speech at Mar-a-Lago, Trump favorably recounted his term as president, during which he claimed to have prepared America for its \u201cgolden age.\u201d \u201c[Two years ago], our nation was at the pinnacle of power, prosperity and prestige,\u201d Trump said to a crowd of his supporters. \u201cEverybody was thriving like never before. There was never a time like this.\u201d\n\nSome USC students, however, remembered Trump\u2019s term as president much differently, specifically the state that Trump left the country in. Freshman Ian Keim recalled with horror the January 6 riot at Capitol Hill among Trump followers seeking to overturn his 2020 election defeat. \u201cThat was pretty horrible and left a really bad taste for a lot of people in this country\u2019s mouth,\u201d Keim said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be really interesting to see if people are willing to get over that and how much that affected his popularity for people.\u201d\n\nTrump attacked current President Joe Biden often in his speech, calling him the \u201cface of left-wing failure and Washington corruption.\u201d \u201cFor millions of Americans, the past two years under Joe Biden have been a time of pain, anxiety and despair,\u201d Trump said. \u201cUnder Biden and the radical Democrats, America has been mocked, derided and brought to its knees like never before.\u201d\n\nDespite their reservations on Trump\u2019s impending run for president, students were not surprised by the announcement. \u201cI was expecting Donald Trump to keep going until he kicked the bucket, so to speak,\u201d said Marjan Alagheband, a freshman communication major. \u201cJust with the political divide today and people\u2019s anger, I think there are chances he could win.\u201d\n\nFor some students like Alagheband, the thought that Trump could generate support from that anger is more than a little unsettling. \u201cIt\u2019s a little terrifying, to be honest,\u201d Alagheband said. \u201cI feel like all the people who were really upset with him losing the election, the people who raided the Capitol, of course, and the people surrounding that group of people, are going to be really upset. They\u2019re going to come back with that same energy.\u201d\n\nHowever, several students had doubts about Trump\u2019s chances in the race. \u201cI know both political parties are very polarized, and the right, they have got the radical side, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough to actually get him back in the office,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI feel like people are just so done with Trump, I just can\u2019t imagine that Trump would win again.\u201d\n\nBefore Trump takes on the general election, he will first have to make it out of the Republican primaries, where he faces a potential challenge from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who recently won big in his midterm re-election campaign.\n```"}

Shah gave political commentary on the Arizona Senate race for Annenberg\u2019s election special.\n\nConsidering states such as Arizona take longer than others to count up all the votes, Shah says this gives politicians like Lake more of a reason to question the results of elections.\n\nShah: I think the fact that Arizona takes a lot of time to vote, that usually gives a lot of people ammo and to a lot of time to to count the votes that they usually creates issues with people saying that the mail-in ballots are fraud or the count is fraud, which is obviously not true. But I can\u2019t say I\u2019m too surprised\n\nAlthough the results of the election were encouraging for many, Shah says it is still worrisome that there are candidates running that continually deny election results. Given that Lake has a precedent for election denialism, this wouldn\u2019t be something that she is amateur to.\n\nShah: Kari, like her main thing, even coming in to the governor\u2019s race, seemed to be that she was very pro-Trump and very against the 2020 election. So I think it\u2019s unfortunate, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too surprising.\n\nDespite candidates like Lake who continue to deny election results, Shah believes the results of the midterm elections as a whole demonstrate that the US is ready to move on from the 2020 election. Citing the unpopularity of candidates who support such asinine suggestions in their campaigns\n\nShah: Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. I mean, if you look at it, every Republican governor who denied every Republican nominee for governor, who denied the results of the 2012 election, lost their governor\u2019s race this cycle. So it\u2019s it I think it definitely did play a role, I think, especially in Arizona.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Spencer Cline\n```"}

This comes after the news that Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains are seeking to pass a referendum that would overturn AB 257, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law on Labor Day.\n\nAB 257, also known as the \u201cFast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act,\u201d gives more than half of a million low-wage fast food workers the power to raise the industry-wide minimum wage to up to $22 per hour. Moreover, the bill creates a statewide fast food council to set standards across the industry that improve working conditions that will work with individual franchises to ensure safety, health and compliance within stores.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s fast food workers are more than twice as likely to live in poverty compared to other workers in the state. Additionally, nearly 80% of California\u2019s fast food workers are people of color and about two-thirds are women.\n\nThe Fast Food Industry Coalition deems AB 257 to be a threat to restaurant business. The group hopes to block the law until it can be presented before California voters. According to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cThe coalition is in the process of collecting enough signatures by the December 4 deadline to get the referendum on the November 2024 ballot.\u201d\n\nAt noon Tuesday in front of a Starbucks on North Figueroa Street, workers made it clear that they were not on board with these initiatives. David Green, a social worker at Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, addressed workers at the protest. He made it clear that fast food workers deserve dignity and respect.\n\n\u201cCorporate greed got in the way. Starbucks got in the way. McDonald\u2019s got in the way. Carl\u2019s Junior got in the way. Guess why? Because they want you to live in poverty. But it\u2019s worse than that, folks,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey want to take away your voice.\u201d\n\nGreen said that corporations prioritize their bank accounts rather than helping their employees. \u201cThe goal is that all these workers, whether they\u2019re a gig worker or a fast food worker, [earn] a living wage, be able to raise your family with dignity, respect, child care, health care,\u201d Green said. \u201cA lot of these workers are one paycheck away from poverty. We want to lift them up.\u201d\n\nLike many assembled at the event, Anneisha Williams, a Jack in the Box worker and in-home care provider, has concerns about the bill being overturned. \u201cWhy be unfair to people that are busting their butts to make your corporation, your foundation better?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe deserve better as well. You know, some of us have health conditions. Some of us have several children. Some of us are dealing with eviction. Rent has gone up.\u201d\n\nWilliams said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up. We\u2019re going to continue to stand thick in numbers, because we deserve better and we\u2019re trying to show you that we deserve better.\u201d\n\nIn order to appear on the November 2024 ballot in California, referendum supporters such as the fast-food corporations need 623,000 voter signatures by December 4.\n```"}

Striking outside of a Starbucks, against a new attempt by the fast-food industry to kill a new pro-worker state law. Clemence Feniou has the story\n\nOn September 5, Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law the Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act a.k.a AB 257. The act establishes a ten member fast food council, that would be empowered to set a dignified wage as high as $22 an hour, better and safe working conditions for fast-food workers. But the billion dollars corporations are not willing to agree this easily.\n\nThe industry need to collect about 623,000 signatures by the first week of December to launch the referendum on the November 2024 ballot. A situation that would suspend the law and deprive workers of higher wages. Miguel Santiago, a Los Angeles assemblymember calls the corporations to respect the law.\n\nMiguel Santiago: All we\u2019re saying is we passed the law, adhere to the law that\u2019s passed. We have a council, that council is supposed to set foot and begin that work, and corporations are refusing to come to the table and corporations should not come to the ballot when they don\u2019t like the outcome of what\u2019s happening in legislature.\n\nIf the referendum qualifies, workers can expect Burger King, KFC, McDonald\u2019s to spend gigantic amounts of money to overturn the law. In defense, fast-food workers, are looking into unionizing the workers in every one of these companies as Felipe Casares, a coordinator at SEIU Local 721 explained.\n\nFelipe Casares:So we\u2019re hoping to make sure that companies like Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, Burger King understand that when they put millions into anti-worker ordinances, that the workers are gonna rise up, labor is gonna rise up, in demand that workers have a voice and a seat at the table just like AB 257 says. Just that Starbucks, Burger King, McDonald\u2019s better count their days because we\u2019re coming for them with the workers and we\u2019re going to a get a union for every worker in their company.\n\nThe organizations at the strike, whether it is Fight for $15, SEIU 721, SBWorkers United or California Gig Workers Union, are ready to multiply the strikes and actions to prevent corporations from killing AB 257, another pro-worker law.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Clemence Feniou\n```"}

The announcement contained both expected and unexpected nominees, fantastic new breakout artists like Omar Apollo and Latto, and even some new categories.\n\nOf course, longtime music legend and worldwide superstar Beyonc\u00e9 led the pack with nine nominations, eight of which are for her recently released album, Renaissance. This ties her for the record of most Grammy nominations with her husband, rapper Jay-Z.\n\nAll eyes will be on the Album of the Year category as Adele and Beyonc\u00e9 show down just as they did in 2017, when Adele\u2019s album 25 beat Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade. Adele herself was nominated seven times, including for her album 30.\n\nHarry Styles fans will be happy to know that the former One Direction band member was nominated six times. His album Harry\u2019s House, which he\u2019s on tour performing right now, was nominated for Album of the Year.\n\nMary J.

Kendrick Lamar scored eight.\n\nAlong with the announcement of the nominees came the reveal of five new Grammy Awards categories. The new categories are Songwriter of the Year (Non-Classical), Best Alternative Music Performance, Best Americana Performance, Best Score Soundtrack For Video Games And Other Interactive Media, and Best Spoken Word Poetry Album. There will also be a new special merit award under the category of Best Song For Social Change.\n\nTaylor Somerville, a music industry major in the USC Thornton School of Music, had some thoughts on the new categories and what their impact will be.\n\nSomerville: I think those are really good categories. I heard about the video game soundtrack one. I think that\u2019s really cool because I think it\u2019s a video game Valorant that has become really popular because of the really intense music that they use in their soundtracks. So I think that that\u2019s really cool. And the Americana category. I do appreciate Americana for sure, because it kind of integrates blues and country and R&B and folk music. So I think we really cool to see what comes out of that.\n\nSomerville had some additional thoughts about the new special merit award, the best song for social change. She thinks the award will inspire artists to create music relevant to current social changes.\n\nSomerville: I\u2019m really excited to see what songs are going to be like nominated for that category because I know, for example, a very popular like political change song is \u201cThis Is America\u201d by Childish Gambino? And that\u2019s always so impactful, especially here in the United States and everything that\u2019s going on here with Black Lives Matter. I\u2019m really excited to see what creative minds come into, like, songwriting. To see kind of like what they can come up with that\u2019s relevant to what\u2019s happening today, if that makes sense.\n\nSomerville also said that these new categories will be important to artists.\n\nSomerville: Just to get the recognition that they need. A lot of artists don\u2019t feel that they fit into the really strict Grammy categories. I think a really positive thing to come out of this, as in many artists could branch out so they can get a Grammy in a different category or just like kind of explore their genre and not stay in the same thing.\n\nThe 65th Grammy Awards show will take place on Feb. 5th, 2023 at Crypto.com Arena here in Los Angeles.\n\nFor Annenberg Radio News, I\u2019m Maddy Brown\n```"}

Logano\u2019s first win of the 2022 season took place at the Coliseum in February, making his return a full circle moment.\n\nWhile in L.A., Logano visited the Boys and Girls Club of Venice, a club that provides over 4,000 kids with support and character development experiences. During his visit, Logano signed autographs and answered some of the kids\u2019 questions.\n\n\u201cThe questions were far more deep than I thought they would be. Usually with kids, \u2018how fast does the car go? How much horsepower do you have?\u2019\u201d Logano said. \u201cIt was really deep questions about our sport or about life and how things were. So it was really neat to see, you know, these young kids that are very smart and into it and really cared about their future.\u201d\n\nLogano has been racing professionally since 2007, when he was just 17-years-old. Now at 32, he has three kids and a wife. His two boys are often pictured right next to him after a race, running up to congratulate him. Following his most recent win in Phoenix, Arizona, Logano celebrated on the track with his eldest son Hudson, who was right by his side waving a checkered flag.\n\nAlong with being a family man, Logano is the founder and chairman of the Joey Logano Foundation. The foundation was founded in 2013 when Logano was 19-years-old and aims to offer \u201cchildren and young adults with a second chance during crisis.\u201d The mission of the foundation mirrors Logano\u2019s love for working with children.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m way better at interacting with kids now that I have kids. I wasn\u2019t around kids much before that,\u201d Logano said. \u201cSo it\u2019s funny, once you have kids you just love kids. I just love hanging out with them.\u201d\n\nThree years prior to founding the Joey Logano foundation, Logano was inspired by Gavin Grubbs, a 6-year-old with muscular dystrophy who used his Make-A-Wish to meet Logano in 2010. Instantly becoming friends, Grubbs ended up being a groomsman in Logano\u2019s wedding and their friendship still holds to this day.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be treated any different than anybody else,\u201d Logano told NBC Sports. \u201cUnfortunately, people do. With us, he doesn\u2019t get treated any different, I promise you that. We give him a hell of a time. He wants that, right?\u201d\n\nUp next on Logano\u2019s circuit is more quality time with friends and family as the NASCAR season doesn\u2019t resume until the new year. Logano will return to the Coliseum on February 5, 2023 to defend his title at the Busch Light Classic.\n\n\u201cI would never have thought at the end of the year I would be back here,\u201d said Logano. \u201cYou can never call life, you never know what\u2019s coming around the corner and you need to enjoy it.\u201d\n```"}

But what exactly did they discuss? The two superpowers found common ground over a host of global issues. Jeremy Kole has the story.\n\nAt the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, world leaders gathered to tackle global issues like climate change, inflation, rising food prices, and the Russian war. G20 serves as an intergovernmental forum for 19 countries and the European Union, accounting for nearly 2\u20443 of the world\u2019s population, 85% of the global economic output, and 75% of world trade.\n\nNotably, communication lines are back open between the US & China after President Joe Biden met with President Xi Jinping for the first time since Biden took office in 2021. The two leaders met face-to-face to work through various ongoing issues. The communication between the two global superpowers hit an all-time low in August after Nancy Pelosi\u2019s unwanted visit to Taiwan provoked China to cancel dialogue with the US across many areas.\n\nThe historic meeting lasted nearly three hours, and Biden feels confident about the future. Joe Biden: It was clear. He was clear and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights, and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners.\n\nPresident Xi was straightforward, telling Biden that China has no intention to challenge the US and that the world is big enough for both countries to coexist and prosper. China does not want to interfere in the internal affairs of the US nor change the international order. However, the one-China policy acknowledging that Taiwan is still a part of China is an ongoing issue of disagreement.\n\nBiden made it clear that the US\u2019s policy in Taiwan has not changed, but fears of a Cold War have been quelled. Joe Biden: I absolutely believe there need not be a new Cold War. I\u2019ve met many times with Xi Jinping, and we were candid and clear with one another across the board. And I do not think there is any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.\n\nOn the Russo-Ukrainian War, President Xi expressed that China is highly concerned for Ukraine and has always stood on the side of peace. Interestingly, only the White House readout of the meeting said that both Presidents oppose the use or threat of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\nIn the end, Biden and Xi importantly agreed to maintain strategic communications. Both leaders will empower key senior officials to sustain communication and deepen constructive efforts on macroeconomic policies, trade, debt relief, health security, and global food security.\n\nStill, the US and China will continue to shape the future for hegemony and economic power, but Biden doesn\u2019t mind. Joe Biden: We\u2019re going to compete vigorously, but I\u2019m not looking for conflict. I\u2019m looking to manage this competition responsibly.\n\nAfter months of tension and uncertainty, the US and China are back on the right track.\n```"}

But the Compton Cowboys were there also, an incongruous group of Black cowboys and cowgirls at this historic race track located in Arcadia \u2014 a suburb of L.A. mostly populated by Latinos and Asian Americans.\n\nRandy Savvy grew up riding horses as a part of his aunt\u2019s Compton Junior Posse, a non-profit program created to prevent youth from joining gangs. When his aunt retired, Savvy rebranded the Compton Junior Posse as the Compton Junior Equestrians and founded the Compton Cowboys. His goal was to follow his family\u2019s mission to provide Compton youth with horseback riding, positive role models and mentorship as an alternative path to gangs and crime. The Compton Cowboys\u2019 motto is \u201cstreets raised us, horses saved us.\u201d\n\nSavvy was first introduced to attendees on the track that day alongside other members of the Cowboys \u2014 hats raised, riding their horses past the reviewing stands twice for several rounds of applause. Next, Savvy was ringside at the Cowboys\u2019 Junior Equestrians English show jumping demonstration, a different discipline than western style riding. During the event, an announcer narrated how teen female riders were inspired by equestrian activities to reach their life goals, as they rode through the course\u2019s jumps.\n\nThe focus of Race Day Takeover moved next to the Santa Anita Park infield where a DJ played Shania Twain\u2019s \u201cMan! I Feel Like A Woman\u201d to a gathering throng. A diverse crowd of Black, white and Latino beer drinking attendees dressed in traditional and custom designed western wear set the mood for entertainment around Savvy\u2019s trademarked stage. To the left of the stage a variety of vendors sold vintage leather fringed jackets, cowboy hats, western and Native American-themed jewelry and bolo ties. Food trucks on the other side of the stage completed the circle of wagons effect.\n\nSavvy\u2019s stage introduced the gathering audience to artists Tanner Adell and Willy Jones, each with their own brand of Black country music. It was dusk as Savvy hit the stage, with his \u201cstreet country\u201d sound inspired by West Coast rap and country music. The Black country performers featured at this event are a small sample of a large wave of artists at the forefront of this music genre. Many of them have joined a group called Black Opry, which showcases Black country music talent all over the U.S. Black Opry Revue performed at the Troubadour in L.A. on Nov. 5, showcasing five Black country music artists from the 200+ who have contacted the organization about performing with its revue.\n\nThe Santa Anita Race Day Takeover was also a preview of the Cowboys\u2019 performance at Stagecoach \u2013 billed as California\u2019s Country Music Festival, April 28-30, 2023, at Indio\u2019s Empire Polo Club.

Gottlieb has now secured two top-10 recruits with the Trojans, after No. 8 overall recruit point guard Aaliyah Gayles joined the program this season.

Significant youth and criminal justice gains have been made in the past decade and could change depending on the election outcome.\n\nLACAN President Pete White and movement builder Tiffany Loftin hyped up the crowd by reminding them of their collective power, saying that four people in a room cannot erase decades of coalition building, referencing the leaked recording of L.A. City Council members and a union leader making racist comments about the Black community.\n\nThe lineup was a blend of live musical performances, poetry and speeches, with the ultimate goal to inspire collective action and change. A diverse lineup included DJ Linda Nuves and DJ Sleepwalk of Chulita Vinyl Club setting the event in motion, followed by the poetry of Danielle Harris. El Compa Negro, a corrido singer from Compton accompanied by a 15-person banda, got the small, but growing audience dancing. Pam\u00e9, a Dominican singer with a flair for mixing palo and merengue styles from her homeland with other modern sounds, performed as the crowd vibed to her set.\n\nJason Chu is a Chinese American rapper who speaks on identity, healing with a lyrical flow. In an interview, Chu said, \u201cIt\u2019s so meaningful to be performing at Schools Not Prisons today because the school-to-prison pipeline is wild. We need real solutions rather than just carceral solutions.\u201d\n\nThe Austin-based group, The Tiarras, performed for the first time in Los Angeles. The group, which consists of three sisters, sang their original song, \u201cSoy Chingona,\u2019\u2019 an anthem for all badass women. It was followed by a rendition of a popular song by the Mexican band Caifanes, \u201cNegra Tomasa.\u201d The L.A.-based rapper Reverie pulled the audience in with her wit and powerful lyrics. The British-American rapper IDK, which stands for \u201cIgnorantly Delivering Knowledge,\u201d closed out the show by sharing his own experience of having been incarcerated.\n\nThe immersive experience was not limited solely to musical performances, free food and Instagram-worthy photos. The educational and social impact component was prevalent throughout this carefully curated and intentional event. Throughout the event space there were posters with striking statistics displayed against green, aesthetic shrubs. One poster read, \u201c6 Million Students are in schools with police but no school psychologists.\u201d\n\nThe intention behind the music festival was clearly stated in a quote by abolitionist Assata Shakur \u2014 \u201cWe Have Nothing To Lose But Our Chains.\u201d It was reproduced throughout the venue in bold, block letters, a reminder to anyone participating or just passing through.\n\nNearby was an interactive replica of a prison cell, presented and curated by Barrio Unidos of Santa Cruz. This traveling installation has all the markings of a real cell: a bunk with a flimsy mattress, a metal toilet and sink, Cup Noodles stashed in the corner, and a door with fluorescent orange bars. Barrio Unidos Executive Director Daniel \u201cNane\u201d Alejandrez closed the bar door behind me so I could get a feel for the tight living quarters. I immediately noticed my rapid breathing. I exhaled, attempting to calm my nervous system. Even the sounds of a prison cell are included; a roaring echo of inmates yelling \u201cbuenas noches\u201d filled this true-to-scale replica.\n\nAlejandrez created this replica so that families could experience what their incarcerated loved ones are dealing with. \u201cFamilies see the courtroom and the visiting room, but they don\u2019t see what\u2019s behind the wall,\u201d Alejandrez said. He maintained this project is not a \u201cScared Straight thing.\u201d He wants to equip families with the knowledge and empathy needed to welcome their relatives back home after being incarcerated.\n\nOn the outside of the replica read the message, \u201cJobs Not Jails.\u201d The ethos of the event was grounded in this prison cell replica: People deserve investment. Schools, counseling and communities should be supported instead of the prison system.\n```"}

The three-hour meeting addressed the Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in Taiwan and the U.S.\u2019 sanctions on China. The leaders met face-to-face for the first time at a crucial point in world politics, after both men strengthened their political positions at home, according to analysts. China has been under pressure from the United States since Trump imposed economic sanctions on the country in 2018 which limited the country\u2019s growing economy. China\u2019s refusal to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine heightened international tensions last year.\n\n\u201cTrump identified China as the number one international threat,\u201d Douglas Becker, USC associate teaching professor of political science and international relations, said. \u201cBiden\u2019s policy has generally been fairly supportive of Trump\u2019s...But, if Biden was at all interested in trying to shift the U.S.\u2019 relationship with Russia, he would realize that he needed China\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nAccording to Becker, China\u2019s economic power has been growing and will continue to rival the U.S.\u2019 into the next decade. This, combined with the combatting political ideologies of the two nations, has created a historical conflict between China and the U.S. Both leaders expressed an \u201copenness to restoring channels of communication\u201d and repairing the relationship that has been compared to a second Cold War.\n\nBiden said that the conversation between the two leaders was \u201cvery blunt.\u201d According to Jinping\u2019s spokesperson, the Chinese leader viewed the meeting as \u201cin-depth, candid and constructive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that there was a meeting between the two leaders,\u201d Thomas Chow, a senior communication major and editor of U.S. China Today, said. \u201cAlthough there are a lot of disagreements, it doesn\u2019t seem like Biden is as hardline on China as Trump was.\u201d\n\nAccording to a White House statement, the leaders agreed that a nuclear war \u201cshould never be fought and cannot be won,\u201d underscoring their opposition to the use or threat of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOne of the motivations of this meeting is for Biden to quietly suggest to Xi that China could reevaluate the growing trade relations with Russia,\u201d Becker said.\n\nThe leaders also discussed the recent increase in military tension in the Taiwan Strait. Despite media speculation about Beijing\u2019s intentions to invade the island, Biden said there was no imminent attempt to do so on the part of China.\n\n\u201cDo I believe he\u2019s willing to compromise on certain issues? Yes,\u201d Biden told reporters afterward about the meeting. \u201cWe were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Becker, this meeting could be the start of what could be a change the country needs to watch, as Biden\u2019s number one foreign policy goal is to \u201cdefeat\u201d Russia and Ukraine through these strategic interactions.\n\n\u201cHe was clear, and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to compete vigorously, but I\u2019m not looking for conflict.\u201d \n```"}

But it didn\u2019t go as expected.\n\nOregon defensive back Bryan Addison (13) breaks up a pass intended for Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) during the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 12, 2022, in Eugene, Ore. (AP Photo/Andy Nelson)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade November 14, 2022 at 7:24 pm PST\n\nWith just over a minute and a half left in the game, Oregon had to make a decision. The game was tied at 34 and the Ducks were facing a fourth-and-1 at their own 33-yard line. The options were clear: Either punt the football and give Washington junior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. over a minute to get the Huskies into field goal range or go for it on the short fourth down to continue the drive.\n\nThe Ducks made their choice, but there\u2019s some context missing here. Oregon\u2019s stellar senior quarterback Bo Nix was out on the drive after suffering an apparent leg injury on the previous drive. The Ducks ran it three times on the current drive to set up the fourth-and-1 \u2014 another obvious running attempt if Oregon attempted to convert.\n\nThe Ducks did attempt that conversion, and had it not been for sophomore running back Noah Whittington slipping in the backfield, the Ducks would have gotten the first down. Washington scored a field goal on the next drive and secured the upset win in Eugene.\n\nIt drew a heap of scrutiny, but that decision to go for it on fourth down was the right call. It\u2019s one of those plays where the coaches look like geniuses if they convert and look like complete fools if they come up short. But it\u2019s a risk well worth taking.\n\nSome will say Oregon should have punted and trusted its defense. That\u2019s a good rule to follow for most games, but what defense did the Ducks have to trust? Washington averaged 5.2 yards per rush attempt and 11.7 yards per passing attempt. On the drive immediately before, the Huskies drove 65 yards in 47 seconds. If Washington got the football anywhere on the field, the Huskies were going to score one way or another.\n\nOregon\u2019s offense should have been just as certain to drive down the field \u2014 or at the very least gain one yard. Without Nix in the lineup, the passing game was less of a factor, but the Ducks averaged 6.1 yards per rush. You have to trust that running game and the best offensive line in the Pac-12 to break through.\n\nAnd, to be very clear, Whittington would have broken through. There\u2019s one key component that no one appears to be talking about that definitely went into Oregon\u2019s decision to attempt the fourth down conversion: the Ducks\u2019 loss of Nix. Nix returned on the following possession, but there were no signs he would return. If he\u2019s out for the remainder of the game and it goes to overtime, Penix and the Huskies would annihilate the Ducks.\n\nComing out of high school, Oregon backup redshirt freshman quarterback Ty Thompson was expected to be the future star quarterback for a program that has had several over the years. But the coaches\u2019 decision to have Thompson hand off the ball on all four plays of the drive shows they don\u2019t trust Thompson with making plays in the spotlight. If they don\u2019t trust him with over a minute left in regulation, you\u2019re not going to want to trust him to get the job done in overtime.\n\nPlenty of teams go for 2-point conversions late in games to take the lead when the other team is clearly better. This was Oregon\u2019s version of that \u2014 without Nix, the Huskies are clearly better. If you need any more convincing, ESPN\u2019s Bill Connelly has the box score labeled here. Washington averaged 9.2 yards per play \u2014 giving that offense the ball is giving the game away.\n\nWASHINGTON 37, OREGON 34\n\nI'm sorry, but of COURSE you go for it on fourth-and-1. A very, very easy call. pic.twitter.com/1GQutOsMVL \u2014 Bill Connelly (@ESPN_BillC) November 14, 2022\n\nGo for it or not, the result is likely the same either way. At least going for it keeps the ball in the hands of the side of the ball that has been reliable all season. If only Whittington kept his footing.\n\n\u201cCollege Football Roundup\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

As details still surface about the tragic deaths of four students from the University of Idaho on Sunday, the UVA community has begun the process of mourning and seeking justice. Both schools have canceled class on Monday. UVA also canceled class on Tuesday.\n\nIn the Virginia shooting, Christopher Darnell Jones Jr. is facing three charges of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony. Police said that around 10:30 p.m. Jones Jr. opened fire on a bus in an on-campus parking garage. The bus was returning from a field trip in Washington, D.C. The football players killed are linebacker D\u2019Sean Perry and wide receivers Lavel Davis Jr. and Devin Chandler.\n\nJones Jr., who was listed as a running back for the football team during the 2018-2019 season, faced an administrative disciplinary action for allegedly failing to report a February 2021 criminal incident involving a concealed weapon violation, and was allegedly hazed while on the football team.\n\n\u201cI am holding the victims, their families, and all members of the University of Virginia community in my heart today, and we will make plans to come together as a community to grieve as soon as the suspect is apprehended,\u201d University of Virginia President Jim Ryan tweeted early Monday morning.\n\nRyan Conn, a junior at UVA, described what happened Sunday night and how students reacted. \u201cWe got a \u2018shots fired\u2019 alert at around 10:30 last night, followed by a hail of police alerts telling us all to shelter in place as the shooter had not been detained,\u201d Conn said. \u201cNaturally, rumors started swirling like crazy, but it was pretty clear multiple people had been hurt or injured based off of what could be heard on a police scanner, and a lot of people became very scared.\u201d\n\nFrom 2,500 miles away, USC students also felt the impact of the Virginia shooting. Desta Sahle, a sophomore biology major from Arlington, Virginia, was distraught about the tragedy. \u201cI was really scared when I first heard about the shooting,\u201d Sahle said. \u201cHalf the people from my hometown go to UVA, so I was immediately thinking about them.\u201d Sahle wasn\u2019t able to contact any of her UVA friends until Monday morning, adding that it \u201cshakes the whole state.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing from Virginia, you kind of grew up on UVA or Virginia Tech,\u201d Sahle said. \u201cEveryone has friends or family at these schools, so to hear something like this and know that it directly impacts so many of the people you know and love is really hard even from across the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, this is the fifth shooting on or near a Virginia college campus since February. In Virginia, residents and non-residents alike can carry a concealed firearm with either a Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP), or a permit issued by their home state. Virginia CHPs are issued to anyone above the age of 21-years-old. CHP holders are required to complete a state-approved firearms training course and demonstrate competence with the firearm. However, no permit or registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual \u2013 provided the buyer and seller are both Virginia residents.\n\nIn states like California, all gun purchases go through a state licensed gun dealer, and the buyer has to make an application to the licensed dealer. According to the Giffords Law Center, states with stricter gun laws see a lower gun death rate. California, with stricter gun laws than most other states, has a 37% lower gun death rate than the national average, with 8.5 gun deaths per 100,000 people compared to the national average of 13.7. California\u2019s gun death rate among children is 58% lower than the national average and marks the lowest in the country.\n\nMiles Stoddart, USC electrical and computer engineering major, shared his thoughts on the threat of shootings at USC, saying, \u201cThe campus is extremely contained, you know, gates all around, and it feels like a different world from what\u2019s around.\u201d A recent survey, which polled 1,000 Gen Z Americans, ages 13 through 25, showed that gun violence is the issue they\u2019re most concerned about. Though Stoddart feels safe on campus, he also believes that we should reconsider the Second Amendment. \u201cI think we need to put all guns on hold, open our eyes a little bit, and realize that this is really f-ed up and take some time to figure it out.\u201d\n\nCorrection: In the previous version of this story, Miles Stoddart was spelled as Miles Stoddard.

{"key": "/2022/11/14/classes-put-on-hold-after-48000-uc-academic-workers-strike-for-better-pay/", "response": "```\nForty-eight thousand academic workers went on strike across 10 University of California (UC) campuses Monday morning demanding adequate pay. The demonstrators included teaching assistants, tutors and other students employed by the UC system. According to UC workers, protesters are demanding a more respectful work environment, childcare subsidies and public transit passes. The largest issue, however, comes down to wages. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), which represents UC graduate students, has demanded base salaries of $54,000, nearly double their current average pay of $24,000. UAW is one of the largest and most diverse unions in North America, with members in virtually every sector of the economy.\n\nIn response to recent protests, UC has offered a salary increase of 7% during the first year, and 3% every consecutive year, but workers are not satisfied with their proposal. \u201cThere are people living in student housing who are paying 70% of their income right back to the employer,\u201d said Sam Hunter, a Ph.D. student and teaching assistant at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \u201cBetter learning conditions will allow us to spend more time working with our students, without being worried about whether we\u2019re going to be able to pay rent next month or put food on the table tonight.\u201d\n\nUCLA workers began picketing around the Broad Art Center and Buche Hall at 8 a.m., where undergraduate and graduate students chanted, \u201cWhat do we want? Fair contracts. When do we want them? Now.\u201d The protests halted classes on campus, as professors, researchers and TAs refused to teach courses until their demands were met. \u201cIf you walk around this campus today, it feels very eerie. There\u2019s not a lot of people here, so we\u2019ve effectively stopped a U.S. university from functioning...that means a lot,\u201d Dylan Dornfeld, a teaching assistant at UCLA, said. \u201cThis shows what collective power can do, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on out here.\u201d\n\nStudents at other UCs are experiencing similar effects of the protests. UC Berkeley students, like microbiology major Sabrina Hammond, have seen their discussion sections and office hours canceled. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been avoiding campus in solidarity, so we haven\u2019t been using the libraries or academic buildings as much as possible, except when absolutely necessary to go to classes,\u201d Hammond said.\n\nAccording to Glassdoor, a website where employees can anonymously report their salaries, TAs at USC are paid around $37,000 per year \u2013 nearly 60% more than the typical UC salary. Even with an increase in rent and inflation, UCs have failed to expand their financial compensation for their employees. Although USC\u2019s average TA salary exceeds the UC\u2019s, USC has seen protests held by employees demanding better pay. Last year, custodial workers together with USC\u2019s Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation (SCALE) fought for a better contract, asking for fairer wages and benefits for their labor. There was no significant change from the custodians\u2019 protests \u2013 yet, many UC workers are willing to strike until their employers meet their demands.\n\n\u201cA lot of people come to the UC for a great education, and we are the ones that deliver it,\u201d Emma Gudmundson, a student employee at UCLA, said. \u201cI believe that we\u2019re not only fighting for the working conditions of our grad students and postdocs, we\u2019re fighting for the learning conditions of our students as well.\u201d \n```"}

Among this week's many traditions are the efforts to protect the statues of Tommy Trojan and Hecuba from potential vandalism. The Trojan Knights and USC Helenes are two campus organizations centered around school spirit and community service. This week they take on the responsibility of protecting the statues.\n\nHere\u2019s Natalia Osuna with the story. Amid the cold and the stress of upcoming final projects and exams, a group of high-spirited Trojan Knights and Helenes sit and guard the duct-taped Tommy Trojan and bubble-wrapped Hecuba statues 24/7 throughout this conquest week. Sitting in a circle under a tent with sleeping bags, the Knights take shifts to ensure that the statue is always guarded by someone who will remain alert, even through all hours of the night.\n\nWill Chambers is a senior philosophy, politics, and law major, and a member of the Trojan Knights. \"As official hosts of the University and Guardians of Tradition, this is one of our longstanding traditions we have to defend against the the the nasty folks from the campus across town. We have to make sure that all of our traditions, all of our landmarks, all of the things that we hold dear are defended against. And so really, it\u2019s a pleasure for us to engage in this every year. It\u2019s a pleasure for us. It\u2019s a duty that that everyone really rises to.\"\n\nIn the village, yellow caution tape surrounds the statue of Hecuba as members of the USC Helenes gather around, doing homework, chatting and sharing snacks. Elsie Bencke is a freshman studying philosophy, politics, and economics. She joined the Helenes this semester and today was proudly protecting the statue of Hecuba from the rivals, from the adversaries. \"From the Bruins. In case any Bruins want to come and try to deface our statue. We protect her.\"\n\nWith around 80 members in the Helenes, there are always people protecting the statue. \"It\u2019s kind of just like people like to be here, and you don\u2019t have to, but we usually have more than five people here at once just because we enjoy hanging out.\"\n\nMeanwhile back on campus, students and visitors passed by Hahn Plaza, taking pictures of the bizarre scene as the Knights guard Tommy Trojan, eating tater tots for breakfast. \"One of the nice things is we\u2019re fortunate enough to have a variety of different organizations provide food and other resources to us, whether they\u2019re parent groups, whether they\u2019re USC dining, shout out to EVK for breakfast this morning, whether it\u2019s athletics and football coming out and supporting us.\"\n\nThe Conquest Week traditions come after a month of planning. The Helenes reserved and paid for their spot and got free food from restaurants in the Village. As a service and spirit organization, the Helenes give as much as they receive. Emilee Leveque is a USC junior and the director of public relations for the Helenes. In addition to protecting Hecuba, they\u2019re running a food drive and a clothing pop-up. Proceeds will benefit the unhoused population of South L.A. \"We\u2019re setting up a bin today and going to label it so people are just free to drop off food whenever and then our clothing pop up is going to be on Wednesday. We\u2019re going to be opening it up to anybody in the village or free to come by.\"\n\nThe Trojan Knights and Helenes also receive a lot of support from the university, whose Facilities Planning and Management staff are responsible for wrapping the statues. Will Chambers of the Trojan Knights says they have a good relationship with the university. \"We\u2019ve been doing this now for literal decades. The university knows that they expected from us, helps us out by wrapping up the statues on campus and then we don\u2019t have permits issued. The university just understands that it\u2019s what we do and they\u2019re happy to let us do it.\"\n\nShruthi Benkatachalam sits in the shade of Hecuba studying for an upcoming exam. She\u2019s a junior who joined Helenes last fall and expresses gratitude for the campus security measures when it comes time to spend the night in the village. \"Usually the staff, like the CSC and DPS in the village know that we\u2019re here for Hecuba. So they make sure to keep an eye on us. There\u2019s usually extra security around that time.\"\n\nThis yearly tradition does more than protect USC\u2019s property and boost school spirit. Emily Leveque says it also fosters connection between members of the Helenes. \"I feel like this is like definitely the event of the fall that like really brings us together as an org.\"\n\nAs day turns to evening, the Helenes are prepared for the falling temperatures. Blankets cover the cots where they\u2019ll be sleeping this week. \"Definitely worried it\u2019ll be chilly, but there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather do it with than the Helenes.\"\n\nAs students anticipate the most important football game of the season, they can rest easy knowing the Knights and Helenes are defending USC\u2019s mascots.

The strike is the largest at any academic institution.\n\nAbout 48,000 unionized University of California workers went on strike today at the UC\u2019s ten campuses across the state. They include teaching assistants, postdoctoral scholars, grad student researchers and tutors. Together they do most of the teaching and research at the Universities of California schools. They are asking for higher pay and better benefits.\n\nOn a cold early Monday morning, the usually quiet UCLA campus was met with an unexpected sound. Hundreds of UCLA workers marched around different parts of campus holding white and blue signs that read \u201cUAW ON STRIKE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE\u201d while also being led by chants from megaphones and drums. The UAW stands for United Auto Workers.\n\nSam Hunter, one of the protesters, stepped aside to explain why they are striking. \"Because the university won\u2019t stop committing unfair labor practices. You know, we\u2019ve been saying for months that we need to earn enough to live here. And the university\u2019s response has been to break the law rather than, you know, meet us and talk this out.\"\n\nSome 48,000 unionized workers across the University of California\u2019s schools had organized walkouts this morning. They\u2019re asking for better benefits and higher wages. Currently, they earn an average of $24,000 a year.\n\nAccording to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Research Center, it costs close to $47,000 annually to live in California. Physics teaching assistant and striker Morgaine Mandigo-Stoba explains the struggle with making ends meet in California. \"Over half of academic workers at UC pay more than 50% of their income on rent each month. So we\u2019re fighting to end rent burden. We want we\u2019re asking for salaries that take us out of rent burden, that take us down to 30% of our wages spent on rent.\"\n\nThe workers are seeking $54,000 a year. Here is Mandigo-Stoba again on what the workers would use the higher wages on beyond rent. \"We\u2019re asking for, you know, parity with international scholars. We\u2019re asking for childcare reimbursement currently at the U.S. system or at least at UCLA. It costs $2,000 a month to have a child in daycare. That\u2019s my entire paycheck.\"\n\nThree UAW chapters have been negotiating for months with the UC\u2019s to no avail. The UAW is claiming that this is the largest walkout in academic history. Striker Desmond Fonseca shares his hopes for the university\u2019s response. \"We don\u2019t have to be out here, so that students can be in the classroom, so that research can resume because we don\u2019t want research to shut down. We don\u2019t want education to shut down. We are undergrads, people we have a section for to be learning. You know, I personally love teaching. Teaching is, you know, maybe my favorite part about being a Ph.D. student worker here at UCLA.\"\n\nThe demonstration disrupted normal campus life today. The University of California has said that any differences should be worked out at the bargaining table and not on the picket lines. The UC\u2019s said in a statement \"UC remains committed to continuing its good faith efforts.... to reach agreements with UAW as quickly as possible.... \"\n\nFor Annenberg Media I\u2019m Eric Yeh.\n```"}

{"key": "/2022/11/14/maer-roshan-visits-usc-annenberg-class/", "response": "```\nMaer Roshan visits USC Annenberg class\n\nThe editor-in-chief of Los Angeles Magazine spoke about his work, the political state of America and offered advice to young journalists\n\nBy Ethan Huang\nNovember 14, 2022 at 1:58 pm PST\n\nEthan: So my first question for you is what kinds of stories do you like to focus on?\nRoshan: It\u2019s a very broad question. I think we do a lot of stories introducing people. We do a lot of stories on things that are in the air and happening. I think one function that we could provide is talking about people in power or people with influence in in the city, in various arenas, in a way that I think L.A. media is sometimes slow to do.\n\nEthan: Right. And kind of going into that, specifically in the realm of politics, how do you choose to cover that field specifically?\nRoshan: Well, sometimes you have columnists who cover the basic, you know, mechanisms of how things work and votes and stuff like that. But I think for a magazine, it\u2019s more interesting to cover the personalities behind them and tell political stories through them. So whether you\u2019re doing the head of the teachers union or you\u2019re doing we just did a cover with Eric Garcetti or, you know, just people who play different roles in in all arenas of politics and government and telling good stories about them is really, I think, what we should be doing and how we could do the best job.\n\nEthan: Right. And I\u2019m going to kind of drop a heavier question, but of course, we recently just had an election and they\u2019re still counting the votes. But what do you think is the current state of play? And do you think that politics can fix that?\nRoshan: Geez, that is a heavy question. I think the state of L.A. in some way mirrors the state of America and the world, which is this really intense polarization. That wasn\u2019t always the case. And some of it is because there\u2019s intractable problems that are, that need to be addressed. But I think there\u2019s also this tendency for people on different sides of an issue to retreat into their own worlds and get the news that they want to hear. And so, there\u2019s not a lot of common, as much common ground, as there once was.\n\nEthan: Right. And you spent quite a bit of time in New York as well. How do they compare in confronting their issues to L.A.?\nRoshan: I mean, New York has a lot of the same problems as L.A. does and, you know, it\u2019s certainly not immune to polarization either. The big difference between New York and L.A. is in New York there was a one time, not even that long ago, five different papers competing for the same public and, you know, countless websites and the whole news apparatus was much more active and lively and the competition made everyone better. And I think there\u2019s not a culture of that here. We have one paper.\n\nEthan: Right. And over in New York, we have Bloomberg and now we have Caruso here in L.A.. What do you see in this trend? Is this a trend that we\u2019ll continue to see and, you know, continuing with these individuals who are kind of more, you know, in the business realm and kind of getting into politics.\nRoshan: It\u2019s a it\u2019s a really good question. And it\u2019s there\u2019s aspects of it that are troubling. And so they\u2019re insulated from having to go out and find donors. And they could basically decide to spend as much as they want to win a political position.\n\nEthan: I\u2019m kinda going into this idea with, you know, in journalism, and there\u2019s this notion that a lot of times, you know, in journalism might actually contribute to, you know, supporting power or, you know, being complacent in their role in society when journalism, at least many were considered to be something that you should be punching up or you should be using that platform to actually discuss or speak out against maybe power structures. So, how do you think that we can do that in journalism?\nRoshan: I think we are seeing this increased tendency that a democratization of media and who has power in media and you could have a blog and develop a voice. You don\u2019t need this expertise that you used to. So I think that\u2019s good. But I think the flip side of that is, you at least if you grew up in journalism or you city journalism and you make that your profession, there are like rules that you abide by in certain ways things are. And I think that\u2019s kind of fallen by the wayside for better and for worse. And again, the other thing I think is like people retreating into their own silos where they don\u2019t want to hear anything that contradicts what their world view is. And I think that allows for power structures that go on in a world where there\u2019s no one definition of reality, which is a dangerous thing for society.\n\nEthan: Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.\nRoshan: It\u2019s my pleasure. Thank you for having me.\n```"}

Meta. Lyft. Microsoft. These are all companies who have had to fire a significant portion of their workforce in the past year. Meta has been affected the most, having to fire 11,000 employees because of a disappointing 4th quarter. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO, says Meta\u2019s move was entirely his decision.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: \u201cI want to say upfront that I take full responsibility for this decision. You know, I\u2019m the founder and CEO. I\u2019m responsible for the health of our company and for our direction and for deciding how we execute that, including things like this.\u201d\n\nMarco Papa, a senior lecturer of Computer Science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, is not surprised by the recent economic downturn for Meta.\n\nMarco Papa: \u201cMeta is not in a good shape. Meta is effectively now for old people like me. Young people go on Tik-Tok and that trend is probably going to continue. Zuckerberg is betting on the metaverse. I think in my opinion, it\u2019s still too much of an early adopter market, so I think Meta is going to have a hard time.\u201d\n\nTwitter also just laid off 3,700 employees, shortly after Elon Musk finalized his purchase of the social media platform. Musk said in a Tweet on November 4th these layoffs were necessary because Twitter has been losing over $4 million a day. Papa attributes this to a lack of innovation in their product.\n\nMarco Papa: \u201cIf you take a look at what Twitter development has happened in the last three years, it\u2019s hardly anything.

Ben Wang: \u201cA lot of people I know before this talked about how the tech market is kind of oversaturated. I just think freezes across tech in general is definitely very indicative of it being a lot harder to break in I suppose.\u201d\n\nThat was Ben Wang, an economics and data science double major who is worried about job placement after graduation. However, Papa says USC students should not be worried about these layoffs he sees these layoffs as a temporary setback in the tech industry, not a trend.\n\nMarco Papa: \u201cCS is probably the best place now and for at least another five years. There\u2019s a reason why I don\u2019t see anybody that would be or should be deterred to come to USC all because now we are having high tech layoffs and major companies. That doesn\u2019t change the job situation for graduates.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s stock is up 10% today and Elon Musk claims Twitter usage is at an all time high. We\u2019ll see if these trends continue and how they will affect the tech job market in the near future.\n```"}

Entering the political sphere has heightened their passion to fight for causes they believe in as they now have a say in governmental decisions. According to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, 27 percent of US youth aged between 18 and 29 cast their ballot in this year\u2019s midterm election. That makes it the second-highest youth turnout in any midterm vote, which generally has lower turnout than presidential election cycles. Young voters tend to lean Democratic\u2013as 63 percent of young voters identifying with Democrats, and 35% identifying with Republicans.\n\nWe spoke to young voters from college campuses across the country voting in swing states this election. Students share why and how the youth vote prevented the projected \u201cred wave.\u201d Patrick Periard, a sophomore at the University of Michigan had this to say about Michigan voting.\n\nPatrick Periard: I do think that the biggest reason that young people turned out to vote, especially in Michigan, is that we had a proposal called Prop. 3 that was to enshrine abortion rights in our Constitution.\n\nLuka Heidari, a freshman at Emory University who lived in Chicago but voted in the contentious Georgia election, remarked that he thought his vote would be more influential in Georgia.\n\nLuka Heidari: Issues like abortion, health care, immigration, education are things that affect, you know, our generation on a day to day basis, especially living in Georgia, we kind of see what the impacts of not voting and not turning out books like this in terms of the legislation proposed and the legislators that are in office and getting to make those decisions.\n\nDr. Gregg Johnson, a professor of political science and international relations at Valparaiso University said that young voters, who are more diverse than older voters, lean Democrat because of the party\u2019s support on issues like reproductive rights and climate change, and this support showed especially in swing states.\n\nDr. Johnson: states like Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Arizona, you\u2019ll see higher youth voter turnout, higher turnout across the board, particularly because there\u2019s something to fight over. I live in Indiana. Statewide races here are generally not competitive. So you don\u2019t see much as high turnout as in other states.\n\nYoung voters today have to balance the thrill of voting for the first time with the burden of trying to change America as we know it.\n```"}

As a physically disabled person, I have found it challenging to make new friendships, especially as I grew older, because you don\u2019t know the intentions of their friendship. They might be your friend because they feel sorry for you, or on the other hand, they might want to be your genuine friend, and determining that can be very difficult and is something that those of us wheelchair users struggle with. Some people don\u2019t know how to interact with us, further complicating a genuine human interaction.\n\nI felt this acutely going into college since I no longer had the security of an assistant who knew my personality intimately. I never needed assistance with social interaction, but it was a little daunting because I was in an environment where making friends wasn\u2019t easy. Growing up, I had primarily non-disabled friends because I was always in a general education classroom throughout my formative years. The truth is that I never really struggled to make friends when I was younger because my last friend group was from my childhood. But here was a group of people who did not know anything about me, who didn\u2019t know my worth. All they saw was a person in a wheelchair.\n\nI also find it difficult because I am more mentally mature than my peers due to my life experiences and struggles as a differently-abled person. Most adults do not know how to interact with a physically disabled person. For me, that was my biggest struggle. However, I was fortunate to meet with someone that, due to his life experiences and years of volunteering at a summer camp for adults with disabilities, knew how to treat me and became my friend. His name is Tim.\n\nTim\u2019s and my relationship is meaningful because he views my disability as a part of me. We first met at USC during the welcome week of our freshman year. I was admitted as a spring admit. I was there in the Fall because I wanted to see what the campus was like, and he was here and about to start. From the moment that he turned around and started having a conversation with me, we instantly clicked. I knew from that moment on that he would become my friend. Keep in mind that I had no idea at that time he had this connection with the differently-abled community.\n\nLater in our friendship, he came to my fundraising events, where I was a public speaker on behalf of the Bud Kuhl Wood Bat Invitational. This fundraiser continues to help fund one of the therapy centers I went to as a kid, formerly known as United Cerebral Palsy of Orange County. He helped me through tough times. One day, I was sitting with him at one of our residential dining halls, and I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re the first friend that I can truly say that I feel normal around.\u201d Because for me, I\u2019ve always had my mother or just somebody there, not necessarily to facilitate but to be like a bodyguard. As a kid, you don\u2019t realize how sheltered you are as a differently-abled person. College was the first time I could be fully autonomous with my decisions because even during my formal education, I always had teachers surrounding and sheltering me. Of course, teachers are there to protect and teach us right from wrong, but I was even more sheltered because I am a differently-abled individual.\n\nTo this day, Tim and my relationship feels like the first authentic friendship I have had with a non-disabled person. Throughout our friendship, we have been able to confide in each other; I was able to help him through his moments of anxiety, and he was able to help me through mine. One of the most meaningful moments we shared where he helped me emotionally was one day I called him because I was facing a moment of anxiety and doubt. I don\u2019t remember the context exactly, but I remember telling him, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m good enough.\u201d And he told me straight up, \u201cThat sounds stupid.\u201d You might think that is rude, but I appreciated his candor because he told me, \u201cLook how far you\u2019ve come.\u201d And honestly, in that moment, I forgot to think that way. I have so many stories like that with him, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s meaningful to me.\n\nAt the end of this particular phone call, he said I love you before he ended the call. I needed to hear that because I was about to break down. While Tim was a student, we got lunch nonstop. He was comfortable taking me to the restroom when my assistant was unavailable. Tim always makes me feel normal and appreciated. He is the one that taught me to say, \u201cI love you,\u201d at the end of every human interaction because it matters.\n\nOne of the most meaningful things Tim did for me was during his final semester in college; it was my birthday. Despite his exam the next day, he came and spent time with me even though he had just finished a group project and was about to leave for New Jersey in a couple of weeks. I\u2019ve never had someone do something like that for me. It illustrates the fact that he views me as a genuine friend. Yes, it\u2019s a small gesture, but to me, it meant the world. I even told him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come if you\u2019re busy,\u201d but he told me, \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d and that meant the world.\n\nIn one of our subsequent conversations, I said to him, \u201cYou don\u2019t give a fuck about my disability, do you?\u201d And his answer was, \u201cOf course not.\u201d Tim taught me to be authentically myself and not give a shit about my diagnosis or what other people think about me. While this has always been my attitude from a very young age, I lost it as a university student. What\u2019s funny is Tim has absolutely no filters and tells me things as it is. He\u2019ll sometimes ask me if I want to drink, and we talk about wildly inappropriate things that drive me a little bonkers. He even asked me if I could have sex and questions that the ordinary person would not necessarily ask, but that\u2019s what I like about him because he truly is genuine.\n\nI know this type of friendship is hard to come by or virtually impossible for some differently-abled people due to developmental or physical limitations. Still, for those of us who are, our story can serve as an example of what is possible when we step out of our comfort zones. We are all different, so let\u2019s embrace that. And the truth of the matter is Tim is not an exceptional case. We can all be like him if we put our guard down, see into the core of that differently-abled person, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re just like me.\u201d Tim and I are a lot more similar than we are different. Our friendship continues to grow to this day and no matter what happens our bond will never break, as illustrated by this one last story.\n\nOne day, we were sitting outside of the dining hall and I was just going over how he was feeling and talking about his anxiety. He said something I\u2019ll never forget. He said, \u201cI hope I die before you.\u201d That is very morbid and I understand that but it shows his true measure of his friendship. I hope everyone finds a friend like Tim.\n```"}

So I could do either something in the Media Center, a TA position or a research position. But the Media Center really called to me. I guess I haven\u2019t had a traditional newsroom experience. I have done two internships. One for a digital entertainment magazine, and then one for LA Magazine. But I started my internship at LA Magazine at the end of February 2020. I think I was there two weeks before we went completely online. So I never got the newsroom experience. [The Media Center] just looks like such an incredible space for community and because so much of my journalism studies were remote, I felt really isolated, and coming here I knew I only had a year and I just really wanted to make as many connections as I could.\n\nWhy be a USC editor specifically?\nI thought it was very much in line with my background, and it is, but also it\u2019s allowed for some more growth than I think it expected. I feel like I do use every completely different part of my brain and it has made my own writing stronger. Like being able to look over other people\u2019s [writing]. And I really love the collaborative efforts, like being on a team of editors is really exciting to me because I get to see how other people think and write and report and structure stories. And I think regardless of the medium that\u2019s always important.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of being a USC editor?\nI have such a good team on Mondays. So I\u2019d say the camaraderie is wonderful, a huge plus to it. I love just reading everyone\u2019s stories and seeing it start with the conception of just the pitch in the morning and at the end of the day having a full fledged story. That\u2019s a lot of work and a lot of different people. There\u2019s just like a lot of different fingerprints on it. And I think that\u2019s really cool that all the undergrads get to have this, like, little baby at the end of it. I like to see how that grows and be a part of that in some small way. I like the team effort.\n\nHow do you recognize what is or is not a good article?\nI think when someone comes in with a pitch that\u2019s something that\u2019s timely for sure, but they can relate it to a bigger, more global movement or like understanding of its place in the community, especially for undergrads.\n\nHow do you edit an article without removing the original author\u2019s voice?\nI think reading it through fully first is the best move and trying to get an idea of what the story really is. If there\u2019s anything missing, if you have any major questions about it as a reader, and you get an idea of their voice, and once you\u2019ve done that and take a beat before you start picking out things, I think for me, the editing process, it\u2019s really it\u2019s either a structural issue or just like grammar issues. A lot of the students that I\u2019m working with at least are really talented and understand what they\u2019re doing for the most part. I can help with filling out holes, being like, oh, you know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve answered this question that readers are gonna have, how would you go about answering this? Instead of giving them, this is what I would write. Because that\u2019s what the job is. It\u2019s really letting them figure it out.\n\nWhat are you hoping to do after school?\nI [want to] have a host driven documentary show. I love long form. I love video. I love interviewing people and really just getting their stories. So that would be the end goal. But right after graduation, probably something in the digital space like Vice or BuzzFeed or something where they have multiple mediums that I can work with and play with, because I still love writing, but I\u2019m interested in video and I think different stories call for different mediums and I think it\u2019d be cool to explore.\n\nWhat can Annenberg Media do to better engage the surrounding community?\nCollaborating more with the social media team. I have a background in social media, so maybe that\u2019s just like the way my brain works, but I love the idea... I think it\u2019s just like such an underrated, underutilized tool in journalism as an industry.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who is looking to become an editor?\n[Dive] in headfirst and [don\u2019t be] afraid to share your expertise with the students. Because I think it can be a funny feeling sometimes because like you\u2019re a student too, but I think everyone has a unique experience and unique understanding of this industry. And I think we all just learn better if we all share that together. And then also just being open to learning from the students themselves because I feel like I\u2019ve already learned stuff from like the undergrads here too, which is great. [It] feels like a big, collaborative effort.\n```"}

The artist, famous for his contributions to the popular group Migos, was shot and killed outside of a Houston bowling alley on November 1 at the age of 28.\n\n\u201cI was really sad to hear the news,\u201d said Reverend Jesse Curney III of New Mercies Christian Church, who officiated the service and gave the eulogy, said in a statement to TMZ. \u201cKirsnick has been a faithful member since he was ten years old. He and his family were active and avid supporters of the church and the community as a whole.\u201d\n\nThere is little public information about the details of what led up to Takeoff\u2019s death, but Houston Police have said two shooters opened fire at a private event, injuring two other people. Authorities continue to investigate the case, but no arrests have been made. Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said Takeoff was \u201cwell respected\u201d and there was \u201cno reason to believe he was involved in anything criminal at the time.\u201d\n\nThis widespread respect for the rapper is what makes his death so shattering for fans, especially Atlantans. \u201cTakeoff was one of the most influential names in modern music whose creativity left a profound impact on music and culture as we know it today,\u201d read a news release from Quality Control Music and Motown Records.\n\nInstead of flowers or gifts, his family has asked that donations be made to The Rocket Foundation, which was established in honor of Takeoff\u2019s death and supports community-based programs devoted to preventing gun violence.\n\nTakeoff was one-third of the Grammy-nominated group Migos along with his uncle, Quavo, and brother, Offset. The trio hailed from Lawrenceville, a suburb of Atlanta in Gwinnett County. \u201cGwinnett\u201d gets many name drops in their songs, exemplifying the group\u2019s pride in their roots. Their success thus proves the professionalism of the Atlanta rap scene, a sphere that was not always respected within the broader hip-hop landscape.\n\nAuthor Joe Coscarelli reflects on the progression of the Atlanta entertainment ecosystem from its rocky start to its earned spot in the limelight in his book \u201cRap Capital: an Atlanta Story.\u201d He laments that rappers from the South have been discounted as artists, writing that they have been called \u201cignorant and inaccessible, overly simplistic or vulgar or simply too country, in line with broader prejudices against people \u2013 and especially Black people \u2013 from below the Mason-Dixon Line.\u201d\n\n\u201cArtists from Atlanta and across its neighboring states have continued to innovate, lyrically and sonically, breathing new life into the genre \u2013 often using those derided Auto-Tuned melodies, South-specific language and, yes, dances, even as \u2018mumble rap\u2019 became a twenty-first-century pejorative for a new, outr\u00e9 style of Atlanta hip-hop,\u201d he continued.\n\nTakeoff\u2019s death hangs so heavily on the hearts of Atlanta fans because he was the glue of a group that brought national attention to the musical ingenuity of a region that was previously deemed technically inept. Maurice Hobson, assistant professor of Africana studies at Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta, emphasized how the group manifested the city as a historical landmark of Black popular culture.\n\n\u201cMigos\u2019 rise is a continuation of the soul and funk sound that comes out of the \u201870s, that moves from disco to soul and funk and then the rise of what kind of comes out of the late \u201880s and early 90\u2032s that establishes the rise of the Dirty South that really promotes Outkast, Goodie Mob, Organized Noize, The Dungeon Family,\u201d Hobson said. \u201cThen you go into snap and trap. Migos represents it as this kind of new vignette of Atlanta Black popular culture.\u201d\n\nThis rise can be largely attributed to Takeoff\u2019s technical prowess. In an interview with The Guardian, DJ Ray G reflected on how Takeoff was known for being \u201cthe quiet one\u201d who focused more on perfecting his craft than relishing in attention. On nights when Quavo and Offset were out at nightclubs promoting their music and networking, they would come home to find Takeoff learning music production from the greatest names in rap, like Tupac and Biggie, on YouTube.\n\n\u201cThis kid\u2019s 16, studying his craft \u2013 like, \u2018I ain\u2019t going out with you tonight. I\u2019m going to stay here and listen to Big, Pac, Eminem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trio\u2019s public debut occurred in 2013 when their single \u201cVersace\u201d went viral for its sticky beat. Their recognition has been steady ever since for their iconic contributions such as \u201cFight Night\u201d and their trilogy of albums \u201cCulture,\u201d \u201cCulture II\u201d and \u201cCulture III.\u201d\n\nAfter featuring the group in the third episode of his hit show \u201cAtlanta,\u201d the multi-hyphenate creative Donald Glover gave the group\u2019s single \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d a shoutout during his Golden Globes acceptance speech. \u201cI think they\u2019re the Beatles of this generation,\u201d he said backstage. \u201cThey don\u2019t get a lot of respect outside of Atlanta.\u201d\n\nAlmost eight years later, that could not be less true. The rap trio known for their punchy flow and iconic ad-libs has taken the hip-hop world by storm. Takeoff\u2019s music will live on forever.\n\n\u201cMigos literally shaped and changed the sound of hip-hop music,\u201d said Lore\u2019l, host of the nationally syndicated radio program \u2018The Morning Hustle\u2019 on Atlanta\u2019s Hot 107.9, in an interview with 11 Alive. \u201cThey are Atlanta, they represent Atlanta,\u201d Lore\u2019l said. \u201cThey\u2019ve helped schools, they\u2019ve helped kids. They\u2019ve done so many things that were positive. They\u2019ve helped other artists, other aspiring artists in the city, from the city of Atlanta. And they\u2019ve definitely made their mark in Atlanta and made sure they always given back. And Takeoff was always a big part of that, and they never left where they came from.\u201d\n\nTakeoff\u2019s death has sparked immense grief even beyond the limits of hip-hop circles. Stacey Abrams expressed what a loss this tragedy was for the state of Georgia. \u201cThis is heartbreaking news and a tragic loss to GA and the music industry. Born and raised in Gwinnett County, Kirshnik Khari Ball influenced Hip-Hop and our Culture beyond measure,\u201d tweeted the author and gubernatorial candidate. \u201cMy condolences are with Takeoff\u2019s family, friends and all those who were inspired by his talent.\u201d\n\nActivist and founder of Campaign Zero Brittney Packnett Cunningham tweeted, \u201cRIP Takeoff. So undoubtedly influential in rap\u2019s new school. But more importantly, a whole human being who deserved far more life and not this reckless, vile act. My goodness.\u201d\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks emphasized the loss of such a central figure of the city who was often spotted courtside at games alongside Quavo and Offset. \u201cWe are heartbroken over the passing of Takeoff, a passionate Hawks fan and pillar of Atlanta culture,\u201d tweeted the franchise that calls Atlanta\u2019s State Farm Arena home.\n\nJournalist Jemelle Hill reflected on major losses in hip-hop that struck her in her youth. \u201cI was in college when Biggie and \u2018Pac were killed and thought there was no way we\u2019d ever experience anything remotely close to that again,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cNow it\u2019s happening so frequently that you barely have time to recover before someone else [is] killed. RIP Takeoff.\u201d\n\nOther hip-hop artists sharing their grief on social media were Teyana Taylor, Kid Cudi, and Keke Palmer.\n\nAt Friday\u2019s service, Quavo and Offset shared emotional speeches about their relative and bandmate to a packed venue of Georgians. Complimentary tickets went live on Ticketmaster at 2 p.m. Tuesday and were sold out less than four hours later. Although attendees were asked to adhere to a no-photo and no-video policy, short videos have been circulating of the speeches and performances including that of Drake, Chloe Bailey, Yolanda Adams, and Byron Cage.\n\nTo close, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens presented Takeoff\u2019s family with the Phoenix Award, the city\u2019s highest honor.\n```"}

She\u2019d been teaching herself over the past few days. \u201cMy best friend told me I need to start doing something for myself,\u201d Duhe says.\n\nLifelong fascinations for 24-year-old Duhe, such as the sweeping possibilities of composing music, singing and songwriting, make it difficult for her to stray, even if she tries. Her friend\u2019s sentiment echoed the milieu of \u201cWhiplash,\u201d a film about a jazz drummer\u2019s obsession to better his abusive professor, achieve greatness, and a flying chair. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve never had a teacher throw a chair at me,\u201d Duhe says, laughing. \u201cBut I have had a teacher tell me that I should quit the trumpet.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, she did quit at one point for an entire year. Everything had come down to one question: Am I happy not doing music? she asked herself. The answer was in how she had lived her life up to that point.\n\nDuhe\u2019s sound is a harmony of the many places she\u2019s lived, such as her hometown of Atlanta, plus the influence of her parents\u2019 Black Southern origins in Louisiana \u2014 conjuring an ardor and a deep conviction that give her trumpet playing a singularity. On her Instagram, you\u2019ll find a clip of her blowing an undulated and playful swell while singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco serenades the Hollywood Bowl for the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s free online concert series, Sound/Stage, earlier this year.\n\nAs the only musician sharing the stage, Duhe\u2019s individuality as a trumpeter was the sound heard around the world for a moment, distinguishing that performance as the highlight of her career thus far, she says. \u201cI tell my students trumpet is 85% mental and 15% physical,\u201d Duhe decisively shares. But while she plays, the 85% is loaded with questions: \u201cAm I doing a service to the music? Am I doing a service to whoever wrote this music? Am I doing a service to myself? Am I portraying this musical vision as well as it can be portrayed to the audience?\u201d\n\nIf you look at her music sheets, they are adorned with little notes, like \u201ca lot of soul\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t be a bitch.\u201d Not to be misconstrued for obsessive, impractical strides toward excellence measured by those who came before her, Duhe sets her own bar in that regard.\n\nWhen we compare notes on heroes, we agree we need them, people who tell us what can be possible on this creative odyssey of coming into our own\u2014whenever that begins and ends. The glaring difference between us, perhaps, is that Duhe has actually performed with one of her heroes \u2014 Lauryn Hill \u2014 with 85,000 in attendance at the Lovers and Friends Festival 2022 in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s also one of my earliest memories of music, watching \u2018Sister Act II\u2019 and just being in awe of [Hill\u2019s] voice,\u201d Duhe says. \u201cThat movie is not sad like that, [but] I\u2019d cry like a little baby.\u201d\n\nDuhe recalls her first memories of music through a parental dichotomy \u2014 her father\u2019s love for Black singer-songwriters who dominated the \u201870s and \u201880s, and her mother\u2019s gospel roots. But Duhe especially underscores the absolute necessity in separating inspiration and influence \u2014inspiration being the drive and influence being the motive.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a moment where you realize that you can\u2019t spend your whole life chasing what someone else sounds like, and what someone else plays like,\u201d Duhe adds. \u201cYou have to chase the best version of yourself.\u201d\n\nHer father was ultimately responsible for putting the trumpet in her hands, and then putting her in front of small crowds \u2014 dressed like \u201ca little man\u201d in a vest and fedora getup \u2014 to play the trumpet around Atlanta as half of \u201cSax Man and Jazz\u201d with her saxophonist brother.\n\nAn amusing distant memory, sure, but in that moment, audiences responded to her playing. She was only seven-years-old when she taught herself how to play the horn.\n\nTrombonist Errol Rhoden and Duhe have been friends for roughly 11 years now. They first crossed paths in grade school through the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Talent Development Program \u2014 made up of 25 Black and Latinx musicians at the time, according to Rhoden. He also admits that his mother, Duhe\u2019s first District Honor Band conductor, will often recount \u2014 to whoever will listen \u2014 watching young Duhe play as a prodigy at work.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s just like, \u2018Who\u2019s this little Black girl? Who the hell is this? She sounds amazing!\u2019\u201d Rhoden recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s always been kind of like a natural thing for Imani.\u201d\n\nDuhe was accepted as a graduate student at USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music to study classical music in 2020, but put off moving from North Carolina for a year because of the pandemic. It was the same year she quit playing \u2014 the doing of her teacher I assumed \u2014 until our conversation turned to how she\u2019d been reflecting on the modern record label\u2019s soulless pursuit of monetary gain, and the lost fervor for physical media.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t own anything anymore, we own a subscription to a service that allows us to listen to music sometimes,\u201d Duhe says. \u201cI think that that\u2019s not good because music and movies and all of that stuff can be a form of protest, it can be a form of love, and as soon as someone wants to censor what we\u2019re able to listen to and have some of the things that we really like, it might not be available anymore.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most tragic reason for her decision to quit was the incessant deconstruction of music and emotions in an academic setting until it was seemingly stripped of all of its wonder by the end of her undergraduate years.\n\n\u201cA lot of being a musician is your music \u2014 making being so tied to how you feel on the day to day,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge thing that people struggle with, when they\u2019re having a bad playing day and think that\u2019s automatically a reflection of their character, which is just absolutely not true.\u201d\n\nBut her love affair with music, the most tangible form of spiritual expression, was too deep to abandon. Instead, Duhe left a bartending gig in North Carolina in her rearview mirror as she drove to California to make a career out of music, whether it was playing gigs or the gratification of teaching kids of YOLA at Inglewood to play the trumpet.\n\nDuhe is visiting the studio on her own accord these days, too. She\u2019s writing the latest song for her debut R&B record under the banner, \u201cMani and the Wildflowers.\u201d The song is supposed to be a deep contrast to the yearning tone of the rest of the album, a record she plainly describes as \u201cfast\u201d and \u201chappy.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Duhe takes a break doesn\u2019t concern Rhoden, a gracious nod to her talent, and his love of Miles Davis. \u201c[Davis] put down the horn for five years, and then brought it back, and the cool was still there,\u201d Rhoden said. \u201cImani is the same. Regardless, she\u2019s still cool.\u201d\n\nListen to the only Mani and the Wildflowers song on Spotify here.\n```"}

Galen Center filled with the sounds of \u201coohs\u201d as Littleton raised three fingers into the air and made a circle with the other two. Littleton scored 19 points with 15 coming from behind the 3-point line in a convincing 75-42 Trojan victory against the Idaho State Bengals.\n\n\u201cWhat she brings to this team is her leadership, her six assists and her steadiness,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cShe\u2019s a winner, and she has a really complete game.\u201d\n\nThe graduate guard got hot right out of the gate, receiving a shovel pass from junior guard Kayla Williams and launching a 3-pointer to put the Trojans up 5-0 in the first quarter. Littleton helped the Trojans pull away in the second quarter. With USC\u2019s lead at 21-13, junior forward Koi Love rebounded the ball off the rim before firing a pass to Littleton on the outside. Littleton splashed a dagger into the net. The Bengals never got as close as nine points for the rest of the game.\n\nThe Trojans had a strong supporting staff to help Littleton\u2019s efforts. Sophomore guard Bella Perkins shot 50% from beyond the arc and contributed 15 points. Overall, the Trojans shot 40% from 3-point range, hitting a program-high 14 3-pointers.\n\n\u201cI knew that our posts would be doubled-up this game because a lot of the focus has been on them,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cSo, when a guy kicked out, I was locked in, ready to shoot.\u201d\n\nGraduate forward Kadi Sissoko dropped 14 points against Idaho State after recording 15 in USC\u2019s previous game against CSU Bakersfield.

USC scored 29 points off turnovers compared to Idaho State\u2019s 11.\n\n\u201cOur mentality heading into this game was to just pressure Idaho State,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c[Associate head coach Beth Burns] has done a great job instilling a toughness defensively in our players. We have to keep getting better, but I think [the players] understood that we were trying to disrupt the team, and that\u2019s what they did.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will travel down I-5 to face San Diego on Tuesday. The Toreros are 2-0 and are coming off a 57-47 win against Portland State.\n\n\u201c[The Toreros] are always tough,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI imagine they\u2019ll do some different presses because that\u2019s what they always do.

Following a goal from redshirt senior Jake Ehrhardt, which gave the No. 3 Trojans a 13-10 lead, the senior night energy from the UCLA side of Spieker Aquatics Center was zapped. The Trojans should have come away with their 16th win of the season. They should have prevailed over a No. 2 ranked Bruins team who had bested them in their first two meetings this year. They should have been able to go into next week\u2019s MPSF tournament with momentum.\n\nThen, Gianpiero Di Martire struck. The Bruins\u2019 redshirt sophomore attacker (brother of USC\u2019s own graduate driver Massimo Di Martire) stuck a knife in the Trojans\u2019 hopes of coming out of regulation with a win. He rattled off three straight goals in the last minute of the fourth quarter to send the game into overtime.\n\nUSC played great water polo for the first 30:55 of the game. USC\u2019s Di Martire continued his torrid scoring campaign, adding another four goals to his resume. Ehrhardt, redshirt sophomore utility Joshua Waldoch and redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen each contributed two goals. On the defensive side, the Trojans struggled to limit exclusions. However, they limited the Bruins to three goals on 10 tries when they had the man advantage. USC\u2019s defense in general was fairly strong during that time frame.\n\nYet every single one of those positive aspects of the game were rendered null when UCLA\u2019s Di Martire rattled off three straight goals. From then on, all that mattered for USC was securing the win in overtime. The Trojans were unable to claim that victory. Graduate attacker Jake Cavano gave UCLA the lead with three seconds left in overtime. It proved to be the only score from either team during the overtime period.\n\nUCLA\u2019s strong performance factored into the Trojans\u2019 defeat, but USC still believed the game was incredibly winnable. \u201c100 percent,\u201d freshman utility Andrej Grgurevic said when asked if he thought USC was the better team in the pool. \u201cWe were playing a really good game.

We just need to finish harder.\u201d\n\nAs defeating as the loss was, the loss doesn\u2019t dissuade head coach Marko Pintaric from having lofty, long-term goals for this team heading into the MPSF tournament next weekend. \u201cWe really belong in that championship tournament,\u201d Pinatric said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna play hard with a chip on our shoulders, especially right now after this type of game. We want to win the tournament, that\u2019s our goal.\u201d\n\nUSC has the ability to compete for a national championship, and there is still a strong possibility that they will do just that. But first, the Trojans will likely need to exorcise their demons and defeat this UCLA team in next weekend\u2019s tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s just a few slip-ups in defense that we really need to fix as a team and I feel like we\u2019ll be in a very strong position next week,\u201d Grgurevic said.\n\nUSC will face Austin College Friday at 2:45 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center in the first round of the MPSF tournament.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Cl\u00e9mence-Maureen Feniou November 12, 2022 at 8:55 pm PST\n\nUSC suffered a significant loss to the UC Irvine Anteaters, losing 2-0 in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Some defeats hurt more than others, but this game leaves a bitter feeling of unaccomplishment and missed opportunities. UC Irvine, who was defeated earlier this season 3-2 at McAllister Field, had a revenge to take, and that\u2019s exactly what they did.\n\nThe game started off strong for the Anteaters, pushing a high offensive block on the Trojans, stifling their game setup. \u201cI thought we had a tough start, it is something that we knew they did and had success with,\u201d USC head coach Jane Akulonis said after the match. \u201cJust untidy in the moment, and I think that set us off.\u201d\n\nIf the pressure and the intensity were high from UC Irvine, the same can not be said for the Trojans. The first 15 minutes resumed with a lack of possession and failed passes in the midfield. UCI\u2019s confidence grew over the minutes while the Anteaters intensively attacked the Trojans\u2019 defense.\n\nIn the 16th minute, when a throw-in arrived in the box from the left, the Trojans failed to clear it and left redshirt junior forward Destinee Manzo the opportunity to kick it into the far right-side netting, giving the Anteaters a 1-0 lead.\n\nAfter the goal, the Trojans struggled to bounce back into the game. Sophomore forward Simone Jackson did her best to bring animation towards the opposite goal, but USC still couldn\u2019t adjust their passes, keep hold of the ball or display effective lane and depth play.\n\nThe second period started on a different rhythm for the Trojans, who seemed less nervous as they quickly made appearances in the opponent\u2019s box, giving redshirt junior goalkeeper Glo Hinojosa kicks to save. Sophomore defender Brooklyn Courtnall stepped to the midfield with hopes of bringing creativity into the Trojans game.\n\n\u201cIt was just trying to get more players who could be dangerous higher up on the field,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cShe did well. It was just unfortunate nothing came our way.\u201d\n\nSophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer fell down at the box\u2019s entrance, under the side referee\u2019s watchful eyes, but wasn\u2019t awarded a penalty kick.\n\nThe following minutes saw a succession of actions and opportunities until the biggest one of the game for USC. Jackson pierced right through the defense, guiding the ball into the box before shooting. Saved by Hinojosa, the ball rebounded and came to USC. Junior midfielder Zoe Burns took a sharp-angle shot and missed the goal by a few inches.\n\n\u201cI think, obviously, we wish we were more creative, had more chances. We did create, but most of them went to the goalkeeper.\u201d Alukonis said.\n\nUSC tried with energy and conviction for 45 minutes, as the second half was almost completely filled with their offensive plays. Unfortunately, even with seven corners and eight shots on goal, none of them made it into the net.\n\n\u201cI think we just struggled all day, whether it was to get a hold of the ball. Irvine came out with a lot of bite and fire and, at times, just outworked us,\u201d Alukonis said.\n\nIf the Trojans were unlucky in scoring, it was not the case for the Anteaters, who took one of their only opportunities of the second half to bury the game two minutes before the final whistle. On an assist from Manzo, redshirt sophomore forward Alyssa Moore, left alone in the left corner, ran the ball into the box, and dribbled in the middle of two USC defenders before poking it home past the keeper.\n\nUCI celebrated their win on the field, another upset against USC after defeating UCLA in the first round last year. The Anteaters will meet Brown for a spot in the Sweet Sixteen on November 18.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate result, but well played by Irvine, and we wish them luck,\u201d Alukonis said.\n```"}

(Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)\n\nBy Drake Lee\nNovember 12, 2022 at 12:35 am PST\n\nAfter surrendering 35 points to Cal, the Trojan defense knew they had to bear down against Colorado, the last-place team in the Pac-12. The walls of Troy passed with flying colors, sacking Colorado quarterback J.T. Shrout three times and limiting the Buffaloes to 259 total yards, the lowest the Trojans have allowed this season. The Trojans gave up just three third-down conversions on twelve Buffalo attempts in a 55-17 victory.\n\n\u201cOur defense played really well,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cWe affected the passer, which was huge. We did a really nice job on third down. We got a couple of turnovers. I was really proud of the defensive effort.\u201d\n\nJunior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu and senior defensive lineman Tyrone Taleni combined for three sacks.\n\n\u201c[Tuli] has been so important to what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe affects the passer in a really unique way, and I think he has really improved as a player. His versatility has really shown, and he\u2019s been consistent for us.\u201d\n\nSophomore quarterback Caleb Williams recorded 268 yards and also rushed for two touchdowns. Redshirt freshman quarterback Miller Moss tacked on 78 more yards.\n\nThe victory came at a heavy price. With 2:49 left in the second quarter, two Colorado defenders slammed redshirt senior running back Travis Dye to the ground after he received a handoff. Immediately, Dye clutched his left leg and remained on the ground for several minutes. A look of serious concern engulfed Lincoln Riley\u2019s face as the entire team huddled around Dye. The wide receiver had to be carted off the field. Riley said that he does not expect Dye to play again this season. His time as a Trojan on the field appears to be at an end.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019d be sitting here as a football team if it wasn\u2019t for him,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be playing on an NFL team next year.\u201d\n\nDefensive back Max Williams brought down R.J. Sneed on the 45-yard line to stifle the Buffaloes\u2019 opening drive. Colorado responded by forcing Caleb Williams to sail a pass over the head of Dye, resulting in a three-and-out for the Trojans.\n\nOn Colorado\u2019s second drive, Tuipulotu broke through the Colorado offensive line and threw down Shrout on the Colorado 40, forcing the Buffaloes to punt again. Williams heaved a pass toward a sprinting Brenden Rice on the left side. At the last moment, Nico Reed put his hands out and dove for the ball, picking the ball from Rice\u2019s hands and giving Williams his second interception of the season.\n\nThe takeaway turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the Trojans. Chased by a Trojan defender, Shrout scrambled into the end zone out of the pocket and threw a pass into the Colorado bench. The entire Trojan squad erupted when the refs called a safety, putting the Trojans up 2-0\n\nColorado responded with another strong defensive effort, forcing another three-and-out on the Trojans. Back on offense, Alex Fontenot rushed for 37 yards on the right side to put the Buffaloes in the red zone. Skillful tackles by the Trojan defense limited the Buffaloes to just a field goal, kicked by Cole Becker to give Colorado the lead 3-2.\n\nIn the second quarter, Kyle Ford helped the Trojans escape an early 3rd and 28, receiving a heave from Williams and running for 42 yards to put USC on the 20-yard line. After faking a handoff, Williams ran up the middle for the first touchdown for either side. Denis Lynch put the finishing kick on a 72-yard drive by the Trojans.\n\nOn 3rd and 10, Tuipulotu threw down Shrout again on the COLO 08, forcing the ball loose. Stanley Ta\u2019ufo\u2019ou quickly dove to grab the ball and pumped his fists in the air, screaming with his teammates. Williams followed up the defensive effort by dodging several defenders and sprinting into the end zone on the right side for his second rushing touchdown\n\nIn the third quarter, Williams, scrambling away from the defensive linemen, made his signature running heave to Tahj Washington. The wide receiver sprinted all the way to the end zone through the middle to put USC up 33-10. Riley decided to let Will Rose run the ball for a successful two-point conversion. Rose celebrated with a backflip, getting the entire Coliseum on its feet. The refs were not as enthused as they gave the punter a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nThe eight-point drive proved to be the nail in Colorado\u2019s coffin. USC moves to 9-1 overall and 7-1 in the Pac-12. The Trojans will face their biggest challenge of the season so far when they travel up to the Rose Bowl to face off against UCLA next Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt is the rivalry, but we have to treat every game the same,\u201d Tuipulotu said. \u201cHow we treat Colorado, how we treat UCLA \u2013 we just work for practice, to get better.

In their last game, the Trojans had 15 turnovers and allowed the Eagles to mount a comeback in the second half to win 74-61. However, this game turned out to be much different, with a dominant performance by the Trojans on Thursday night to beat Alabama State 96-58 at Galen Center. It was their highest margin of victory since last year\u2019s opener.\n\nUSC Head coach Andy Enfield said after the game, \u201cThey really came out, played and tried to play the right way. Share the basketball, make plays for each other, and played very hard.\u201d\n\nUSC proved the first game will not represent the whole season, as the Trojans looked like a completely different team on the court, having five players in double-digit scoring. It seemed like for the whole game, you could hear the crowd chanting \u201cTHREE!,\u201d as the Trojans were relentless in hitting from behind the arc, going 11-of-23. In comparison, USC went 3-of-19 in 3-point shooting against FGCU.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 passing was much more fluid and contributed to the overall game improvement. They were much more willing to pass the ball, which allowed them to open up more shots and layups. USC went after the ball for most of the game, forcing 20 turnovers.\n\nThe team chemistry prevailed, and it was obvious USC spent the week making adjustments. However, at first the game did not seem like it was going to go like this. In the start, both teams were going back and forth, and the game stayed tight. Alabama State even had the lead at one point, even if it was for a brief 12 seconds.\n\nIt took about 10 minutes for the Trojans to separate themselves from the Hornets, but then USC started to heat up. Through constant movement and passing, USC soon led Alabama State by 10 points, and the lead kept on increasing.\n\nFifth-year guard Drew Peterson and redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan looked unstoppable, as they continuously made shot after shot. The end of the first half continued to go in the Trojans\u2019 favor. True freshman guard Tre White ended the half emphatically, making a buzzer-beating deep 3-pointer. The Trojans would end the first half leading 48-23.\n\nThe second half was where the game was truly won, as USC put a beating on the Hornets. The Trojans came out hot and quickly extended their lead to 30 points. Peterson did not let up, as he effortlessly made baskets. He finished the game with 21 points on 7-for-9 shooting, including 4-for-4 from 3-point range.\n\nSenior guard Boogie Ellis did not disappoint either, recording seven steals and racking up 15 points. Another key player was Morgan. He silenced a lot of critics tonight, being able to move a lot smoother and get to the ball quicker than he did last season. Morgan positioned himself correctly in the paint, leading a successful night shooting 5-for-7. He finished the night with 11 points.\n\nThe star power of Peterson, Ellis and Morgan, along with others, helped USC win by a margin just shy of 40 points. However, even with such a great margin of victory, there is still a lot of room for improvement. Last season and Monday\u2019s game saw a Trojans team cursed with turnovers, and that was no different against Alabama State. USC had 17 turnovers \u2014 an unacceptable number for Enfield.\n\nThe Trojans also often had difficulty going after rebounds. The Hornets even outscored USC 10-2 in the last three minutes of the game while forcing four turnovers.\n\n\u201cI thought up to the four-minute mark we were playing really well in most areas,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cEven though we had a big lead, we expected our bench guys to play as well as the other guys did.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have to play for the full 40 minutes in their next game against Vermont on Tuesday, November 14, at 8 p.m. at Galen Center. The Catamounts are not an easy opponent as defending America East Conference champions that entered last year\u2019s NCAA tournament as a No. 13 seed. This can easily be another upset if USC is not careful.\n\nMorgan recognizes the threat of UVM, saying USC needs to go into games \u201cwith the mentality that any team can beat us\u201d and that his team is \u201creally locking in and preparing this week.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans need to keep moving the ball effectively, making plays for each other and turn the ball over less frequently to grab a decisive win over the Catamounts. USC hopes to build momentum into the seasons against UVM Tuesday at 8:00 pm at Galen Center.\n```"}

More than the publicity, the Cardinal Divas were subject to intense discourse online about the complicated nature of their existence at a predominately white institution (PWI).\n\nOne tweet argued that the team is \u201cliterally mimicking other teams that have rich history and have been around for decades. This is why people gatekeeping HBCU culture. USC doesn\u2019t need any more exposure.\u201d Mentions of appropriation and safe spaces for communities of color, especially Black people, at PWIs were rampant. Criticism on every spectrum of the conversation was littered on timelines in the weeks following.\n\nLang was surprised to see that the team had gone viral, but even more surprised to see the backlash \u2013 and who was behind it. \u201cIt was just like, whoa, this is crazy. Then, when I see people that look like me being the negativity, it was really crazy,\u201d said Lang. \u201cI was expecting it to be from USC and by their fan base because it\u2019s such a traditional school.\u201d\n\nFor Lang, who has been training as a majorette dancer since fourth grade, it means everything to have created this historical team. \u201cI just want to be able to be a Black voice and be able to uplift Black work,\u201d she beams. \u201cIt just really makes me happy and proud of myself that I get to not only be a part of history but I get to show other Black girls that you are more than capable of doing anything in any area. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a minority in that space or not.\u201d\n\nIn response to those who don\u2019t think a majorette team should exist at a PWI, Lang said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be Black anywhere I go. So whether that\u2019s at an HBCU or at a PWI, I have the right to not only be a part of my own culture, but also showcase my culture.\u201d She also addressed the argument that she should have just attended an HBCU. \u201cMe going to an HBCU was not in the plans for me or my career path. And that\u2019s O.K. too. But majorette has always been in my life, so it wasn\u2019t going to just up and leave since I go to a PWI,\u201d said Lang.\n\nFollowing high-profile media coverage of the team, Lang is still fighting for her dance counterparts. She is looking for more support from the university. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the spirit teams, so we wouldn\u2019t be getting support as they would. There\u2019s a lot of different ways that [the university] been [saying] that they don\u2019t have resources to support us or to get us involved with spirit,\u201d stated Lang. \u201cAnd that was really my end goal for the team.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinal Divas are a student organization, but not a recreational sports team like the Song Girls or Spirit Leaders. They are also not allowed to perform on the field, which is a major draw for majorette performances at HBCUs.\n\nOTHER UNIVERSITIES CHIME IN\n\nLang\u2019s effort adds USC to a list of other PWIs that offer majorette dance teams on campus. At San Diego State University, the SDSU Diamonds were the first majorette team on the West Coast with an Instagram bio states the team is \u201cinspired by the art of HBCU majorette dance.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, when the team was founded, it was difficult to adjust to a PWI setting. \u201cWe got a lot of backlash. There was a hate page made for us and everything,\u201d said Sakina Buycks, the team\u2019s captain. But after 10 years, things have settled down and the Diamonds have found their place in their community. \u201cThe fans love us. At the football games, they cheer for the Diamonds. We\u2019ll walk on the field, the whole student section will cheer for us. It\u2019s really, really hype and we definitely feel the love,\u201d said Buycks.\n\nIn regards to the debate over majorette teams at PWIs, Johvonne Roberts, the Diamonds\u2019 co-captain, believes majorette dance is an aspect of Black culture that can be practiced and appreciated anywhere. \u201cI believe that we should be able to take our culture anywhere we go. If there\u2019s something that the PWI lacks that we know we can bring to the table, I don\u2019t really see a problem with that, especially if we\u2019re appreciating it,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cWe\u2019re not diminishing or forgetting about where it comes from. As long as we still give credit back to where it came from, I think that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nThe Diamonds were happy to see the announcement of the Cardinal Divas, despite the controversy that followed. \u201cHaving another majorette team on the West Coast is a big thing. I\u2019m just really happy for them. I think, even though it was some bad backlash, they\u2019re still getting publicity, still getting their name out there,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cSo I\u2019m just really happy for them and that\u2019s a really great achievement to accomplish.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s captain, Buycks, appreciated the light that shined on the existence of majorette teams at PWIs, like the SDSU Diamonds. \u201cGetting the word [out] that PWIs actually do have majorette teams was very big because obviously, no one else has had the platform [to do that], so to that aspect, I\u2019m very grateful they got the exposure.\u201d\n\nJa\u2019Lynn Steen, a Long Beach native and member of Howard University\u2019s Ooh La La! Dance Line, is also supportive of the Cardinal Divas while still having reservations about the existence of majorette dance teams at PWIs. \u201cThe fact that [they were] able to start a major team in the first place at a PWI is amazing in itself, but I feel like I\u2019m kind of on half and half,\u201d Steen shared.\n\nSteen believes HBCUs are made to protect Black culture and keep it within the Black community. She worries about what majorette dance will look like outside of Black cultural spaces. \u201cIf you start to incorporate it at PWIs, our culture doesn\u2019t have the same symbolization. The feeling and the meaning of being a majorette dancer isn\u2019t the same,\u201d said Steen.\n\nSpecifically, Steen is concerned about the style of majorette dance being diminished to appeal to a non-Black audience. \u201cFor majorette dance, how it\u2019s big moves, how it\u2019s getting low and just more of a vibrant, loud dancing. You put that at a PWI, I\u2019m scared that is going to kind of water it down in a way,\u201d said Steen.\n\nA member of Tuskegee University\u2019s Marching Crimson Piperettes, Errenous Evans, also sees that possibility and hopes the Cardinal Divas don\u2019t allow their environment to temper their culture. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to utilize and share the fruits of our culture at the PWI, then do it wholeheartedly. Don\u2019t do it scared,\u201d said Evans. \u201cDon\u2019t dumb yourself down or reduce anything that you\u2019re doing because somebody at that school doesn\u2019t get it. If you\u2019re going to showcase your culture, do it big, do it loud, do it to the best of your ability.\u201d\n\nEvans felt that the online backlash the team received was unnecessary, saying it\u2019s not an issue for non-USC students to concern themselves with or act negatively towards the women involved with the team. However, she has her own concerns about the inclusion of a majorette at a PWI.\n\n\u201cMajorette dance is almost entirely intertwined with Black culture and bringing that Black culture to a university or an area which may not be open to accepting or even understanding where it came from would make it lose its effect almost,\u201d Evans stated. \u201cWe march because we\u2019re members of the band, and that comes with a certain amount of pride. And for me, I feel like that aspect of it is lost when you don\u2019t have the accompanying instrumentalists who share the same complexion as you.\u201d\n\nIn comparison, while they feel like a family with the band, the SDSU Diamonds have a different attitude regarding the music they dance to. Buycks shared, \u201cThe songs they play in the stands, you know, they\u2019re gonna play their own music, but we\u2019re going to figure out how to dance to it.\u201d\n\nMany who disapproved of the team online made the argument that, if you want to be a majorette dancer, you just have to attend an HBCU. While Steen acknowledges that you can still incorporate Black culture at PWIs, she argues it\u2019s not the same. \u201cYou have to go to HBCU to really get the full culture. To really engulf yourself in the proper culture, in the proper way, go to an HBCU,\u201d said Steen. \u201cBut if you want to translate it and still be comfortable at a PWI, make your space with your people the best you can.\u201d\n\nEvans does not understand why those interested in majorette would not attend an HBCU. \u201cIf there was already an HBCU team and the purpose of your team at a PWI is to mimic the exact same style, when afforded the opportunity to attend an HBCU to get the authentic culture, why did you not attend?\u201d\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not everyone is afforded the opportunity. HBCUs are primarily concentrated in the south and the largest percentage of those institutions are located on the East Coast. For some in the West, moving across the country and paying out-of-state tuition to attend an HBCU is impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s not as accessible to everyone to go to HBCU. A lot of people that I\u2019ve met at San Diego State are in-state students,\u201d said SDSU\u2019s Buycks.\n\nWhile this is a debate and conversation that captured many people\u2019s attention and will surely continue, Steen believes that the true heart of the matter was lost. \u201cI think we kind of forgot about how hard she had to work to even get the dance team approved. For it to be a whole bunch of brown faces in the stands at a PWI, I think we forget...it was a Black woman who was able to start a dance team and have it be successful,\u201d said Steen. \u201cSo, [applause] to her because, whether it\u2019s at a PWI or not, she still did her thing and she still is, in a way, fighting for us.\u201d\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nFor fans of the team, Lang asks that they continue to be vocal about their support to help the team achieve its goals. \u201cFor those who want to support and continue to support us, just keep letting people know that. Keep letting us see that you want us to be showcased properly and get on the field and have our own section and be a part of spirit.\u201d\n\nLang does recognize that many may not understand majorette dance, but she hopes that once that obstacle is overcome that the team will finally be given equal opportunities as other spirit dance teams. \u201cI think it\u2019s just really hard to understand what majorette is and how it\u2019s totally different because a lot of people have been trying to compare it to other sorts of organizations, and they don\u2019t want anything to seem like we\u2019re getting favoritism and things like that,\u201d said Lang. \u201cBut in general, majorette is just a totally different entity in itself, and it\u2019s not really comparable. I feel like once USC can really understand that and grasp that once [they] accept this team, things do have to change, then we can really get somewhere and be able to further the dream of USC fully working with Cardinal Divas and making sure that we\u2019re on the same platform as the other spirit teams.\u201d\n\nWhile they have received national media attention and raised over $14,000 through their GoFundMe, the Cardinal Divas are still fighting to be officially recognized and supported by the university. Only time will tell if the team will be given a platform to shine or if they will always be regulated to a few rows in the student section.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nNovember 10, 2022 at 11:31 pm PST\n\nAfter an offensive masterclass and defensive struggle, the Trojans will look to be consistent on both sides of the ball against a lowly Colorado team. Last Saturday, the Trojans pulled out an ugly 41-35 victory over Cal behind the wizardry of sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams. Williams once again played a phenomenal game with nearly 400 total yards and five touchdowns. Down his top two receivers in sophomore Mario Williams and junior Jordan Addison, Williams made due, and his other targets took care of business. Sophomore wide receiver Michael Jackson III showed off his potential by catching a pass and scampering 59 yards down the field.\n\nThe defense, however, needs to improve. Cal got whatever it wanted against the USC defense in the second half, and the Trojans allowed the Golden Bears to score three fourth-quarter touchdowns to crawl their way back into the game. Nonetheless, the Trojans pulled out the win and are already moving on.\n\nColorado\u2019s season has been disappointing to say the least. The Buffaloes are 1-8 with their one win coming over Cal. They have been dominated in virtually every game this season, allowing 40.2 points per game to opponents which is 130th in the country. Offensively, Colorado scores 15.6 points per game, \u2013 129th in the country. The Buffaloes are last in the Pac-12 in passing yards and have had three different quarterbacks throwing the ball this year. Although Friday\u2019s starting quarterback is up in the air, it seems Colorado is sticking with sophomore J.T. Shrout. Against Oregon last week, Shrout threw for one touchdown and 247 yards, much of which came from an 81-yard bomb to freshman wide receiver Jordyn Tyson.\n\nColorado\u2019s run game is the best aspect of the team\u2019s offense, but it\u2019s still subpar. The Buffaloes average 113.7 rushing yards per game which is 10th in the Pac-12. The Buffaloes have four running backs who have rushed for over 100 yards this season with the backfield leader being junior running back Deion Smith with 381 rushing yards.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 defense was missing key defensive players last week against Cal and may be missing them again against Colorado. It is still unclear whether sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry, sophomore defensive end Korey Foreman and senior linebacker Ralen Goforth will play after being out for the Cal game. It could be that all of them are being rested before UCLA and Notre Dame, although the USC defense will need to have other players step up in a major way if the team wants to look impressive.\n\nThe team\u2019s poor run defense continues to ravage USC. The Trojans need to stop the Buffaloes from bursting out into big run plays, which USC has let other teams do way too often this year. Ralen Goforth will be available for this week\u2019s game, which should help the Trojans run defense, while Eric Gentry is still a game time decision.\n\nUSC\u2019s hope should be to go up early and force the Buffaloes to throw. After that, the Trojans should look to shut down the Colorado pass game and do what they do best \u2013 force turnovers and sack the quarterback.\n\nInjuries also have been plaguing the offense with both Mario Williams and Addison missing the last two games. Additionally, redshirt senior offensive tackle Andrew Vorhees has missed the last two games. While it has been reported Addison will be available for the game, it is still unclear if Williams or Vorhees will play.\n\nThe Trojan offense, however, has still averaged a hefty sum of 43 points per game over its last two games and should continue to roll against Colorado. Realistically the Trojans should be able to move the ball at will on this meager Colorado defense. USC should look to build off redshirt senior running back Travis Dye and the rest of the running back corps. The Buffaloes give up the second most rushing yards per game in the country, and Dye\u2019s hard running should steamroll Colorado\u2019s defense, allowing the offense and Caleb Williams to potentially move with ease on the Buffaloes.\n\nThough Colorado is arguably the worst Power Five football team, the Trojans\u2019 defense has been unimpressive in the past few games. If USC is to gain any ground in the College Football Playoff rankings, the Trojans will need to embarrass the Buffaloes.\n\nCatch the Trojans taking on Colorado at 6:30 p.m. Friday at the Coliseum.\n```"}
{"key": "/2022/11/10/alex-villanueva-faces-campaign-violations-and-lags-behind-robert-luna-in-sheriffs-race/", "response": "```\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva had a bad week. On Tuesday, Robert Luna appeared to beat him by more than 16 points in the ballots. Then a day later, news broke that he was under investigation from the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office for violating state law after a video surfaced last week of Villanueva asking for solicited campaign donations from deputies.\n\nThe video, released by the L.A. Times, shows Villanueva soliciting campaign donations directly from deputies in the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the union representing L.A. deputies. The video was brought to the newspaper\u2019s attention by a deputy who received the video through a text message that included a link to Villanueva\u2019s fundraising website, according to the L.A. Times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to each and every one of you who you want to be as sheriff. We\u2019re gonna win this thing,\u201d Villanueva said in the video after openly directing his message to the sheriffs in the union. \u201cAnd if you want to help, anything will help us get our message out there...I\u2019ll leave it up to you. Any donation is great: 20 bucks, all the way up to 1,500 bucks, your choice.\u201d\n\nVillanueva says in the video that ALADS abandoned its duty by only contributing $1,500 to his reelection when they previously contributed $1 million to his campaign in 2018. California State Law prohibits an employee of a local agency from \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d soliciting contributions from an officer of the same agency, especially if the employee is aware that the contributor is from the same agency. Violations of this law are counted as misdemeanors.\n\nSince his election in 2018, Villanueva has been the subject of several controversies involving the sheriff\u2019s department. He has been accused of misconduct on several instances and has clashed with the L.A. County Board of Supervisors on multiple occasions. Villanueva pushed back against the Board of Supervisors\u2019 claim of corruption in the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cIt appears you are making yourselves the judge, jury and executioner for the office of the sheriff, nullifying the will of the voters,\u201d Villanueva said.\n\nL.A. County Measure A, which grants the Board of Supervisors the authority to remove the sheriff during their time in office, was approved to be on the November 8 ballots because of Villanueva\u2019s questionable leadership, according to the L.A. Times. The measure was met with overwhelming approval with over 70% of voters voting in support during the midterm elections.\n\nDuring his reelection campaign, Villanueva raised over $2.9 million in funding, doubling the amount of his opponent, retired Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna, who raised $1.3 million. As of Thursday afternoon, with 1.2 million votes totaled, Luna is currently leading with 56.8% percent of the vote compared to Villanueva\u2019s 43.2%.\n\n\u201cOur campaign team has worked diligently to run an effective campaign in compliance with all applicable laws,\u201d said Villanueva in a statement to NBC Los Angeles News. \u201cTo date, we have no official communication from the D.A. We will work with the D.A.\u2019s office to address any concerns they may have.\u201d\n\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office Director of Communications Tiffany Blackwell said in a statement that the video has come to their attention and \u201can investigation by the office\u2019s Public Integrity Division has been initiated.\u201d\n\nBob Shrum, the director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future, expanded on why Villanueva\u2019s asking for funds is considered incriminating.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the sheriff and people work for you...they\u2019re obviously going to feel a lot of pressure to contribute, which is why we have rules against [soliciting donations for political campaigns],\u201d said Shrum.\n\nThis is not the first time Villanueva has been accused of acting unethically to secure campaign funds. A L.A. Times investigation released in September found that permits to carry weapons were granted to at least 50 people who contributed funds to his campaigns for L.A. County Sheriff in both 2018 and in 2022. A criminal investigation was launched in early September by the city\u2019s sheriff\u2019s department into the concealed carry weapons application.\n\nIn another controversy, Villanueva was accused of mishandling an incident where one of his deputies knelt on the head of a handcuffed inmate for three minutes. Last week, the Board of Supervisors settled nearly $50 million in lawsuits alleging deputy misconduct under Villanueva\u2019s oversight.\n\nWhen asked in an interview with Spectrum News 1 in July about how he would work with the board in the future, Villanueva said that the board has launched \u201cattack after attack\u201d since he took office as county sheriff.\n\n\u201cIn fact, they hired a law firm to sue me my first month in office. So there\u2019s been no honeymoon,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they do the right thing, I\u2019m more than happy to work with them and I want to work with them.\u201d\n\nHowever, based on current polling, it seems Villanueva will not have to work with the board in the future.\n```"}

Two individuals have been reported dead, according to authorities. A tropical storm warning is in effect from Sebastian Inlet, Florida, about 165 miles north of Miami, to just north of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn Volusia County\u2014composed of Daytona Beach and surrounding areas\u2014around 70 buildings and structures have been compromised or destroyed. \u201cThe current state of the ocean is unforgiving,\u201d said Tammy Malphurs, the director of Volusia County Beaches. \u201cAnywhere near the beach, you are putting your life in danger.\u201d\n\nShane Soletti, a sophomore at Florida State University, said the university announced the cancellation of classes Thursday and Friday due to the storm. During a trip home from the gym, he witnessed a large power grid in Tallahassee spark out when a stoplight ahead of him on the road suddenly stopped working.\n\nGwyneth Baker, a senior at the University of Florida in Gainesville, said that, as a Texan, she was surprised by her classmates\u2019 calmness before major storms over the course of her time at school. \u201cFloridians don\u2019t seem super stressed about it,\u201d Baker said. Baker says there are \u201churricane parties\u201d where friends gather to drink and make merry once storm warnings cancel class. Hurricanes are so common in Florida that a certain acceptance of the situation is quite common, she added.\n\nSarah Feakins, a professor who works in USC\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences, says larger climate issues are contributing to Florida\u2019s intensifying storms. Global warming has created a longer hurricane season each and every year, leading to \u201cstronger hurricanes with faster wind speeds.\u201d The rapid nature of these storms\u2019 formations leaves residents with inadequate time to prepare and evacuate. \u201cRainfall is often the most damaging aspect of some of the larger slow moving storms,\u201d she added.\n\nFlorida is an extremely flat and low-lying state, meaning that increased rainfall can cause catastrophic flooding. Streets often fill with water so high that drivers risk flooding out their engines. When storms pass, the work is far from over as communities shift their focus toward recovering and rebuilding from financial and structural damages. Streets filled with downed tree branches and other debris need to be cleared and cleaned, while houses need to be repaired and rebuilt.\n\nSevere storms, which damage a community\u2019s infrastructure such as gas stations and grocery stores, can hinder such efforts, keeping residents from receiving the resources they need. Safety issues often arise during these recovery efforts due to the strain put on local law enforcement and first responders. Emergency rooms can become overrun, leading some injured to be refused care. Emergency response times often drop as police and EMS are stretched thin, struggling between keeping their communities safe and protecting their own families.\n\nThe transition to sustainable energy will greatly impact the direction and impact of global warming on our environment, which in turn will decrease the severity and frequency of these storms. Feakins posits that until we change our fossil fuel use, the issue will only get worse. \u201cWe need to vote for and call for action to rein in the pollution of the major fossil fuel industries and transition rapidly and ethically to a more sustainable energy and transportation sector,\u201d Feakins said.\n```"}

{"key": "/2022/11/10/proposition-31-passes-in-california-banning-the-sale-of-flavored-tobacco-products/", "response": "```\nCalifornia voters passed Proposition 31 on Wednesday, which bans the sale of most flavored tobacco products in an effort to combat the use of tobacco among teens and young adults. Despite the results still having yet to be finalized, the Associated Press  called the race  on Wednesday with  62.3%  of the votes in favor of the proposition. Results would likely be certified by December 16, meaning that the law may be implemented as soon as December 21 of this year.\n\nThe ballot measure would uphold  Senate Bill 793  signed by Governor Newsom in 2020 which passed with the intent of discouraging young people from vaping and smoking. The bill, however, was delayed after a  referendum  by a coalition representing the tobacco industry that qualified the proposal for the November 2022 midterm elections ballot.\n\nA study by the University of Michigan  reported in 2020 that the use of flavored tobacco products was becoming a prevalent issue with young adults and teens. According to the study, \u201cbetween 2017 and 2019, the 30-day prevalence of vaping nicotine increased from 6% to 22% among college students and from 8% to 18% among 19-to-22-year-olds not in college.\u201d\n\nGiven the effect that this measure has on college-aged individuals, USC students weighed in with their views on the proposition. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good step in the right direction, but they did that in New Jersey\u2013where I\u2019m from\u2013and people who want a flavored vape will find a way around it,\u201d Jennifer Lathrop, a sophomore studying communication, said. Lathrop also spoke on the prevalence of vaping at USC. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really big problem here. Even walking on campus, I see people vaping,\u201d Lathrop said. \u201cA lot of people I know vape. They\u2019ll be upset by [Prop. 31] because it will be harder for them to buy the flavors they want, but I don\u2019t think it will change their habits or make them stop vaping.\u201d\n\nA 2017  study  conducted by the Tobacco Regulatory Science scientific journal found that getting rid of flavors in tobacco products would not completely eradicate e-cigarette or other tobacco use among young people, but has the potential to substantially reduce the use of said products when flavor is no longer a factor.\n\nStudent-run organizations will also be affected by Prop. 31. Duffl and Handle, two student-run companies that supply quick delivery services of common goods to USC students, will likely be impacted by the implementation of Prop. 31 as well. Both companies offer an array of flavored nicotine products for delivery on their websites and many USC students rely on them for quick delivery.\n\nChase Robbins, a junior in the Iovine and Young Academy who is a co-founder and the CEO of Handle, isn\u2019t too concerned about the impact that Prop. 31 will have on the company\u2019s sales. \u201cDisposable tobacco devices like those targeted by Prop. 31 make up a small portion of our overall sales,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cThis ban will not have a significant impact on our business. Our customers primarily use Handle to order products like snacks, drinks, ice cream and other food products.\u201d Robbins also doubts that Prop. 31 will have an impact on youth tobacco use.\n\nHowever, Stefano Cafatti, the Duffl marketing admiral and a senior studying business administration, said that flavored vapes are one of the company\u2019s top-selling products.\n```"}

Katie Porter, a Democrat, is running against Scott Baugh, a Republican, in Orange County. (AP/Andrew Harnik and AP/Krysta Fauria)\n\nBy Sara Kahn and Taryn Snyder\nNovember 10, 2022 at 4:41 pm PST\n\nThe race to represent the 47th Congressional District of California between Katie Porter, the Democratic incumbent, and Scott Baugh, the Republican challenger, is tight and yet to be called. Porter, who flipped the 47th in 2018, is running to keep the seat blue, while Baugh, a former state assemblymember, is hoping to take the seat back.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, 58% of the votes have been counted and Porter maintains a slight lead at just less than 1%. \u201cIf Republicans want to gain control of the House of Representatives, a district like California\u2019s 47th is one they\u2019ll need to flip,\u201d PBS correspondent Geoff Bennett said on PBS NewsHour. \u201cPollsters consider the race there a toss-up between the Democratic incumbent Katie Porter and Republican Scott Baugh, both of whom are running in a vastly redrawn district.\u201d\n\nThe 47th District was redrawn in 2020 to include coastal Orange County cities such as Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. Additionally, there have been population increases and demographic changes in the past decade in Orange County.\n\nUpdated results for the race are expected to come from the OC Registrar of Voter at 5 p.m. on Thursday. Waiting for the results is not new for Porter\u2019s campaign. \u201cI\u2019m proud our state makes it easy for people to make their voices heard via the mail\u2014even though that means it can sometimes take a few days to declare a winner,\u201d Porter said on Twitter Wednesday evening, adding that her 2018 victory came 11 days after Election Day.\n\nThe political landscape of the 2022 elections are quite different from that of the 2018 elections. Daniel Schnur, an adjunct instructor at USC Annenberg who teaches courses in politics, communications and leadership, believes Porter\u2019s success in 2018 can be attributed to the nation\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cThe biggest difference for Porter is that there was a national wave that she was able to surf in 2018 that simply didn\u2019t exist this year,\u201d Schnur said. \u201cThis year, she\u2019s on a more neutral political turf. It\u2019s not necessarily working against her, but the national trends aren\u2019t helping her nearly the way they were in either 2018 or 2020.\u201d\n\nPorter is a prominent congresswoman, ranking in the top five in fundraising for the House of Representatives. Her platform focuses on the housing crisis and cutting healthcare costs. Baugh, a business attorney and politician, is running on what he calls \u201cOrange County values,\u201d with his platform focusing on lowering taxes, strengthening border security and limiting constitutional government.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of Orange County voters who don\u2019t like Donald Trump but would support \u2014 and do support \u2014 a more conventional Republican,\u201d David Wasserman, a campaign analyst, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAlex Palakian, a USC sophomore from Irvine, discussed the impact he believes Baugh\u2019s campaign messaging has had on the community. \u201cI would get numerous automated text messages from Baugh about inflation, gas prices and crime that I think CA-47 voters resonated with which helped make this race surprisingly close,\u201d Palakian said.\n\nMultiple prominent Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-CA and the GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik endorsed Baugh. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Emily\u2019s List and the League of Conservation Voters endorsed Porter, showcasing a stark contrast between who is backing the two candidates.\n\nBoth candidates have made large campaigning efforts in Orange County. Porter\u2019s campaign reached 125,000 doors and made 640,000 phone calls, while Baugh\u2019s reached 60,000 doors and made 680,000 calls.\n\n\u201cEven though Orange County politics has changed a lot in recent years, this is not the Republican bastion that it was for much of the 20th century. There\u2019s an open question of whether it\u2019s moved as far left as Porter has,\u201d said Schnur, adding that \u201cshe probably is somewhat left of where the district is philosophically.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel\nNovember 10, 2022 at 2:19 pm PST\n\nI don\u2019t want to say \u201cI told you so,\u201d but I hope you picked up Justin Fields while you had the chance. The sophomore QB went nuclear against the Miami Dolphins during Sunday\u2019s early slate. Despite his team falling short by a score of 35-32, Fields had a career day, posting over 42 fantasy points with four total touchdowns. For the fourth week in a row, his athletic ability was on full display. Fields broke the NFL record for single-game rushing yards by a QB in the regular season, gaining 178 yards on the ground. Who previously held the record? None other than Michael Vick, when he went for 173 in his infamous overtime walk-off win against the Vikings in 2002. It\u2019s safe to say Fields is in stellar company.\n\nAside from Fields\u2019 ridiculous performance, my prediction for a big game from Chargers\u2019 wide receiver Joshua Palmer also aged nicely. He saw 10 targets, catching eight for 106 yards. When all was said and done, he finished the day with 18.6 points in PPR leagues. Not too shabby.\n\nEnough patting myself on the back, though \u2014 it\u2019s a new week. That means there\u2019s new studs out there to bring to your attention.\n\nHere Comes Hardman\n\nCan anyone explain to me how Mecole Hardman is only rostered in 36.1% of ESPN leagues? There were a lot of questions about the Kansas City Chiefs receiving corps heading into this season. Would the offense be as dangerous without Tyreek Hill? Who would replace him in the passing game? The answer to the first question is quite simple: Thanks to Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, the Chiefs are just as much of an offensive powerhouse, averaging 30.4 points per game (the best mark in the NFL). The answer to the latter is a bit more murky. You can\u2019t truly replace Tyreek Hill. He\u2019s a one-of-a-kind player. Instead of trying to find someone to replace Hill, Kansas built a wideout group that may be just as dangerous. Hardman is one of the pieces to a puzzle that also includes USC alum JuJu Smith-Schuster, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and the recently acquired Kadarius Toney. While none of them possess the superstar talent of Hill, the Chiefs are just as good without him.\n\nHardman is a huge part of why this team has been so successful, and it\u2019s showing up in his fantasy numbers. He\u2019s currently riding a four-game streak in which he\u2019s scored at least 12 PPR points per game. He\u2019s also scored a touchdown in three straight games and is coming off an overtime win over Tennessee when he saw a season-high nine targets. While JuJu is this team\u2019s WR1 (not counting Travis Kelce, obviously), Hardman has made his touches count. With a QB like Mahomes, there\u2019s no reason to believe that won\u2019t continue.\n\nFrom NorCal to South Beach\n\nAfter acquiring a generational talent in Christian McCaffrey, the San Francisco 49ers shipped Jeff Wilson Jr. off to South Beach at the trade deadline. The Dolphins backfield has been dominated by Raheem Mostert all season, but Wilson saw no shortage of action during his first game in Miami. He had nine carries for 51 yards and three receptions for 21 yards. He also added a trip to the end zone for good measure. By the final whistle on Sunday, he\u2019d tallied 16.2 PPR points. That\u2019s a solid day at the office for his first game in the orange and teal.\n\nThe most interesting part about Wilson\u2019s performance on Sunday was that Mostert saw the same nine carries and less use in the passing game. Mostert had appeared to be the guy in Miami\u2019s backfield, but with the arrival of Wilson, it seems as though they\u2019ll be splitting touches at the very least. Wilson may even overtake Mostert in snap share in the coming weeks. If you\u2019ve been looking for some running back help, Jeff Wilson Jr. could be your solution. He\u2019s still only rostered in less than 50% of ESPN leagues.\n\nBeckham\u2019s Coming Back\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again. Odell Beckham Jr. has been cleared to play by his doctors. Whether you\u2019re looking for a high-ceiling player to stash on your bench or desperately need someone to fill in that flex spot, go swoop up Odell before an actual NFL team does. We all know about his legendary moments back with the New York Giants. After a couple of disappointing years with the Cleveland Browns, the wideout rewrote the narrative in his half-season stint with the Rams last year, which culminated in a long-awaited Super Bowl ring. Beckham played eight regular season games for the Rams last year, averaging just under 40 yards per game and scoring five touchdowns. Now the numbers aren\u2019t astonishing, but they look a lot better when you consider he had to compete with Cooper Kupp for targets, who had arguably the best season by a wide receiver in NFL history. Odell will likely fall into a similar situation as last year, signing with a Super Bowl-caliber team looking to cash-in on some of his former glory. This means he will probably be playing in a high-powered offense with a highly-talented QB. Whatever team signs him will get him on the field. He may be past his prime, but he\u2019s simply too skilled to ride the pine. He\u2019s still available in about 80% of ESPN leagues, but that number will shoot up as soon as the inevitable news breaks about his new squad. If you want to take a chance on him, roster him ASAP.\n\nWe\u2019re getting down to the dog days of the fantasy season, and no matter where you stand there is work you can do now. If you\u2019re trying to scratch your way into the playoffs or avoid last place, consider trading a superstar for a haul that can help you win right now. If you\u2019re top of the league, maybe do the opposite and start to think about how you want your team to look come playoff time. Can I be a crystal ball two weeks in a row? We\u2019ll just have to wait and see. \u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Drake Lee\nNovember 10, 2022 at 1:34 pm PST\n\nHead coach Brad Keller looks up at the Galen Center scoreboard. He cannot believe what is happening. His injury-riddled Trojans are five points away from a sweep against the No. 8 team in the nation. A win against Stanford would guarantee a spot in the NCAA Tournament and might even put USC back in the Top 25 AP Rankings. Three sets later, Keller was in disbelief again. His team had just blown a 2-0 lead to the Cardinal at Galen Center, the second time Stanford had defeated the Trojans this season.\n\n\u201cI always say that losses are painful gifts,\u201d Keller said. \u201cIf you phrase it right, you can really learn a lot about what a team is doing. But I mean, Trojans, Bruins, Cardinal; you don\u2019t want to lose to each other in any form.\u201d\n\nWith senior outside hitter Skylar Fields out with a day-to-day leg injury, the Trojans relied heavily on freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson. The Arizona native recorded a team-leading 21 kills in the losing effort. Sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga recorded 48 assists.\n\n\u201c[My teammates] really helped me get to 21,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBeing able to hear my teammates on the court is great, and I talk with Mia a lot. She always talks to me on how to adjust and what shots are open.\u201d\n\nStanford senior opposite Kendall Kipp torched the Trojans for 24 kills to go along with a .413 hitting percentage.\n\n\u201cKendall Kipp is a National Team-caliber type of player, and so is Skylar Fields,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThey play at a physically higher level than anyone else, they have a ton of range, they have great hand contact. They can just do things that a lot of other players can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nThe opening set was deadlocked until graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams lept high in the air and delivered a slam from the right side to put the Trojans up 24-22. Senior opposite hitter Emilia Weske delivered the killing blow, rifling a ball from Tuaniga into the Stanford defense. A 4-1 run in the second set, featuring three of Weske\u2019s 15 kills decisively put the Trojans ahead 19-12, leading to a 25-21 victory.\n\nThe Trojans still looked unstoppable in the third set. The Cardinal could not handle a soft spike from sophomore middle blocker Katelyn Smith, putting the Trojans up 10-6. The Cardinal countered with a 4-0 run to tie the set, capped off by a blast from redshirt junior outside hitter Caitie Baird. The two teams went back and forth in a set that featured 14 of the game\u2019s 31 ties and six of the game\u2019s lead changes. Stanford emerged victorious 25-22, shifting the momentum in the Cardinal\u2019s favor.\n\nFans wearing cardinal and gold roared when Tuaniga slammed a serve that bounced off the hands of Stanford freshman outside hitter Elia Rubin and put the Trojans up 22-20 in the fourth set. The Cardinal scrambled for two more points to tie the game. Kipp followed up the effort by smacking the ball past the diving Wilson. She then delivered two service aces to give the Cardinal their second set victory.\n\nBy the fifth set, the Trojans were exhausted and under immense pressure to defeat a top-ten team. Kipp burst the floodgates open by racking up four more kills and a block in a 7-1 Cardinal run. The Trojans never recovered, losing the final set 15-9.\n\nThe 3-2 defeat against the Cardinal marks the second time that USC held a 2-0 lead this season before dropping the next three sets. The first occasion was against Hawaii September 10. USC looks to right the ship on Saturday with a match against Cal in Galen Center. The Golden Bears are 7-17 overall and 0-14 in the Pac-12.\n\n\u201cWe played a really great game against Stanford, and we\u2019re facing another great opponent in Cal,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve just got to be on our A-game.\u201d\n```"}

But with just one game left in the regular season, Di Martire currently sits at the top of the USC scoring list for the season. The Italian graduate driver has even bested his teammate redshirt senior Jake Ehrhardt, who currently is ranked eighth all-time in career goals for the Trojans.\n\nDi Martire grew up in Naples, Italy, and has been playing water polo since he was eight years old. While in Italy, he played at some of the highest levels of the sport, including top club team Circolo Nautico Posillipo and the Italian Youth National Team. Once Di Martire received his undergraduate degree for business administration in Naples in December 2021, he decided to take the leap across the world and look at schools in the United States.\n\nEven though Di Martire\u2019s younger brother Gianpiero plays water polo at UCLA, it was he who first convinced Massimo to look at USC. \u201cMy brother suggested to me to contact Marko Pintaric, the head coach, because I was interested in getting a master\u2019s in finance and [USC has] this program that is amazing,\u201d Di Martire said. \u201cSo I reached out to him and we started talking. It was amazing because immediately, really, you have a feeling.\u201d\n\nThe feeling was mutual. With his success in Italy, head coach Marko Pintaric knew he had found something special. \u201cI knew from watching him \u2014 his offensive and defensive ability,\u201d head coach Marko Pintaric said. \u201cWhen recruiting a player like that, you just hope he says yes.\u201d\n\nDespite his success in Italy, Di Martire couldn\u2019t imagine he would play as well as he has this season. But he has made a seamless transition across continents, leading the Trojans in scoring with 46 goals and earning the MPSF Newcomer of the Week award four times. \u201cFor me, it was completely unexpected,\u201d Di Martire said. \u201cHere, it is a completely different water polo. I needed to get used to this kind of water polo.\u201d\n\nPintaric knew adjustments would be necessary, but he also knew that if he could get Di Martire to commit to USC, he would have a star on his team. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to play for a new team,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cHow are you going to adapt to a new culture? How are you going to adapt to a new league? And the way he\u2019s playing, it\u2019s actually phenomenal.\u201d\n\nThough Di Martire traveled over 6,000 miles from his home, there was one familiar face on the team. Redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen met Di Martire in 2016 when Molthen was playing for the USA Junior National Team and Di Martire was playing for Italy. \u201cI knew what he was capable of, but I don\u2019t think a lot of guys on the team really expected the extent of how good of a player he is,\u201d Molthen said.\n\nBeyond his goal-scoring ability, Molthen credited Di Martire\u2019s ability to play with an emotion and intensity that his teammates feed off of. \u201cWe like to play with emotion as a team, whether it\u2019s up or down,\u201d Molthen said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing with a person like Massi, the energy he brings really helps us out, especially in late-game.\u201d\n\nDi Martire especially channels that competitive energy when he\u2019s around one particular USC rival: his brother. When the brothers are out of the pool, Di Martire said it\u2019s like being back home in Italy. Brotherly love was thrown out the window, though, when the two Di Martire brothers played against each other. \u201cIt was a weird emotion because it was the first time I had faced my brother,\u201d Di Martire said. \u201cDuring the game, we were opponents, so no mercy. But after the match we are brothers, so we shared emotion and started laughing about the match.\u201d\n\nMassimo also tries to spend as much time as possible with his current teammates outside of the pool. The connection Di Martire has with his USC teammates is unlike the connections he had in Italy as they prepare to play in the MPSF and NCAA tournaments. \u201cWe have just one purpose, one objective, one goal. And it\u2019s amazing because every day we gather ourselves here for like three or four hours,\u201d Di Martire said. \u201cWe work hard, and we have one goal and we want to achieve that goal.\u201d\n\nNo matter what expectations any teammate, coach or fan had of Di Martire, no one could have predicted how important he would be for the Trojans. Not only is he the leading scorer for the team, he is heating up at just the right time. In USC\u2019s past five games, all against ranked opponents, Di Martire has scored 13 goals. The Trojans will need more of Di Martire\u2019s goal-scoring prowess with the MPSF Tournament coming up in the middle of November and the NCAA Tournament following in early December.\n\n\u201cWe are getting closer to the most emotional, best part of the season,\u201d Di Martire said. \u201cWe have UCLA, then the MPSF [Tournament] here. It is going to be incredible emotion and incredible matches. I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s out of the pool, Di Martire balances being a D1 athlete and earning his degree. He hasn\u2019t decided yet whether he will continue playing water polo or use his graduate degree to pursue a career in finance once he leaves USC. \u201cI want to work and want to explore the different possibilities that this master\u2019s can give me,\u201d Di Martire said. \u201cI don\u2019t [want to] close the door to water polo and play professionally in Europe, so I still don\u2019t know. I want to completely live and enjoy this emotion. And afterwards, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n```"}

In Week 9, 313 total points were scored in five conference games; this week, 397 points were scored in six games. To put this remarkable weekend into perspective, the SEC scored 362 total points in seven games. It could be that the Pac-12 is just full of weak defenses. Regardless, it was incredibly entertaining to keep up with these dynamic contests across the Pac-12. Don\u2019t stress if you didn\u2019t get a chance to watch every game because I have you covered in my Week 10 edition of \u201cUnpack The Pac.\u201d\n\nWashington 24, Oregon State 21\nThis incredibly exhilarating game ended with Washington senior kicker Peyton Henry delivering the game-winning field goal with eight seconds left. The field goal was set up by junior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. who led the Huskies\u2019 offense 92 yards down the field on that final drive. Penix delivered a solid performance, mainly due to his offensive line which was outstanding during the game and has been the entire season. Penix was not sacked or hurried once throughout the game. On the other side of the ball, the Huskies\u2019 pass defense, which has struggled this season, finally produced as it held Oregon State to 87 passing yards. This was a shock considering redshirt freshman quarterback Ben Gulbranson has had a lot of success during the past month filling in for injured junior quarterback Chance Nolan. Gulbranson was not able to move the ball down the field, and the only reason the Beavers played the Huskies down to the wire was their elite rushing attack, which put up 175 rushing yards and two touchdowns. This was a heartbreaking loss for the Beavers, who have now fallen out of the College Football Playoff rankings after entering the game at No. 23.\n\nUSC 41, Cal 35\nIt\u2019s another week, but it\u2019s the same storyline for USC: Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams delivered a Superman-esque performance to make up for the Trojans\u2019 lackluster defensive outing. USC\u2019s offense looks as good as any in college football, and Williams has been the most talented player in college football over the past few weeks. The reality is he has had to put the team on his back these past two weeks without his best two wide receivers and with a poorly performing defense on the other side of the ball. In its last three games, USC has allowed 38.3 points per game after allowing 18.7 points per game in the team\u2019s first six contests. Let\u2019s give credit to Cal, though, since the Golden Bears clearly watched the USC defense\u2019s tape this week. Redshirt senior quarterback Jack Plummer attacked a vulnerable USC secondary the entire game and threw for 406 yards and three touchdowns. Plummer\u2019s career game helped Cal battle until the final whistle, but the Trojans\u2019 offense was too much for Cal to handle as USC squeaked out a narrow 41-35 win. USC\u2019s defense will need to drastically improve for the team to pick up key wins as the schedule comes to a close.\n\nOregon 49, Colorado 10\nOregon got off to a red-hot start and did not take their foot off the pedal as the Ducks rolled past Colorado. Oregon\u2019s offense is firing on all cylinders as it has an elite mixture of a superb passing attack, rushing game and an abundance of big-time playmakers. Senior quarterback Bo Nix is leading the flock of Ducks as he has added five more touchdowns to his season total of 36. Nix did his best impression of Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles and caught a touchdown pass. Colorado never really stood a chance in this contest and had too many mistakes on offense to stick around with Oregon. Oregon now extends its winning streak to 8 games, and Colorado now drops to 1-8.\n\nUtah 45, Arizona 20\nUtah won this game in the trenches as the Utes rushed for 306 yards and five touchdowns. Arizona has one of the worst rushing defenses in all of FBS, and Utah undoubtedly took advantage of that. Utah junior quarterback Cameron Rising, who returned to the starting role after missing one game with a knee injury, wasn\u2019t asked to do much in this game but did a terrific job managing the game. It\u2019s also noteworthy that he was only sacked once, a significant improvement since Utah\u2019s offensive line hasn\u2019t held up too well this season. Arizona had too many mistakes in this game, as the Wildcats turned the ball over four times and had three more penalties than Utah. This was an all-around dominant performance by Utah.\n\nUCLA 50, Arizona State 36\nUCLA ran all over Arizona State in this game. The Bruins rushed for a season-high 402 rushing yards. The Bruins did this without superstar senior running back Zach Charbonnet, who missed the game due to an injury. While the Bruins\u2019 offense dominated the box score, the UCLA defense, which has been inadequate for most of the season, allowed ASU to stay in the game. ASU redshirt junior quarterback Trenton Bourguet threw for 349 yards and two touchdowns. The biggest question for the Bruins this season has been whether the defense can keep up its end of the ball, and that answer is still unclear after another subpar outing.\n\nWashington State 52, Stanford 14\nWell, I don\u2019t think many expected Washington State to be the highest-scoring team in the Pac-12 this weekend. The Cougars, like UCLA and Utah, faced one of the worst run defenses in all of college football. As a result, WSU rushed for 306 yards and averaged 8.1 yards per rush. The Cougars\u2019 defense also completely embarrassed Stanford\u2019s offense, forcing four turnovers and returning a fumble for a touchdown. This win ends WSU\u2019s three-game losing streak and brings the Cougars within one game of being bowl-eligible.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

As the players ran onto the field, a coach yelled, \u201cSomebody is going to go to work and it better be us.\u201d The close nature of the Trojans\u2019 41-35 win against the California Golden Bears pushed the team through the practice.\n\nJunior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu was named the Pac-12 Defensive Lineman of the Week after recording four tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss and two sacks during the homecoming game. Although this is Tuipulotu\u2019s third time earning the award this season, he received the achievement with humility. \u201cEven though I got the award, I believe it\u2019s a team effort because I wouldn\u2019t be able to get the award without my guys,\u201d Tuipulotu said.\n\nTuipulotu now leads the nation in sacks with nine on the season. He is also currently No. 4 in the nation in tackles for loss with 1.7 per game, leading the Pac-12 in the stat. Senior linebacker Shane Lee was unaware of Tuipulotu leading the nation in sacks, but he wasn\u2019t surprised when he learned. \u201cTuli is a dog, man. He will go after you on every play,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI\u2019m happy and proud of him because he deserves it.\u201d\n\nAlthough the defense has been breaking records this season, USC\u2019s offense is gaining recognition with five different receivers recording a 100-yard game for the first time since 2000. USC\u2019s offense finished Saturday\u2019s game with 515 yards, 155 rushing yards and no interceptions. In fact, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams\u2019 only interception this season was against Arizona State.\n\nWilliams said practices throughout the week help him to avoid throwing interceptions on game day. \u201cStaying locked in throughout every play, watching film, talking to Coach Riley throughout the whole game, and the connection with the offense helps me try and stay consistent,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSophomore wide receiver Michael Jackson III has been stepping up to his role in recent games,  with five receptions for 115 yards and two touchdowns this past weekend. Jackson also received a spot on the Paul Hornung Award Honor Roll. When Williams was asked if he expected Jackson to break the tackle for a third quarter 59-yard touchdown, he referred to Jackson\u2019s hard work during practice. \u201cHe actually did it again today. He broke a tackle and went down the sideline,\u201d Williams said. \u201cOne thing about Mike Jack is that he always worked hard and hated not being on the field.\u201d\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley said although there are moments when the offense and defense aren\u2019t playing to the best of their ability, the team often plays well enough on one side of the ball to make up for the other\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cThis team has done a great job of covering up for both for each other [offense and defense],\u201d Riley said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have won all of our games except for one.\u201d\n\nRiley, Williams and Lee echoed the importance of staying true to this during the last few games of the regular season. Although USC\u2019s main challenge is consistency on the field, the Trojans hope to move past this and win Friday\u2019s game. \u201cThere\u2019s this hunger from all sides of the field to get better and put ourselves in the best position to win,\u201d Riley said.\n\nThe Trojans will play against Colorado on Veterans Day at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  The game kicks off at 6:30 p.m. on Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Micheal Chow)\n\nBy AC Shick\nNovember 09, 2022 at 6:16 pm PST\n\nAs America waits to see who will control Congress for the next two years, all eyes are turning to the West and races that haven\u2019t been called. Here are four of the most prominent national races that could swing the balance of power:\n\nARIZONA\n\nArizona Senate Race\nIncumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly is up against Republican Blake Masters. Kelly became the state\u2019s senator in 2020 after an election to fill a vacant seat when Republican Sen. John McCain died. Kelly is a former astronaut and Navy pilot whose platform focused on abortion and reproductive rights. The Trump-backed Masters\u2019 campaign focused on the economy and inflation. Masters was nominated by the GOP as a far-right candidate in a swing state. This race Kelly currently holds the lead with just under 70% of the votes being counted. This race is pivotal because it is one of three races that haven\u2019t been called yet that will decide which party controls the Senate.\n\nArizona Governor\nRepublican candidate Kari Lake, a vocal 2020 election denier, began questioning the election results in her race against Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs before the race had been called. Lake\u2019s election denialism has endeared her to former president Donald Trump, and she has made that the focal point of her campaign. Hobbs is currently the state\u2019s Secretary of State and has defended the 2020 election results. As of November 9 at 4 p.m., Hobbs leads with 50.22%.\n\nWhen Will We See Results?\nMaricopa County has the largest population in Arizona, which includes Phoenix and surrounding areas, so it will make the largest impact on the Senate race, but the ballot counting process is slow in the county. Maricopa County allows early votes received and verified by 5 p.m. on Saturday, November 5 to be released at 8 p.m. on election night. Votes received after 5 p.m. on Saturday are being counted with in-person votes. Election officials are expecting that 95 to 99% of the vote will be counted by Friday.\n\nNEVADA\n\nNevada Governor Race\nIncumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak trails behind Republican Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo with 77% of votes counted. Sisolak is seeking his second term after focusing on abortion access and past economic achievements, such as raising the minimum wage. The Trump-endorsed Lombardo has been vocal about his disapproval of Sisolak\u2019s stewardship of the state. The results are expected to be within an extremely close margin.\n\nNevada Senate Race\nNevada\u2019s United States Senate race is the most expensive political race in the state\u2019s history because it could decide which party controls the Senate. The margin between Democrat Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt has made the race still close to call. The candidates follow a national pattern of abortion access being one of the most important issues to voters. Masto campaigned on reproductive rights after the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court during summer. Laxalt has embraced more restrictive abortion policies, endorsing a ban after 13 weeks. Currently in Nevada, abortion is legal up to 24 weeks and later if there are health risks. Laxalt leads with 49.9% of votes.\n\nWhen Will We See Results?\nNevada has been a blue state with a majority of voters registered as Democrats, but this status is at risk based on voting turnout. The senate race only has 75% of votes counted. Mail-in ballots are now sent to every registered voter and can be counted if postmarked by election day. Cortez Mastro has a lead, but the race is still too close to call as Nevada law allows mail-in votes to be received up until November 12.\n```"}

Gavin Newsom was reelected as the governor of California and Nancy Pelosi retained her house seat Tuesday night.\n\nKaren Bass pictured at Dia de los Muertos Festival at 24th Street Theatre November 2.

(Photo by Jason Goode and Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Shreya Agrawal November 09, 2022 at 6:15 pm PST\n\nAs soon as polls closed in California, the race for governor was immediately called for current Governor Gavin Newsom, before any of the votes were counted. Democratic representative Nancy Pelosi also retained the House seat for her district in California. While Pelosi may have kept her seat, it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll retain her role as Speaker of the House. That\u2019s because the Republican Party is predicted to win a majority in the House. California Republican Kevin McCarthy, who is currently the minority leader in the House, will most likely become the next speaker.\n\nWhile the control of the Senate still hangs in the balance because of ongoing races in key battleground states, Democrats gained an advantage by flipping Pennsylvania with Democrat John Fetterman\u2019s win against Republican Mehmet [meh-MET] Oz, also known as Dr. Oz. The senate race in Georgia between Herschel Walker and Raphael Warnock proceeded to a runoff, and the races in Arizona and Nevada are still too close to call.\n\nThe Republican party had expected to win both the House and Senate with large margins, in what many predicted would be a red wave. But this wave failed to materialize. Many experts think that Donald Trump\u2019s influence in the midterm campaigns led to the election of other Republican candidates during the primaries. Officials say while these candidates initially had a strong following, their deeply divisive politics eventually turned away any voters who identified with more centrist values. Analysts suggest that Republicans with more centrist values performed much better in the election than Trump endorsed candidates.\n\nAlthough California is still counting votes, the fate of some of the state\u2019s ballot measures has already been decided. Prop 1 passed with a wide margin, protecting the right to reproductive freedom and abortion by adding it to the state\u2019s constitution. Prop 31, which bans the sale of flavored tobacco, also passed with great support. But Prop 29, which was on the ballot for a third time, and is a measure intended to increase medical staffing at dialysis centers, failed along with Proposition 30, which proposes an increase of taxes on the wealthy to fund the transition to electric vehicles.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the mayoral race between Karen Bass and Rick Caruso still remains undecided. At the time of this reporting, Caruso holds a slight lead of more than two percentage points over Bass but with more than half a million votes still uncounted, the race hasn\u2019t yet been called. Caruso seemed confident of a win at his election watch party last night.\n\nRick Caruso: \u201cSo we don\u2019t know the outcome yet, but we\u2019re starting out strong and we\u2019re a couple of thousand votes ahead, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nBut Bass hasn\u2019t given up hope either.\n\nKaren Bass: \u201cForward is where we are going, and together is how we will get there. Together we will get there because we will have a new Los Angeles. When we win, we will win. We will win.\u201d\n```"}

Young the Giant are an American rock band who have two Billboard top 10 albums and over five million monthly listeners on Spotify.\n\nThis is not the first time Sameer Gadhia, lead singer and co-founder of the band, has performed at USC. \u201cWhen we first started as a band, we used to always come to USC and just play random pop-up shows,\u201d Gadhia said. \u201cJust going back to our roots.\u201d\n\nSameer also visited USC twice in 2020: once to perform and another time to talk to students with the band at Bovard Auditorium, where Soni and Gadhia initially met. \u201cThey came to USC to do a panel discussion about some of the themes of their albums, which deal with migration and identity and belonging. And I really admired how profound they were,\u201d Soni said about his inspiration for hosting the concert.\n\n\u201cWe all lived in Venice, and I just kind of got to know them over the years and became a huge fan.\u201d The world renowned rock band found themselves in one of USC\u2019s more intimate venues Wednesday afternoon, performing on the steps of a building where students pray and worship.\n\nThe band recently released their album American Bollywood, which deals with themes of immigration and spirituality, making the center a fitting place for their performance. Most students crowded together at URC, stopping by the pop-up concert to enjoy the music. Other students even became part of the music.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m still processing. I think I\u2019m in shock,\u201d said Belle Wang, a senior who was invited to play viola with Young the Giant. \u201cTo always hear an artist\u2019s music and then to finally be able to play with them, especially in front of a live audience, I think that\u2019s something that I never thought I would be doing today.\u201d\n\nFour USC students were invited to play with Young the Giant, as the band was in need of string instruments. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat) The band needed string instruments for their show and invited a quartet of USC performance students to play with them last minute. They rehearsed together for the first time before the performance, much to the delight of the student performers who are all longtime fans of the band.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing. We were sitting there, we were playing, our arms were swinging. We were just in the motion of the song,\u201d said Evan Ilafet, a senior majoring in violin performance who played Wednesday. \u201cWe were vibing, we were going. A little scratch here, a little missed note there, but that\u2019s fine. You know, it is not classical music. This is not Schubert. This is Young the Giant.\u201d\n\nOutside of a center where students gather to pray, Young the Giant was joined by four USC students to play a short concert. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat) Ilafet\u2019s enthusiasm was shared by many of the band\u2019s fans, many of whom have grown up with the ever-changing styles of Young the Giant.\n\n\u201cThey started in high school. Like their first song was \u2018My Body,\u2019 that\u2019s a fun high school, college-sort of fraternity song,\u201d Soni said. \u201cBut now, 13 years later, they\u2019re singing about migration, memory, family history, spirituality. These are really profound sort of themes that the band themselves grew into. They\u2019re no longer in high school; they\u2019re in their early thirties. They have kids, right? So they\u2019re growing into their art as they\u2019re growing into their life and they\u2019re bringing their audience with them.\u201d\n\nThese themes of growth and finding identity in America also tap into the issue of media representation in America. Sameer Gadhia from Young the Giant singing.

If you\u2019re not familiar with it, you might be wondering what is League of Legends? Well, League of Legends is an intricate online MOBA, or multiplayer online battle arena, known for its split-second strategy and decision-making. Players battle against one another using various characters called champions, with each possessing a set of unique abilities and play styles. \u201cLeague\u201d pins two teams of five against each other with one common goal \u2014 taking out the enemy\u2019s base.\n\nLeague of Legends is insanely popular all around the world. Over 150 million players log in every month, and this weekend\u2019s event was a perfect example of the passion and community surrounding the game. (Crowd cheering \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d)\n\nFunny enough, League was created by two USC graduates, Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill. They attended USC together and bonded over their love for video games, and after college, they founded Riot Games out of their LA Apartment in 2006. In the years since, Beck and Merrill have developed Riot into a gaming powerhouse, developing other successful games such as Teamfight Tactics and Valorant alongside League of Legends. More groundbreaking games are on the way in the coming years from Riot, including a highly anticipated fighting game and an MMO or massive multiplayer online game.\n\nThey have also expanded far beyond video games. Riot created Arcane, an animated TV series that set the record as Netflix\u2019s highest-rated series within a week of its premiere in 2021. Imagine Dragons wrote and performed the theme song titled \u201cEnemy.\u201d (Enemy by Imagine Dragons) A second season is currently in production, and pop-star Lil Nas X is rumored to perform the theme song.\n\nBeyond that, Nas X seems to be getting more involved with Riot, even being named the President of League of Legends leading up to the big event. At a press conference before the World Finals, CEO of Riot Games Nicolo Laurent joked about Nas X leading the charge on creating a Riot Games Theme Park, but he was only half joking. Laurent said: Nicolo Laurent: I fundamentally believe that that\u2019s where the world is going in the 21st century, the center of gravity for entertainment - that\u2019s going to be gaming, that\u2019s going to be us.\n\nNas X and superstar Jackson Wang created music for the World Finals and performed during an impressive opening ceremony with stunning visuals and choreography on Saturday night. The production was off the charts like a Super Bowl Halftime Show. (STAR WALKIN\u2019 by Lil Nas X)\n\nRiot has been dreaming about creating a multi-generational entertainment company, which is becoming a reality. This past weekend, the World Finals was a perfect example with all kinds of events going on everyday. On Thursday and Friday nights, Riot put on a drone show over Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Over 100 drones took flight and lit up the sky with dazzling visuals, including the logos of each team competing in the Finals, the World Finals trophy, and the Riot Games logo. (Crowd reaction to drone show)\n\nRiot also hosted a massive Fan Fest event outside the Chase Center, where thousands of loyal League of Legends fans participated in exciting activities. Fans had the opportunity to play the game on the same setup that professionals use and could participate in exciting games to win free merchandise. Fans also attended meet and greets with their favorite league players and celebrities, including mega-popular live streamer Tyler1 and Game of Thrones actor DeObia Oparei, who voiced the newest champion in League of Legends, K\u2019Sante.\n\nOparei had no exposure to the gaming world before voicing K\u2019Sante and was amazed by the passion and community surrounding League. Oparei said: DeObia Oparei: Coming into this world, it\u2019s been an absolute joy to see the level of kind of heart in people like it really means something. It\u2019s like, wow.\n\nLike Nas X, Oparei derives so much purpose from his involvement with Riot, as both are proud advocates for diversity and representation of the LGBTQ community. DeObia Oparei: It\u2019s very meaningful for me because it\u2019s very important to me that because K\u2019Sante is, you know, a queer black LGBTQ champion. And the fact that I get to play that character and get get to be received by everyone here so warmly and celebrate it is awesome.\n\nInside the Chase Center for the World Finals, the energy and the crowd were electric. (Crowd cheering) The matchup was a perfect storyline between the greatest professional League of Legends player of all, Faker, and his long-time friend Deft. Their relationship dates back to their high school years, and while Faker has won the championship a record three times in the past, Deft had never won despite a very successful decade-long career.\n\nFaker plays for the esports organization T1, while Deft is a member of DRX. For context, T1 was a heavy favorite going into the tournament, while DRX was counted out. Very few people thought they had a chance to make it past the first round of playoffs.\n\nIn the end, the series went to the maximum five out of five games and surpassed all expectations. Deft and DRX ended up conquering Faker and T1, extinguishing years of demons and doubts. It was the perfect Cinderella story and the perfect way to wrap up an incredible weekend.

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Salome Nebiyu, Ben Cohen and Jack Hallinan\nNovember 09, 2022 at 6:07 pm PST\n\nAs crucial Senate races in the East have settled, the country has cast its eyes on Arizona, Nevada and California as Americans wait to see which party will control Congress, lead the Senate and the House of Representatives. While major Senate races are garnering most of the national media attention, California has tight House and local races that could take days or even weeks before the results are announced.\n\nWith the introduction of statewide measures to make voting easier for California citizens over the past two decades, it takes longer to count all the votes. Since 2015, a state law has permitted any mail-in ballot postmarked by Election Day to be counted as long as it arrives by the following Friday, meaning California will not even receive all eligible votes until the end of the day Friday. And as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, even more voters are using mail-in ballots.\n\nKamy Akhavan, director of USC\u2019s Center for the Political Future, said that the proliferation of mail-in ballots is the exact reason California\u2019s elections require more time to decide. \u201cCalifornia uses mail-in ballots, and those ballots are not counted until and starting on election day itself,\u201d Akhavan said. \u201cThat means that all the ballots that have yet to arrive over the coming days and that are still postmarked on or before November 8 will take time to count. Most other states do not have 100% mail-in ballots and many other states unlike California start counting their mailed-in ballots as they are received rather than after the election.\u201d\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, California voters do not mind the longer wait times as long as they have multiple opportunities to cast their ballot. The poll found that 64% of voters can tolerate the delay in results provided the state keeps their voting options open.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the hotly-contested mayoral race between Rick Caruso and Karen Bass could take weeks to determine. The latest update from the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk\u2019s office came Wednesday morning. With 44% of votes counted, Caruso held a 51.2% majority to Bass\u2019s 48.8%. The office will not provide another update until Friday, November 11 between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. The next update comes Tuesday, November 15 during the same time frame. From there, additional updates will continue on the same Friday-Tuesday schedule.\n\nElsewhere in Southern California, there will likely be similar delays in calling some of the closer House races. In a particularly close race in California District 47, Democrat Katie Porter leads Scott Baugh 50.3% to 49.7% with a difference of just under 1,000 votes. The Orange County district was redrawn ahead of this race, and experts anticipate it to lean slightly Democratic.\n\nIncumbent Representative Mike Levin leads District 49, which splits both southern Orange County and San Diego County, 51% to 49% with 46% of votes counted. In the Orange County portion of the district, Levin\u2019s Republican challenger Brian Maryott leads 56% to 44%.\n\nAt the state level, the Associated Press called the Senate race in favor of Democratic Incumbent Alex Padilla, the former California Secretary of State running for a full-term after being appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to replace former Sen. Kamala Harris when she became Vice President of the United States.\n```"}

But their home has changed a great deal over the past few decades. BIANCHI: So climate change is obviously driving enormous changes in the land and oceanic ecosystems. Warming is probably the most direct influence of climate change and it\u2019s caused by greenhouse gasses. So it starts in the atmosphere and as the atmosphere warms, the ocean warms as well. And in fact, the oceans are taking up most of the heat.\n\nDaniele Bianchi is an Associate Professor at UCLA in the Oceanic Science Department and an Oceanographer with a specialty in ocean biogeochemistry. Bianchi\u2019s work shows that not all aquatic environments experience warming at the same rates. BIANCHI: This warming in the ocean starts at the surface of the ocean. So we have been observing higher and higher temperatures right at the surface of the ocean. In general, coastal water might warm faster because, you know, it\u2019s harder to mix them as deep as they are at the very open ocean or close to the poles.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Public Health, an outbreak of Norovirus infections, an illness that causes vomiting, stomach cramping, and in some cases, a fever and chills, was linked to raw oysters imported from British Columbia, Canada. Oysters cluster in coastal waters, near the surface - an area ripe for higher ocean temperatures. A study from the United Kingdom\u2019s, University of Plymouth Marine Biology Centre found \u201cthat the enhanced accumulation of copper in Pacific oysters may be of future concern in terms of consumption safety.\u201d\n\nBut rising ocean temperatures are also causing a scarcity issue within the seafood industry. Tim Ratcliff is owner of Shin Sushi, a restaurant in Hollywood, California. RATCLIFF: It causes problems with receiving services to be out of stuff and just unsure when we\u2019ll be able to get in. It was just literally, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d But yeah, we\u2019re still going. Right now at the start of the season, uni, we should be able to get it, still struggling to get that one to.\n\nBianchi thinks that climate change is likely to blame for this issue too. BIANCHI: One impact of warming on fisheries is really migration of species. And so some of the changes in, for example, in parasites or diseases carried by raw seafood consumption may also have to do with the movement of fish stocks or changes in the population that are driven by the warming. Changes in movement means fish populating in areas that are different from their normal migration patterns. For seafood suppliers, this means adopting a better understanding of those patterns in conjunction with climate change.\n\nBIANCHI: We have been seeing over the years, periods of relatively warmer or cooler conditions that have very different species. Sometimes you have tropical species coming in when one is especially warm, and then if the conditions cool again, more and more certain species come in.\n\nSo how do you avoid getting sick while still enjoying your favorite seafood? The CDC suggests understanding the quality of water in the area you are getting your seafood from. If you\u2019re eating from an area experiencing an algae bloom, avoid shellfish altogether. Annenberg Media reached out to California Department of Public Health for a direct comment but we have not heard back.\n```"}

Wade ruling, abortion rights had a big night, led by Proposition 1 in California. According to results, which are still being counted, more than 3.4 million voted to make access to abortion a constitutional right in the state of California. Many elections, like the Los Angeles mayoral race, will not be called for days or even weeks, but Prop. 1 won overnight. With only 42% of the vote in, the race for Prop. 1 was called to win with nearly two-thirds majority favoring the vote.\n\nMany USC students met the results with excitement and hope for what it means going forward. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting,\u201d said junior Celine Vazquez. \u201cI hope other states follow through. Abortion rights should be protected across the whole country. Abortion is just a form of health care. So having access to it when you\u2019re young, having access to it when you\u2019re old, one should have access to it, period.\u201d\n\nJunior Emily Sabinas also praised the result and California\u2019s role in protecting access to abortion. \u201cIt makes me feel thankful that I live in this state that really cares for women\u2019s right to choose whatever she wants to do with her body,\u201d Sabinas said.\n\nWhile several students praised the move and the election result, the discussion around abortion remains contentious and not everyone was happy to see the proposition pass. Trojans for Life, an anti-abortion rights club at USC, remain firmly against Proposition 1. Morgan Farrier, president of Trojans for Life, told Annenberg Media that the proposition goes too far, arguing that the move \u201cmakes all abortions at any point in pregnancy legal.\u201d\n\nA big dispute over Prop. 1 focused on whether it will allow for late-term abortions, a question Republican campaigns around the country asked following last summer\u2019s Supreme Court ruling. According to the Associated Press, \u201cCalifornia already prohibits most abortions after fetal viability, defined in state law as the point during a pregnancy at which there is a reasonable likelihood of the fetus\u2019 sustained survival outside the uterus.\u201d But Farrier argued that the fetus\u2019s rights were just as important as those of the mother. \u201cI think on either end of the spectrum, you either have a human rights violation of the fetus\u2019s right to life or you have a human rights violation of bodily autonomy,\u201d said Farrier.\n\nBut Prop. 1 advocates argued that the measure will grant many women with underlying health conditions access to abortions that would keep them safe and healthy. \u201cI have some health conditions that would make being pregnant super dangerous for me,\u201d junior Georgia Danehy said. \u201cAnd it really scares me how a lot of places would value the life of a fetus over me.\u201d\n\nNationally, five states had abortion-related measures on the ballot this election day. In Vermont and Michigan, similar ballot measures affirmed abortion rights. Newly re-elected Gov. Gavin Newsom, who spearheaded the state\u2019s response to the fall of Roe, led a Prop. 1 rally asking voters to \u201cVote Yes.\u201d \u201cWe have affirmed we are a true freedom state,\u201d Newsom said.\n```"}

The Yes jar was filled to the top while the No jar was filled halfway. Likewise, partial returns in California showed Proposition 1 leading with 65% of the vote, which was expected by many. The measure was projected to pass, but many supporters desired a decisive win to send the clear message that abortion is legal and accessible in California, encouraging other states to do the same.\n\nNative California student Alexa Karlin, expressed how this news filled her with pride for her state. Karlin: I think in light of everything that happened over the summer with Roe v Wade being overturned, with the Dobbs decision, I think it\u2019s amazing to hear that Californians are very strongly supporting a woman\u2019s right to choose. And I hope that other states will follow with their propositions and that they\u2019ll pass.\n\nRebecca Carlson, a graduate student studying Philosophy, explained how Prop 1 contrast to laws in her home state of Washington. Carlson: I think Prop 1 is more preventing of abortion restrictions than anything we have in the Constitution in Washington state. But Washington is a fairly, generally pro-choice state, so it\u2019s fairly similar that way.\n\nThis was a sentiment shared by Gavin Newsom after the ballot measure passed. Newsom: We affirmed clearly with conviction, that we are true freedom state. That we embrace the rights of women and girls.\n\nVoters in Vermont and Michigan also chose to enshrine the right to abortion and contraception in their state constitution. Only time will tell if other states follow suit.\n```"}

Will we ever see legalized sports gambling in the Golden State?\n\nBetting odds for Super Bowl LV are displayed on monitors at the Circa resort and casino sports book in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)\n\nBy Ian Roddy November 09, 2022 at 5:41 pm PST\n\nAfter months and months of record spending and an endless barrage of attack ads, the battle for the future of sports betting in California came to an end yesterday... or maybe more of an impasse. Despite an overwhelming decision by California voters to reject Propositions 26 and 27 during Tuesday\u2019s election, experts are convinced that big betting corporations like FanDuel and DraftKings are sure to loop back around for another try on the 2024 ballot.\n\nBut first, it\u2019s important to understand why exactly voters in California so overwhelmingly struck down something that hasn\u2019t faced much resistance anywhere else. Spokesperson for No on 27, Kathy Fairbanks, says it\u2019s in large part due to the way they\u2019ve presented it here.\n\nKathy Fairbanks: They\u2019re promoting it as a solution to homelessness. And, you know... the voters aren\u2019t buying that. Voters don\u2019t believe that funding is the only problem that we, you know, funding for homeless programs isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s government bureaucracy. It\u2019s red tape. It\u2019s bad policy, all of that -- none of which is, you know, considered in Prop 27.\n\nA large part of it also has to do with the betting corporations underestimating the support voters have for California native tribes. Jacob Mejia: I mean, I think for companies that make their money setting lines, they obviously totally blew this one. Jacob Mejia is the executive director of the Tribal Alliance of Sovereign Indian Nations.\n\nJacob Mejia: By voting no, the voters just reinforced their strong support for tribes and their staunch opposition to online gaming. Again, though, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the possibility of sports betting in California is completely dead. Rather, it means the betting corporations will need to reconvene and prepare for another approach.\n\nWith over $3 billion in potential revenue on the table, they almost certainly won\u2019t be walking away quietly. FanDuel CEO Amy Howe even said at the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas last month, \u201cWe absolutely live to fight another day,\u201d referring to sports betting in California.\n\nBut how exactly could sports betting become legalized in California? After all, the measures didn\u2019t just fail, they failed overwhelmingly, with the results currently trending toward an 80-20 split. Gary Painter is the executive director of the USC Homelessness Policy Research Institute. He says it will more than likely be on the 2024 ballot, but he\u2019d prefer it go through California Legislature like it has in other states.\n\nGary Painter: What I\u2019d like of our representatives who have some expertise in a variety of areas as it relates to California\u2019s finances and etc. to actually come up with a law and then debate that law, and then that\u2019s something that the governor can sign.\n\nWhether it appears on the 2024 ballot or is handled by the state government itself, one thing is clear: betting corporations made a severe miscalculation in their expansion to California.\n```"}

The Town and Gown event commemorated the program\u2019s success, and gave JEP volunteers, faculty and student workers a chance to get together and show gratitude for the program\u2019s mission.\n\nWhat is JEP? Since 1972, JEP has been pairing USC students with local community organizations, like schools and nonprofits, in Downtown Los Angeles. In particular, students can tutor local kids and formulate lesson plans for elementary school students while, in exchange, volunteering and earn work-study or volunteer hours.\n\n\u201cWe had so many people that had gone through JEP and now do great things in the world,\u201d said Kathrin Rising, JEP\u2019s director of communications. \u201cThe program touches so many people and seeing everyone come together at this event was incredible.\u201d\n\nAs a service-learning program for students and community members alike, JEP teaches lessons about mental and physical well-being. From the Little Yoginis, a yoga program with local communities to a series of lessons introducing conflict resolution and self-awareness, JEP shows topics students can learn beyond their academics.\n\nThe program also introduced the first federal work-study opportunity to enlist college students to help improve math and reading skills of K-12 students. The ReadersPLUS Math and Literacy Tutoring program commends a wide variety of tutoring opportunities at local institutions like the USC Hybrid High School near campus.\n\nHow can students become more involved with JEP? Currently, there are four core programs to get involved with JEP. Students can serve elementary through high school students in a variety of subjects. JEP continues to expand their program and discover topics like science learning experiences and lessons on active listening.\n\n\u201cMy experience in this program brought back my passion for working with kids,\u201d said Sebastian Rodriguez, a sophomore enrolled in an Oceanography course that offers extra credit opportunities through JEP. Rodriguez volunteers as a tutor for elementary school students. \u201c[The kids] absolutely love college students...whenever I walk into class, they start smiling and get really excited. I think it\u2019s really important for us, as individuals, to remember what it felt like to be a kid and make meaningful memories with them.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for JEP? After their 50th anniversary, JEP hopes to offer virtual service activities. \u201cThe joint program continues to provide what is needed to match and emulate the environment that we continue to serve \u2013 and that truly is the beauty of it.\u201d said Sharon Blount, JEP\u2019s office manager. She has served as part of the JEP community for five years.\n\n\u201cThe opportunities we have offered for the past 40 years have changed...like going from virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. JEP has continued to evolve into what the current community needs,\u201d Blount said.\n\nOne of JEP\u2019s focuses for the future is offering STEM tutoring and learning services to all students in K12 schools, not just K-6. \u201cThe program really does their best to actually ask the community what they need and what they want versus the savior complex aspect of it to be like, I\u2019m going to give this to you because I can and I see the need,\u201d said DJ Kast, director of STEM education programs.\n\nTo learn more about JEP, visit their homepage here or contact jephouse@usc.edu for more information.

But will their voices have an impact on the electorate?\n\nPhoto courtesy of Erik (HASH) Hersman via Flickr.\n\nBy Chris Bibona, Haylee Clophus, Aaron Goldstein, Lorenzo Arce, and Jason Pham\nNovember 09, 2022 at 4:52 pm PST\n\nKim Kardashian took to Instagram to endorse Rick Caruso. Lin Manuel Miranda stumped for Raphael Warnock. Kerry Washington went on a nationwide endorsement tour in support of several members of the Democratic party. While not a new phenomenon, celebrity endorsement of politicians has become more widespread and the weight behind them has increasingly become a topic of debate and curiosity.\n\nMore recently, Katy Perry posted an Instagram selfie Monday in front of a voting machine queued to select L.A. mayoral candidate Rick Caruso. \u201cI am voting for a myriad of reasons (see the news) but in particular because Los Angeles is a hot mess [at the moment],\u201d Perry captioned the post.\n\nIn spite of the popularity of using celebrities on both sides of the political aisle to sway voters, the effectiveness and true influence of the method is often questioned. \u201cCelebrities are people just like us, only with a different occupation and different given circumstances,\u201d said Shyheim Carter, a graduate student studying acting. \u201cI don\u2019t let their decisions sway how I live my life or what decisions I make because often what is affecting them is not going to be affecting me.\u201d\n\nC.J. Craig, a senior majoring in theater, thinks similarly, specifying how celebrity influence can be both beneficial and detrimental during elections. \u201cI do feel like celebrities do have a chance to sway people\u2019s mindsets and move towards progressive actions,\u201d Craig said. \u201cBut also at the same time, their actions can move them the wrong way.\u201d\n\nFreshman business administration major Joseph Good favored celebrity endorsements. \u201cI know Lebron James is pretty left-leaning overall, and I would say he definitely has impacted some of the ways that I view certain issues,\u201d Good said.\n\nResearch tends to side with Good\u2019s sentiment. A study conducted by Columbia University concludes that Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement of Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary had a statistically significant effect on the political outcomes that followed. A study done by Northwestern University came to similar conclusions, citing increased voter turnout and campaign contributions after Winfrey\u2019s endorsement.\n\nHowever, Mary Murphy, USC Annenberg associate professor and former Entertainment Tonight correspondent, argued that some celebrities have more of an impact on elections than others. \u201cI think in terms of voting, the celebrities that count are former presidents,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Hollywood celebrities make a difference.\u201d\n\nMurphy also explained how celebrities tend to impact their audiences through their projects and advocating for important issues, more so than who celebrities endorse politically. Regardless of viewpoints of individuals, it is clear that well-regarded celebrities, in the eyes of the public, have sway in regard to election outcomes.\n\nTaylor Swift famously endorsed Democratic nominee Phil Bredesen in the 2018 midterm election for one of Tennessee\u2019s seats on the Senate. Bredesen was ultimately defeated by incumbent senator Marsha Blackburn. Several mainstream media outlets, such as CNN and the Guardian, reported on the coincidental increase of registered voters in the days after Swift made her statement, but no concrete line was drawn between the two.\n\nSome celebrities have less coherent endorsements. Former fashion mogul and rapper Ye, formally known as Kanye West, endorsed Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential elections, then denounced him before launching his own presidential run.\n\nCelebrity endorsements of politicians date back to the 1920s when Al Jolson, the first actor with a speaking role in non-silent film, endorsed Warren G. Harding for president as head of the \u201cHarding-Coolidge Theatrical League,\u201d a coalition of 70 other early film actors and jazz musicians. Harding won the election with 60.3% of the popular vote against James Cox who had 34.1%, the largest difference in votes at the time.\n\n\u201cI think celebrity influence is more important in terms of issues... in terms of voter turnout, I\u2019m not sure it has any impact at all,\u201d said Murphy, adding that the power of celebrities relies on longer actions. \u201cIf Leonardo DiCaprio speaks in front of the United Nations about climate change and makes films about climate change ... that has an impact.\u201d```"}

(AP Photo/Karl B DeBlaker)\n\nBy Adam Bradford November 09, 2022 at 4:18 pm PST\n\nLast Thursday, author Pat Pickens spoke with USC Annenberg\u2019s sports and social change class on his book, \u201cThe Whalers: The Rise, Fall, and Enduring Mystique of New England\u2019s (Second) Greatest NHL Franchise.\u201d Published in October 2021, the book discusses the rise, fall and legacy of the NHL\u2019s Hartford Whalers. Originally founded in 1972 as a member of the World Hockey Association (WHA), the Whalers joined the NHL in 1979 as part of the NHL-WHA merger. They would serve as Hartford\u2019s NHL team for nearly two decades, before moving to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1997. Today, the Whalers are known as the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nIn Pickens\u2019 research, the Whalers have come to serve as a case study in the existence of small-market teams in professional sports. With just over 120,000 inhabitants, Hartford ranks outside of the top 200 most populous cities in the United States. By contrast, the NHL\u2019s current smallest market \u2014 Buffalo, New York \u2014 ranks 78th with over 275,000 inhabitants, more than double the size of Hartford.\n\nHartford\u2019s small size was a major factor in the financial issues that ultimately led to the Whalers\u2019 demise, according to Pickens. Fans of visiting hockey teams are far more likely to prefer traveling to Nashville or Las Vegas \u2014 cities that the NHL has expanded to in recent decades \u2014 than Hartford to watch their team play a game. In addition, during the 1990s, many NHL teams moved into newer, more modern arenas, such as TD Garden in Boston (Bruins), Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. (Capitals) and Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia (Flyers). However, as a result of their financial pitfalls, the city of Hartford could not afford to upgrade the Hartford Civic Center, where the Whalers played their home games, in line with other modern arenas.\n\nWhen Raleigh offered the team the new arena that Hartford could not, they decided to make the move, and the Whalers were no more. Pickens argued that the team\u2019s failure to win a Stanley Cup in Hartford ultimately doomed their time there. He pointed out that during the early 1990s, the New Jersey Devils were also rumored to be considering a move. After the Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995, however, increased fan support prompted them to stay in New Jersey. The Whalers, by contrast, only won one playoff series from the time that they joined the NHL in 1979 until they left Hartford.\n\nDuring their final five seasons of existence, the Whalers did not qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs and were therefore unable to galvanize enough local fan support to justify staying in Hartford. In Carolina, the team has had much more success, winning the Stanley Cup in 2006 and making several other deep playoff runs in recent years.\n\nThose Whalers fans that did exist, however, faced a dilemma once the team left. Should they follow the franchise to Raleigh, a city that most Whalers fans had no connection to? Or should they pick another team to support instead? The fact that the current closest NHL team to Hartford, the Boston Bruins, were the Whalers\u2019 biggest rival further complicated matters.\n\nAlthough the Whalers left Hartford 25 years ago, their legacy still lives on to this day. In recent years, the Carolina Hurricanes have begun to host \u201cWhalers Nights,\u201d when the team wears throwback jerseys and uses Brass Bonanza, the Whalers\u2019 official anthem, as its goal song. However, according to Pickens, this has drawn a mixed reaction among former fans of the Whalers. While many of them appreciate the team paying homage to its Hartford roots, others feel as though it is further rubbing salt in the wound of having lost the team.\n\nHaving grown up in New Jersey, somewhat of a smaller market in itself, Pickens himself experienced numerous different emotions with regard to relocation. In addition to the Devils flirting with leaving during his childhood, the New Jersey Nets left for Brooklyn in 2012, depriving the region of its NBA team, and leaving the Devils as the only franchise with the New Jersey name. (Although the NFL\u2019s New York Giants and Jets both technically play their home games in New Jersey.)\n\nHence, beyond telling the story of the Whalers, Pickens wrote the book in order to detail both the experience of being a fan of a small market and watching that team leave your city.\n```"}

According to CNN politics, the Republican Senate Candidate in Nevada, Adam Laxalt, has a 2% lead against the incumbent, Catherine Cortez Masto\u2013with 80% of the vote in. Although this is a small lead, and CNN has called the race too close to call. Nevada\u2019s potentially flipped seat could determine which party controls the United States Senate. This control determines multiple issues, such as reproductive rights, the DACA program, voter rights, and much more. The turnout of the Latinx population in the state of Nevada is crucial to this race.\n\nUSC Sol Price School of Public Policy professor and USC Annenberg expert on Latinx public opinion, Roberto Suro, explains the significance. \u201cThe future of the United States Senate could be decided by a couple of barrios in East Las Vegas and in southern Phoenix.\u201d he said. \u201cDemocratic candidates have to get two-thirds or better of the Latino vote...It\u2019s enough to tilt the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nAs much as these candidates appeal to the Latinx population of the United States, specifically in Nevada and Arizona, Latinx turnout in the history of United States elections has been substantially low. \u201cThere are 30 million eligible [Latinx] voters...only one in five Latinos eligible to vote register.\u201d said Suro.\n\nAccording to Professor Suro, the Hispanic population in the United States is very different from the Hispanic electorate. There are two very important characteristics of the population in the U.S.: Approximately half are under 18 and are too young to vote. About half of all Latinos are not United States citizens and therefore cannot vote. When you take those who fall into this category of the Latinx population out, there are approximately 30-34 million eligible voters. Among these voters, only about 15 million actually set out to vote.\n\nThough there is no specific reasoning that political scientists have found, Suro explains that both major parties do not try hard enough to get the Latinx ticket. \u201cParty organizations have not made a big effort and outreach. Republicans think [Latinx voters] will be Democratic voters and Democrats make strategic decisions not to [appeal to the Latinx population]...[Democrats] have not significantly closed the [voting] gap.\u201d said Suro.\n\nThis outreach is needed to make those eligible to vote feel engaged with their community and to feel that their voice (and vote) matters. So, if you are hesitant to vote \u2013 or do not know where to start \u2013 please set out and make your voice heard. There are many more elections besides the Presidential elections that matter in predominantly Hispanic communities, and those that are not eligible to vote, need those in our community to be that voice for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your future...You\u2019ve got your whole life in front of you. Voting will determine the [kind of] country you\u2019re living in,\u201d Suro notes as his last point.\n\nVOTING RESOURCES: Register to vote Check voter status\n```"}

Associate head coach Beth Burns, who has a more hard-nosed, defensive approach to coaching, led the team in her absence and was interim head coach for its exhibition game against Cal State L.A. on October 30.\n\n\u201cI was really impressed with our players\u2019 grit and work ethic while I was gone,\u201d Gottlieb said after officially returning to the Trojans\u2019 bench for the first time since the birth of her daughter last month. \u201cI don\u2019t think [the players] realize it \u2014 they have an energy about them, and they\u2019re building a culture and habits. I think a lot of that Coach Burns took on herself, but I think the players really embraced it too.\u201d\n\nUSC dictated the game in the paint from the get-go. Without making a shot from more than two feet away from the basket, the Trojans got out to a quick 10-0 lead. The tall, talented frontcourt duo of graduate forward Kadi Sissoko and sophomore guard Rayah Marshall proved difficult for the Roadrunners to defend, with both making frequent cuts in behind the defense and then using their height to get easy buckets at the rim.\n\nThe Trojans had their way on the other end of the floor, too, likely to the delight of Coach Burns. CSU Bakersfield was held without a point for the opening six minutes, and its first points came via the free throw line. The Roadrunners didn\u2019t make their first field goal until under a minute left in the first quarter, and USC had already opened up a 20-2 lead by then.\n\nWith a commanding lead right away, Gottlieb wasn\u2019t afraid to rotate early and often given the team\u2019s many new faces. Ten players, including all seven transfers, saw action for USC in just the first quarter. Two transfers, Littleton and junior forward Koi Love, saw their first game action in cardinal and gold after missing the exhibition game due to injury. Each had a strong debut, with Littleton contributing 13 points and five assists and Love adding six points and seven boards.\n\n\u201cIt feels good to be back home, to finally wear this jersey, to finally represent USC like I have always wanted my whole life,\u201d Littleton, a San Diego native, said. Littleton struggled from behind the arc, going 0-for-6 for the game, but had a lot of success drawing contact. She went to the line six times in the first half alone and didn\u2019t miss a free throw.\n\nSissoko was impressive on offense, especially when she beat a Roadrunner off the dribble for a layup that put the USC bench on its feet in the second quarter. After 11-of-14 shooting from the field in the Trojans\u2019 exhibition game, she remained efficient on Tuesday, making five of six shots in the first half.\n\nThough not quite as commanding as the first quarter, the game remained all Trojans through the remainder of the first half. They led CSU Bakersfield 46-14 at halftime; the Roadrunners had more turnovers (12) than field goals (5).\n\nNevertheless, it wasn\u2019t a perfect game by USC, who still has room for improvement given its massive roster turnover this past offseason. In fact, speaking of turnovers, the Trojans had 11 in the first half. USC also couldn\u2019t find much of a rhythm from 3-point range either, starting the game 3-of-13 from deep.\n\nHowever, the Trojans ironed out those issues at the start of the second half. They turned the ball over only three times in the third quarter, while still having success in the fast break. Sophomore guard Bella Perkins also caught fire from behind the arc, cashing in a trio of triples in the third.\n\n\u201cI really trust in our ability to shoot,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI did feel like they were starting to pack the paint at the end of the first half...I thought the kick might be out and we were able to do that.\u201d\n\nBut USC\u2019s defense remained stellar throughout the contest. CSU Bakersfield had another scoreless stretch of over five minutes that bridged halftime and missed its first 10 threes of the game. Marshall, who continues to emerge as one of college basketball\u2019s elite defenders, had five rebounds, three blocks and two steals in the third quarter alone, playing just six minutes in that period.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we expect of her,\u201d Gottlieb said of Marshall\u2019s defensive performance, as she finished with a double-double that included 12 points, 10 rebounds, four blocks and three steals in total. \u201cHer timing on shot blocking is really impeccable ... She hasn\u2019t even reached her ceiling.\u201d\n\nUSC took its foot off the gas pedal slightly in the second half, though the Trojans were still clearly the better team all game. Graduate transfer guard Okako Adika started the fourth quarter strong, scoring seven points in under two minutes. She finished with 15 points on 5-of-7 shooting, including 3-of-4 from 3-point range.\n\nThe TCU transfer could be a very important piece for USC all year, as she appears to be one of the team\u2019s more consistent scorers outside the paint. Despite some inconsistency with turning the ball over, the Trojans\u2019 ball movement was a bright spot overall for the game. USC had 24 assists on 30 made field goals.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re at our best, the ball is moving,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI actually think our turnovers come when we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\n\nUSC is back in action this Saturday against Idaho State, with tip-off at Galen Center scheduled for 7 p.m.\n```"}

The belief that voter fraud is prevalent in our country has been a flashpoint among many Republicans since former President Donald Trump claimed it was rampant after losing the last presidential election.\n\nIra Reiner, the former district attorney of L.A. County and the current fall 2022 fellow for the Center for the Political Future at USC Dornsife, said that the rise in authoritarianism is due to \u201cTrumpism,\u201d which is threatening democracy in the United States. \u201cTrumpism, which goes beyond Trump himself, has metastasized and has infected the Republican party, so that there are those who are true believers and those who know better but have made a bargain to go along with Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nDaniel Schnur, a political communication professor at USC, said he doesn\u2019t believe that voter fraud is rampant. \u201cThere are very limited cases of voter fraud in our country, not nearly enough to sway an election, but these incidents do happen and they deserve to be addressed,\u201d Schnur said. According to Schnur, both Democratic and Republican parties use the idea of voter suppression as a \u201cway to frighten their loyalists to vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is certainly a major contributor to this discussion, but it existed before he ever ran for office and it will exist [for] a long time after he\u2019s gone. There\u2019s no question that he elevated these fears to a much greater level,\u201d Schnur said.\n\nUSC students acknowledge the possibility of voter fraud but don\u2019t believe it is a game changer in elections. \u201cVoter fraud is a thing, but it\u2019s so rare that it\u2019s almost not a fake,\u201d Joseph Hyslope, a junior majoring in journalism, said. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s not a real concern. Despite what some political parties say, mail-in ballots don\u2019t really pose a security issue or a fraud issue. It\u2019s just as secure as throwing a ballot in person.\u201d\n\nAnother student shared similar sentiments to Hyslope. \u201cI don\u2019t think that voter fraud is a real thing,\u201d said Ire Omitowoju, a junior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. \u201dI think every vote counts. And even though it just seems like you\u2019re one person, everyone should go out and do it because it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nAmanda Omehe, a sophomore cognitive science major, feels that although voter fraud may occur, it doesn\u2019t significantly impact the outcome. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past anybody,\u201d Omehe said. \u201cI think that there probably are some fraudulent ballots that get counted, but I don\u2019t think it has any real effect on the outcome.\u201d\n\nOmehe feels that our voting system is fair and needs to focus on making information about candidates more accessible to young voters. \u201cI believe that voter fraud exists, but I tend to believe that the ballot that I sent, even though it wasn\u2019t even in person, will be counted accurately,\u201d said Parker Bond, a sophomore majoring in acting for the stage, screen and new media.\n```"}

Marco Rubio won their races in the midterm elections Tuesday night. Incumbent candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis won by a large margin against Democrat Charlie Crist. Politico reported that this is the widest winning margin in a Florida gubernatorial race (57-42) since Jeb Bush\u2019s 2002 win.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, DeSantis is widely seen as the \u201cRepublican who poses the biggest threat to Donald J.

These wins mark a significant shift to the right for the swing state, according to the New York Times\u2019 Lazaro Gamio.

The final results will likely not be known until Wednesday or even later.\n\nShrum cited Pennsylvania, where Dr. Mehmet Oz faces John Fetterman in a tight race for one of the state\u2019s Senate seats. Oz won the Republican primary riding with the support of Donald Trump, which was enough to give him a narrow victory over his opponent David McCormick.\n\n\u201cIf Dr. Oz\u2019s major opponent had won the Republican primary, I think he would probably win the race,\u201d Shrum said. \u201cOz still might win, but he is a weaker candidate.\u201d\n\nAt the time of publication, Fetterman was leading the race with 49.4% of the vote compared to Oz\u2019s 48.3%, and with 71% of Pennsylvania votes counted.\n\nThe watch party, which Shrum co-hosted with Christina Bellantoni, director of the USC Annenberg Media Center, included Noelia Rodriguez, a career communications and politics expert; Todd Purdum, a political journalist; Ira Reiner, the former Los Angeles County district attorney; and Muna Shikaki, a career political journalist and Washington correspondent.\n\nThe impact of Trump\u2019s 2020 election denial also continues to ripple across the midterm elections, even influencing several outcomes, according to Shrum. At the time of publishing, Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Rapahel Warnock received 200,000 more votes than Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, which could carry Warnock to victory. At the time of publishing, Walker leads Warnock by 1,000 votes, with 89% of the vote counted.\n\nShrum theorized that the difference between Warnock\u2019s and Abrams\u2019 results was due to their opponents: Warnock was running against Herschel Walker, an avid Trump supporter who denied the results of the 2020 election, while Abrams faced Republican governor Brian Kemp, who certified Georgia\u2019s election results in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe bigger philosophical question about the impact of Donald Trump is the denier question, and that really is what hurts our form of democracy,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cProbably for the first time in history, [a state\u2019s] secretary of state position is more important than ever, because people don\u2019t just think of it as an administrative role, but a role in certifying elections.\u201d\n\nHowever, not all of Donald Trump\u2019s favored candidates face tight opposition. In Ohio, JD Vance, the Trump-backed candidate for Senate defeated Democratic opponent Tim Ryan, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe simply have a very closely divided country,\u201d Purdum said of the gap between the two parties. \u201cIt is not lopsided one way or the other.\u201d\n\nThe event was sponsored by the Annenberg Media Center in partnership with the Political Student Assembly, Trojan Democrats, USC College Republicans, Vote SC, USC Political Union, USC Undergraduate Student Government, USC Student Affairs, The Moderator, and YPO LA Chapter.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)\n\nBy Colton Lucas November 08, 2022 at  8:41 pm PST\n\nAs voters continue to make their way to polling stations nationwide, there\u2019s growing uncertainty among Democrats and Republicans that the results will be in their favor. Contentions continue to rise over gubernatorial, mayoral and representative races, but the fight for control of the Senate has garnered major publicity in the months leading up to the election. Democrats hold 14 seats that are up for reelection this cycle, while Republicans hold 21. Despite the difference, early polling indicates that Republicans could gain back power in the Senate.\n\nThere are numerous contested battleground states fighting for Senate control, but there are eight key races that could determine whether President Biden\u2019s political agenda is uprooted or remains afloat.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is currently one of only a handful of states with both a Democratic and Republican senator. After Republican incumbent Pat Toomey announced he would not seek reelection, two prominent figures jumped at the chance to take over his seat in the Capitol. The contentious battle between Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and multimillionaire TV personality Mehmet Oz sparked a series of internet memes and online debate criticizing both candidates.\n\nFetterman faced heavy criticism from conservatives regarding whether he could perform the duties of a U.S. senator after suffering a stroke in late May. While Fetterman maintains he\u2019s healthy and recovering, Oz\u2019s campaign has homed in on the medical emergency in numerous political advertisements since.\n\nOn the flip side, Fetterman\u2019s campaign has questioned Oz\u2019s ability to connect with Pennsylvania voters, often poking fun at Oz\u2019s residency in New Jersey and lack of knowledge on popular Pennsylvanian culture.\n\nA Fetterman win would signify a major victory for Democrats, but an Oz win could lead to the Senate being under GOP control depending on the results in other battleground states.\n\nDr. Michael Berkman, director of the McCourtney Institute for Democracy at the Pennsylvania State University, said the fate of the Senate is \u201con a razor\u2019s edge,\u201d and the chance for Democrats to flip the seat is a major opportunity.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania law, mail-in ballots cannot be processed until the day of the election resulting in a similar situation to the 2020 election, Berkman said. There will likely be early signs of overwhelming Republican support due to in-person voting, but as mail-in ballots begin to be counted throughout the day, and possibly the week, the results could shift to Democratic candidates.\n\nAn early \u201cwave of red\u201d could easily be subdued by mail-in votes, a majority of which are casted by Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe reason Pennsylvania is so important is that it\u2019s the opportunity for Democrats to flip the seat,\u201d Berkman said. \u201cIf the Democrats could hold their seats and flip one, then they\u2019re in an entirely different position than they are right now \u2014 But that means they can\u2019t lose any. There are seats that are clearly at risk of being lost.\u201d\n\nGeorgia\n\nAfter a major win during the 2020 Georgia special election that helped flip the state blue, Democratic incumbent Sen. Rapahel Warnock is now facing down an ex-footballer turned politician: Herschel Walker.\n\nWith the highly contested rematch between Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams looming in the background, Warnock faces a tight race against Walker.\n\nWhile Democrats are optimistic Warnock can maintain his seat, it\u2019s still too early to really understand who has the upper hand.\n\nIn recent weeks Walker\u2019s campaign has been embroiled in a series of allegations that he paid for abortions for various women, as well as criticism from his own son.\n\nDespite the last-minute scrutiny, Walker\u2019s chance of uprooting Warnock\u2019s seat is still a possibility, according to Karen Owen.\n\nOwen, an associate professor of political science at the University of West Georgia and president of the Georgia Political Science Association, said there\u2019s no clear indication that either Warnock or Walker will win.\n\nIf neither candidate manages to secure 50% of the vote, Owen said the race could even see a run-off, similar to the 2020 election.\n\nIf this happens, the results could take weeks and control of the Senate may already be well-established by then.\n\nArizona\n\nArizona\u2019s Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly is running for reelection against venture capitalist Blake Masters.\n\nKelly joined Sen. Krysten Sinema in 2020 following a special election after John McCain\u2019s death. He beat his Republican opponent by less than three points.\n\nBacked by the former president, Masters aims to unseat Kelly and push control of the Senate toward the Republicans.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Masters pushed the lie that the 2020 election was riddled with mass election fraud.\n\nAccording to his website, Masters seeks to wage a war on not just progressives, but also members of the GOP that have disaffiliated with the previous president, the so-called \u201cRINOs\u201d of the party.\n\nOne week ago, the Libertarian candidate, Marc Victor, dropped out of the race and endorsed Masters.\n\nEarly polling from FiveThirtyEight indicates Kelly may have a slight lead in the race, but a definitive answer won\u2019t come until the votes are in.\n\nNevada\n\nThe open seat from Nevada has two candidates vying for control: Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Matso and Republican Adam Laxalt.\n\nElected the first woman senator in Nevada and the first Latina in the U.S. Senate in 2016, Cortez Matso\u2019s seat has been considered one of the most vulnerable this election cycle.\n\nDespite the seat\u2019s long history of being held by Democrats, it could see a Republican challenger take over soon.\n\nLaxalt served as Nevada attorney general from 2015 to 2019. His predecessor was Cortez Matso, who had to step down after reaching the term limit for the position.\n\nNow, the two former attorney generals for the state are eyeing up the seat. One is hoping for a reelection, and one is hoping for a Democratic upheaval.\n\nBerkman said Democrats have been increasingly worried about the race in Nevada, and the chance of it being flipped remains up in the air.\n\nWisconsin\n\nAlongside Pennsylvania, Wisconsin is another state where the two senators are from differing parties, but that could soon change if Democrats are successful.\n\nIncumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is currently facing off against Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.\n\nJohnson has served as senator since 2010 when he defeated then Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold by five points. He beat Feingold again in 2016 by just three points.\n\nThough Johnson\u2019s seat may be considered vulnerable, Berkman said recent polling suggests otherwise.\n\nWhile flipping the seat could help Democrats maintain the loose majority they have, Berkman suggests the other races in the state could be more detrimental, especially in areas that face heavy gerrymandering.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nIn what\u2019s come as a surprise to some, New Hampshire\u2019s narrow race could play a major role in determining the balance of the Senate.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Maggie Hassan faces Republican Donald Bolduc, a retired U.S. Army brigadier general.\n\nThe tight race has \u201csnuck up on the Democrats in the past couple weeks,\u201d Berkman said.\n\nEarly voting results show Hassan has a slight advantage over Bolduc, but votes continue to rack up favor for Bolduc.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAfter serving as one of North Carolina\u2019s senators since 2005, Richard Burr announced he would not seek reelection this year, leaving an open seat for Democrats and Republicans clamoring to take control.\n\nCheri Beasley, former chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, and Ted Budd, current U.S. Representative of the state\u2019s 13th Congressional District, are battling for the open Senate seat.\n\nPolling leans toward Budd, but if Beasley wins the open seat she will become the only Black woman serving in the upper house.\n\nOhio\n\nThe battle for Ohio\u2019s open Senate seat is between a former presidential hopeful and a venture capitalist turned author.\n\nDemocrat Tim Ryan, current representative for Ohio\u2019s 13th Congressional District and former presidential candidate, is running against J.D. Vance, a former Marine and author of \u201cHillbilly Elegies\u201d, which was adapted into a movie by Netflix in 2020.\n\nThe seat was left open after the Republican incumbent, Rob Portman, chose not to seek reelection.\n\nIn the 2020 election Biden narrowly lost to the Republican candidate by less than one point. Now, the race for the Senate seat could be just as contentious.\n\n\u201cTim Ryan, who is probably the best Senate candidate in the country for the Democrats, is making a pretty strong run of it in Ohio,\u201d Berkman said. \u201cBut he is facing enormous headwinds there. So while I don\u2019t put it out of the question that he could win, it would take an extraordinary effort for him to do so.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing battle to control the Senate is a key part of the midterm elections. Whoever ends out on top will change the course of Biden\u2019s agenda and set the tone for the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\u201cA midterm election is always important, but it\u2019s also fairly routine,\u201d Berkman said. \u201cWe always have midterm elections, and the president\u2019s party usually loses and it will change the nature of American politics. This could be the end of Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Micheal Chow)\n\nBy Devon Lee, Bryan A'Hearn and Nataly Lozano\nNovember 08, 2022 at 8:16 pm PST\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections come with a resurgence of questions around voter safety and election integrity. During the 2020 presidential election, the United States saw an increase in voter intimidation nationwide. In Los Angeles, measures have been put in place to ensure the polls are safe for voters. This follows a warning of heightened threat during the 2022 midterm elections issued by the U.S. government.\n\nAs a result, the Department of Justice sent poll monitors to L.A. County to protect voters from intimidation or suppression. The Election Day Poll Monitor Program is another service set in L.A. polling stations to help resolve any issues at the polls and to ensure that voting system procedures are followed. These poll workers are expected to help solve issues like inspectors not being present when the polls open or a lack of provisional envelopes.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Greater Los Angeles has also helped to increase civic engagement and voter security. The organization has a variety of programs aimed at promoting voter education. While not physically present on election day, the league worked in the time leading up to help educate and assure voters that voting is safe.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is we give information to voters so they can make the most informed decisions possible,\u201d said Dr. Ninochka McTaggart, executive director of the league. \u201cPart of that also is getting information out about the L.A. County Registrar Recorder\u2019s office, who ensures that folks will be able to get to the polls safely and also while they\u2019re at the polls ensure that there are mechanisms in place where folks do not feel intimidated or any sort of threat to their safety.\u201d\n\nAccording to McTaggart, voting security in L.A. is relatively high due to the several efforts in place for voters to feel safe. \u201cPoll monitors will be watching,\u201d McTaggart said. \u201cI know they are also watching to make sure the ballot boxes around the city are also not being tampered with so there\u2019s a real effort in the city and in the county to make sure that voting is fair.\u201d\n\nDespite efforts to stop voter intimidation, groups across the country continue to spread misinformation. In Arizona, election-monitoring group Clean Elections USA \u2014 founded by election denier Melody Jennings \u2014 organized at ballot boxes to \u201cmonitor\u201d voters who may commit voter fraud. The group open-carried firearms, took photos and videos of voters and spread false election laws.\n\nThe Citizens Clean Elections Committee, another organization based in Arizona, shares a similar name to the conspiracy-driven Clean Elections USA, which unintentionally draws intention to the other group. \u201cWe are very concerned about the potential confusion, and we\u2019ve gotten many calls from voters in Arizona who seem to think we have something to do with those activities,\u201d said Tom Collins, executive director of clean elections committee. \u201cWe do not support marching around in front of a drop box with some kind of weapon.\u201d\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the FBI has reported an unusually high number of threats to poll workers which has coincided with a shortage of poll workers in Philadelphia. This raises concerns of voter intimidation. According to York County President Commissioner Julie Wheeler, constables will be at all polling locations in York County and poll workers staffed by the county will be available to help. Additionally, in the state\u2019s roughly 700 polling stations, 24-hour surveillance will be conducted.\n\n\u201cI would encourage people who are scared to know that there are people out there making sure that voting is a safe space for everyone,\u201d Taggart said.\n```"}

On Valentine\u2019s Day 2018, 17 lives were senselessly taken at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. In the following weeks, a coalition called March for Our Lives formed in favor of universal background checks, stronger gun regulations and an assault weapons ban. \u201cNever again,\u201d cried survivors such as David Hogg, Cameron Kasky, and X Gonz\u00e1lez. On March 24th of that year, millions of people across America joined this coalition in one of the largest youth protests in American history. The nationwide march was a watershed moment in the fight for national gun reform. \u201cNever again,\u201d the students cried. There was an \u201cagain,\u201d however. And another again. And another. And the fight went on.\n\nFour years later, the MFOL movement is still going strong with advocates and outreach at every level of government. Their policies have expanded to meet the urgency of the times. Enter Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a key player of the national MFOL movement, grassroots organizer and fierce advocate of legislative gun reform and racial justice. The 25-year-old Afro-Cuban Democratic progressive running for the U.S. House of Representatives in Florida\u2019s 10th is currently on track to become the first Gen Z member of congress.\n\nMaxwell Frost supports Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. He intends to expand access and coverage to healthcare, hold pharmaceutical companies accountable, bring reform to the justice system and expand affordable housing and public transportation. He believes in expanding background checks for all gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and bringing new community solutions to the areas hit hardest by gun violence. Frost is ready to continue MFOL\u2019s fight and take on gun lobbies like the National Rifle Association.\n\nAccording to the Library of Congress, the average age of House of Representatives members at the beginning of the current Congressional session was 58-years-old. With Frost being elected at the age of 25, young people across the country would have a representative that can see them, hear them and truly understand the crucial issues facing this generation\u2019s present and future. Be it the threat of climate change or the rising costs of living, Maxwell Frost gets us, because he is us.\n\nHis opponent is retired combat veteran Republican Calvin Wimbish. A 2020 election denier, Wimbish believes that Joe Biden is not the rightful president and wishes to \u201crestore\u201d voter and election integrity in our country. Wimbish does not support the gun reform movement and is an advocate of the 2nd amendment. This year, Wimbish expressed support for the overturning of Roe v. Wade and supported Florida\u2019s 15-week abortion ban that made no exceptions for rape or incest. Interestingly, he also came out in defiance of vaccine and mask mandates, stating on his website that \u201cyour body\u201d is \u201cyour choice.\u201d Using pro-choice arguments to further the anti-vax narrative, Wimbish said that he would \u201cpropose and support laws that will get politicians out of mandating health care choices.\u201d Some of his arguments seem to cancel themselves out.\n\nFlorida\u2019s 10th congressional district, covering parts of Orlando, is the former seat of the current U.S. Senate Democratic candidate Val Demings. Considered a Solid D district this election, the odds are likely in Frost\u2019s favor. According to the Cook Political Report, Val Demings won the seat with about 64% of the vote in her last general election. That gives Frost a current margin of 14 points. According to the 2020 census, the district is about 39% White, 29% Hispanic, 26% Black, 6% Asian, and 2% Native American or other.\n\nHistorically, voter turnout for midterm elections is usually lower than that for presidential elections. However, in recent years, a positive shift has been seen among many voting groups. According to research from Tufts University, it was estimated that 50% of eligible young people aged 18-29 voted in the 2020 election, compared to 39% in 2016. This kind of massive growth among the youth voter bloc comes off of the unprecedented stakes of the 2020 election. It is highly possible that the 2022 election \u2013 highly consequential for what it could mean for legislation regarding gun reform, bodily autonomy, and environmental justice, among other things \u2013 could very well be swayed by the power of young voters.\n\nWith that, it becomes imperative that the youth voter turnout this year does not fall prey to the midterm slump. Young people have the power to change the future of America on Tuesday. Frost is Gen Z\u2019s first vehicle for political change in Washington. If we show up to the polls with confidence, many more young leaders will follow in the coming years. It is time that young people reclaim the narrative of American history, and there is no better way to signal the start of this era than by sending Maxwell Frost to Congress.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Nolan Ezzet\nNovember 08, 2022 at 4:26 pm PST\n\nWith Week 10 featuring a few key losses, the Heisman race appears to be closer than we all anticipated a week ago. USC sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams deserves to be the front-runner. Currently, DraftKings sportsbook lists the following players as the favorites to win the award: Ohio State redshirt sophomore quarterback C.J. Stroud (+140), Tennessee redshirt senior quarterback Hendon Hooker (+290), Michigan junior running back Blake Corum (+750) and Williams (+900). As cool as it is to see a Trojan near the top of the list of favorites, very rarely does the player with the fourth-best odds this late into the season win the prestigious award. It looks like Stroud and Hooker are the only two with a realistic shot at winning the Heisman Trophy. But after last week, that should not be the case.\n\nStroud went into last week with nearly identical odds at +190. He flew out to Evanston to face a weak Northwestern defense that previously gave up 33 points to Iowa \u2014 the most the Hawkeyes have scored this season. Northwestern currently ranks 12th out of 14 Big Ten teams in scoring defense, giving up 27.9 points per game. Despite what should have been an electric performance from Stroud, he had by far his worst game of the season. He completed just 10 of 26 passes (38.5%) for 76 yards and failed to find a receiver in the end zone. He did add 79 yards on the ground, but that does not make up for the subpar passing attack against a weak secondary. It should also be noted that vicious winds upward of 30 miles per hour heavily impacted the passing game, but Northwestern quarterback Brendan Sullivan had more passing yards and the same number of completions as Stroud on just 14 attempts. The Buckeye quarterback doesn\u2019t have much of an excuse.\n\nHeisman winners can struggle in tough games but not in what should be a blowout. Somehow, DraftKings views Stroud as more likely to win the Heisman after that disappointing performance than before, but I disagree. I would be hesitant to give the trophy to a quarterback with that type of performance this late into the season.\n\nHooker was the clear favorite going into Week 10 at (-110). This was largely due to his impressive performances against Alabama and Kentucky. However, with a larger sample size now available, it\u2019s clear that Alabama isn\u2019t the powerhouse we initially thought they were. Hooker\u2019s performance against the Crimson Tide, while still remarkable, isn\u2019t as impressive as we once thought. During Week 10, Hooker and the Volunteers got exposed. In a 27-13 loss to Georgia, Hooker completed 23 of 33 passes (69.7%) for just 195 yards, zero touchdowns and one interception. Of course, this should be taken with a grain of salt, as Georgia boasts a dominant defense. But 2021\u2032s Heisman winner, Alabama\u2019s then-sophomore quarterback Bryce Young, threw for over 350 yards in each of his two games against Georgia last year. He scored five total touchdowns and threw just two interceptions in both games combined. Hooker\u2019s performance was definitely more excusable than Stroud\u2019s, but it still isn\u2019t impressive.\n\nThen there\u2019s Williams, who went into last week at (+1500). In a 41-35 shootout win against Cal, he completed 26 of 41 passes (63.4%) for 360 yards, four passing touchdowns and zero interceptions. He also added 38 yards and one score on the ground, making it his third straight game with over 390 yards from scrimmage and five total touchdowns. This streak started against a stout Utah defense that is only giving up 212.2 passing yards per game this season. It\u2019s not Williams\u2019 fault the Trojans almost lost to a weak Cal team. Just like it\u2019s not his fault they lost to Utah three weeks ago. Stroud and Hooker have the privilege of defenses that can hold their own, and Williams does not. But when we look at what Williams does when he\u2019s on the field, he\u2019s incredible. His only poor performance was against a respectable Oregon State defense in Week 4. He\u2019s been lights-out since.\n\nIf we analyze the whole season, Williams has the others beat statistically. He has more passing yards (2,742), more total touchdowns (32) and fewer interceptions (1) than Stroud and Hooker. There\u2019s no doubt that all three candidates have had excellent seasons thus far. There\u2019s a reason why Ohio State, Tennessee and USC are all in contention for the College Football Playoff. But even after a stellar Week 10 performance from Williams and subpar performances from Stroud and Hooker, the Heisman race still seems to brush the Trojan off to the side. Williams should be in the conversation just as much as the other two, if not the front-runner.\n```"}

(Photo by Sarah Ko)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nNovember 08, 2022 at 4:23 pm PST\n\nWith USC and UCLA\u2019s departure from the Pac-12 seemingly right around the corner, fans should be curious to see how scheduling for the Trojans will look. Games for sports such as football are scheduled years in advance, but since USC is no longer in the Pac-12, how will these schedules change and what will the Big Ten Conference look like?\n\nThe Big Ten is currently broken up into two divisions, East and West. Simple enough. However, with USC and UCLA joining it would cause an imbalance of conferences, with the West geographically having more teams than the East. So how will they reform the divisions?\n\nMy favorite option would be to split the conference up into four divisions: North, East, South and West. In a fun but unrealistic world, the divisions would set up a tournament for the conference title where the top team from each division would play one another. That option is ridiculous and doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense for scheduling, but it would be a whole lot of fun.\n\nA more realistic idea would be to move Purdue to the East division and then add UCLA and USC to the West division to make the divisions even at eight. In the end, my proposed division breakups may not even matter because the Big Ten is reportedly in talks to eliminate divisions and make just one division where the top two teams play each other, in a similar format to what the Pac-12 started doing this year.\n\nUSC already has its out of conference football games scheduled for 2023-2026, with a joust against LSU in Las Vegas in 2024 and a home and home set of games vs. Ole Miss in 2025 and 2026. The Pac-12 is also scheduled for next year, but after that nothing is set in stone. Clearly all of the Pac-12 universities are still in talks about how scheduling will work after USC and UCLA uprooted the conference\u2019s future plans.\n\nOn the Big Ten front, it seems likely we will not see any real news about Big Ten conference games for a while. Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith made this very clear back in August. \u201cWe have made a determination that in the future, you won\u2019t know our conference games for the next year until some time in October,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSo sit back and relax Trojan fans. It seems we will be getting a new college football video game before we actually know who USC will play in the Big Ten. Here\u2019s to hoping USC football gets a good mix of playing Big Ten bottom dwellers, tough road games in the Midwestern snow and primetime games under the lights against the Buckeyes or Wolverines in the Coliseum.\n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Mike Baker)\n\nBy Charlotte Phillipp November 08, 2022 at 1:36 pm PST\n\nPeter Knell and Stephanie Fleischmann\u2019s \u201cARKHIPOV,\u201d which had its concert-style world premiere as a part of Jacaranda\u2019s music series at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City on October 21, tells the true story of Vasili Arkhipov \u2014 a somewhat unknown but heroic figure in history.\n\nThe performance opens on a stage with most of the cast shrouded in darkness. All the words sung out to the audience \u2014 known as the opera\u2019s libretto \u2014 are projected on a screen that also reads \u201c1962.\u201d A small chorus of men stand at attention and state their names and naval ranks out to the audience: \u201cSemyon Penkov, Seaman, 890 roentgen. Valery Kh\u00e1ritonov, Seaman, 935 roentgen. Evgeny Kash\u00e9nkov, Starshina, 2nd class, 845 roentgen. Boris Korch\u00edlov, Lieutenant, 5400 rem.\u201d The list goes on.\n\nThe scenes then switch. The screen reading \u201c1962\u2032\u2032 has jumped ahead \u2014 now, it\u2019s \u201c1998.\u201d Olga, Arkhipov\u2019s wife, is being interrogated by a silent nameless Russian officer. Although he has no lines, it\u2019s implied that he is questioning her on her husband\u2019s actions \u2014 referring to his time on the submarine B-59.\n\nSuddenly, the scene shifts to the B-59 just as it\u2019s about to submerge, \u201cBound for points unknown,\u201d as the crew sings out. The next two hours are spent in the pressure-cooker tension of the submarine cabin as the crew, led by the vocally powerful Edward Parks III as co-captain Arkhipov, sets off toward Cuba.\n\nThe crew members battle through rough waters, illnesses, the possibility of running out of food and the fact that they must harbor a \u201cspecial weapon\u201d of mass destruction \u2014 all under the careful eye of Arkhipov and his co-captain, one of the story\u2019s many villains.\n\nAfter months in the increasingly hot and low-on-drinking-water submarine, the crew is at its wits end. A tipping point arrives: They\u2019ve lost all radio communications with life above the surface of the sea and they\u2019re being fired at for reasons unknown. A fight ensues and the men violently argue that they should fire their massive weapon. Arkhipov, the kind-but-firm mediator of this motley crew, stops the launch of the weapon.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, he has saved the world from nuclear warfare. Arkhipov not-so-famously stood up against a fellow officer and blocked a mistaken decision to fire torpedoes at vessels belonging to the United States. The U.S. was trying to signal to the Russians that they could come to the surface, but the crew mistook it as an attack. Arkhipov was the singular member of the crew who was able to stop the launch.\n\nAs the New Yorker put it, \u201cHad the torpedo been fired, the United States would have retaliated with nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe opera\u2019s story, although somewhat fictionalized, is based upon a combination of Olga\u2019s testimony and reports on the incident from the Russian government, as well as some actual letters found at the National Security Archive from a sailor to his wife. This sets up the opera\u2019s framing as the audience watches time jump back and forth between the 1990s and when the incident happened in 1962.\n\nAs Knell tells it, the idea to turn this story into an opera came when he read Arkhipov\u2019s story in the New Yorker, which detailed every time that we came close to a nuclear Armageddon. \u201cIt was basically a paragraph that ... actually doesn\u2019t even say the name of the captain or the sub or anything. It just said it was this one sub that was maybe the most dangerous of all [during the Cuban Missile Crisis],\u201d Knell recalled. \u201cThat was enough to pique my interest.\u201d\n\nKnell then connected with Fleischmann, who had previously delved into the intersection of contemporary politics and opera with her piece \u201cThe Long Walk\u201d (based upon Iraq veteran Brian Castner\u2019s memoir of the same name), to write the libretto. At Knell\u2019s offer, Fleischmann said she felt \u201chungry to do more of this work.\u201d\n\nConsidering how long Arkhipov\u2019s heroic actions were kept a secret from the world, as well as just how relevant the piece seems now \u2014 this was something they both felt they needed to write. \u201cI hate to use the word serendipitous because it\u2019s not something we want, so it\u2019s the opposite of serendipitous. But timely, yes,\u201d Knell said.\n\nThe obvious comparison is the current tension and military action between Russia and Ukraine, Knell points out, but the examples of times the world has almost ended are frighteningly innumerous. Hiroshima, Chernobyl, India and Pakistan, North Korea \u2014 all pose threats to the future of the planet, Fleischmann said.\n\nThis is such a pressing issue that the real Arkhipov was posthumously awarded the \u201cFuture of Life\u201d award, which goes to individuals who \u201cwithout having received much recognition at the time, have helped make today dramatically better than it may otherwise have been\u201d and are provided by the Future of Life Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that so often the causes of these incidents are based around a lack of understanding and listening is something that Knell wants audiences to take away. As both Knell and Fleishmann put it, communication is one of the themes that permeates throughout the show.\n\n\u201cThe opera gestures at our current crisis of leadership,\u201d Knell writes in the show\u2019s program. \u201cWith more and more countries sliding toward autocracy and belligerence, now more than ever we need an Arkhipov to be our global Ark.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nAfter a tense seven-game back-and-forth match, the Dallas Fuel triumphed over the San Francisco Shock 4-3 and emerged as the champions of the Overwatch League. The Overwatch League is the pinnacle professional eSports league for Overwatch, a first-person-shooter game by Blizzard Entertainment. It features 20 franchised teams representing cities from all around the world, from London to Seoul.\n\nThe competition was held in front of a 6,000 person crowd at the Anaheim Convention Center Arena on Friday, November 4. Dallas Fuel was the top seed entering playoffs while San Francisco Shock was the second seed. Stakes were high entering grand finals \u2014 Dallas Fuel had yet to win a championship after years of lackluster performances while the Shock had the opportunity to earn their third championship with a roster mostly comprised of rookies.\n\nThis was the first Overwatch League season played on Overwatch 2, featuring new characters, new maps and a faster-paced five-versus-five format. It was also the first in-person grand finals since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt has been a difficult few years for Overwatch \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic shut down plans for homestand matches held at the teams\u2019 home cities; Overwatch 2 was also hampered by release delays, poor communication and criticism by returning players for its expensive new monetization model. Parent company Activision Blizzard also faced legal suits by California and employee walkouts over toxic work environments and rampant sexual harassment.\n\nThe return of in-person finals proved to be an important milestone in the longevity of the league and the game moving forward. Returning to the Anaheim Convention Center Arena, where BlizzCon and the Overwatch World Cup was held from 2016 to 2019, symbolically marked the return of a thriving competitive community.\n\nAfter years of slumping viewership, the grand finals broke the Overwatch League\u2019s online viewership records, peaking at 398,000 viewers with a total of 9.9 million hours watched.\n\n\u201cIt feels refreshing to see the new game live, especially after years without major content updates to Overwatch,\u201d said Joon Ho Hong, a long-time Overwatch fan and a sophomore at USC majoring in business administration. \u201cIt is also amazing to be back in person. It is just a different feeling of feeding off the energy of the crowd compared to passively watching the online stream chat.\u201d\n\nAshley Kim, a senior at USC studying theatre, signs a fanboard outside the Anaheim Convention Center Arena. The Houston native wore a Houston Outlaw jersey to catch the games.\n\n\u201cIt feels really invigorating,\u201d Kim shares of her first experience at an Overwatch League event. \u201cI have not followed the League before but seeing a team representing my hometown was amazing. You really feel all the highs and the lows and it is really amazing to see their hard work live.\u201d\n\nSC eSports, a student gaming club at USC, was offered complimentary tickets to catch the grand finals.\n\n\u201cIt was a great opportunity to catch the grand finals where it is for once decently close in Anaheim,\u201d said Ashley Kim, who is also the president for SC eSports and has a minor in video game production. \u201cWe are so thankful to be able to socialize as a club and enjoy the games. It is important to get out and understand what happens in the eSports industry, beyond our computers and our classrooms,\u201d Kim said.\n\n6,000 fans crowded the Anaheim Convention Center Arena for the first in-person grand finals since the COVID-19 pandemic. The arena is dubbed the home of Overwatch eSports where the Overwatch World Cup, the first premier event for competitive Overwatch, was held in 2016.\n\nSan Francisco Shock fans Chloe Barrocas and Anthony Hanly celebrate as the Shock overwhelmed the Houston Outlaws in the finals of the losers\u2019 bracket 3-0.

As a team we relied on each other and worked together towards the same goal for years. To grow together with the players that I picked out at a young age and trusted from the start, and to become champions on this great stage, I think that makes it feels even more special. I\u2019ve always enjoyed developing a team like this, and the players are all close like family, so I love them even more because of that.\u201d \u2014 Yun \u201cRush\u201d Hee-won, head coach of the Dallas Fuel\n\nFletcher proudly shows off his custom Dallas Fuel jersey to the camera.

We are champions! We are the best in the world!\u201d Fletcher exclaimed.\n\nFearless breaks into tears as he was announced the Grand Finals MVP.\n\nHis journey in the Overwatch League has been described by commentator Jonathan Larsson as the \u201cgreatest individual story in Overwatch League history.\u201d Fearless winning the Grand Finals MVP is the finishing touch on the greatest individual story in Overwatch esports history. From the 0-40 Shanghai Dragons in 2018, to 2022 OWL champion with @DallasFuel. Fearless is the Overwatch League protagonist.\n\nHe started out in the 2018 Shanghai Dragons squad with a loss streak of 42 matches, the worst in all of professional sports. He then left the league and came back as a Tank Role Star, an award for the top 4 performances in the Tank role of the season, in 2020 and 2021. He then fell just short of winning the grand finals twice in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\u201cWe got this win because of all of the fans,\u201d Fearless said, holding back tears. \u201cEvery time I felt my mental slipping, I could hear the sound of the fans cheering us on, and that motivated me more to win it for them. It gave me a lot of strength.\u201d\n\nAs the season comes to a close, Overwatch and the Overwatch League looks to build on their grand finals thriller. Dion Rogers and Alec Dawson, respectively the art director and lead hero designer for Overwatch 2, announced a new tank hero during the grand finals. Rammatra, a hulking robot with the unique ability to switch between two forms, attracted excitement and applause from fans.\n\nOverwatch League teams will now take a break after the season and refresh their rosters. Champions Dallas Fuel took the opportunity to celebrate their win at Disneyland to tie up their fairy tale season while in Anaheim.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Adam Jasper\nNovember 07, 2022 at 10:58 pm PST\n\nFifth year guard Drew Peterson gained some steam on the break and cut to the left, but lost the ball in the transition. Florida Gulf Coast picked it up and turned it right back around, as senior guard Isaiah Thompson finished with a smooth behind the back move and layup with 14:40 left in the game for the largest lead of the night up until that point. Head coach Andy Enfield called a timeout to gather his team, but the stoppage couldn\u2019t turn the tide. The Eagles mounted a 25-10 run in the next 10 minutes to jump out to a 20-point lead, catching fire from beyond the arc and leaving USC in the dust by the end of the game.\n\nAfter a failed late comeback, the Trojans were toppled in a 74-61 loss on the first day of the college basketball season. \u201cOur offense just went into a deep freeze,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cWe have to be better. I thought we were prepared to play tonight, and it didn\u2019t look like it, so that\u2019s on me ... It looked like [the players] went back to some bad habits.\u201d\n\nTurnovers, a familiar foe to USC last season, returned with a knockout punch. The Trojans coughed up five turnovers in the first five minutes of the game and accumulated 15 on the night. Florida Gulf Coast junior guard Chase Johnston and Thompson combined for 36 points with six 3-pointers. The two were the driving force of the second-half run that buried the Trojans.\n\nUSC went on a too-little-too-late run in the last few minutes of the second half, cutting the deficit to just nine points before the clock caught up with them. The Trojans struggled with their new offense centered around guard play rather than a focal point big man. Senior guard Boogie Ellis ended up shouldering the scoring load, finishing with 19 points on 5-for-13 shooting.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of having a dominant big guy scorer like we\u2019ve had in the past,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to play with a flow and a pace, and you saw some overdribbling. You saw some uncharacteristic turnovers in transition.\u201d\n\nUSC feigned a suffocating defense early on, holding the Eagles to 18.2% shooting in the first five minutes of play. The Trojans started with a 13-4 advantage, as an Ellis 3-pointer forced an FGCU timeout. The lead grew as large as 11 points, but the Eagles wiggled their way back into the game as the first half went on, tying the game up at 22 a piece with 5:15 to go. This coincided with a brutal shooting stretch for the Trojans which allowed FGCU to take the lead. At the half, the Trojans led by a measly one point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to set the tone offensively,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWhen the ball stays stagnant ... it trickles down to the rest of the guys, and it\u2019s a bad example for the freshmen. That\u2019s on us to take care of.\u201d\n\nShooting from beyond the arc caused all sorts of problems. USC was 1-for-12 at the break. Open looks were created, but not converted. That remained the case for the rest of the night, as the team finished 3-for-19 from three.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no frustration,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI see all these guys work out, and they make shots in practice...When we\u2019re not making shots, we gotta figure it out, get to the line, do other things. We can\u2019t just rely on the 3-point shot.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans started the season down two forwards, with only redshirt junior Joshua Morgan, sophomore Harrison Hornery and freshman Kijani Wright available to play. Morgan had himself a night on the defensive end, racking up seven blocks and two steals. He showcased a new mobility, picking up his feet for steals and meeting defenders at the rim to contest shots. Offensively, though, Morgan couldn\u2019t get into a rhythm and foul trouble in the second half forced him to the bench.\n\n\u201cA lot of [our] big guys were outrunning their bigs in transition, and we didn\u2019t reward them,\u201d Ellis said. Peterson affirmed his need to step up as a veteran in the locker room after a bad result to start the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a learning experience for us,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cTwo years ago, we were a Tahj Eaddy shot away from losing to Cal Baptist first game. Even good teams go through stuff like this...We\u2019re going to take a lot from this game, and better believe we\u2019ll be ready Thursday.\u201d\n\nUSC will search for its first win of the season Thursday at Galen Center against Alabama State.\n```"}

(Photo by Kimberly Aguirre)\n\nBy Kimberly Aguirre and Gabriella Medina\nNovember 07, 2022 at 8:03 pm PST\n\nThe Democratic party called on Vice President Kamala Harris to help in the final push to secure Karen Bass as L.A.\u2019s next mayor just in time for tomorrow\u2019s midterm elections. Harris, joined by other L.A. Democrats, spoke at a UCLA Get Out the Vote rally on Monday, where she urged young people to vote and protect their freedoms, especially their reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cKaren Bass has a long history of always being on the side of the people and fighting for the people whose voices aren\u2019t in the room but must be present. That\u2019s who Karen Bass has always been. It\u2019s what she will always be, and that\u2019s why she will be the next mayor of Los Angeles,\u201d Harris said.\n\nCongresswoman Bass has represented portions of western and southwestern L.A. in Congress for the past six years. She is widely supported by Democrats and has been endorsed by President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. Her opponent is real estate mogul Rick Caruso, a longtime Republican who changed his party affiliation to Democrat shortly before announcing his run. Caruso was viewed as the underdog in a city that rarely votes for candidates with Republican values.\n\nIf Bass maintains her lead, L.A. would see its first woman and second Black individual as its mayor. But while Bass dominated the polls in past months, Caruso has gained significant ground. Caruso\u2019s campaign spent $100 million in attack advertisements, a tactic presumed to have swayed previously undecided voters.\n\nOn Monday, a line of eager young Democrats wrapped around UCLA\u2019s Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center hours before doors opened for the Harris-Bass rally. Attendees cheered in-between the vice president\u2019s remarks and chanted \u201cKamala\u201d. During her speech, Harris passionately condemned the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade, saying, \u201cOne does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s rally was organized by the Bruin Democrats, where UCLA student Bailey Swain encouraged fellow students to support Bass. \u201cI know that as a young Black woman who values a woman\u2019s right to choose in 2022, I can\u2019t afford to miss an election. And if you guys agree with me, we cannot afford to skip out and vote for anyone except for Karen Bass.\u201d\n\nWhile Bass and Caruso have both presented themselves as fervently pro-choice in their campaigns, many Democrats raise an eyebrow at Caruso\u2019s stance. Caruso has yet to fulfill a $1 million pledge from May to support abortion rights and has a long history of donating to anti-choice politicians.\n\n\u201cHer opponent calls himself a Democrat, but only registered as a Democrat 18 days prior to pulling his papers,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cHe cannot fool voters and he cannot buy this election because Los Angeles is not for sale.\u201d\n```"}

Running in 2018 with the promise of bringing transparency and fostering accountability in a department that has faced numerous officer misconduct scandals, the sheriff quickly shifted gears once in office.\n\nVillanueva is accused of using his authority to investigate a reporter who exposed one of his deputies for kneeling on an incarcerated person\u2019s head. Opposers also say that he\u2019s failed to improve the quality of life in L.A. County jails.\n\nLeonard Baker, an L.A. resident and voter, criticizes the sheriff\u2019s abuses of power. \u201cMr. Villanueva is out of control and hasn\u2019t been accountable,\u201d Baker said. \u201cRobert Luna doesn\u2019t really set off any bells for me, but he\u2019s the lesser of two evils, so to speak.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Board Supervisor Holly Mitchell commented on Villanueva\u2019s contentious relationship with the board. \u201cI would hope that [Villanueva] would take a long, hard look at actions and policies of his department before continuing to complain that this board is defunding said department,\u201d Mitchell said in an interview with the L.A. Times.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved nearly $50 million in settlements for several lawsuits alleging misconduct by sheriff\u2019s deputies. These lawsuits come from the families of five victims who had been either killed or injured by sheriff\u2019s deputies under Villanueva\u2019s rule.\n\nVillanueva is skeptical of the timing of these settlements, which were released just a week before the election. He criticizes them as being part of a political move. \u201cEach and every case that we\u2019re involved with where the outcome is not good \u2013 somebody either dies or is severely injured \u2013 each one is tragic in and of itself,\u2019\u2019 Villanueva said during a news conference. \u201cBut to exploit the tragedy for political gain is equally upsetting.\u2019\n\nLuna focuses on developing his anti-Villanueva frame while concentrating his campaign on regaining the trust of both Angelenos and the county offices that collaborate closely with the sheriff\u2019s office. In press interviews, Luna has used his strong relationship with the board as a positive factor in this election and has stated his intentions to make a difference in L.A. County.\n\n\u201cLuna has been portraying himself as someone who can get along with all the other parties [the sheriff needs] to get along with,\u201d Akhavan said.\n\nDuring the September debate between both candidates, Villanueva accused Luna of being a puppet for the Board of Supervisors \u2013 whom Villanueva has consistently clashed with.\n\nIn a typically non-partisan position, political affiliation has become a major point for voters to consider in the 2022 elections. The two candidates have a stark partisan difference in voter support, with 65% of Republicans supporting Villanueva and 50% of Democrats behind Luna.\n\nLos Angeles County is primarily blue, with more than half of voters registered as Democrats. Despite receiving more than double the campaign contributions than Luna, Villanueva remains behind in the polls.\n\n\u201cThe chaos around the current sheriff needs to end, and there\u2019s no one better suited to that than Robert Luna,\u201d Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said. \u201cHe\u2019s calm, collaborative, collected...always trying to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nAnother South L.A. voter, Raymond Velasquez, claimed Luna\u2019s outsider status as a primary reason for his endorsement of the candidate. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming from the sheriff\u2019s department. He\u2019s coming from an outside agency, the Long Beach Police Department,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what the sheriffs need, someone from the outside to come inside and really clean the sheriff\u2019s department out.\u201d\n```"}

Greg Abbott\n\nBy Viktoria Capek and Grace Murray\nNovember 07, 2022 at 7:25 pm PST\n\nWhat do USC\u2019s cutting-edge art school and the university\u2019s acclaimed eye institute have in common with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott? They all have the considerable financial support of USC Life Trustee Ed Roski, Jr. Roski, whose fortune is estimated at $9.3 billion, is president and chairman of L.A. County-based Majestic Realty, one of the country\u2019s largest privately-owned investors in commercial real estate. Majestic owns properties in Texas, which may explain Roski donating nearly $2 million to Abbott\u2019s re-election campaign, making him one of the Republican governor\u2019s top donors. Texas state law does not limit the size of campaign contributions.\n\nRoski and his wife, Gayle, have made two major donations totaling $48 million to USC, resulting in the art school being named after his wife as the Gayle Garner Roski School of Art and Design in 2006. The couple also made a gift to the Keck School of Medicine in 2016 to endow and name the USC Gayle and Edward Roski Eye Institute. Roski served several terms as a voting board member, starting in 2000, including a period when he was chairman before becoming a life trustee. His donations to Abbott do not violate any rules for his current status as a non-voting member of the university\u2019s board.\n\nRegardless, at a graduate program exhibition opening last Friday, USC art students were disturbed to learn about their school\u2019s shared source of wealth with such a prominent conservative political figure. \u201cKnowing that Greg Abbott has restricted communities of color and histories of communities of color in Texas, it says a lot about what is supported,\u201d said Tracy Fenix, a dual degree graduate student for Curatorial Practice and Urban Planning at the Roski School who grew up in the Texas borderland. Fenix was referencing Abbott\u2019s actions that largely target minority groups in the state. For example, his backing of Senate Bill 7, a piece of legislation to reduce polling hours and access to mail-in voting, disproportionately impacting communities of color in Texas. Abbott\u2019s support of the bill led to large-scale walkouts by state Democrats in protest of the legislation.\n\nFenix is concerned with the ambiguous nature of funding for USC and how the money endowed to the institution may determine the curriculum centered at Roski or any department on campus. Knowing where USC gets its funding is also a big curiosity for Angelina Jesson, a Roski international student from London. \u201cUSC is a big capitalist school structure. It\u2019s an institution and functions the way America functions, and I think that means that there\u2019s a lot of un-transparency,\u201d Jesson said. \u201cThe fact that we have these incredible professors that are talking about social practice [and] social justice, and then having the money coming from a place which contradicts that is weird to me.\u201d\n\nMajestic Realty did not respond to several requests for comment from Roski. USC Roski Eye Institute at USC Village. (Photo by: Viktoria Capek) Roski has donated an additional $275,000 to other Texas Republicans besides Abbott for the 2022 midterms, according to Transparency USA, a campaign finance database. Other donations went to George P. Bush\u2019s unsuccessful campaign for attorney general, as well as Dan Patrick\u2019s campaign for Lieutenant Governor.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democrat, is attempting to unseat Abbott on Tuesday. O\u2019Rourke, who ran for president in 2020, is considered an underdog. Abbott was first elected in 2014. In recent years, the two-term governor has spent significant time in the spotlight for his positions on gun control, immigration and abortion rights. In the wake of the Uvalde school shooting, Abbott received criticism for his refusal to hold a special legislative session to address gun control in the state, which has some of the least restrictive firearms laws in the country. He has also resisted pleas from gun control advocates to increase the minimum age to purchase a semi-automatic rifle to 21.\n\nAbbott\u2019s reelection campaign has also been largely focused on maintaining one of the strictest abortion laws in the country. In May of this year, he signed into law legislation that prohibits abortions in the state after the six-week mark. Another touchstone of Abbott\u2019s time as governor and his reelection campaign has been advocating for increased border security and enforcement using stricter laws. He has also launched a program where he sends immigrants via bus to sanctuary states across the country.\n\nIn addition to Roski\u2019s high-dollar donations, another USC trustee is one of Abbott\u2019s top funders: honorary trustee Dr. Miriam Adelson. The widow of casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson runs drug treatment and research centers in Las Vegas and Tel Aviv, Israel. She served one term as a voting trustee before being awarded honorary status this year. Adelson donated $1 million to Abbott\u2019s campaign and has a history of giving to other conservative politicians and causes, including a $2.3 million donation to the Texas PAC. Before his passing, Sheldon Adelson had been advocating to legalize gambling in the state of Texas, and Miriam Adelson is now pushing for legalization as well. She is the majority shareholder of the Sands Corporation. Adelson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNo other USC trustees have made contributions to either the Abbott or O\u2019Rourke campaign.

The measure reflects a decade-long effort to expand voting accessibility in municipalities nationwide. Takoma Park, Maryland, was the first to pass \u201cVote 16\u2032\u2032 legislation in 2013; by 2014, the turnout rate for 16- and 17-year-olds exceeded that of any other age group.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what really changes between 16 and 18 to the point where somebody could be drafted for the military and not be able to vote,\u201d Madeline Perrou, a voter at the Culver City City Hall polling station said. \u201cAnd I think that teenagers now have a lot of pressure to get into college and to study for the SATs, so they clearly have the brain cognition to make important decisions.\u201d\n\nFive other Maryland municipalities as well as cities like Berkeley, Oakland and Washington D.C, followed suit, passing similar legislation to grant voting access to younger voters.\n\n\u201cVoting is habit forming \u2014 studies show that one of the best predictors of whether someone\u2019s going to vote is whether they voted previously,\u201d Joshua Douglas, a professor at the University of Kentucky, said. Douglas, an election law and voting rights researcher who has previously supported these ballot measures, said that 18-year-olds are already bombarded with the transition to university, introduction to the workforce and the pressure of relocation, making it a \u201cweird age\u201d to start the voting process.\n\n\u201cIf we do it at 16, people are still in school,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cWe can get them registered, we can educate them appropriately and improve civics.\u201d\n\nIn March of 2021, the United States House of Representatives voted against the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d a Constitutional amendment introduced by Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley that would lower the voting age to 16 on a national level for federal elections. The voting age for federal elections has not been changed since the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which lowered it to 18 via the 26th amendment. The measure passed after Congress faced criticism for allowing 18 year-olds to be drafted into the armed forces but not giving them the right to vote.\n\n\u201cI think at 16, that young, you can be easily influenced,\u201d Mike Hinojose, a poll worker, said. When Hinojose was in high school, he did not care much about voting and politics. \u201cI\u2019m going to say it anyway, I was more into girls in high school,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if the measure had any impact on voter turnout, Erik Merino, the voting center clerk, said that it was possible. \u201cI feel like they understand that the future generation has a voice, and would like them to be able to express it because any age group is important,\u201d Merino said.\n\nNo other city in the nation will consider lowering the voting age for local elections this year.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of adults who don\u2019t do their own research,\u201d Culver City voter Madeline Perrou said. \u201cSo if kids or teenagers are passionate about voting, then I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t be able to, [especially] if they\u2019re more educated than many of the adults.\u201d\n```"}

Here\u2019s a comprehensive look at why exactly so much has been dumped into both sides.\n\nProps 26 and 27 could decide the future of sports betting in California. (Graphic by: Ian Roddy)\n\nBy Ian Roddy November 07, 2022 at 6:00 pm PST\n\nYou\u2019d think hundreds of millions of dollars could buy you just about anything. But apparently, even nine figures might not be enough to legalize sports betting in California. Despite a record amount spent on the two gambling-related state ballot measures this campaign season, both Propositions 26 and 27 are trending toward defeat in the polls just before the election.\n\nFor an industry that could rake in over $2.8 billion per year from California bettors by some estimates, the stakes are quite high, needless to say. With that much money potentially on the table for big betting corporations, along with it being the most expensive ballot measure battle in state history (more than $400 million collectively for and against), skeptics have concerns about what is behind all the claims being made.\n\nThe California homelessness problem\n\nProp. 26 would legalize in-person sports betting at tribal casinos, as well as allow dice and roulette games there. Prop. 27 would legalize online betting in California and is backed mainly by gambling websites like FanDuel, DraftKings and BetMGM, who have collectively contributed $95 million. As a whole, the industry spent $150 million on political ads.\n\nProp. 27 promises to help fight homelessness, mental illness and addiction in the state by taxing betting corporations and diverting those funds to the cause. Organizations in support of the legislation have focused heavily on that in their marketing. But it hasn\u2019t exactly been a lack of funding that\u2019s held California back from finally making progress in its fight to end homelessness.\n\nBillions of dollars have been spent to address homelessness over the past five years, but things have only continued to get worse. A recent report by the independent State Auditor said California\u2019s spending on homelessness is \u201cdisjointed\u201d and \u201chas not fulfilled its most critical responsibilities.\u201d\n\nFor example, in Los Angeles there is a $1.2 billion bond measure currently falling short of its promise to create up to 10,000 housing units for the homeless over the course of a decade. The projects continue to drag on as costs only get higher. This is according to a city audit from February 23.\n\nA state audit from 2021 criticized the California Interagency Council on Homelessness for failing to track spending across the state, which was a big reason for its creation in 2017. All this is to demonstrate that the main issue with the lack of progress in California\u2019s fight against homelessness isn\u2019t due to a lack of funding (the main thing Prop. 27 promises to provide) \u2014 it\u2019s due, at least in part, to the shortcomings of the state government.\n\n\u201cWe have a very challenging system and we\u2019re trying to make it work,\u201d Molly Rysman, chief program officer at the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, told NBC. The LAHSA coordinates spending and oversees housing and social services for sprawling Los Angeles County. \u201cWe do not have a well-oiled machine and that has become a real crisis in this county in terms of housing unhoused residents.\u201d\n\nOpponents of Prop. 27 say that fixing this system should take priority before dumping more taxpayer money into it.\n\nExamining the fine print\n\nAny company that wants to participate in California\u2019s sports betting market would have to pay a $100 million licensing fee to the state to set up shop \u2014 that\u2019s four times as much as the current highest licensing fee, New York\u2019s $25 million.\n\n\u201cRemember it was drafted by lawyers hired by the seven companies that are bankrolling it,\u201d said Kathy Fairbanks, spokesperson for No on 27. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t something that the legislature put on the ballot. This is a ballot measure that they wrote to benefit themselves.\u201d\n\nWhile the regulation is supposedly in place to protect consumers, it clearly benefits big betting companies, setting impossibly high barriers to entry that smaller companies cannot pay. Alex Kane, CEO of Sporttrade, a small Philadelphia-based betting company, said he thinks the bigger companies writing the initiative don\u2019t want to face competition.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at \u2018what would we be willing to pay to get rid of competition altogether?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see that it\u2019s worth a lot of money to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way Prop. 27 is written...the ballot measure identifies a 10% tax rate for the online companies that participate in California\u2019s market,\u201d Fairbanks said. \u201cSo obviously 90% is not going to California...Automatically 90% right off the top goes straight back to the companies and into their pockets.\u201d\n\nHow things are faring\n\nThe latest Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) survey released last month showed Prop. 26 down by 11 percentage points and Prop. 27 failing by 26 percentage points.\n\n\u201cThese results suggest that the sports wagering initiatives are foundering in the face of the opposition advertising campaigns,\u201d said IGS co-director Eric Schickler in a statement. \u201cThe lack of support among key demographic groups makes passage of each an uphill climb at best.\u201d\n\nOver the past three years, nearly 40 states have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting, and 30 \u2014 most recently Arizona and Arkansas \u2014 have already passed the initiatives. But in California, voters simply aren\u2019t buying what the betting companies have been trying to sell.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re promoting it as a solution to homelessness, but voters aren\u2019t buying that,\u201d said Fairbanks. \u201cVoters don\u2019t believe that funding for homeless programs is the only problem [with the fight against homelessness]. It\u2019s government bureaucracy, it\u2019s red tape, it\u2019s all of that, none of which is considered in Prop. 27.\u201d\n\nNathan Click, spokesperson for Yes on 27, told the Los Angeles Times that Prop. 27 has faced \u201cover $100 million in misleading and false attacks \u2014 $45 million before we even qualified for the ballot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s because of the uncertainty and lack of understanding over the propositions themselves that many voters are simply voting no.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m just gonna say no,\u201d said Brian Mercado, a Los Angeles resident watching football at a local sports bar. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand all the fixing homelessness stuff...and I honestly feel like people can still [bet on sports] anyway. I do sometimes.\u201d\n\nBecause of the sheer size of the untapped California betting market, it\u2019s likely a matter of when, not if, some form of legalized sports betting makes its way into the state. The betting companies aren\u2019t likely to give up on billions in potential profit. One DraftKings executive has even called California one of the industry\u2019s \u201choly grails.\u201d\n\nAccording to I. Nelson Rose, author and emeritus gambling law professor at Whittier College, voters could even wind up seeing sports betting propositions on the 2024 ballot, and likely will if these ones fail to pass.\n\n\u201cThe reality is they\u2019re definitely going to try again if it doesn\u2019t pass,\u201d said Rose. \u201cSome group is going to quickly start writing an initiative again.\u201d```"}

Our producer Meredith McCabe had the chance to talk to Caruso campaign intern Jennifer Alvarado. She\u2019s been working on the campaign as a policy adviser since before the primary elections in June.\n\nJennifer Alvarado\u2019s early mentors were police officers - LAPD. That may be not so unusual, but she grew up in South LA - a community not typically known for its positive relationship with law enforcement. Today, she\u2019s studying public health at USC. She believes in giving back to the community. And these days, Alvarado\u2019s an intern on the Rick Caruso campaign.\n\nJENNIFER ALVARADO: I learned that Rick Caruso was running for mayor from one of my LAPD mentors. And I saw the opportunity to support Rick and in some ways give back. Many Angelenos see Caruso as a billionaire developer, Republican-turned-Democrat. And he is all that, but Alvarado, who has known him for nearly ten years, points out that he\u2019s also a huge philanthropist. In fact, Alvarado says many of her educational opportunities came from a nonprofit Caruso donates to called Operation Progress. It helps underserved youth in South L.A. to reach their full potential.\n\nHer personal connection led Alvarado to seek out the campaign opportunity, but she has since grown to admire his strategy. ALVARADO: I think that Rick\u2019s approaches are unconventional in the sense that, like, he is funding his own campaign, but guess what? He\u2019s worked so hard for every dollar, and as a successful developer, I am confident that he\u2019s going to be able to navigate through the housing policies and through all of that red tape because he\u2019s familiar in that field.\n\nWhile Alvarado admires Caruso\u2019s unconventional approach, his opponents argue that his development background is not suited for public office. Bass, on the other hand has had three public service careers - in healthcare, community organizing and as a lawmaker in Sacramento and D.C. for over a decade. Nonetheless, Alvarado finds his career path somewhat admirable. ALVARADO: I feel like Rick can be relatable if you allow him to be. He was the first in his family to graduate from college and so am I. I feel like there\u2019s a lot of similar struggles in our journeys.\n\nThe mayoral race is down to the single digits with Bass still narrowly in the lead. Bass supporters shared their reasons for voting for the congresswoman in an LA Times article citing civil rights and multiracial unity, the fight against a \u201cpseudo-Trumpian developer,\u201d and Bass\u2019 identity as a woman in light of reproductive rights. As for Alvarado, she\u2019ll be out canvassing tomorrow for team Caruso. ALVARADO: We\u2019re probably going to spend the day in the field under the rain. We\u2019re still going to go door to door and get people out to vote.\n\nThis, of course, marks just one intern\u2019s experience, but it gives us a glimpse into one of the most significant and newsworthy campaigns in L.A. mayoral history. No matter whether you\u2019re team Caruso or team Bass, be sure to grab your umbrellas and brave the polls tomorrow between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Meredith McCabe.\n```"}

The 2022 midterm elections are set to be the most expensive midterms ever, according to a news study from OpenSecrets.\n\nBy Peter Makk, Sophia Hammerle, and Sullivan Barthel\nNovember 07, 2022 at 5:36 pm PST\n\nLA is getting ready to elect its first new Mayor in nearly a decade. The current Mayor Eric Garcetti can not run for re-election because of the two-term limit. Billionaire developer Rick Caruso is facing Congresswoman Karen Bass. Bass was the early favorite by far. She was backed by most of the Democratic Party establishment. But Rick Caruso has spent nearly one-hundred million dollars on his campaign and he has brought tomorrow\u2019s contest to nearly a dead heat. Money talks, and so does Sophia Hammerle.\n\nBillionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso has now spent more than $92.3 million on his mayoral campaign, 99% of which comes from himself in the form of loans, according to the L.A. Times. His spending is nearly 8 times that of his opponent, Karen Bass, who has run her campaign almost exclusively on donations. This increase in spending is part of a national historical trend. The 2022 midterms are projected to be the most expensive midterms ever with a total of 16.7 billion dollars in expected spending, according to OpenSecrets, an independent nonprofit research group that tracks money in U.S. politics.\n\nGeoffrey Cowen, USC Annenberg professor and director of the center on communication leadership and policy, described how while money makes a difference in politics, it doesn\u2019t necessarily secure a win. Geoffry Cowen: I think part of what happens is people who are hugely rich sometimes think that the only way to win is to spend a lot of money and they have the money to spend. [...] I personally think there are a lot of problems with too much money in politics. I really do think there is. But it\u2019s where we are.\n\nAcross the country, several other races are seeing record levels of spending. The Wisconsin governor\u2019s race is the most expensive in state history, nearing $115 million in spending, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. In the race for U.S. Senate in Georgia, candidates have raised a combined $150 million. This isn\u2019t the first mayoral race to see such high spending, either. Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg poured $102 million into his campaign for a third term in 2009.\n\nThere appears to be a strong association between campaign spending and political success. In 2020, 88% of those elected to the House of Representatives spent more money than their opponents, according to Open Secrets. This isn\u2019t evidence of causation, however. Richard Lau, a professor of political science at Rutgers, said it is less about money causing winning, and more about winning attracting money. Cowen agreed that it wasn\u2019t a direct correlation.\n\nGeoffry Cowen: So money does not always mean you win. you\u2019ve got to have a message. You\u2019ve got to have a candidate with some appeal. More than half of Caruso\u2019s spending has gone toward radio, TV, and digital advertising. This is part of a national trend of proliferation in political advertising since 2010, when the Citizen\u2019s United v. FEC Supreme court case overturned restrictions on campaign spending.\n\nGeoffry Cowen: You know, if we hadn\u2019t had Citizens United, I don\u2019t think Caruso could spend the amount of money that he spent. He doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t still win. It\u2019d be different system, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it by spending a lot of money\n\nIs Caruso\u2019s spending enough to sway the election in his favor? Voters have their final say tomorrow on Election Day. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sophia Hammerle.\n```"}

Also, like I\u2019m also from L.A. so when I first been noticing that politics and stuff, I\u2019ve always known that Eric Garcetti has been our mayor. So now I\u2019m seeing that he is not going to be our mayor any more.

Yes, that makes sense. So I kind of like, well, my major focus was like, um, proposition one. Proposition one would guarantee abortion rights in California\u2019s State Constitution. Here\u2019s Saldana again on why this prop matters to her.\n\nLourdes Saldana: It\u2019s captured my interest because it\u2019s I don\u2019t know personally, I think it\u2019s very extreme because, you know, you know, there is like pro-choice and pro-life and it\u2019s just a such a big topic now without like Roe v Wade.\n\nThis year\u2019s midterm election has many candidates who have no prior political experience. Some of them nationwide include former football player Herschel Walker, TV presenter Dr. Oz, and more. Neuroscience sophomore Cas Martinez goes more in depth.\n\nCas Martinez: It\u2019s more so just hearing like sort of how crazy some of the candidates can be. That\u2019s more so how I\u2019ve been following the elections and just seeing, you know, how extreme some of the candidates are.\n\nPublic relations junior Ella Bittman tells us why voting is important.\n\nElla Bitman: I think it\u2019s the most important thing we as citizens and people in this country need to do. So regardless of if I feel super passionate about something that\u2019s on the ballot, I think it\u2019s important to use my voice and make a vote one way or the other because it\u2019s I\u2019m not voting and I\u2019m not helping anyone. I\u2019m just being silent. So and I also think if you vote, then you have less reason, I guess, to complain if it doesn\u2019t go your way. And for the people that don\u2019t vote and then get upset about the results, it\u2019s like, well, you didn\u2019t do anything. So you can do something.

The team would eventually lead the match by a goal close to the end of stoppage. Both supporter sections were constantly cheering and making themselves heard.\n\nWith only eight minutes left in the match, LAFC\u2019s Jes\u00fas Murillo would put the ball in the back of the goal making it 2-1 as if sentencing the final for the Angelenos, but the Union was not about to give up so easily. Only three minutes later Philadelphia would tie it, sending the match to overtime.\n\nIn the first half of extra time, LAFC\u2019s keeper, Maxime Creapeau would commit a foul in order to protect his goal from an imminent downfall. Resulting from this foul, Crepeau earned a red card, lost his participation in the remainder of the final and suffered an ankle fracture that will likely keep him out of the World Cup.\n\nTo add more drama, his successor, John McCarthy, would later take the spotlight \u2014 but first we have to see what Gareth Bale did. Referee Ismael Eflath had added nine minutes when, after a corner kick, Philadelphia Union\u2019s Jack Elliot silenced the 3252 supporters section with a late goal. However, the match ends only when the final whistle is blown.\n\nWith 90 seconds left on the clock, Gareth Bale placed a header into the goal that would shake all of Los Angeles. This earthquake would continue throughout the penalty shootout as John McCarthy would make two critical saves which would grant Ilie S\u00e1nchez the opportunity to sign history and bring LAFC their first title since their league debut in 2018.\n\nIlie S\u00e1nchez stated his confidence in his keeper was unshaken even after the abrupt substitution. \u201cWe felt confident throughout the 130 minutes and of course in the shootout. We knew how good John McCarthy is in goal, and also, we\u2019ve been practicing the kicks in the past week,\u201d added the Spanish midfielder for LAFC.\n\nCarlos Vela was the first-ever signing for the Black and Gold and recalls arriving in Los Angeles before the club had neither a stadium nor team colors. Now he is aware that his goals are starting to become a reality. \u201cI had that in my mind. I put the target. Today, finally, we get it. Like I say, we took long (time) to get it, but we got it,\u201d said Vela.\n\nLos Angeles continues to celebrate as yet another one of their 12 sport teams earn a title. LAFC joins the Lakers, Dodgers and Rams in earning a title in the last two years.\n```"}

Mark Kelly, left, Republican challenger Blake Masters, right, and Libertarian Marc Victor, back, pause on the stage prior to a televised debate in Phoenix, Thursday, Oct. 6, 2022. Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin.\n\nBy Shreya Agrawal November 07, 2022 at 5:04 pm PST\n\nArizona native Chelsea McGuire grew up on a farm in Pinal County. Her family sold the farm in 2000 for financial reasons, but she remains close to the agricultural community. As the Arizona Farm Bureau\u2019s director of governmental relations, she lobbies on behalf of farmers to ensure their access to the resources they need to feed the state. The state\u2019s agricultural community brings more than $23 billion every year. The farmers tend to cattle and hogs, and grow crops like lettuce, cantaloupes and lemons, pecans and dates. But they also grow cotton and cattle-fodder like alfalfa, which consume a significant portion of Arizona\u2019s allotted water in the middle of the desert.\n\nMcGuire said the farming community is politically minded because their livelihood depends on the management of natural resources. \u201cFarmers and ranchers are not one-issue voters and they are not one-party voters either,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cWe are able to put our labels aside and say, \u2018Agriculture is a critical industry. Food production is something the country needs.\u2019 How can we work together on both sides of the aisle to make sure our industry is empowered and has the tools that it needs to do that?\u201d\n\nThe decades-long drought in the southwestern United States is becoming a significant issue for Arizona\u2019s agricultural community, which uses about 70% of available freshwater allotted to the state. \u201cWhat the drought is actually doing is putting more pressure on the politicians that our farmers are interacting with to become literate on these issues, because water has always been a huge issue,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cBut it\u2019s never been that, oh well, water is the only thing I\u2019m going to vote on,\u201d she said. \u201cDo I think that we\u2019re going to have folks that are changing how they vote because of the drought? No.\u201d\n\nA poll conducted by the Beacon Project on behalf of the Environmental Voter Project found likely voters in Arizona identified inflation, abortion rights and the economy as their top three issues. Environmental issues ranked sixth highest priority, with only 5% of likely voters listing them as a top priority. When asked to identify their top long-term priorities, inflation and the economy topped the list, with environmental lagging behind.\n\nBoth major candidates running for the Senate election in Arizona have stated that water issues are a major priority for Arizona, but have different approaches to solving the problem. Mark Kelly, the incumbent Democratic Arizona senator, said he wants to reduce the state\u2019s water usage to conserve water while Blake Masters, a Trump-endorsed Republican nominee who was an election denier before winning the primary, has repeatedly said he wants to fight other states to increase Arizona\u2019s water allocation.\n\nArizona is a key battleground state this midterm election. The Senate race between Kelly and Masters will play a large role in determining which party controls the Senate for the next two years. If elected, Masters will join hundreds of climate deniers in Congress who refuse to take action on environmental issues. But as the drought worsens, the need for political action to ensure access to essential resources like water becomes urgent.\n\nAccording to a report by the World Bank, water scarcity is linked to a 10% increase in global migrations. Dr. Benjamin Cook, a drought researcher at Columbia University, said that droughts in the American West are a natural phenomena. \u201cThe difference is that this drought is happening in a world that\u2019s much warmer because of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is having an amplifying effect on the drought.\u201d\n\nSandy Bahr, director of the Grand Canyon chapter of Sierra Club, said the environmental organization wants the government to etch a more sustainable course of action. \u201cHow can we live within our means relative to water here in the Southwest, instead of always looking for the next place we can try to get water, which has really been the focus of a number of entities and the governor, particularly, in Arizona,\u201d she said.\n\nBahr said that the agricultural community needs to be more efficient in their water use. \u201cWe can insist... that we are not growing all of this alfalfa and cotton in the desert. It is ridiculous, it is ludicrous to think that is sustainable. It is just not,\u201d she said.\n\nCandidates\u2019 views on the drought\n\nIn the first and only Senate debate, Kelly said, \u201c[The drought] is a major issue. This is the worst drought that this part of the planet has seen in the past thousand years and it\u2019s been going on 22 years.\u201d Kelly urged immediate action to solve the water crisis. \u201cI got money from Washington to help farmers keep water up in Lake Mead,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just a stopgap measure. We can\u2019t do this all on our own.\u201d\n\nKelly called on the other states reliant on the Colorado River to step up and take action, especially California. On August 16, 2022, the United States Interior Department announced federal water cuts for key basin states, reducing Arizona\u2019s allotment by more than a fifth. Nevada and Mexico also endured water cuts, but the plan spared California, entitled to the largest share of water out of all states. Four agencies in California promised to cut water use by about a tenth, but no formal plans have been announced.\n\nThe Sierra Club endorsed Kelly in 2020 and again in 2022. \u201cThis prolonged drought is partly attributable to climate change. We need to do something and that is something Sen. Kelly is willing to do,\u201d Bahr said. \u201cHe supported the Inflation Reduction Act which has a number of measures in it that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and begin to put us on a path for the reductions we need.\u201d\n\nIn August 2022, Sens. Kelly, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada secured a $4 billion drought reduction package as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The provisions will support water conservation and drought mitigation in the states affected by the drought, and includes $12.5 million to assist tribes affected by drought.\n\nBahr also said that addressing climate change in the short term will not bring more water to Arizona, so allocations must be cut. \u201cIt can begin to ensure that it doesn\u2019t get worse and worse,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t change the fact that there is not enough water in the Colorado river for all the straws that are in it, but we can change how we\u2019re using water and what we\u2019re allocating it for.\u201d\n\nMarc Victor, the independent candidate in the race, said the agricultural community in the desert should not allocated high amounts of water. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said during the debate. \u201cWe can import our agriculture, we can get it from places where they can more efficiently produce these goods.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy and large, the agricultural community here in Arizona has been looking for ways to keep moving forward with business as usual,\u201d Bahr said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to change. They just want somebody to, the taxpayers to pay for more water, whether it\u2019s expensive desalination or some other mechanism to bring water from outside the state.\u201d\n\nMasters has emphasized the lack of mandatory cuts in California instead of suggesting ideas to reduce water use in Arizona. \u201cGuess how much California had to cut? Zero. Guess what Mark Kelly did about it? Nothing,\u201d he said during the debate. \u201cWe need someone in here with sharp elbows who is going to fight for our water.\u201d\n\nMasters has called for the renegotiation of the Colorado River Compact and the use of technology to fight the water crisis. \u201cWhy is California even putting its straw into the Colorado River?\u201d he said. \u201cThat water should be Arizona\u2019s.\u201d He said California should draw water from desalination plants powered by nuclear reactors, and believes the private industry needs to have a bigger role in the water crisis.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact of 1922 set water allotments for all the basin states that received water from the river. California got almost 60% of the lower basin water budget, while Arizona received about 37%.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that those allocations were based on a period of very, very wet conditions in the region,\u201d Cook said. \u201cNow, though, you still have the same people who need their water needs met. But now we\u2019re 20-plus years into a pretty significant drought event. And this is having really big impacts on water resource availability.\u201d\n\nDangerous lack of climate action\n\nBlake Masters has repeatedly questioned the validity of climate change in interviews. When asked what the role of climate change was in the politics of Arizona in an interview for The Hill, Masters said, \u201cWe gotta figure out if the Earth has been warming up and why and how much is caused by humans. I think people are open. The problem is they feel like they\u2019ve been lied to, so much and so often by the expert class. Not just on climate change, but on everything.\u201d\n\nHowever, scientists\u2019 verdict on climate change remains consistent for the past 30 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its sixth assessment report last year, with thousands of scientists concluding that human activities caused rapid climate change and global warming.\n\nAccording to polls, Masters trailed incumbent Mark Kelly during a significant part of the campaign period. In September, the GOP yanked more than $10 million in advertising funding from Arizona, suggesting the party did not consider the Senate seat winnable. However, in early October, the National Republican Senatorial Committee recommitted to backing Masters, with recent polls showing the Senate race tightening.\n\nAccording to a New York Times/Siena College Poll last week, more likely voters in Arizona prefer Kelly over Masters, but also prefer Republican control of the Senate. Environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters spent more than $100 million altogether in 2022 to elect candidates who put climate issues first, yet polls show environmental issues are not a top priority for voters.\n\nVoters remain disinterested in climate issues for many reasons, but unless the government solves the climate crisis, migration due to lack of water could become a scary reality in Arizona.\n\nBahr said, \u201cPoliticians talk about how expensive it is going to be to address climate change, but they leave out the part about how expensive it already is to deal with the impact of climate change and how much more expensive it will get.\u201d\n```"}

Pollack, who was assaulted at a party after someone spiked her drink in middle school, took matters into her own hands creating her organization, A Path 2 Courage, to educate others about sexual assault and domestic violence. She started off with an online event during the pandemic. The event highlighted different ways to intervene in situations involving sexual assault, ways to help survivors heal and how to inspire others to get involved with becoming an advocate for change.\n\nPollack is currently putting this into practice by working with USC fraternities to give chapter presentations. The response is unexpected \u2013 and overwhelmingly positive. This past semester she already gave 14 presentations on campus. In addition to her new member wellness day, where she presented to all the active fraternities\u2019 new members. Every time she tells her story, she reopens her trauma in hopes of spreading awareness and helping someone else who is struggling. It also helps her heal herself. Telling her story publicly is its own form of trauma therapy, Pollack says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done a bunch of group sessions and trauma therapy. But it was extremely healing, being able to finally put words to my emotions and be able to talk about my story publicly without feeling guilt and shame,\u201d she says.\n\nPollack is continuing to do this with the events she holds on campus, and some are even sponsored by fraternities. Late last month, she hosted an exhibit in collaboration with The Bradley Sonnenberg Wellness Initiative and Breaking Silence. The importance of having fraternities funding the event is motivation in itself, Pollack says.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re paying for it so it\u2019s more motivating for them to actually come and invest time in the exhibit.\u201d\n\nThe exhibit, which lasted four days, focuses on bringing awareness to sexual assault and domestic violence, especially on college campuses. When you first walk into the space where the exhibit is held, the third floor of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center (TCC), you are offered a pair of headphones and an iPod. This technology guides you through the nine makeshift rooms of the exhibit and allows you to hear the stories of both survivors and perpetrators. Each room is set up to correspond to the setting of the story being told, really immersing you in the first-hand narrative. The result is not only hearing these stories but feeling as if you\u2019re experiencing them unfolding. The visual scene that is set makes the words that much more powerful.\n\nUSC junior Yasmin Gohar, who is the president of communication and social media for A Path 2 Courage, described her experience walking through the exhibit.\n\n\u201cI heard from both the perspective of a victim and a perpetrator of sexual assault and domestic violence. Listening to both sides, I realized that oftentimes it can occur when we least expect it. Ali\u2019s story, the founder of Breaking Silence, stood out to me most as it discussed sexual assault in a college situation. This is especially important to highlight on campus as many incoming and current college students are naive and unfamiliar with life beyond their homes.\u201d\n\nWhile the stories do recount explicit details of violence and assault, the exhibit is meant to create a safe space where people can understand and connect with these experiences. With the increase of sexual assault cases, Pollack explains, it is important to have these spaces available for students. The ultimate goal is not simply to allow survivors to tell their truth, but to try to prevent sexual assault altogether.\n\nGohar feels that the concept of this exhibit is especially important.\n\n\u201cThis exhibit was vital to have at USC, especially in light of everything occurring with domestic violence, assault, and women\u2019s reproductive rights. Although it\u2019s a complex topic to grasp and discuss, it\u2019s essential to put it in the spotlight and get people to listen. I was not expecting to hear the stories I did, and they moved me more than I imagined they would,\u201d Gohar said.\n\nAfter walking through the exhibit there were spaces for reflection, a chance to talk to a specialist and any of the founders, and opportunities to engage with various resources offered through USC Student Health and the Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX.\n```"}

Owner Sergio Arias cares for his birds and knows how much they charm his guests, and he was equally proud to have them host the mayoral candidate.\n\nCaruso was a charmer, too, as he took to the stage and wooed his constituents. \u201cYou got a dimple in your tie,\u201d Caruso told an 11-year-old student of Monse\u00f1or Oscar Romero Charter School. \u201cThat is a really classy detail,\u201d With that, Caruso scored a laugh from the audience, one of many to come as he made his way through a series of questions from the boy.\n\nIt was the same kind of laugh he tries to elicit when diverting attention away from uncomfortable questions \u2013 like why he suddenly registered as a Democrat just before running for mayor. The boy had come with his father, a local businessman, and joined Caruso in front of a 50-odd crowd under a tented extension of the quincea\u00f1era venue.\n\nCaruso proceeded to lay down a version of his plan \u201cto end homelessness\u201d that included declaring a state of emergency, and how, because he is a builder, he can build houses fast. Just before the boy returned to join his father, also in suit and tie, proudly capturing the scene with his smartphone, Caruso asked if he thought he could accomplish his plan. \u201cHe can do it,\u201d the boy declared. \u201cWorship Caruso!\u201d\n\nThe audience cheered, and embraced the religious tone. Many wore blue-billed caps embroidered with \u201cRick Caruso for mayor.\u201d The give-and-take often sounded as if the audience\u2019s caps were red. They see Caruso as a businessman, not a politician \u2013 as an outsider who would not raise taxes but would amp-up money for the police.\n\nOut with the establishment and in with him \u2013 a man not drawn to a life-long career in politics but driven to clean-up a corrupt city hall. \u201cWhen you have crime, when you have homelessness, when you have the encampments, when you see the struggle, it dampens dreams,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cIt takes away people\u2019s optimism that Los Angeles is the land where dreams come true. I believe it still is. I\u2019ve had my dream, beyond my imagination. God has been abundantly good to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re blessed!\u201d an audience member called out. \u201cI am blessed beyond blessed. And now it\u2019s time to get back.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles, a Democratic stronghold, has not seen a Republican mayor since Richard Riordan ended his term in 2001. Though he was the first Los Angeles mayor to be term-limited out of office, there had not been a Republican mayor for 30 years before him. Riordan endorsed Rick Caruso in May 2022, four months after Caruso joined the Democratic party. He moved between Republican and unaffiliated over the last decade.\n\nThe switch gave Caruso a peculiar hybrid identity that has attracted voters unsettled by the ever-growing homelessness crisis coupled with the growing financial impact on the middle class. With inflation, housing and energy costs on the rise, many constituents are looking for someone who may bring about change.\n\nL.A.\u2019s establishment politicians took a hit in October after recordings were leaked in which city council members Nury Martinez, Gil Cedillo and Kevin de Le\u00f3n engaged in racist conversation while discussing redistricting issues. The tapes upended city government and public trust.\n\nThis is where Caruso positions himself, with his pointy leather shoes and silk tie, ready to step in as an outsider with a history of business success. To his supporters, he already built the ideal city. It\u2019s called the Grove, a fantasy made real, where leisure is encapsulated by merchandise and a grand boulevard leads you into the insulated and pristine bowels of courtyards where cocktails, pasta and fountains spout as a trolley train carries tired shoppers and their labradoodles.\n\nIt\u2019s nostalgic for a Hollywood Europe in California that was never here, and futuristic by inventing one. If he built that, surely his supporters believe, he could do the same for greater Los Angeles.\n\nA day of images to set the record\n\nBefore arriving at Salon Princesita, Caruso met a restaurant owner and sat for an exclusive interview with Telemundo at St. Lawrence of Brindisi, a Catholic church in Watts and a beneficiary of the Caruso Foundation. Caruso funds a church school program called Operation Progress, offering mentorship opportunities for children in Watts.\n\nCaruso\u2019s devotion to the Catholic church includes investments across the city; at USC, he founded the Caruso Catholic Center and erected Our Savior Parish Church on the campus of his alma mater. The project left many in a quandary about his pro-abortion-rights stance, which he professes when asked.\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media he underlined his views and denounced his opponent Karen Bass for what he said was her politicizing the issue. He then went on to say that Bass gave money to a congressman in Georgia who pushed for the Hyde Amendment, a law that bans federal Medicaid from funding abortions. Bass signed the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act in 2021, which is aimed at protecting abortion rights.\n\nMeanwhile, Caruso has given over $1 million to lawmakers such as Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy who worked to strike down Roe vs. Wade.\n\nCaruso then went on to meet with the Los Angeles Fire Department at Station 64 in Watts. The United Fire Fighters Union endorsed him. Though campaigning is not allowed on city property, the compound boasted a fire truck dressed in Caruso flags, and a fire pit with chairs around it, set for what looked like would be a fireside chat. Organizers asked Annenberg Media reporters to leave the station before the candidate\u2019s private session.\n\nA bit later in the day, Caruso boarded a vintage fire truck adorned with rooftop seats for a ride around L.A. He donned his LAFD cap and joined family, friends, and uniformed men for a view of the city. When they arrived at the quincea\u00f1era hall it was dusk and the party was frigid. But a taco truck awaited them, and his town hall constituents were well past their first serving.\n\nBack at the hall\n\nWhen the microphone started to go around the room the first to take hold of it was Barbara McFarlin, an impassioned Black woman who spoke her truth much to the discomfort of the Caruso campaign staff. \u201cI like you because you are an outsider,\u201d McFarlin said. \u201cYou\u2019re like Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nNote to historians: She wasn\u2019t the first to draw the comparison with another big-city builder. Way back in 2007, before Caruso bared his political aspirations and during his rise as a developer, a book editor for the L.A. Times, David L. Ulin, called him the Donald Trump of Los Angeles.\n\nMcFarlin, though, was speaking about a Trump of a different era, one who as president transformed the rhetoric of the Republican Party and wove his image as an American-made business tycoon with the language and aesthetics of mid-century European fascism.\n\nCaruso didn\u2019t challenge McFarlin or contradict her view. His staffer called out to her, pressing if she had a question. She didn\u2019t, she just wanted to share. He took the microphone from her.\n\nL.A. Times paints Caruso like a son of Tony Soprano\n\nIn a November 3 article, the L.A. Times depicted Caruso as a family man who could hold his family\u2019s past, while forging a future empire based on his own imaginings. If he had listened to them, he would still have been a lawyer. He is Catholic, of Italian descent, his father spent time in jail in the 1960s for cheating people out of money in car sales. He got his moral fiber from his mother, and his business smarts from his dad.\n\nHis dad never wanted him to go into politics, but he cherished his vision for the Grove, realizing a bygone era of cleanliness and safety. He put himself in the running for mayor after his dad died, and cried when he was asked what his father would say about his mayoral ambition.\n\nTainted by family crime, pumped full of aspiration, he crafted his own American dream. The one that for most others remains a dream, or an impossibility. Like Tony Soprano from the hit HBO show, he owns a house in a good neighborhood, and runs businesses that do well while he embraces the complications of inheritance.\n\nAnd like Soprano, his viewers love him even more because he faces the trouble in his past \u2013 through that struggle his money gains humanity. He served on the board of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, made famous by Roman Polanski\u2019s \u201cChinatown.\u201d He was president of the L.A. Police Commission and Chair of the USC Board of Trustees during numerous upheavals and betrayals of trust.\n\nDuring his board tenure, the dean of the Keck School of Medicine provided methamphetamine to a young woman with whom he was having an affair, USC gynecologist George Tyndall had been sexually abusing students for more than 30 years, and the school was a centerpiece of Operation Varsity Blues, an admissions scandal that saw a number of wealthy parents charged with bribing their children\u2019s way into universities.\n\nHe still dodges questions about those problems. When asked about his lack of transparency on the Tyndall case his answer was plain. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any lack of transparency,\u201d insisted Caruso, responding to an Annenberg Media journalist after the town hall meeting at Salon Princesita. \u201cI disagree respectfully with the premise of your question.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Caruso still manages to paint himself as a hero. Maybe that is why his constituents love and pray for him. After all, he declared, \u201cthe scandals are over \u2013 and cleaned up.\u201d```"}

Volunteers will then go through the trash, sort out plastics and record detailed information on the kinds of items found. Credit: Philip Salata\n\nBy Philip Salata, Jeremy Kole, Shreya Agrawal and Arun Cherukuri November 06, 2022 at 4:05 pm PST\n\nLong Beach, Calif. \u2013 On land, Captain Charles Moore\u2019s sea legs give way to his green thumb. His neighbors know him for his front yard farmers market \u2013 they come for the fruit, but they stay for the conversation. And he has a lot to say, as the oceanographer who discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. In 1997, while sailing his research ship, the Alguita, Moore came across the mass of plastic accumulated in the North Pacific gyre that is roughly three times the size of France. The plastic he saw then has now broken down into a toxic soup. It no longer just traps organisms \u2013 it has worked its way into their flesh.\n\nSince Moore\u2019s discovery 25 years ago, marine plastic contamination has only gotten worse, but legislation has not matched the magnitude of the problem. On June 30, 2022, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law to curb plastic waste, putting the responsibility on plastic manufacturers. Many environmentalists agree that while the bill was long overdue, it could serve as the bellwether to shift the pendulum in the right direction. But Moore has some concerns.\n\nThe Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act started as a far more comprehensive grassroots initiative with stricter regulations, but it failed to gain ground despite feverish lobbying and negotiations. Opposition from plastic manufacturers resulted in a rush to pass the act that includes several compromises which undermine its efficacy.\n\nCaptain Charles Moore tends his weekly farmers market in Long Beach, Calif. on Jul. 31, 2022. Moore grew up at the house where he still lives and has been cultivating fruits and vegetables for decades. Credit: Philip Salata\n\nBut the real fallout is much graver than that. Instead of limiting the production of single-use plastic, the bill paved the way for the fossil fuel industry to maintain its stronghold in California, one of the world\u2019s largest markets for plastic products. The act doesn\u2019t outright ban styrofoam, known to be one of the most toxic plastics, and lacks specific language to ban the burning of plastics. It also sets a 10-year timeline to reduce plastics from the market, making purging plastic from the environment a pipe dream.\n\nWill Lorenzi, president of Smart Planet Technologies, an eco-friendly materials engineering company, said, \u201cNo one will start making changes until you get close to the dates.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was what I anticipated, a devil\u2019s bargain,\u201d said Andy Hattala, Co-Chair of the Climate Reality Project in Los Angeles. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to be supporting some form of the oil industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cScience generally makes improvements, and in this situation, we can see that with politics you can actually go backwards,\u201d Moore said.\n\nThe plastic problem\n\nThe plastics revolution took off before World War II, when the demand for efficient, light and cheap materials prompted the creation of plastic products such as polyethylene, styrofoam and nylon. They fueled the war, then fed the post-war boom, during which nearly everything was made of plastic, from windows and doors, bottles and bags, to clothes. It became a cash cow for the fossil fuel industry because most plastic is made from petrochemicals, which are petroleum and natural gas products.\n\nThe influence of the plastic industry even made its way into popular culture. According to the 1967 film \u201cThe Graduate\u201d starring a young Dustin Hoffman, it was the new way to become rich. But with the ease of production also came the apparent ease of disposal.\n\nMegan Fieser, a chemist at the University of Southern California whose research focuses on plastic, points out the irony: \u201cSome of the qualities that make plastic really wonderful for these applications also become its flaw when it\u2019s thrown away,\u201d she said.\n\nGlobally, less than 10 percent of plastic waste is recycled every year. Most non-recyclable plastics are single-use and end up in landfills. The life of single-use plastic is a blip compared to the centuries it takes to degrade. Due to the mismanagement of waste, much of that plastic ends up in the ocean.\n\nJames Fawcett, the former Chief of Planning for the Los Angeles Department of Beaches and Harbors, said that plastic waste usually collects in the city\u2019s drains and rivers all year round, and washes out into the oceans during the winter rains. Fawcett said the Department of Public Works installed a net to catch the debris, much of which was cups made of styrofoam.\n\nAccording to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD), by 2060, the amount of plastic buildup in rivers, lakes, and oceans will more than triple to about a billion metric tons.\n\nSea turtles are especially vulnerable to plastic pollution. To them, bits of floating, translucent plastic resemble jellyfish and algae, which are significant parts of turtles\u2019 diets. A research study by the University of Queensland suggests that more than half of sea turtles worldwide have ingested marine debris.\n\n\u201cMost turtles are endangered or threatened, so anything that happens to them is a potential threat to the entire species,\u201d said Jill Sohm, a marine biologist at the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on Catalina Island.\n\nWhen plastic waste enters the marine environment, it breaks down into smaller pieces, known as microplastics. They are ubiquitous in marine waters worldwide, yet harder to see because of their small size. Many scientists believe they are a bigger problem for the oceans than larger plastics, but their impacts on organisms are not yet well known.\n\nMicroplastics have been found in filter feeders and certain fish species, which ingest these particles with their food. A study has shown that microplastics can alter behavior within fish. Plastic lingers in organic bodies for decades because organisms normally cannot process toxic chemicals.\n\n\u201cThey might be in small concentrations at the bottom of the food chain, but then if another organism eats a lot of the smaller [organisms], they might have the potential to ingest a lot of microplastics,\u201d said Sohm.\n\nThe Plastics Act: landmark or landfill?\n\nCalifornia\u2019s ambitious goal of transitioning into a sustainable economy seemed to take a significant step in the right direction with the passing of the Plastics Act. According to Hattala of the Climate Reality Project, the Act is the most comprehensive plastic policy to be implemented in California and the United States.\n\nIt lays out a plan to cut down single-use plastic packaging and foodware, like plates, straws, and utensils, by a quarter within 10 years. It also states that all single-use packaging and foodware, including non-plastic items, must be recyclable or compostable. It is the first plastics act to hold manufacturers responsible for waste generation.\n\nIt also sets up the California Plastic Pollution Mitigation Fund which collects $500 million per year from manufacturers, as well as an oversight commission to keep them accountable.\n\nThose provisions were a huge deal for Nick Lapis, the Director of Advocacy for Californians Against Waste (CAW). CAW initially opposed the Act, but after it was amended to include the measures, the organization changed its stance.\n\n\u201cWe had been trusting the industry to achieve these goals and frankly, that model has not worked in the past,\u201d Lapis said.\n\nDespite support from a majority of environmental organizations, recycling associations, and public interest groups, critics believe the Act is missing the mark. Compromises introduced by plastic manufacturers have led to a call for stricter regulations.\n\nAmong them was an outright ban on styrofoam. Instead, the Act allowed for its use if manufacturers complied with the stated recycling goals. Jenn Engstrom, the State Director of the California Public Interest Research Group, referred to this compromise as a failure to ban \u201csome of the worst low-hanging fruits of single-use plastic.\u201d\n\nAnother contested component is the timeline of regulations, as most of the plastic policy outlined in the Act comes into effect in 2032. Lorenzi, of Smart Planet Technologies, believes this will enable plastic manufacturers to delay changing their operations.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows how procrastination works,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re giving them a long, long runway, and they\u2019re gonna cram the night before.\u201d\n\nLorenzi pointed out that the European Union banned certain single-use plastics in 2019 and implemented its policy in 2021.\n\nThe most critical weakness of the Plastics Act was the omission of language that explicitly prohibits burning plastic, which releases hundreds of toxic chemicals like dioxins and phthalates. These can cause respiratory problems, fertility issues, and cancer.\n\nThe Act does state that \u201cincineration\u201d and \u201ccombustion\u201d do not qualify as recycling but does not define them, giving the plastics industry the power to interpret these terms in their favor. This incentivizes production because the industry is no longer forced to invest in actual recycling methods \u2013 a convenient fix to keep producing more.\n\n\u201cBig plastic has been lying to the public about plastics\u2019 recyclability, and now they\u2019re trying to take incineration and rebrand it as recycling,\u201d said Jane Williams, Executive Director at California Communities Against Toxics.\n\nWilliams believes that the relief fund established by the Plastics Act was a way for the fossil fuel industry to buy its way out of recycling regulations. She also thinks it will establish a concerning precedent.\n\n\u201cThe ink wasn\u2019t dry on [Newsom\u2019s] signature before the American Chemistry Council\u2019s lobbyists were in Congress and New York City,\u201d she said.\n\nSince passing the Plastics Act, California legislators have introduced and passed a series of recycling-related bills and other climate-related legislation, aimed at reducing pollution. These recent bills tighten some of the loopholes in the Plastics Act and other previous plastic laws.\n\nBut even as recycling laws become stricter, the fossil fuel industry will continue to lobby its way into retaining its hold on what is still a growing plastics industry.\n\nRethinking Plastic\n\nIn the absence of decisive political action to control plastic waste, many scientists have taken it upon themselves to reimagine recycling. Fieser focuses on finding substitutes for plastic that degrade under natural conditions or can be easily recycled. She is also interested in the idea of upcycling, which would make the waste into something more valuable than it originally was. In this case, she wants to convert plastic waste into fuel.\n\nTravis Williams, who also works with the Wrigley Institute, has an entirely different approach to solving the plastic problem: turning it into medicine.\n\n\u201cWe can take the Pacific Garbage Patch, blast it with some catalytic chemistry and feed that to a fungus. And the fungus will make medicinal natural products,\u201d said Williams, referring to the huge mass of plastic discovered by Moore.\n\nWilliams and Clay Wang, his collaborator at the USC School of Pharmacy, are using these medicines to create potential cures for diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. He sees the potential to convert billions of pounds of plastic waste into medicine. But he foresees one colossal drawback: do we even need that much?\n\nCommunity in Action\n\nEighty-three pounds of trash, sixty volunteers, two hours. That was the result of the Surfrider Foundation\u2019s Venice Beach cleanup on July 9, 2022. Participants came out to feel the potential of collective effort.\n\nFor Kelcey Rose, who had just arrived in Los Angeles from Florida the day before, joining the beach cleanup was a way to mingle with like-minded people.\n\n\u201cThey should make a Bumble, but with beach clean-ups,\u201d she said, referring to the popular dating app.\n\nHer musings, though humorous, underlined a crucial point about individual action. It is a lonely fight and can feel Sisyphean. Corporations often try to push off the responsibility of being environmentally conscious onto individuals.\n\n\u201cSaying people have to solve the problem and should feel the guilt about their impact is problematic,\u201d said marine biologist Jill Sohm.\n\nSohm believes that is hard to achieve when all the choices given to the public by corporations are not sustainable.\n\n\u201cWhat really needs to change are the options from those corporations. They need to take responsibility for the huge impacts that they have,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, changing the culture of consumption is critical. According to Moore, this change can only come about with a fundamental re-evaluation of our needs.\n\n\u201cYou want the next best thing, and you throw it away to get the next best thing,\u201d Moore said.\n\nMoore Changes Course\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Moore docked the Alguita, his 50-foot catamaran converted into a certified research vessel, in the Alamitos Bay Marina to undergo repairs. Meanwhile, he founded the Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research and is currently establishing the first accredited lab to determine the amount of plastic in drinking water.\n\nMoore can be cynical about the relationship between government and industry, but his institute works to connect policy makers with viable solutions to address plastic waste. He now spends most of his time on dry land, with his efforts split between fostering the new institute and cultivating a garden that he opens up to his neighbors.\n\nTo him, local food production is integral to the fight against plastic pollution \u2013 from the ground, unpackaged, and directly into the hands of the hungry.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that AB 881 and eight other bills were signed into law on Oct. 5, 2022. It has been corrected to include the 2022 recycling laws. Annenberg Media regrets this error.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nNovember 06, 2022 at 1:11 am PDT\n\nThere is a lot to be positive about regarding No. 9 USC\u2019s 41-35 win over Cal on Saturday night at the Coliseum. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams was dominant, carrying the offense with nearly 400 total yards and five total touchdowns. Sophomore receiver Michael Jackson III had a breakout game, with 150 all-purpose yards and a pair of touchdown catches. Redshirt junior safety Bryson Shaw had another big game with 11 tackles, junior defensive end Tuli Tuipulotu had two more sacks and sophomore safety Calen Bullock had an interception and a pass breakup.\n\nUSC is 8-1 and squarely in the mix for the College Football Playoff after two teams ahead of it in the rankings lost on Saturday. But after the game, players and coaches still felt frustrated with the team\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cWe came here to dominate and really show the world what kind of team we really are,\u201d redshirt senior running back Travis Dye said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not happening yet, but it will. It definitely will. I have full confidence, full faith in this team.\u201d\n\nThe frustration especially stems from the Trojans\u2019 defensive play, as they haven\u2019t been able to close out games. USC allowed 21 fourth-quarter points from Cal on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cWe can be excited by a win and pissed off about how we played,\u201d defensive coordinator Alex Grinch said. \u201cWe got to play 60 minutes and we\u2019re going to find a way to do that.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans didn\u2019t come out of the gates particularly strong. Their first drive on offense stalled out fairly quickly, then the Golden Bears marched down the field in under two minutes to take an early 7-0 lead. Cal freshman running back Jaydn Ott ran at will early; he concluded the possession with a 10-yard run into the end zone, breaking a couple of tackles along the way.\n\nWith linebackers sophomore Eric Gentry and senior Ralen Goforth out due to injury for a second straight week, it looked as though it might be a long night for the Trojans\u2019 run defense. But USC quickly settled into the game on both sides of the ball.\n\nDespite not having his two star receivers \u2014 junior Jordan Addison and sophomore Mario Williams \u2014 for a second straight week, Williams found other options through the air against a lackluster Golden Bears pass defense. After a breakout performance last week that included 118 receiving yards and two touchdowns, redshirt junior Tahj Washington again saw plenty of targets, including eight in the first half.\n\nThe Trojans found the end zone on two of their next three drives, with both Williams and Dye finding pay dirt on the ground to take a 13-7 lead. Still in just his second season, Williams showed some savvy, veteran skills, especially during a huge fourth-down conversion for the Trojans on their second scoring drive.\n\nWilliams coaxed a pair of Golden Bears offside, then used the free play to find wide-open redshirt senior receiver Terrell Bynum for a 20-yard gain into the redzone.\n\n\u201c[Caleb] has come a long way since I played him in the Alamo Bowl a year back,\u201d Dye said about playing Williams when the two were at Oregon and Oklahoma, respectively. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s just a sophomore always surprises me.\u201d\n\nThe USC defense also found some rhythm, something the group hadn\u2019t had in its past couple of games. The Trojans weren\u2019t as reliant on their turnover-dependent, \u201cbend-don\u2019t-break\u201d style, forcing three Cal punts on its next three possessions and holding the Golden Bears scoreless for the rest of the first half.\n\nUSC especially locked down Ott after his big opening drive, when he had three rushes for 40 yards; he was held to only 15 yards on his remaining 11 rushes of the game.\n\nThat defensive rhythm continued when USC forced a turnover on downs deep in Trojan territory late in the first half; then, with just over a minute remaining before halftime, Bullock picked off a deep pass by Cal redshirt senior quarterback Jack Plummer.\n\nIn just two plays \u2014 a 39-yard pass to Washington inside the 10-yard line and a diving catch by Jackson in the end zone \u2014 the Trojans extended their lead to 20-7 before halftime.\n\nJackson, who has seen more snaps in recent weeks due to injuries in the receiver room, has made the most of his newfound opportunities. His second catch of the day also reached the end zone, as this time Jackson took a screen pass 59 yards to the house, increasing USC\u2019s lead to 27-7.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t appeared in a game this season prior to Utah, but the young wideout now has three touchdown catches in three games.\n\n\u201cThey are two guys that, right at the beginning, weren\u2019t necessarily ... getting a lot of opportunities,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said of Washington and Jackson. \u201cThey\u2019ve continued to work, continued to improve. Those guys are evident of what we need to be as a team.\u201d\n\nWith Ott struggling on the ground and Cal\u2019s deficit quickly growing, the Golden Bears had to lean on Plummer and the passing game in the second half. The Golden Bears got a much-needed big play when Plummer found junior receiver Jeremiah Hunter deep on the sideline for a 58-yard gain; redshirt senior receiver Monroe Young caught a touchdown pass a couple plays later to keep Cal within striking distance, though still trailing by two scores.\n\nThe USC offense still kept humming. Washington capped off perhaps the Trojans\u2019 best offensive drive of the night with a 10-yard touchdown on another screen play. That drive put USC up 34-14 and consisted of 4-for-4 passing from Williams for 40 yards to go with four rushes for 46 yards, including a 27-yard run by Dye.\n\nCal still wouldn\u2019t quite go away, though, and the USC defense struggled to get stops in the second half. Plummer responded quickly with a 47-yard touchdown pass to redshirt freshman receiver Mavin Anderson, who practically walked into the end zone after USC\u2019s secondary blew a coverage assignment.\n\nA surprise onside kick recovery later, and the Golden Bears were abruptly right back in this game. Plummer methodically led another touchdown drive on the ensuing possession, finding Hunter for a three-yard score to cut the lead further.\n\nCal\u2019s quarterback was stellar all game, completing 35 of 49 passes for 406 yards, three touchdowns and an interception.\n\nGrinch took the blame for his team\u2019s defensive issues later in the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coaching. We have done a good job in the second half in the past, but we didn\u2019t come close to that [tonight],\u201d Grinch said. \u201cWe got to start searching high and low to find what works.\u201d\n\nAll of a sudden, USC led by just seven points with nine minutes remaining in a game that felt eerily similar to last week\u2019s contest at Arizona, with the defense unable to get stops late.\n\nBut thankfully for USC, like in that Arizona game, Williams took over in the fourth quarter to put it away. Well, him and Jackson.\n\n\u201cHe runs hard, he runs aggressive,\u201d Riley said of Jackson. \u201cSome guys run as the aggressor, like \u2018I\u2019m going to get mine.\u2019 And he runs like that.\u201d\n\nJackson had back-to-back big gains on USC\u2019s ensuing drive. The first was a 29-yard diving catch coming back towards Williams on a scramble and throw. The second was a crafty reverse for 19 yards that quickly put the Trojans deep in Cal territory.\n\nFour plays later, Williams rolled out again and found redshirt freshman tight end Lake McRee at the goal line, putting USC up 41-27 with 5:34 to go.\n\nBut yet again, the USC defense allowed Cal to march right back down the field and answer with a 12-play, 85-yard drive in under three minutes.\n\nA two-point conversion cut the USC lead to six with two and a half minutes left, and the Golden Bears had all three of their timeouts remaining.\n\nHowever, the Trojans recovered the onside kick this time and held on to win 41-35, albeit unsatisfyingly.\n\n\u201cWe could have really separated, and we didn\u2019t,\u201d Riley said, citing mistakes in all three phases of the game. \u201cIf you\u2019re winning, you\u2019re doing more good than bad. We just got to do more good and eliminate some of the bad football.\u201d\n\nUSC improves to 8-1 overall and 6-1 in Pac-12 play, while Cal falls to 3-6, 1-5 in conference play. The Trojans have a short week coming up, as they will remain at home to face Colorado on Friday, November 11 at 6:30 p.m.\n```"}

The Trojans move to 12-2-3 overall and 8-1-2 in Pac-12 play, while UCLA falls to 17-2-0, 9-2-0.\n\nUSC\u2019s win could not have been predicted in the game\u2019s first minutes. Under pressure and a high offensive block from UCLA, the Trojans suffered from multiple ball losses and could not keep a long possession period. The Bruins, aware of their early superiority, then shot four times in the first 10 minutes, putting the defense and graduate goalkeeper Anna Smith under tight pressure.\n\nThe Bruins did not score, and USC did not miss its opportunity to strike first 15 minutes in the game. Sophomore forward Kayla Colbert shot a cross from the right side of the box to redshirt senior defender Kaylin Martin, who, after a chest control, only had to poke it home past the keeper.\n\nAfter that goal, the energy went up a bar for the Trojans, who continued to have intense activity in the midfield with a game of passes and attacks on the UCLA box. And it paid off a second time. In the 29th minute, UCLA sophomore defender Lily Reale missed clearing a shot. The ball rebounded on her arm, becoming a handball in the box, giving the Trojans another scoring opportunity. Junior defender Zoe Burns did not miss the chance and buried the penalty in the left corner, giving USC a 2-0 lead.\n\n\u201cI think the key was to ignore that they\u2019re number one in the rankings,\u201d USC head coach Jane Alukonis said after the match, \u201cand just play our game, set the tone and dominate.\u201d\n\nBoth offense and defense remained strong, leading to two other scoring chances during the 37th and 38th minutes, both saved by UCLA graduate goalkeeper Lauren Brzykcy. The Trojans kept up their game until halftime with a solid defense \u2014 almost entirely neutralizing the Bruin\u2019s offense.\n\nThe second period did not see many opportunities for both teams. With a comfortable 2-0 lead, USC did not have to make plays, but the Bruins did not seem in capacity to tear the Trojans\u2019 defense. Brzykcy made three saves in the 50th and 51st minutes, saving a first shot from sophomore forward Simone Jackson, leading to back-to-back shots off the ensuing corner kick.\n\nUp to the task for a full 90 minutes, the defense only suffered in the last 10 minutes of the game. In the 81st minute, graduate defender Madelyn Desiano shot a retreating center from the right for senior forward Sunshine Fontes. Left unmarked by two Trojans\u2019 defenders, she adjusted a point-blank shot, but Smith was there to make the save.\n\nThe Trojans maintained their defense until the final whistle and were left to savor their win over the crosstown rival for the first time in seven years.\n\n\u201cThey were competing for a Pac-12 title, and we just wanted to make sure we came out and denied them that, but we did it for ourselves,\u201d Burns said.\n\n\u201cWe have a quick turnaround.

(Photo by Aayush Khator)\n\nBy Samuel Reno\nNovember 04, 2022 at 11:22 pm PDT\n\nJordan Wilson\u2019s 20th swing of the night found the floor, and USC found its first win in two weeks. After suffering their first losing stretch of the season, this new-look Trojans group took a big step toward getting back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2019.\n\nUSC came from behind to top Arizona State 3-1 Friday night at Galen Center. The Trojans missed just five of their 94 attempts from behind the line on the night, taking the last three sets to hold off the Sun Devils.\n\n\u201cI think the only way we were able to kind of get through that was our service game was pretty good,\u201d USC head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cI just felt like we were always getting them in certain jams and allowing us to at least have a shot.\u201d\n\nSenior outside hitter Skylar Fields did not play in the Trojans\u2019 loss at Colorado Sunday, but she was right back in the starting lineup Friday night and pacing the USC offensive effort. Fields finished off an eight-kill second set with a massive slam that deflected over the scorers table, closing out a 25-22 set-two victory.\n\nThe transfer outside hitter ended the night with a game-high 21 finishes to go along with a triad of blocks.\n\n\u201cSkylar\u2019s one of the best players in the country,\u201d Keller said. \u201cIf we can keep her healthy, I\u2019d like to do that because she\u2019s an important part of this team.\u201d\n\nBut it took Fields time to find her footing, as she registered just five kills on 20 attempts in the 25-20 opening frame loss. While the Pac-12\u2032s leader in kills struggled, junior outside hitter Marta Levinska pounced for Arizona State, finding the floor seven times in the Sun Devils\u2019 victorious set one.\n\nLevinska racked up another seven kills over the next two sets, including a slam that put Arizona State ahead 12-8 midway through the second frame. Leading 1-0 and controlling set two, the Sun Devils looked poised to pull away.\n\n\u201cPeople need to realize how good ASU is,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThey have two elite pins that can hit their way out of anything. They outscrapped us in the first set. They made so many good plays.\u201d\n\nFacing that same 12-8 deficit, freshman libero Gala Trubint went back to serve for USC. By the time the Sun Devils won back the serve, the Trojans had tied it at 13 apiece. They took the next two points, forced an Arizona State timeout and never trailed for the remainder of the set.\n\n\u201cI feel really confident going back to serve because other people trust me,\u201d Trubint said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been really accepting of each others\u2019 roles and have given me the freedom to take advantage of my position and be comfortable telling people where we are on defense and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nTrubint missed just one of her 21 serves on the night, and the two-time Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week racked up a game-high four aces to boot.\n\nUSC also got a lift from another freshman in defensive specialist Megan Verbiest. Verbiest had only appeared in more than one set once \u2013 a 3-1 loss at Creighton on September 2. The freshman took the floor in the final three sets Friday night, a career high, as she served a perfect 8-for-8, tallying a pair of aces.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of Megan,\u201d Trubint said. \u201cShe works extremely hard in practice, is always grateful for every opportunity and came out and played her game. She knows that we trust her, so she knows that she can go out there and play her game.\u201d\n\nThe win halts a three-game skid for the Trojans and improves them to 17-7 and 9-4 in conference, keeping pace with Washington State for third in the Pac-12. USC will look to complete the sweep of the Arizona schools when they host the Wildcats on Sunday.\n```"}

What a shame, I know. That title belongs to Gregg Berhalter, who has failed to bestow in fans even a mustard seed\u2019s worth of hope going into the World Cup. One of the main reasons for this uncertainty is his questionable personnel selections. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind: When the official roster drops Nov. 9, USMNT fans will be sent into a frenzy of fury, questioning just about every selected player \u2014 myself included.\n\nSo, before the storm hits, let\u2019s use our imaginations for a second and picture a world where Adam Jasper, the tactical genius, is in charge. Here is my 26-man roster:\n\nGoalkeepers: Matt Turner, Ethan Horvath, Gaga Slonina\n\nAbout a year ago, this position would\u2019ve been one of the most certain in the whole roster, with Zach Steffen being the starter. That is, until Steffen flamed out like no other. His recent club form and his form at the end of World Cup qualifying is more than enough to keep him out of the squad. Matt Turner is the GK1 for this USMNT side on the basis of consistency and, honestly, a lack of other options. His reflexes stand out, enabling him to make one-on-one saves in big spots. Ethan Horvath is a very serviceable backup, as we witnessed first hand in the 2021 Nations League final. While I don\u2019t know if you can count on him as a starter, he\u2019s my solid No. 2. With the third spot, I\u2019ve gone with teenage sensation Gaga Slonina. He secured a move to the Premier League after a spectacular campaign with Chicago Fire in MLS. Since I view him as the keeper of the future for the U.S., I put him in the 26 to get him some very valuable World Cup experience with low risk.\n\nDefenders: Antonee Robinson, Joe Scally, Sergi\u00f1o Dest, DeAndre Yedlin, Reggie Cannon, John Brooks, Chris Richards, Walker Zimmerman, Mark McKenzie\n\nThis is the most shaky position group for the United States. The man I actually trust the most out of all of the center backs, John Brooks, likely won\u2019t make Berhalter\u2019s roster. Health is going to be the crutch for the center backs. Miles Robinson would be a lock had he not torn his Achilles in the summer. Chris Richards\u2019 status is still up in the air. If the U.S. actually has to trot out Walker Zimmerman and Aaron Long (not in my roster, but he\u2019ll likely make the team considering he is Berhalter\u2019s teacher\u2019s pet), they might not have a chance to begin with. The fullback group carries this defensive unit. Antonee Robinson and Sergi\u00f1o Dest can get forward to provide attacking threats, but they\u2019ve also proven they can defend in a crunch. DeAndre Yedlin might be a little past his prime to be playing in a World Cup, but he\u2019s one of just two players on my roster who played on the 2014 team \u2014 the last time the U.S. played in the competition.\n\nMidfielders: Tyler Adams, Kellyn Acosta, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Luca de la Torre, Gianluca Busio, Malik Tillman\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to argue that the United States is the deepest in the midfield. This group is super talented \u2014 and also super young. The issue in the middle of the park is balance. What combination of three players will be most effective? My pick is Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Luca de la Torre. This group has one ball-winning and tempo-controlling defensive midfielder, one true box-to-box midfielder with aerial abilities and one progressive, mobile attacking midfielder. It\u2019s tough to leave Yunus Musah out of the starting lineup considering his talent, but his profile is too similar to McKennie and Adams to have a balanced product. Musah will provide much-needed energy should he come off the bench. I gave some of the fringe spots to prospects with promise (Busio, Tillman) as opposed to veterans like Cristian Roldan. This campaign should be about development as much as it should be about results. Roldan shouldn\u2019t even see the pitch anyway, so why even bother putting him in the squad (looking at you, Berhalter).\n\nForwards: Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Timothy Weah, Brenden Aaronson, Jordan Pefok, Josh Sargent, Ricardo Pepi\n\nThis is the drama position group. At this point, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear, correct decision up front. That being said, I would put Christian Pulisic on the left, Gio Reyna on the right and Jordan Pefok up front. This trio has two dynamic wingers who can make incisive runs behind the defense plus a striker who is in great form with his club and is the most clinical in the squad. My pipe dream, mad genius idea for the attack would be to put Timothy Weah at striker. While he\u2019s only ever played in the wing for the U.S., I could see him being an electric option up front, and I don\u2019t want to leave him out of the starting lineup. Brenden Aaronson should be the super sub. Use his immense energy and work rate to take advantage of tired opposing defenders later on in the game. I don\u2019t think Jesus Ferreira should make the squad. Will he? Absolutely. But he\u2019s proven time and time again to lack the clinical finishing needed to put away easy chances. You can\u2019t be on the plane if you can\u2019t even do your main job well.\n\nSo there you have it, my 26-man team is set. I don\u2019t expect the actual roster to look anything like this, knowing Berhalter. I\u2019m sure it sounds rich coming from me, but when the roster drops, let\u2019s cut the negativity and support our squad. From the second they step on the plane until the final minute the U.S. plays in the World Cup, every player is a representative of our nation, just trying to make history. It\u2019s a noble mission, one that we should applaud the whole way through.\n```"}

Rick Caruso pictured at debate hosted by USC in March 2022. (Photo by Jason Goode and Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Sullivan Maley November 04, 2022 at 4:55 pm PDT\n\nWith less than a week remaining until election day, Annenberg Media spoke with mayoral candidates Rick Caruso and Karen Bass about the race and their plans for the city. The candidates addressed a variety of issues central to the race, such as homelessness, crime and housing, while also taking time to respond to the statements and accusations of their opponents.\n\nBass has targeted Caruso throughout the campaign for past donations to Republican lawmakers like Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep. Kevin McCarthy. Appearing with Sen. Bernie Sanders at an event in Playa Vista last week, Bass accused Caruso of \u201cusing his riches to lie about his anti-choice Republican history.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been pro-choice, so that\u2019s always been my stance forever. And I think it\u2019s unfair that what Karen has done is to try to turn things on me. I think it\u2019s unfair to women in Los Angeles to make this a political issue,\u201d Caruso said in an interview Wednesday with ATVN. \u201cSo have I given money to Republicans? Yes. But Karen Bass has given money to people and a congressman in particular in Georgia that pushed the Hyde Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, named after its original sponsor Rep. Henry Hyde, is a provision that Congress has included in annual appropriations bills for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies (L-HHS-Ed) since 1976. It blocks the use of federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or life-threatening pregnancy, according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nCaruso also defended his handling of the scandal surrounding former USC gynecologist George Tyndall in 2019 as chair of the Board of Trustees, for which Bass and others have accused him of a lack of transparency. Caruso led the board through the negotiation of a $1.1 billion settlement with Tyndall\u2019s hundreds of victims, but some critics were frustrated that the entirety of the investigation conducted by the university was not released.\n\nDuring an interview with Annenberg Media Thursday, Bass referred to the controversy surrounding her $95,000 scholarship to USC\u2019s social work program as \u201cCaruso wanting to muddy the waters around USC to essentially divert attention from his lack of leadership over the Tyndall case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t lack of transparency. I was brought in as chair to clean up USC and I did,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cEvery expert told us not to release any detailed information because it revictimized the people. It wouldn\u2019t be right. It wouldn\u2019t be fair. But there\u2019s about 700 pages of information that has been on the USC website for a couple of years now...If it was just up to me, I would probably maybe release some more. But at the same time, I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\u201d\n\nDuring the conversation Wednesday, Caruso framed himself as the \u201cchange candidate\u201d in the mayoral race and had a final message to garner support from voters who are still undecided going into election day.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re happy with the way your community is today...if you feel safe, if you\u2019re happy with the homeless situation, if you\u2019re happy with the corruption, then I\u2019m not your candidate. If you want change, our system is broken. If you want someone to fix the system and have real positive change to make L.A. more livable and safer, I\u2019d be honored to have your vote and put me to work,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to denying any misconduct in her acceptance of the scholarship, Bass discussed her plans for various issues throughout Los Angeles including policing and homelessness. The congresswoman said she believes that different strategies are necessary to fulfill the varying needs of L.A.\u2019s different neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThere are some neighborhoods in Los Angeles that really would like to have an increased police presence. In those neighborhoods, if that\u2019s what they would like to see, that\u2019s what they should have,\u201d Bass said. \u201cIn inner-city areas...there is not a big cry to have an increased police presence. What is wanted there are resources for community-based programs to prevent crime.\u201d\n\nBass expressed Thursday that one of the issues she currently sees with our local government is the disconnect between L.A. City and County officials, and the missed opportunities that arise from the two entities not working together.\n\n\u201cI think one of the things that has been broken in our policy is the lack of collaboration actually between L.A. city and L.A. County...We need to centralize the process. And there\u2019s a lot of regulations that need to be relaxed or waived or changed in a lot of different areas,\u201d Bass said. \u201cFor example, it takes too long to build housing because you have to go through so many hoops in order to get the public financing...You have to go to about ten different departments in order to get approvals.\u201d\n\nA vocal supporter of the \u201chousing first\u201d model promoted by current mayor Eric Garcetti, Bass has expressed that the best way to deal with L.A.\u2019s homelessness problem is working to get individuals off the streets as quickly as possible. She has criticized Caruso, a developer, for not building affordable housing in L.A.\n\nWhen asked about her plans for providing housing for the city\u2019s significant homeless population, Bass said she believes the use of publicly-owned land is crucial.\n\n\u201cI had a press conference a couple of weeks ago on a piece of city-owned property where we could build very quickly,\u201d Bass said. \u201cAn architectural firm...believe[s] they could put up units of housing in eight months.\u201d\n\nBass also addressed some of the safety concerns afflicting many Angelenos, saying she planned to address the city\u2019s recent spike in homicides (35% increase since 2020) with special officers dedicated to solving homicide cases, of which she stated about 50% go unsolved. The LAPD stated that around 55% of homicides went unsolved in 2020, according to CBS.\n\nBass also said that community violence prevention programs would be effective at curbing such crime, but gave little insight into the specifics of these plans.\n\nThe congresswoman also pointed out that the city\u2019s homeless population plays a role in safety, saying that some people may need to be forcibly removed from the streets.\n\n\u201cThere are some people, though, who are profoundly mentally ill who might need to be hospitalized, and they might need to be hospitalized against their will. You know, that happens if they\u2019re a danger to themselves or there are dangers to others.\u201d\n\nAlthough Bass led Caruso comfortably in a poll conducted by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the L.A. Times earlier this fall, recent data shows the two candidates in a near-tie, according to a new UC Berkeley and L.A. Times new poll. Election day is this Tuesday, November 8.\n```"}

Aimed at demonstrating the need for sustainability, the Eco Film & Media Arts Festival is set to showcase student-directed short films at the School of Cinematic Arts.\n\nIn addition to screening 11 short films, the festival will feature a panel of filmmakers that include Courtnee Zambrano, a screenwriter and producer, Jay Ponti, a grassroots political organizer, and Anna Jane Joyner, a climate story consultant. Natasha Nutkiewicz, a senior theater major, will moderate the event. Nutkiewicz is an actress, producer, and filmmaker, who will also present her short film \u201cOur Garden,\u201d at the festival.\n\nThe film, which portrays a young couple fighting against oil drilling in their L.A. neighborhood, goes beyond the actions of the activist and delves into their mentalities, she said. \u201c[\u201dOur Garden\u201d] explores a lot of things about eco-grief, eco-anxiety\u2014but also sometimes interpersonal conflicts that we may have even though we are fighting for the same thing,\u201d Nutkiewicz said.\n\nAs the brains behind the festival, Nutkiewicz helped select several other films and documentaries produced by USC students to feature. \u201cI put out calls for filmmakers, people submitted their films, which are so exciting. They\u2019re great,\u201d Nutkiewicz, who is also a cinematic arts minor, said. \u201cThey\u2019re documentaries, and they are fiction films, and they\u2019re experimental, and they\u2019re industrial promotional videos.

I hope they realize that there are environmental issues going on that they\u2019re not aware of,\u201d Tomar said. \u201cI hope my film inspires people that kind of do their own research to see how the place that they love the most are being impacted and to think about how they can make a difference there.\u201d\n\nNutkiewicz said that she hopes non-filmmaker audiences will also be able to take away just how impactful the climate crisis is on everyone\u2019s lives. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not a filmmaker or an artist, even if you\u2019re just, you know, a lawyer or a doctor, we can all use our gifts towards this movement because, again, this is an existential crisis,\u201d Nutkiewicz said. \u201cIt will affect everyone.

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Will Simonds November 04, 2022 at 12:46 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s been quite the hectic offseason for USC women\u2019s basketball. Head coach Lindsay Gottlieb gave birth to her second child, a girl named Reese, on October 15. As a result, Gottlieb has missed a large portion of the team\u2019s preseason, including its exhibition game last Sunday. Gottlieb stayed around the team as long as possible, though, during a pivotal point of the team\u2019s preparation for the upcoming season.\n\n\u201cI thought Coach G was actually going to give birth in practice,\u201d sophomore forward Rayah Marshall said during Pac-12 Women\u2019s Basketball Media Day last week. \u201cShe did not want to leave us, and I was so grateful for that.\u201d\n\nIn her absence, associate head coach Beth Burns stepped up as interim head coach for Sunday\u2019s exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles, which USC comfortably won 87-48. Burns was the associate head coach at USC from 2014 to 2017 and returned this June to Los Angeles after a stint at Louisville. As San Diego State\u2019s winningest coach in its history, Burns said she\u2019s always appreciated USC\u2019s program \u2013 both up close and from afar.\n\n\u201cI have been fighting on for a long time ... I think this is one of the best universities in the world, but we haven\u2019t done our job on the basketball court,\u201d Burns said. \u201cMost importantly, I have a ton of respect for Lindsay.\u201d\n\nBurns, a defensive-minded coach, provides a much different energy than the more soft-spoken Gottlieb, creating a dichotomy that Marshall describes as \u201cday and night.\u201d But the players know that both points of view are necessary for a successful team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a balance,\u201d junior guard Kayla Williams said. \u201cYou got to love all parts of the game \u2014 offense and defense \u2014 so that\u2019s what we do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Williams enjoys both sides of the game, as the UC Irvine transfer was not only named to the All-Big West First Team last season, but also the Big West All-Defensive Team. In fact, something tells me that when the Anteaters were leading USC at halftime last season, Gottlieb probably thought she\u2019d like to have their leading scorer Williams on her side sooner or later.\n\nThat takes us to the other aspect of the Trojans\u2019 lively offseason: lots of roster turnover. USC lost all five of its primary starters from last season, including Pac-12 Most Improved Player Jordyn Jenkins, who transferred to UTSA in April. In total, Gottlieb needed to replace a staggering 66% of the team\u2019s minutes. She attempted to do so in the offseason primarily through the transfer portal, through which she added seven players, including Williams.\n\nWhen you factor in true freshman guard Aaliyah Gayles, over half the team\u2019s 14-player roster is new. Gayles, a five-star recruit and No. 8 ranked player in the nation in the 2022 class according to ESPN, will redshirt this season. In April, she was shot 10 times at a house party in Las Vegas but was recently cleared for basketball activities.\n\n\u201cAaliyah is, from God, a miracle ... She improves your day, every day. She never has a bad day,\u201d Burns said. \u201cHer progress is phenomenal \u2014 she\u2019s jogging, she\u2019s doing ball-handling with us ... She is an integral part of what we do.\u201d\n\nWithout the highly touted Gayles, Williams will have to step up and run the show as the Trojans\u2019 point guard this year. But if Sunday\u2019s exhibition was any indication, Williams seems ready for the role. She nearly had a triple-double, with 13 points, nine rebounds and eight assists as well as a pair of steals.\n\nHowever, it will be interesting to see who the USC offense flows through when Williams is on the bench, as the team doesn\u2019t have great ball-handling options behind her.\n\nAs for the other transfers, graduate transfer forward Kadi Sissoko, who led Minnesota in rebounding last season, will try to take over the hole left by Jenkins. Sissoko has a knack for getting to and finishing efficiently at the rim, as seen in her perfect 6-for-6 start from the field in the first half Sunday. She finished with a team-high 25 points on 11-for-14 shooting.\n\nOn the wing, a group of three more transfers should all have major roles. Okako Adika, a versatile graduate transfer guard from TCU, got the start in the exhibition and filled up the stat sheet with 12 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three steals. Burns especially challenged Adika coming into that game, successfully predicting that she\u2019d get five offensive rebounds (she had six).\n\n\u201cThe hard thing for all these older players is everybody comes from a team where they had a role,\u201d Burns said. \u201cI almost had to give Okako permission to be Okako ... I was just thrilled with the way that she started the game.\u201d\n\nThe next two transfers, graduate guard Rokia Doumbia from Purdue and sophomore guard Taylor Bigby from Oregon, will be two more interesting depth pieces to keep in mind. If Bigby, a former No. 29 overall recruit and two-time Nevada Gatorade State Player of the Year in high school, reaches her potential, this team\u2019s ceiling could see a significant rise.\n\nThe team\u2019s final two transfers are graduate guard Destiny Littleton, who won a national title at South Carolina last season, and junior forward Koi Love from Arizona. Neither played in the exhibition, though Burns is optimistic about the statuses for both ahead of the team\u2019s regular season opener next week.\n\nLove, who averaged over 20 points and nine rebounds per game two years ago at Vanderbilt, should take on an immediate role given the team\u2019s lack of depth in the frontcourt.\n\nWith so many new faces, it should take some time for players to gel and learn to play on their new team. But as a newcomer, Williams feels good about the team\u2019s chemistry so far.\n\n\u201cWe each come in here bringing something different, a different type of experience,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe have a lot of older people, veterans ... that just allows us to become closer as a team.\u201d\n\nAs for the returners, guards sophomore Bella Perkins and senior Alyson Miura should take up a good amount of backcourt minutes, with both capable of playing on- or off-ball. Miura led the team in 3-pointers last season coming off the bench, but she appears likely to start this season.\n\nBurns particularly liked the way Perkins played despite shooting just 1-for-7 on Sunday, as she added six assists and four rebounds in 18 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt was a little dicey in the middle of the second quarter. We got a little flat,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe changed what we were doing defensively ... Bella really did a great job off the bench. People don\u2019t appreciate that at this level \u2014 [it\u2019s key to] get value from people who don\u2019t start the game.\u201d\n\nBut this team really revolves around Marshall and her continued growth entering her second season at USC. Listed as both a guard and forward, Marshall has the potential to be an A\u2019ja Wilson or Giannis Antetokounmpo type of player for the Trojans.\n\nAt 6-foot-4, she\u2019s already a premier defensive player in the country, as she led all freshmen in the nation with 2.5 blocks per game last season; she currently holds a streak of 23 straight games with a block. Marshall also led USC in every rebounding stat, although she mostly came off the bench during her freshman season.\n\nHer offensive game is already stellar, too, even though it still has plenty of room to grow. The 2021-22 Pac-12 All-Freshman Team member scored 11.2 points per game and ended the season with 12 straight games with at least 10 points \u2014 again, mostly coming off the bench!\n\nAgainst Cal State LA, Marshall picked up where she left off at the end of last season, compiling a statline of 21 points, 15 rebounds, five blocks and two steals. She will be the focal point of the USC offense this season, and if she can establish a consistent 3-point shot, Marshall could be in the Pac-12 Player of the Year discussion.\n\nShe\u2019s that good, and she should only get better.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s been my tempo as a sophomore,\u201d Marshall said about what she worked on in the offseason. \u201cI\u2019ve just been able to condition myself mentally, physically. I\u2019m being consistent as far as having a go-to shot, and being a beast on rebounds.\u201d\n\nStill, with USC replacing so much of its roster in the offseason, the team was picked to finish ninth in both the Pac-12 preseason media and coaches polls. However, the Trojans probably have the talent to be an NCAA Tournament-caliber team if they can figure things out quickly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a great group, and it\u2019s hard for all of them, because there\u2019s so much to learn,\u201d Burns said. \u201cBut I appreciate that our effort is really, really high every day. We\u2019re going to keep getting better.\u201d\n\nUSC opens its regular season against CSU Bakersfield on November 8 at 7 p.m. at Galen Center. Gottlieb is expected to return as head coach from maternity leave for that game.\n```"}

Seeing Kyle Shanahan work his magic in the ground game with a truly elite running back for the first time is a sight to behold. The head coach\u2019s offensive prowess was on full display this past Sunday, as it turns out having superstar running back Christian McCaffrey at practice for a full week did make a difference. McCaffrey was traded to San Francisco from Carolina in the days leading up to the Niners\u2019 Week 7 clash with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Due to the short notice, McCaffrey was not able to be fully integrated into the offense. It showed during the game, as he only saw eight carries and two targets for a total of 62 all-purpose yards. However, with a full week of practice under his belt, he reminded everyone that he is still the game-changing player he was when he played his college ball for Stanford just a half-hour away from his new home in the Bay. McCaffrey accumulated 40.26 PPR points in L.A. last weekend against the Rams and was the focal point of Shanahan\u2019s offense. He made the highlight reel for his running, catching and passing. That\u2019s right, passing. He became just the fourth player since the 1970 merger to run, catch and pass for a touchdown in the same game, joining the likes of Walter Payton, David Patten and LaDanian Tomlinson. If you have McCaffrey on your team, consider yourself lucky, because he\u2019s back to league-winner form. If you\u2019re in the majority that doesn\u2019t, though, let\u2019s try to make some moves that could get you one step closer to winning your league.\n\nFrolicking in the Fields\n\nThe header isn\u2019t just a figure of speech \u2014 it\u2019s what Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields has essentially done the past few weeks on the football field. After a very rough rookie campaign, the second-year signal-caller appears to be finding his stride. Everyone remembers the pictures of Fields sliding and flexing on a sloppy, flooded Soldier Field after the Bears\u2019 Week 1 upset over the San Francisco 49ers. Since that moment of ecstasy, though, Fields and the Bears have fizzled out and looked like their 2021 selves since. Then, the past few weeks happened. It appears as if the Bears realized the best way to use Fields might be to play to his strengths. His biggest strength? His legs. Instead of only rushing on scrambles out of the pocket, Chicago has begun to design runs specifically for Fields, allowing him to put his tremendous athleticism on display. He has 34 rush attempts and 230 rushing yards over the past three weeks. Pair that with two rushing touchdowns and two passing touchdowns, and you\u2019re looking at the highest scoring QB in fantasy football since Week 6. He has not thrown for 200 yards in any of those games. That should be concerning, right? It won\u2019t matter if he keeps taking care of the football and using his legs. He\u2019s scored 23 plus fantasy points in back-to-back weeks on the road. These were also tough situations. One was a dazzling display on Monday Night Football in Foxborough, Mass., against Bill Belichick and the Patriots. While the Patriots are not in a dynasty-like season we\u2019ve become accustomed to seeing, Belichick is notorious for tormenting young QBs. Just look at what he did to Jets quarterback Zach Wilson this past weekend. Then, last weekend, the Bears journeyed to Dallas to take on Micah Parsons and arguably the best defense in the league. Fields still had a great performance despite the loss, scoring just over 26.0 fantasy points. Will he continue this play all season? Who knows. However, with a fairly easy schedule coming up, the opportunities will be there for Fields to have more days like these.\n\nWest Coast Wideout\n\nIf your team got rocked by the Ja\u2019Marr Chase injury like mine, I know a guy who can help fill in: Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Joshua Palmer. People got excited about Palmer after he saw eight and nine targets in back-to-back weeks and dropped two double-digit fantasy scores. That was way back in Weeks 2 and 3. Since then, he has only reached double-figures once in three games, missing one due to injury and being on bye last week. Many people did not have enough room on their rosters and sent him back to the waivers since his surprising start to the year. What\u2019s not surprising? The fact that the Los Angeles Chargers receiver corps aren\u2019t healthy again. Star pass-catcher Mike Williams went down with an ankle injury in Week 7 and won\u2019t return until Week 11 at the earliest. In the meantime, Williams\u2019 touches have to go somewhere, and that will likely be Joshua Palmer. In his first game without Mike Williams this past weekend, Palmer saw a season-high 14 targets and caught nine passes for 57 yards. Keenan Allen, the other star for Herbert to throw to, was supposed to return to the field from an injury this week. However, he will likely not be suiting up after all. This put Palmer in a position to potentially be Herbert\u2019s WR1 this weekend and in the weeks to come. He\u2019s available in about 70% of leagues on most sites. He\u2019s going to have a big week. I\u2019d feel comfortable starting him at flex or as a WR2.\n\nAnother quick note before we finish off: stash Rams running back Kyren Williams in your IR slot now if you have the room. Reports were that Los Angeles loved him in training camp and may have been making him the lead back before he hurt himself prior to Week 1. The Rams backfield is still in turmoil and completely up for grabs. Williams should be returning in the coming weeks and could be a steal if you stash him now. It\u2019s getting to the time of the year when you need to make moves weeks in advance. There are loads of guys that you can pick up or trade for that may not be useful now, but could save you down the line. Especially if you\u2019re 5-2 or 6-1, it\u2019s time to start thinking about playoffs and setting up your roster to win then, but we\u2019ll get into that later. For now, let\u2019s focus on grabbing a W.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Vani Sanganeria, Nataly Lozano, Sam Bitman, Lyla Bhalla-Ladd, and Shane Dimapanat November 04, 2022 at 10:14 am PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council may seem synonymous with scandal these days and the race for South Los Angeles\u2019 15th District may add to that impression. Danielle Sandoval is running against Tim McOsker for the city council seat representing San Pedro, Harbor City, Wilmington, and Watts. In September, the Los Angeles Times reported complaints of wage theft against Sandoval from former employees at Caliente Cantina, Sandoval\u2019s now-closed restaurant in San Pedro. The complaints, which date back eight years, include one by Jose Higareda who alleged the restaurant failed to pay him for more than 100 hours of work. Chef Isaac Garcia testified that the restaurant withheld 48 hours of pay and dishwasher and prep cook Jose Flores Esqueda filed a second complaint alleging $1,080 in wage theft.\n\nSandoval has contributed $37,000 of her own money to her city council campaign. McOsker argued that the money would have been better spent paying her employees the rest of the money they earned. Sandoval issued a public apology taking \u201cfull responsibility\u201d to get the workers their back-pay \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSince then, officials with L.A.\u2019s Department of Industrial Relations reported that under a settlement agreement, Garcia and his colleague Alejandro Jaramillo were paid a combined $5,052 in back pay by Sandoval\u2014about 55% of what they were owed. The California Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office made clear in 2015 that Cantina Investments LLC, a business partner of Caliente Cantina, was the defendant in four cases of alleged wage theft. Sandoval opened Cantina Investments LLC with husband Quinn Padilla in 2014.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is sued as an individual, if they\u2019re responsible for something, clearly they\u2019re going to be liable themselves individually,\u201d Thomas Lenz, USC Gould School of Law lecturer and labor expert, told Annenberg Media. \u201cWhen they form an entity like a corporation, they are really creating a liability shield as the organization that has responsibility for the things it does.\u201d In instances where a corporation does not meet certain legal standards, a court can still hold people personally liable, Lenz added.\n\nAfter the wage theft cases became public, several of Sandoval\u2019s supporters rescinded their formal endorsements, including the Californians for Human Immigrant Rights Leadership Action Fund and UCLA labor rights expert Victor Narro, a prominent career advocate against wage theft. Narro told the L.A. Times that he seriously doubted Sandoval\u2019s claim that she did not learn of the cases until last summer. He withdrew his endorsement after Sandoval failed to respond to Narro\u2019s suggestion that she contact the Wage Justice Center and immediately rectify the damages.\n\n\u201cI cannot endorse a candidate that engages in wage theft and then doesn\u2019t do anything to address it,\u201d Narro said. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t stepped up to take responsibility.\u201d\n\nIf Sandoval had not run for office and been in the public eye, these outstanding wage theft cases may have taken even longer to be resolved, Lenz said. The legal process is very slow, but timing usually depends on how receptive the defendant is toward paying off claims.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that someone is going to pay what you\u2019ve been awarded in any particular period of time,\u201d Lenz said. \u201cIn my law practice, we see employers [who will] sometimes pay right away. Sometimes, there is some delay or an appeal. Others may file bankruptcy or just try to delay payment.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental justice advocate and former District 15 primary opponent Bryant Odega said he is standing by his endorsement of Sandoval despite her flaws. He said he could never support McOsker, who worked at City Hall as a former lobbyist representing real estate developers, hotel associations, and the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t trust someone with that kind of work history,\u201d he said.\n\nThe L.A.

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino\nNovember 04, 2022 at 10:00 am PDT\n\nAfter 28 days without a home game, the No. 9 USC Trojans return to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for their homecoming game. The Trojans are eager to be back and continue to build their momentum in a matchup against Pac-12 opponent Cal.\n\nThree weeks ago, the Trojans had an agonizing loss to Utah. After the bye week, USC moved full steam ahead against Arizona, winning 45-37. Now, they need to take advantage of a struggling Golden Bears team.\n\nIt has not been a great season for the Golden Bears as they sit toward the bottom of the Pac-12 with an overall record of 3-5. Some might say this is due to a tough schedule, facing Pac-12 powerhouse teams like No. 8 Oregon, previously ranked Washington and Notre Dame. However, Cal\u2019s few wins have come against weaker teams like UC Davis and UNLV.\n\nThe offense led by redshirt senior quarterback Jack Plummer is by no means a standout offense. Plummer currently has thrown for 1,968 yards and has a completion average of 61.2%. He has thrown for 13 touchdowns this season with five interceptions.\n\nTheir rushing yards leader, freshman running back Jaydn Ott, has 675 yards while junior wide receiver Jeremiah Hunter leads the team in receiving yards with 544 yards. The Golden Bears currently average 23.4 points per game.\n\nIn comparison, USC has a far superior offense. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams has thrown for 2,382 yards this season with a 64.7% completion rate. He also has 24 passing touchdowns compared to only one interception.\n\nRedshirt senior running back Travis Dye leads the team with 760 rushing yards, and junior wide receiver Jordan Addison leads the team in receiving yards with 585. The Trojans average 41 points per game.\n\nThe Golden Bears\u2019 offense has not been able to find its footing this season, struggling to make a big offensive impact in games. USC\u2019s offense definitely has the edge vs Cal\u2019s defense.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the defense that is a different story. The Cal defense has been able to hold opponents to low-scoring games. The defense kept all but two teams to under 30 points. While the defense is not necessarily one of the best in the country, if underestimated, the defense could be very difficult for the Trojans to beat.\n\nThe USC defense, on the other hand, has been especially struggling these past two games. Against Utah and Arizona, the defense struggled to make a stop on first downs and force punts.\n\nAgainst Utah, the Trojan offense hung in with the Utes, going drive for drive, but the defense let the Utes rally in the fourth quarter and allowed them to score 15 points. This past Saturday in Arizona, the Trojan offense put on another prolific performance, but the defense let the Wildcats pick up 28 first downs \u2013 two more than the Trojans.\n\nThis Saturday will be a clash of opposites as the relentless Trojan offense goes against the Golden Bears\u2019 potentially dangerous defense. For USC to ensure a victory, here are the Trojans\u2019 three keys to the game.\n\nThe first key is that different wide receivers need to step up once again. With top receivers Addison and sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams out with injuries, others need to take charge. Last week, redshirt junior wide receivers Tahj Washington and Kyle Ford had outstanding performances to lead the Trojans to a win. They need to recreate their magic once again on Saturday.\n\nSecondly, the defense needs to be 110% ready. The defense needs to make third-down stops and force punts. The Cal offense may not be phenomenal, but we have seen what happens when the USC defense underestimates a team. This defense needs to start off strong to get back on track.\n\nThirdly, Caleb Williams needs to be on point for all four quarters. It is crucial the star quarterback does not get overconfident and lose focus. Against Oregon State, Williams seemed to have underrated the Beavers and didn\u2019t play like his usual self. Williams can\u2019t make the same mistake again, or it may be costly.\n\nIf USC can accomplish these three keys, the Trojans should be able to win comfortably. The Trojans hope to make their homecoming a memorable one with another Pac-12 win on Saturday, November 5 at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN.\n```"}

Set to host the Philadelphia Union in the MLS Cup final on Saturday, LA Football Club, or LAFC, fans will flock to Banc of California Stadium for kickoff at one o\u2019clock. There\u2019s one problem, though. The stadium won\u2019t have any parking. That\u2019s because USC football will be hosting Cal for their annual homecoming game later that evening, and it\u2019s parking for THIS game that\u2019s being given priority.\n\nBut with the biggest and most important game of the MLS season taking place just a few hours before and no available parking for it, how are soccer fans supposed to come watch their game? Max Bretos: Our friends at Metro--we were having all the details with them, obviously going to metro.net to find out schedules and timetables and where you can catch a train or bus towards Banc of California Stadium. That\u2019s Max Bretos, the official broadcaster for LAFC. Max Bretos: The Dodgers are also involved and they\u2019re providing parking at Dodger Stadium where you can get transport down to the stadium. It\u2019s about a 15 minute drive or less. I think we\u2019re really excited about the options.\n\nIn a nutshell, soccer fans will park at other places around the city, and then rely on public transportation to take them the rest of the way. But how do the LAFC fans feel about their championship game taking a backseat to American football? After all, they\u2019re the ones most affected by the parking rules for Saturday. Steven Salisbury: As any sports fan will know, getting a championship game at home is rare. This could be the only time it ever happens. That\u2019s Steven Salisbury, a longtime fan of LAFC, disappointed by the lack of respect for soccer in the United States. Steven Salisbury: But to have to play little brother to USC, which for a run-of-the-mill regular season game that\u2019s happening, I believe like 6 hours later, is kind of insulting. And it\u2019s a bad look for the sport and it\u2019s a bad look for the league and definitely a setback in terms of trying to stand on its own two feet with the, quote unquote \u2018big boys\u2019 of American professional sports.\n\nExposition Park and the LA Colosseum are both owned by the state of California, not USC. So with that being the case, why exactly does USC get the priority here? Tony Mazza: We have an agreement with Exposition Park with the state of California that went to when a U.S. football game goes on, all of the parking at Exposition Park can be permitted by USC. That is Tony Mazza, the director of transportation at USC. Tony Mazza: So we buy all of the party in Exposition Park from Expo Park, slash the state of California for a certain price, and then we sell it right to our fans. And so we have, you know, first right of the parking for USC game.\n\nEveryone I spoke to echoed the same sentiment that this is the first time an issue like this has ever arisen. With such an action-packed day of sports set for Saturday, the question remains of whether this parking fiasco will wind up upsetting the day for both sports.\n```"}

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nBy Siara Carpenter, Arya Desai and Katelyn Do\nNovember 03, 2022 at 6:08 pm PDT\n\nJust two days ago, Migos Rapper, Takeoff, was shot dead in a suspected murder in Houston, Texas. His last moments of life were captured in a cell phone video and have spread across social media like wildfire. Most notably, \u2018TMZ\u201d posted videos depicting the mortally injured rapper with his Uncle and bandmate Quavo panicking beside him.\n\nTakeoff\u2019s death is just one of many that have been recorded and spread on media sites like TMZ and throughout social media platforms. Rappers like Nipsey Hussle, King Von, and PnB Rock\u2019s murders were all caught on camera and were subsequently shared on social media.\n\nOnline sharing of the graphic last moments of these rappers\u2019 lives has often been a point of controversy. Many of these videos come without trigger warnings, and are played on a repeated loop. Terence Fitzgerald, teaches at USC\u2019s Dworak-Peck School of Social Work says that these gruesome videos of violent black death simply confirm the biases and stereotypes many people have about black people.\n\nTerence Fitzgerald: \u201cIt\u2019s like I already have these thoughts. Like, like if there\u2019s evidence, there\u2019s this evidence right here that\u2019s supporting my preconceived thoughts, stereotypes and beliefs, right? This false narrative of people.\u201d\n\nFor members of the black community, some have also pointed to the handling of Takeoff\u2019s death as the exploitation of black trauma. Seeing images and videos on repeat like this can be triggering and upsetting as many people do not want to see prominent black figures being dehumanized.\n\nCameron Cole, a black senior at USC who studies Computer Science and Business Administration, says that he has noticed a pattern in how black death has been portrayed in the media since the death of Kobe Bryant.\n\nCameron Cole: \u201cIt just seems like there\u2019s a pattern of because these people are such popular figures that the entire society is entitled to, you know, the first information about their lives rather than, you know, talking to their family, understanding the full context, and then providing that to the public.\u201d\n\nAnother black USC student, Jamil Mohammed, who studies business calls for more humane treatment of black death.\n\nJamil Mohammed: \u201cWell, I think you have to first start with a genuine intention to want to treat humans humanely. Like I feel like that is what it all boils down to. If you don\u2019t think that everyone if you don\u2019t think that black people deserve that, then you\u2019re not like even if it\u2019s something that\u2019s subconscious, like then you\u2019re not going to handle it in the same way that you would white celebrities, death or whoever else.\u201d\n\nTakeoff\u2019s death is all the more tragic when listening to an interview he gave a few days ago with the \u201cDrink Champs\u201d podcast. He discussed the steps he took to avoid being targeted as a black public figure, like so many others had been before him.\n\nTakeoff: You gotta watch what you post because even though you\u2019re just trying to show off and show your fans stuff, it\u2019s people that follow you and watch you that [have] bad intentions and don\u2019t want the best for you.\n```"}
{"key": "/2022/11/03/bipolar-community-rejects-ye-as-the-image-of-bipolar/", "response": "```\nAmid a flurry of controversial and racist statements from Kanye West, people with bipolar disorder are making clear they don\u2019t want West as their poster child. After West, who legally changed his name to Ye, recently threatened Jewish people on Twitter, his business partners such as Adidas, Balenciaga and Gap ended their collaborations with the artist. Ye\u2019s actions also spurred many people to blame his offensive statements on his medical condition. But, as people who suffer from bipolar disorder and experts say, the condition doesn\u2019t make you racist.\n\nProfessor Amy Elizabeth West, who teaches clinical pediatrics and psychology at USC Keck School of Medicine, said that associating bipolar disorder to hate is dangerous and misinformed. \u201cBipolar disorder is absolutely not synonymous with racism and there\u2019s nothing about mental illness that creates racism or hate,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are all entirely separate behaviors that he happens to have in addition to having bipolar disorder.\u201d\n\nYe was transparent about suffering from bipolar disorder after being admitted to a hospital in 2016. The album cover of his 2018 album \u201cYe\u201d shows a mountain with hand-written text that says, \u201cI hate being bipolar, it\u2019s awesome.\u201d Ye previously sparked outrage numerous times, like when he claimed in a 2018 TMZ interview that \u201cslavery was a choice.\u201d He has also recently made inflammatory statements about George Floyd\u2019s death including falsely claiming that a police officer didn\u2019t kill him and insulting Floyd\u2019s mother after the family filed a $250 million lawsuit.\n\nProfessor West explained that there is no evidence to support the idea that people with mental illness are more likely to have racist views. She noted that symptoms of mania for people that are unmedicated can cause some of the behaviors Ye demonstrates, such as \u201ca sense of grandiosity, invincibility and inability to control impulses,\u201d but that does not determine the content of thoughts.\n\nMandy Raiff, a 19-year-old student at the University of Texas at Austin who suffers from bipolar disorder, offered her own analysis of the artist and business mogul. \u201cI think he just has a lot of hate and the reason he feels like he is in a position to spout it can be part of the mania in bipolar where you feel like an all-powerful being,\u201d Raiff said. Ye is a prominent influencer. Until recently, Ye had around 18 million followers on Instagram and more than 31.5 million followers on Twitter. His accounts have been suspended over antisemitism.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people, the image of bipolar is Kanye, which fucking sucks,\u201d Raiff said. \u201cIt has done a lot of damage for the bipolar community.\u201d Michael, a software developer from Arizona who suffers from bipolar disorder and is Jewish offered his impression of Ye. Michael declined to have his last name published. \u201cHe\u2019s just an asshole and it\u2019s not fair because he\u2019s on a public platform,\u201d Michael said.\n\nYe has been candid about repeatedly choosing to not take his medication. \u201cI love the new music I\u2019ve been working on, 6 months off meds and I can feel me again,\u201d Ye wrote in a tweet in 2018. Raiff said she thinks Ye is boosting a false impression that medication completely changes who you are. \u201cHe\u2019ll go out and say, \u2018My meds change who I am; this is the real Kanye.\u2019 But you can be the real you with medication,\u201d Raiff said. \u201dIt just helps symptoms so people can function normally in society.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ye\u2019s desire to stop medicating when he is being creative reflects a similar experience that some artists with bipolar disorder can relate to. Several people believe that medication can sometimes inhibit their creativity. \u201cI often write poetry and short stories,\u201d said Dave Holmes, a former hospital emergency room administrator from Pennsylvania who is currently medicated for bipolar I. \u201cYour mind is just ablaze with information and the medication, as much as it helps balance you out, can take away that part of you, which is frustrating.\u201d\n\nRaiff said that people in the hypomanic or manic bipolar stages sometimes become creative and particularly productive. She believes some of Ye\u2019s fans don\u2019t want him to medicate because he makes great music. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you if he\u2019d make the same music if he was medicated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in reality, it comes down to being a functioning human in society, and right now he is not doing acceptable things, so at what cost is a better song?\u201d\n\nMany people have also sparked discussions on Reddit about the importance of medicating. \u201cMy meds are the only reason I am where I am in my life right now,\u201d said one user who stopped taking their medication twice. \u201cThe urge to stop taking your meds can be super strong sometimes...Let\u2019s just say I learned my lesson.\u201d\n\nProfessor West said that there are great treatments and medical professionals who deliver high-quality care that can, \u201cbring the disorder to a very manageable state where they\u2019re able to fully function and participate in society.\u201d Holmes added that Ye shouldn\u2019t be excused from taking accountability for his racist comments and that people who are struggling with serious mental health problems are still responsible for what they say.\n\nMichael referenced a quote from Pete Davidson from Saturday Night Live. \u201cBeing mentally ill is not an excuse to act like a jackass,\u201d Davidson said. Professor West explained that the medical field is working toward further de-stigmatizing such mental illnesses, adding that she wishes people understood bipolar disorder as \u201ca reflection of biological and psychological processes.\u201d\n\nDespite the stigma around bipolar disorder, people who wrestle with it have been eager to clarify the hardships they endure. \u201cHave patience with us,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWe can be difficult to deal with at times and having someone with bipolar in your family, or a friend, can be trying. So it\u2019s important they seek medical attention.\u201d As for the artist, Michael hopes he gets help. \u201cI wish Kanye would take care of himself and find a treatment that works for him.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2022/11/03/world-cup-host-country-qatar-becomes-another-fifa-scandal/", "response": "```\nWorld Cup host country, Qatar, becomes another FIFA scandal\n\nQatar\u2019s human rights violations and unsafe working conditions have sparked backlash, leaving fans feeling uneasy about the upcoming World Cup.\n\nSoccer fans look forward to the World Cup every four years, but human rights violations in Qatar, the 2022 host country, threaten to steal the spotlight this year. According to the Human Rights Watch, these violations included those on \u201cwomen\u2019s rights, freedom of expression, statelessness, sexual orientation and morality laws, and climate change policy and actions.\u201d USC professors and students alike said they are concerned for the safety of both athletes and visitors during the World Cup event. They are blaming the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), soccer\u2019s governing body, for ignoring those concerns when selecting a host country.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that is more driven by the ability to pull in money than FIFA,\u201d said Daniel T. Durbin, the director of the Institute of Sports, Media and Society at USC Annenberg. \u201cThere have been questions about the ethics and values of people for decades so there are deep concerns about FIFA separate from Qatar.\u201d\n\nFIFA also faces scrutiny, due to allegations of bribery. Qatar won the bid for the \u201822 World Cup back in 2010, making it the first Arab nation to host the event. However, immediately after receiving the bid, Qatar was investigated for allegedly paying $3.7 million to secure their ability to host. After two years, the investigation concluded and the charges were dropped.\n\nAside from the controversial selection process, the country\u2019s arid desert environment and lack of accommodations have led people to question whether it was the right choice. Former FIFA Chairman Sepp Blatter who supported Qatar\u2019s bid when he held the role has since publicly come out to say it was a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nThe World Cup, which typically takes place throughout June and July, is scheduled to begin later this month and will be played through December. The rescheduling is a result of temperatures that frequently exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and rarely fall below the 90s in summer months.\n\nThe treatment against the LGBTQ+ community is another big concern for visitors. Under Qatari law, same-sex relationships can be punishable by seven years in prison and the country has advised soccer fans not to bring rainbow flags to the event for their own safety. Some observers worry that visitors of different backgrounds unknowingly risk punishments and imprisonment.\n\nMany of the competing teams have taken a stance against these governmental principles. Australian footballers released a video urging the abolition of such laws while captains of 10 European teams agreed to wear \u201cOne Love\u201d armbands during their matches. It\u2019s unclear at the moment if players will face retaliation from the Qatari government, but it begs the question of what constitutes an ostentatious display of homosexuality. Will players be able to jump into one another\u2019s arms as is typical after scoring a goal? Should openly gay athletes be concerned about being allowed into the country?\n\nAlthough disheartening, discrimination in host nations is not a new phenomenon. In 2018, Russia faced similar backlash for winning the bid. Critics of the decision suggested the nation\u2019s intense history of racial and LGBTQ+ discrimination made it unfit to host.\n\nEvidence of unfair treatment towards infrastructure workers in Qatar ranges from unpaid wages to unexplained deaths. The government has refused to comment on these issues. Qatar\u2019s kafala system, which sponsors foreign workers while controlling their employment and immigration status, makes it nearly impossible for workers to leave jobs. According to Amnesty International, over 90% of the workforce was made up of the nearly 1.7 million migrant workers that reside in Qatar.\n\nWhile 3,200 predominantly migrant workers have been constructing the stadium every day, over 230 men have died building the Khalifa Stadium and Aspire Zone as a result of abuse and exploitation. Workers who paid up to $4,300 to recruitment agencies to get their jobs in Qatar are now burdened with financial insecurity as a result of delayed and inadequate salaries. Those making $300 a month are being paid less than $15 a day to labor in the desert.\n\n\u201cMy family is now homeless and two of my younger children have been taken out of school,\u201d Prem, a metal worker, told Amnesty International. \u201cEveryday I am in tension; I cannot sleep at night. This is a torture for me.\u201d\n\nWorkers who do complain about the brutal working conditions or squalid living quarters are often met with fierce retribution and threats. Those who want to leave don\u2019t have the option because contractors refuse to issue or renew residence permits and have taken workers\u2019 passports. The practices of debt bondage and confiscation of identification documents are commonly employed when using forced labor on plantations, fishing boats or construction sites.\n\n\u201cI remember my first day in Qatar,\u201d Shamim, a gardener at the Aspire Zone, told Amnesty. \u201cAlmost the very first thing [an agent] working for my company did was take my passport. I haven\u2019t seen it since.\u201d\n\nRohan Bhavee, a sophomore studying biochemistry and an avid soccer fan, believes FIFA\u2019s past decisions are also controversial. \u201cMany countries that have hosted the World Cup in the past haven\u2019t had an amazing human rights record either,\u201d Bhavee said. \u201cRegardless, the motivating factor for FIFA has always been financial gain, as proven by the many corruption scandals.\u201d\n\nFans like Bhavee know about FIFA\u2019s history of controversies. Some of FIFA\u2019s notable scandals include: allegations of financial mismanagement in 2002-2003, a FIFA member\u2019s attempt to receive British knighthood for a vote, numerous referee miscalls and long shifts and low pay for workers during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. In 2013, the United States Internal Revenue Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation indicted 14 individuals in connection with wire fraud, racketeering and money laundering. The indictment purported that upwards of $100 million in bribes influenced everything from clothing sponsorships, the 2011 FIFA presidential election and the 2010 World Cup selection process. In 2015, eight of the defendants including marketing heads, media directors and FIFA executive committee members pleaded guilty and agreed to relinquish more than $40 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a positive brand for the World Cup,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cThe World Cup and FIFA, if I\u2019m allowed to say this, has been a corrupt organization for decades.\u201d\n\nFIFA has mainly been criticized for prioritizing profit and ignoring moral issues. The human rights violations in Qatar have sparked a global discussion over fear to visit and disapproval of residents. In response, cities are boycotting screenings. In the UK, London has decided to not host any \u201cfan-zones\u201d while in Paris and other French cities, fans will also boycott public viewings in places such as pubs.\n\nFor those interested in learning more about FIFA\u2019s scandals, Netflix will release a documentary series \u201cFIFA Uncovered\u201d on November 9, just days before the World Cup begins on November 20.\n```"}

Chanting \u201cfight on\u201d alongside current students, alumni are encouraged to attend the November 5 game against long-running rivals from the University of California Berkeley at the Coliseum. On campus, the USC Alumni Association will host tailgates where former Trojans can reconnect with their past classmates. \u201c35 years ago I graduated from USC, my home away from home for four years,\u201d said Lauren Salerno, a USC alumna who graduated in 1987. \u201cLife without social media was simpler but definitely more difficult to maintain connections. However, over the years it\u2019s become easier to reconnect and USC has done a fabulous job helping alumni feel part of our school.\u201d The celebrations are nonstop this coming weekend. Beginning Friday, back-to-campus tickets are available for festivities from 10:00 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. which includes the welcome lounge, lunch, campus tours, class sessions, all-class mixers and a Trojan wine tasting all for $80. Later that day, there\u2019s also a 7:00-11:30 p.m. reunion night celebration at Alumni Park that has already sold out. Saturday gameday will see even more alumni as the sold-out reunion tailgate begins on campus at 3:30 p.m., leading up to the 7:30 p.m. kickoff against the Golden Bears. The Trojan community continues to expand and embrace one another with new generations of students. \u201cThis year\u2019s homecoming holds so much meaning for me as I\u2019m going to be attending it with my current sophomore, my recent 2022 graduate and my son\u2019s future mother-in-law,\u201d said Lauren. \u201cOur families are taking the idea of the Trojan family to a whole different level.\u201d The most recent Salerno to join USC\u2019s alumni is Lauren\u2019s daughter, Kate, from the class of 2022. Despite moving to New York City following graduation, Kate wouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to attend her first homecoming game as a brand new alumna. \u201cSome of my most amazing years were spent at USC. I am so grateful for my experience and time here, and even more excited to be back this weekend for homecoming as a new alumni,\u201d said Kate. \u201cI have met some of the most amazing people at this school and it is going to be very special to be back together with friends to cheer on USC as we play Berkeley.\u201d Current Trojans in Greek life rang in homecoming with activities and events in preparation for the coming weekend. Many fraternities and sororities are paired together this week to do a multitude of events with each other to celebrate. Such events include barbecues, movie nights and sports competitions. Two fraternities and sororities joined forces in honor of homecoming weekend in a flag football game. Members of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, coached by the Sigma Chi fraternity, played against members of the Delta Gamma sorority, coached by the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, on November 1. Sigma Chi member Grant Pallokat, a sophomore studying real estate development, enjoyed helping coach the Kappa Kappa Gamma team. \u201cIt was crazy to see the outcome of the event. Both sidelines were chanting, dancing and holding up signs throughout the game to help support their team,\u201d said Pallokat. \u201cIt was really special to see first hand.\u201d Whether it\u2019s the alumni events on campus, past and present marching band members on the field, or current students off campus, the USC bond can be felt throughout South Central this weekend.

A rarity for a conference without an end-of-season tournament. (Photo by Justin Susan)\n\nBy Samuel Reno\nNovember 03, 2022 at 3:43 pm PDT\n\nAt 5:38 p.m., San Diego State and Utah State \u2013 knotted at a goal apiece \u2013 began a decisive penalty shootout in a Mountain West Tournament quarterfinal contest. 25 minutes and 44 penalty kicks later, junior goalkeeper Alexa Madueno came up with the match and shootout-winning save for the Aztecs at 6:03 p.m. Yup... 44 penalty kicks \u2013 37 of which found the back of the net. That Mountain West showdown was just one of 10 different games across the country on Sunday decided on penalty kicks, and another seven needed overtime to determine a winner. But on a day with bonus soccer in one-third of the games, the Pac-12 provided none of them. The Conference of Champions is the only major conference without a tournament to determine one.\n\nIn front of a sold out crowd last season, USC and UCLA met in Westwood in a winner-take-all contest for the Pac-12 title on the final day. The match delivered on the nearly week-long buildup, and the Bruins campaign to repeat was cemented as successful. But it doesn\u2019t always work like that. Take this year as an example. No. 1 UCLA and No. 7 Stanford enter the final week of the season tied at the top on 27 points. The Bruins will travel across town to face No. 14 USC on Friday, and the Cardinal will \u2013 more or less \u2013 do the same to face a Cal team that\u2019s still receiving votes. The four best teams in the Pac-12 meeting in two of the most storied rivalries in all of college sports. But, other than playing a little spoiler and marginal differences in tournament seeding, there\u2019s nothing in it for the Trojans or the Golden Bears. Not only does it significantly diminish the entertainment value, it\u2019s also hurting the conference on \u201cselection Monday.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go back to last year. Rutgers cruised through the Big Ten a perfect 10-0 to take home the regular season crown, but in the conference title game, they were bested 1-0 by a Michigan side that dropped points on four separate occasions in Big Ten play. As a result, the Scarlet Knights and the Wolverines both ended up earning No. 1 seeds alongside the legacy programs of Florida State and Duke. That sent UCLA down to the two line, despite having lost ZERO games all season \u2013 the only team in the nation to do so. It also has ramifications further down the bracket, as the Pac-12 only put four teams in the field of 64 in 2021. That\u2019s up against nine from the ACC, seven from the SEC, six from the Big Ten and another five from the Big East. By not giving its bubble teams a chance to rack up quality wins at the end of the season, the Pac-12 is failing its member schools.\n\nThe same story is unfolding before our eyes again this season. As Arizona and Arizona State \u2013 fifth and sixth in the Pac-12 respectively \u2013 cling to the bubble, they\u2019re only hope hinges on one last game against the other. In a six-team tournament format, the Wildcats could theoretically close the season with wins against Cal, UCLA and Stanford/USC/ASU, all but locking them into the NCAA tournament. The Sun Devils could do the same with USC, Stanford and UCLA/Cal/Arizona. Sure, it seems far fetched, but that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in Columbus, Ohio. Fifth-seeded Nebraska sits at 53rd in the RPI, likely still on the wrong side of the bubble, but they\u2019ve found themselves in a semifinal against regular season champs and No. 6 Michigan State. Sixth-seeded Penn State is still a top-15 RPI squad, but they\u2019re out to right the wrongs of a disappointing conference season in their semifinal against No. 12 Northwestern. And even if the glass slipper does prove too small for the Cornhuskers or Nittany Lions, we\u2019ll get a rematch between the Spartans at the Wildcats \u2013 the Big Ten\u2019s two best regular season teams. Oh, and it\u2019s all happening under the lights in Lower.com Field in Columbus, one of the best soccer venues in the United States.\n\nNow imagine, USC and UCLA facing off Friday night in a Pac-12 tournament semifinal under the lights at Banc of California Stadium. Or a UCLA vs. Stanford rematch in the Pac-12 title game at PayPal Park in San Jose. Arizona trying to save its season at Providence Park in Portland.

Some ideas included Beetlejuice from the movie of the same name or Willy Wonka from \u201cWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\u201d\n\nConcertgoers and fans from around the world who were closely monitoring his wardrobe on social media were excited to see Styles top his Harryween costumes from his New York City shows last year: Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and a Pierrot clown. Fans were so eager to be front row in the general admission section, also known as the \u201cpit,\u201d that they started camping out five days beforehand. They traveled from many cities for this anticipated show, one of Styles\u2019 15 shows at the Forum in his historic residency.\n\nTents lined the Kia Forum and over 800 wristbands were given out to fans who were camping out. One fan who flew in from the United Kingdom started camping out on October 26 and ended up being number 25 in the line for the pit. After receiving their numbered wristbands, fans with general admission tickets gained early access to purchasing Harryween-themed T-shirts and tote bags. This exclusive collection was only available the day of the show and was sold out by the time doors opened at the Forum.\n\nThe Forum went all out for Styles and his fans by setting up a Ferris wheel, providing tarot card readings, face painting and even selling a specialty drink called the \u201cLittle Freak\u201d latte. Not only did the team at the Kia Forum give their all for \u201cHarryween,\u201d but so did Harries themselves: Fans were dressed to impress as characters from his recently released movie \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d the squid from Styles\u2019 music video for \u201cMusic for a Sushi Restaurant,\u201d past iconic outfits from the Grammys and the \u201cFine Line\u201d album cover.\n\nWhen showtime arrived, fans immediately knew who Styles was dressed up as when his band walked out in \u201cGrease\u201d-themed outfits to iconic tunes like \u201cYou\u2019re The One That I Want.\u201d Styles himself then rose up from the middle of the stage as Danny Zuko, John Travolta\u2019s character from \u201cGrease.\u201d To complete the theme, he also sang \u201cHopelessly Devoted to You.\u201d\n\nAside from fans, there were also a few well-known faces spotted at Harryween. Celebrities sightings have not been rare for Styles\u2019 L.A. residency shows so far, but at this special show, familiar faces like TikTok creator Chris Olsen, celebrity stylist Harry Lambert and music producers Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon stopped by to enjoy the party. Olsen got to share a cheeky moment with Danny Zuko from his seat in the audience. When he showed up on the jumbotron with a sign that said \u201cDaddy?\u201d Styles took the bait and replied saying \u201cYes?\u201d The crowd roared in response to Styles\u2019 answer and it was one of many playful interactions that night.\n\nNo matter how bizarrely funny Styles\u2019 on stage interactions with fans are, or what costumes he\u2019s wearing, his fans are \u201cHopelessly Devoted\u201d to him.\n```"}

The Golden Bears are 3-5 overall and 1-4 in the Pac-12, placing them second to last in the Pac-12 standings.\n\nOne of the main concerns for the Trojans is freshman running back Jaydn Ott. One of On3 and the Athletic\u2019s Midseason True Freshman All-Americans, Ott rushes for an average of 5.8 yards per carry and 84.4 yards per game, putting him in fourth place in the Pac-12 for rushing yards per game and sixth place for yards per carry.\n\nDefensive coordinator Alex Grinch praised Ott\u2019s breakout season. \u201c[Ott] flashes on film,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cVery explosive. He runs hard and fast and hits home runs from a speed standpoint.\u201d\n\nAside from Ott, Grinch recognized the potential of the Golden Bears\u2019 offense. \u201c[Cal] is very multiple on the offensive side between their run game and pass game,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cThey\u2019ll spread you out, and they have a quarterback with a big arm that made some explosive plays last week against Oregon.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have allowed over 152.1 rushing yards per game and 4.7 yards per carry. Grinch recognized that there needs to be some changes going forward for the defense. \u201cThere has to be an honest evaluation of scheme, effort and, of course, execution,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cThe only reason we can sleep at night and the only reason we won the game against Arizona is that we played hard. But we have to play a whole lot better.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the ball, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams is feeling poised heading into the Saturday matchup at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. \u201cBeing able to have a bunch of consecutive starts, it builds a lot of confidence in myself,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBeing able to be out there with my teammates and be the guy that they see every single time is amazing.\u201d\n\nWilliams is coming off a game in which he threw for five touchdowns and a career-high 411 yards. The star quarterback has 24 touchdowns on the season, the most touchdowns in the Pac-12 and the third-most in the nation.\n\nStill, he offered nothing but praise for the Golden Bears\u2019 defense. \u201c[The Golden Bears] have got a pretty good linebacker in [Jackson] Sirmon,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s played a lot of ball, he\u2019s smart and he has good instincts. The secondary does a pretty good job, and they\u2019ve got a few guys at cornerback that are very tall. And their safeties have done a pretty good job throughout the season.\u201d\n\nThe Golden Bears rank 126th in the country and last in the Pac-12 in passing yards allowed with 292.3 yards allowed through the air per game. Last week, they allowed 412 passing yards to Oregon.\n\nMorale was high throughout USC\u2019s practice as the team prepared for its homecoming game on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good matchup to see how our wide receivers match up against [Cal\u2019s] secondary defense,\u201d Williams said.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez)\n\nBy Jacob Hare November 02, 2022 at 8:52 pm PDT\n\nOffense was the story of the week in the Pac-12. In five conference games this week, a combined total of 313 points was scored. To put that into perspective, the Big 10 had five games this weekend and combined for 223 points scored. The fireworks were definitely apparent out west this weekend. While it was challenging to keep up with all of the high-scoring contests from this past weekend, don\u2019t worry, I have you covered in my Week 9 edition of \u201cUnpack The Pac.\u201d\n\nUtah 21, Washington State 17\n\nThe star of this game didn\u2019t even know he would be playing until minutes before kickoff. Junior quarterback Cameron Rising told coaches he would not be able to play in this contest and that put sophomore quarterback Bryson Barnes in line for his first career start. A ton of credit is due for head coach Kyle Whittingham who stuck with Utah\u2019s prior winning formula and trusted Barnes to make enough plays to win the game. Barnes was excellent as he had 175 passing yards, one touchdown pass, 51 rushing yards and a QBR of 87.5. While Barnes was the winning quarterback in the game, Washington State sophomore quarterback Cameron Ward had a suitable performance as he was 27-of-31 with 222 passing yards and two total touchdowns. After another gut-wrenching loss, the Cougars now drop to 4-4, but they are a much better team than their record. With three cakewalk games coming up, I expect them to creep into a mid-tier bowl game. And for Utah, this win keeps the Utes alive in the race for the Pac-12 championship.\n\nUSC 45, Arizona 37\n\nComing off a bye week, USC defeated Arizona, which got the bitter taste out of the Trojans\u2019 mouth that stemmed from their heartbreaking 43-42 loss against Utah. USC transfer sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams was the game\u2019s best player with 411 passing yards and five touchdown passes. The performance from Williams was even more impressive than it was on paper because he did it without his two most talented wideouts \u2014 sophomore Mario Williams and junior Jordan Addison. While the offense showed no signs of rust from the bye week, the defense struggled immensely. USC\u2019s defense allowed 543 yards and gave Arizona too many chances to sneak back into the game. Arizona\u2019s sophomore quarterback Jayden de Laura took advantage of a USC defense that has trouble containing mobile quarterbacks, as his running ability posed a problem the entire game. His performance almost helped Arizona upset USC, but the Wildcats came just short. USC was in desperate need of a victory and found a way to sneak out of Tucson with one.\n\nOregon 42, Cal 24\n\nAfter a slow start in the first quarter, Oregon continued its recent offensive surge as the Ducks rolled right over a wretched Cal team. Senior quarterback Bo Nix has been astonishing this season and added to his potential Heisman campaign as he had six total touchdowns and 471 total yards. Nix and the Ducks\u2019 offense walked all over Cal\u2019s dreadful defense. Cal was dominated in every aspect of the game. After dropping another game, this looks like another lost season for the Golden Bears. On the other hand, Oregon added another win to its resume as the Ducks are vying for a Pac-12 title.\n\nUCLA 38, Stanford 13\n\nUCLA\u2019s offense was too much for Stanford to endure, as the Bruins accounted for 523 yards. The Bruins\u2019 most valuable player was senior running back Zach Charbonnet, who had over 250 total yards and three rushing touchdowns. On 21 rushes, Charbonnet averaged 9.4 yards per attempt. Stanford had no answer for Charbonnet the whole game, and it didn\u2019t help that Stanford\u2019s offense could not move the ball down the field. Junior quarterback Tanner McKee gave a pitiful performance as he was 13-of-29 passing with 115 passing yards, one touchdown and an interception. Stanford entered the game on an impressive two-game winning streak and now looks to move on next season as a bowl game seems nearly impossible. On the other hand, UCLA is very much in the mix for the Pac-12 title as the Bruins continue to lean on their outstanding rushing attack.\n\nArizona State 42, Colorado 34\n\nBoth defenses in this game struggled mightily which created an offensive showdown between two lackluster rosters. This game had 916 total yards and 42 first downs. In his second straight game filling in for injured redshirt junior quarterback Emory Jones, redshirt junior quarterback Trenton Bourguet was fabulous. Bourguet passed for 435 yards and three touchdowns. Bourguet was also able to lean on his superstar graduate running back, Xazavian Valladay, who rushed for 118 yards and three touchdowns. Arizona State and Colorado\u2019s offensive lines gave their quarterbacks enough time to keep making plays to stay in the game. Ultimately, Arizona State was able to pull out a victory in this high-scoring contest.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

This latest update in her case slims the scope of her chances to return home to the United States. Griner now must look towards calculated discussions between the U.S. and Russia when their diplomatic relations are the most fraught in decades.\n\nAlthough her rejected appeal maintains her sentence, the court agreed to recalculate Griner's prison time to reflect what she has already served in pre-trial detention. Every day served in pre-trial detention accounts for one and a half days in prison, meaning she will have to serve about eight years in prison.\n\nSince her arrest at the Moscow airport in February, the Biden administration has been engaged in tense negotiations to bring the WNBA star home. Her arrest came just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, which entangled Griner's case in the broader context of war and only complicated ongoing international discussions between the U.S. and Russia.\n\nThese discussions are not irregular occurrences, however. The U.S. conducts routine international negotiations for intelligence and other desired possessions. Sometimes, those desired possessions are human beings. In order to maintain leverage in these negotiations, countries on both sides capture important prisoners and hold on to them until they can be traded for what they are seeking.\n\nRobert English, an international relations professor at USC, emphasized that this system of international bartering is constantly at play behind the curtain of diplomacy. \"The Brittney Griner case has become a pawn, a political football, in relations between the United States and the Russian Federation,\" he said. \"It's horse trading with human lives.\"\n\nGriner's wellness is not the only thing at stake in these conversations. The U.S. also hopes to bring home former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan by offering the exchange of high-profile Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout\u2014also known as the \"merchant of death.\"\n\nGriner, center for the Phoenix Mercury and two-time Olympic gold medalist was originally in Russia playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason. An all-star athlete like Griner going overseas to find off-season work may seem strange, but she's in the company of other top players like Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart. Since players of their caliber can earn more than quadruple their base WNBA salary by playing in Russia, it's easier to ignore complicated politics and safety concerns.\n\nFriends, family and supporters of Griner have taken their distress over the matter to the public sphere. \"It has been 253 days since our friend, Brittney Griner, has been wrongfully detained in Russia. It is time for her to come home,\" tweeted American basketball player Breanna Stewart of the Seattle Storm. Tagging the White House, the president, and the vice president, Stewart writes \"we are paying attention and we are counting on you.\"\n\nStephen Curry halted the Golden State warrior championship ring ceremony to call attention to the fact that on that day, October 18, Griner spent her 32nd birthday behind Russian bars. \"We want to continue to use our platform and the opportunity to shout out a very special member of the basketball community,\" Curry told the crowd. \"We hope that she comes home soon, that everybody's doing their part to get her home,\" he said.\n\nCherelle Griner, Brittney Griner's wife, shared her anguish with CBS Mornings in early October, \"She's very afraid about being left and forgotten in Russia, or just completely used to the point of her detriment.\"\n\nSo why Griner? There are thousands of U.S. prisoners being held in overseas confinement. Why has Griner become this political symbol for the condition of U.S. international relations? Professor English insisted it is because of her intersectional identity and heightened visibility as a star of the sports industry. \"Brittney Griner is African American. Brittney Griner is a woman. She is also LGBT. And she was carrying marijuana or cannabis oil,\" he said. \"And the Russians know perfectly well that those are incredibly hot-button issues in the United States. They probably see that the publicity surrounding this case actually shines a negative light on the U.S., not just them.\"\n\nIn early August, Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison after officials found cartridges of cannabis oil in her luggage. Now, the threat of serving out this sentence in a Russian penal colony has become all the more palpable\u2014and no less terrifying. These penal colonies are punishment-based facilities where convicts endure forced labor and isolation.\n\nAt her trial, Griner presented a doctor's letter issued on the behalf of the Arizona Department of Health saying that she had been recommended cannabis to treat pain. But Griner is being held on Russian laws, not U.S. laws. Although U.S. federal marijuana legislation has recently relaxed with the Biden administration's pardoning of possession incarcerations, Russian laws remain rigid.\n\nProfessor English noted that the Russian prison system is not the only harsh punishment system in the world. \"If you shine a spotlight on the penal system of the United States, as opposed to Russia, we're not a whole lot better. We really aren't,\" he says. \"And Putin knows that, or at least his diplomats know that. They're trying to turn this around and say, 'now you care about Brittney Griner? How about the thousands and thousands [in your prisons]?'\"\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Madison Moore)\n\nBy Viktoria Capek\nNovember 02, 2022 at 6:44 pm PDT\n\nMadison Moore\u2019s first class as an assistant professor of critical studies began with two minutes of booming underground vogue, or ballroom music \u2014 a cacophony of disco, hip-hop, electronic and house \u2014 that echoed off the white walls of the classroom in the same way music infiltrates an abandoned warehouse that performs as a temporary nightclub. Onlooking graduate students at the University of Southern California\u2019s Roski School of Art and Design shifted anxiously in their seats as the music raged, albeit with amusement on their faces as they waited for Moore \u2014 in bright pink combat boots and a thick, silver chain necklace \u2014 to speak. Some of them took out their phones to record a video of the unusual presentation just in time for the sound to fade and their professor to introduce the lecture: \u201cHello, everyone. Welcome to the history and theory of performance studies.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor\u201d is the latest title the truly amorphous and multi-hyphenate Moore, 40, claims in a way that brings new meaning to what an academic can look like. \u201cI\u2019m very aware of the sort of impact that being a Black, queer, non-binary person might have in the classroom or on the students,\u201d said Moore immediately following a session of their Tuesday class, a 3 hour and 20 minute event where they aim to keep student-led discussions front and center. They\u2019re teaching students how to boldly take up space, a concept that took years for Moore \u2014 who grew up a pariah \u2014 to embrace.\n\nMoore was raised in a working class family by their paternal grandmother in Ferguson, Missouri. They dedicated their childhood to learning the violin. At 17 Moore was told they weren\u2019t good enough to enter a conservatory. Deflated, they abruptly turned their back on music and was forced to find other interests in undergraduate school, where they eventually majored in French literature at the University of Michigan. Moore continued their education, pursuing a doctorate in American studies at Yale, but remained unsure about a topic for their thesis. Moore approached their adviser and mentor, Joe Roach, for advice on finding a focus, and Roach asked Moore what interested them in their personal life. \u201cFashion magazines, shopping and going to nightclubs,\u201d they said. \u201cBut those aren\u2019t real topics.\u201d Roach contested and introduced Moore to performance studies, an interdisciplinary field that uses performance, pop culture and the arts as a lens to study the world. \u201c[Moore] was delighted to know that you can study what they\u2019re interested in, you could do serious work and thinking about it,\u201d Roach gloated about his former student over the phone. \u201cThere are departments and programs and professors who really are excited about the kind of research that Madison is unusually \u2014 and in some ways uniquely \u2014 qualified to conduct.\u201d\n\nMoore spent the remainder of their time at Yale traveling to and through New York City as often as possible. It was there where they honed their interests and how to use them in academia became palpable: They read Foucault on the train from New Haven to the city and interned at fashion magazines while their colleagues scorned them for not taking their education seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s been a journey of learning how to find your voice in these spaces that are not made for you,\u201d said Moore about a concept they explored further in their dissertation-turned-first book, \u201cFabulous: The Rise of the Beautiful Eccentric.\u201d Inspired by the glamorous Sunday-best fashion worn by Moore\u2019s grandmother, \u201cFabulous\u201d analyzes Black and queer fabulousness as a practice of resistence to a society that isn\u2019t largely welcoming to those communities.\n\nBack in the classroom, Moore engages their students with music and media influenced by Black, queer culture. The class watched \u201cMaking Sweet Tea,\u201d a documentary about gay Black men of the South by E. Patrick Johnson, a researcher and performer whom Moore identifies with and is inspired by as an academic. \u201cBlack, queer people are basically invisible and at risk, so I think that\u2019s why it matters to me to be able to center those issues in the classroom,\u201d Moore said.\n\nBeyond academic work, Moore has reincarnated their musical drive as a DJ performing internationally at art institutions, nightclubs and festivals. Most recently they held a nightlife residency at The Kitchen, an avant-garde performance art venue in New York City, with an installation, \u201cThe New Eagle Creek Saloon,\u201d an ode to the first Black, gay bar in San Francisco.\n\nMadison Moore performs international DJ sets at various art institutions, nightclubs and festivals. (Photo courtesy of Madison Moore)\n\nMoore found a way to marry their love for nightclubs and academia by once offering a seminar on clubbing at Yale, a topic that garnered negative feedback from conservative tabloids and media organizations that questioned Moore\u2019s legitimacy as an academic. \u201cMadison is a scholar, they just dress better than most of us,\u201d Roach recalled saying in Moore\u2019s defense at the time.\n\nMoore\u2019s biggest motivator now is to encourage students to challenge the confines of academia and to be a mentor for others the way Roach was for them. Through teaching and exploration of the L.A. nightlife scene, they hope to expand education to all corners of Southern California, inside and outside of the classroom. \u201cPeople want to know things, people are curious, they want to understand the world around them,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYou just got to make it accessible to them.\u201d\n```"}

His latest album Entergalactic treads familiar territory as he both sings and raps about subjects that the everyday person can relate to.\n\nThe emotional lyrics make for better music and Cudi\u2019s large following is due to his openness to discuss the \u201creal\u201d issues, says Bee Pollard, a graduate student studying Journalism.\n\nBee Pollard: \u201cI think musically Cudi\u2019s been able to explore himself and his dimensions and all of his personal nuance, and he\u2019s been able to do it creatively and do it very well. He always exposes a level of himself to his listeners, and I think that\u2019s why he has such a big following, because it\u2019s authentically him. It\u2019s very emotional and it\u2019s just good music at the end of the day because of that.\u201d\n\nPollard, also says that she supports Cudi\u2019s desire to move on from music to pursue other passions.\n\nBee Pollard: \u201cI think it\u2019s awesome for him to explore whatever is in his divine plan. What I\u2019ve seen of Cudi and what I\u2019ve seen of his genius in a way, is that he\u2019s going to flow and maneuver well wherever he goes. He\u2019s got his support in me. So if he\u2019s got one fan, I\u2019m the one fan. I think that he\u2019s going to be able to explore these things effortlessly, and I think he\u2019s going to make a name for himself in other lanes. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nCudi\u2019s animated Netflix special is an innovative approach of blending both music and art. It\u2019s a romantic comedy that primarily centers on two Black lovers, Jabari played by Cudi and Meadow played by Jessica Williams. The art style is similar to Spiderman: Enter The Spiderverse and features character clothing designs by the late Virgil Abloh. It also boasts a star studded cast with names that include, Timothee Chalamet, Vanessa Hudgens, Ty Dolla $ign, Jaden Smith, Keith David, Macaulay Culkin and more.\n\nCudi\u2019s potential permanent departure from music puts him in the same boat as legendary music artists such as Lauryn Hill and Andre 3000, says Taj Frazier, a professor in USC Annenberg\u2019s communication department.\n\nProfessor Taj Frazier: \u201cI think this whole kind of recent statements about, you know, wanting to maybe shift away from music and towards education or just focusing on his family, a lot of that has to do with, you know, potentially, I think maybe feeling a bit contained by some of the conventions of the music business, in the entertainment business, and wanting to free himself so that he can explore other modes of creativity, of expression. I mean, I think it\u2019s, you know, kind of the same kind of wavelength of somebody, like, I would say a Lauryn Hill or a Andre 3000, you know, people who have given us such incredible work, but who also are not willing to abide by this kind of microwave, creative culture..industrial culture, really, that tells artists they have to be producing new stuff, you know, every 6 to 8 months. And I think he\u2019s looking for other spaces in places to feel and be free to express himself.\u201d\n\nCudi already has ideas on how he wants to express himself in the future.\n\nKid Cudi: \u201cI\u2019m really curious to see what else I can do. I was thinking about this - and this is like a wacky idea I had years ago. But it would be cool to, like, one day be a kindergarten teacher. And just do that for a couple of years. Like, when I\u2019m, like 50..And I just, like, infect the youth with that freshness. Get \u2018em young, and then those kids will just sprinkle the freshness to the world, and I\u2019ll just be like, \u2018Yes! Yes!\u2019\u201d\n\nAs Cudi ponders his future in the music industry, anxious fans craving new Cudi content can rejoice as both his latest album and TV special Entergalatic are both available now for streaming.\n```"}

The Mariscotti family opened its Madera, California location of The Vineyard almost 45 years ago. Madera is an agricultural community \u2013 but not in the way you might think. \u201cIt is not romantic agriculture. This is not Napa Valley,\u201d said Mariscotti. \u201cThe Central Valley is kind of a poor stepchild to the rest of the state of California.\u201d\n\nIn order to get an updated count on the country\u2019s population, the U.S. Constitution requires a federal census every 10 years. California uses that census data to redraw the Congressional, State Senate, State Assembly and State Board of Equalization districts based on population changes. Following the 2020 census, California lost a congressional district because of its slowing population growth. As a result, the Democratic House lost a seat and certain towns, like Madera, were redistricted.\n\nDemocrats will lose their narrow hold on the House majority if the GOP picks up five seats in the Nov. 8 midterm elections. Due to the time difference, all eyes will be on California, as those votes are tallied last. Three of those seats could be filled by three of California\u2019s \u201ctoss up\u201d contests: races between a Democratic and Republican candidate in new districts where it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game. This year, those are California districts 13, 22 and 27, located in the northern central valley, southern central valley and the San Gabriel Mountain foothills.\n\nUnlike some states, California\u2019s congressional districts are drawn by a third-party panel, as opposed to state lawmakers. This means California gained some of the highest number of competitive races in the country. Madera is in one of those districts. Democrat Jim Costa ends his nearly decade-long run as congressman for Madera and its surrounding area. This year, Democrat Adam Gray and Republican John Duarte are both running for the position.\n\nMariscotti, an Independent, fears that the redistricting could change the voter demographic. \u201cNew Republicans scare me,\u201d explained Mariscotti, \u201cI have nothing against fiscally responsible, small government Republicans. I\u2019m against hate as a party platform. And that seems to be driving the party today.\u201d\n\nPolitical Analyst and Senior Editor at The Cook Political Report, David Wasserman, considers Mariscotti\u2019s district a Democrat-leaning but culturally conservative area where both parties favor their own candidates. \u201c[Adam] Gray differentiates himself from the coastal Democrats. He\u2019s a blue dog Democrat with pragmatic values,\u201d said Wasserman. By comparison, GOP candidate John Duarte is a Central Valley native and local farmer whose background is a stark contrast from Gray\u2019s political career in Sacramento, Wasserman said.\n\nAccording to Mariscotti, Madera faces two main issues: a lack of water and a struggling economy. Areas like Madera are disproportionately affected by climate change with extreme heat, drought and wildfires. As an agricultural area, Madera relies on oil and gas to get around the sprawling, rural area. But with the nation\u2019s inability to steady inflation rates combined with the state\u2019s focus on reducing air pollution, California gas prices continue to surge.\n\nMariscotti sees these intricate problems looming larger than a campaign platform; he wants a candidate who understands that. For those reasons, Mariscotti doubts he\u2019ll vote for Duarte. \u201cI think his answers are pretty simplistic,\u201d said Mariscotti. \u201cHis whole campaign says he\u2019ll lower taxes and give us more water. I don\u2019t think things are that easy. He gives simple answers to complex questions.\u201d\n\nBut are Mariscotti\u2019s beliefs felt district wide? Wasserman thinks it\u2019s still too close to tell. \u201cWe saw Biden carry that area by 11 points in 2020, but just a year later, Gavin Newsom lost his recall election in that district by one point,\u201d he explained.\n\nDistrict 27 seems to offer an equally mystifying forecast, but Emiliana Guereca, Executive Director of the Women\u2019s March Foundation, is hoping to change that. She stands in front of a wall covered with female empowerment posters, urging onlookers to vote. \u201cWe do have the power to change, state by state,\u201d she said, gesturing to the wall behind her. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take all of us.\u201d\n\nGuereca\u2019s paramount priority is appointing policy makers who support reproductive rights. But she worries that District 27\u2032s Democratic candidate Christy Smith may have an uphill battle. \u201cDistrict 27 has a huge Latino population, which normally votes blue. But Mike Garcia is the Republican candidate. [Smith] needs the Latino vote, but with Garcia running, it\u2019s hard to say if she\u2019ll get it,\u201d said Guereca.\n\nMike Garcia is Latino and defeated Smith in 2020. But since redistricting, District 27 now includes cities like Santa Clarita, Palmdale and Lancaster \u2013 areas that Wasserman believes are more left-leaning. \u201cThis would be a tough district for a Republican candidate to win under these new lines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe real political hot potato, pretty much for the last decade, is California District 22\u2032\u2032. District 22\u2032s GOP incumbent David Valadao struggles with Republican voters as redistricting adds more blue areas like Kings County and Bakersfield. Additionally, Valadao estranged much of his party after backing former President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cHe actually continues to attract Democrats,\u201d explained Wasserman. \u201cA Trump endorsement at this point would then alienate those voters\u201d.\n\nSimilar to Madera, District 22 is an agriculturally focused area that struggles with water issues. Redistricting brought new priorities for policymakers. District 22 is now home to Kings County, where nearly 6% of the population are veterans, according to the 2020 Census. In March 2022, Valadao voted to support legislation that addresses healthcare for veterans, specifically those exposed to toxic chemicals like burn pits and herbicides. He has also made veteran support a major campaign platform, a move likely to garner him more support in the polls.\n\nFor Mariscotti, the fate of his community lies in the ballots of this election. \u201cI\u2019m tired of policymakers playing a big political and cultural agenda,\u201d said Mariscotti, \u201cMy biggest fear is that crazy anti-science election deniers will take over this country.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan November 02, 2022 at 5:59 pm PDT\n\nWith the midterm elections right around the corner, Annenberg Media sat down with Kamy Akhavan, the executive director of USC Dornsife\u2019s Center for Political Future, to discuss voter turnout among young people, the Los Angeles mayoral election and the importance of civic engagement.\n\nWhy is it important to be civically active, especially for the younger generation?\n\nYoung people vote in numbers disproportionate to their populations. If they voted in numbers that were proportionate to their population, meaning if they voted in the same percentages that people over 30 do, you would literally change the outcome of pretty much every election. So youth has a powerful and underused voice. USC obviously is geared towards young people, so we want young people to exercise that voice, feel their power, and become change agents and be part of the change they want to see in the world.\n\nHow is the center getting more students to vote?\n\nThe center has been driving civic engagement at USC since 1976. We\u2019re one of the oldest institutes of politics in America. Specifically, and in recent years we have been fully participating in National Voter Registration Day through campus partners, including VoteSC, the student organization. We\u2019ve been through driving voter registration efforts beyond that day. We are securing voting locations around campus. For 2020, we got the Galen Center. For 2022, we have two mobile voting centers, one that was here on the UPC campus yesterday and one that is on the HSC campus today so that people can register to vote in-person and vote in-person. But as you know, during the pandemic, California law changed and mailed everyone who\u2019s a registered voter their ballot so you can mail your ballot from home if you\u2019re a California resident. Some people are uncomfortable doing that, so we brought vote by mail boxes to campus, one in the USC village, one on [the] HSC campus. You can drop your ballot right in there. If you are not a registered voter in the state of California, if you\u2019re from Illinois or Washington or Florida or wherever, and you go to the USC Votes website, you can register to vote using a system that we paid for called TurboVote, and it will register you no matter what state you\u2019re in. If you are a resident of Illinois and you want to receive your absentee ballot, you can request it through the system and they\u2019ll mail it to you here and you can vote from here. The point is, no one has an excuse. If you\u2019re not registered, you still have time. If you are registered, you can vote in any which way. We want to make all of that possible.\n\nDo you have data on how many eligible USC students vote in a midterm election?\n\nYes. We\u2019ve been tracking the numbers since 2012, and the numbers looked bad up until 2018, for not just USC, but young people across the country voted in record numbers. They were strongly motivated by President Trump and young voters generally were rejecting his policies and wanted to vote in opposition to his policies. So in 2018, we saw a big spike in 2020. We thought, is this a flash in the pan or will there be more youth engagement? And there was more. They broke the 2018 records. 2022, it\u2019s too soon to tell\u2014we don\u2019t know. We hope the trend continues because voting is oxygen to our democratic systems and without oxygen, the system dies. So we need people to participate regardless of their party ideologies. It doesn\u2019t matter who they vote for. If you vote when you\u2019re young, you\u2019re more likely to vote when you\u2019re older. So, it\u2019s developing those habits early. We\u2019re just trying to establish those habits, eliminate the barriers, eliminate the hesitancy, make people feel empowered, make people feel like their vote really matters, because it does. And then hopefully we end up with lifelong voters.\n\nAre you concerned that because it\u2019s a midterm election, there\u2019ll be a lower turnout than in a presidential election year?\n\nYes. Midterms typically have smaller draws than presidential elections. I can tell you that in the last presidential election, 72% of all USC students voted. Of all the students who are registered to vote, 86% voted\u2014very high numbers. USC tied for fourth of all, the top 30 universities with those numbers. We don\u2019t want to be fourth. We want to be first. There\u2019s some competitive incentive there, for sure. But in general, we are expecting the numbers to not be as strong as they were in a presidential election. There\u2019s just not as much recognition of who\u2019s on the ballot. There\u2019s less motivation to go to the polls. There\u2019s less money that\u2019s being spent in general in the election systems, although there\u2019s an obscene amount of money in the election systems regardless. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the numbers were lower for overall voter participation. That would be typical.\n\nWhat issues do you expect to drive midterm voting habits?\n\nMidterm voting habits generally will follow the same lines across all ideological corners, age demographics and racial demographics. It usually has to do with the economy, jobs, feelings of safety, security, crime. Those are issues that are generally the top of the line. If you look specifically at 18 to 29 year olds, those same issues are important. However, so is climate change. So is student debt. Those issues are not important across the general electorate. So if young people want those issues to be elevated, there\u2019s one way to do it.\n\nWhy should USC students care about the L.A. mayoral race?\n\nLocal politics matters far more than people realize. The amount of money that we pay, taxes, fines, fees, what resources are available to us, which offices we can go to when we need assistance and help\u2014those things are largely determined at a very local level. So the mayor in Los Angeles is, compared to other cities, not an especially powerful position, but it is still a powerful position. We will have a Trojan in office, whoever wins. It\u2019s going to be [Rick] Caruso or [Karen] Bass. So USC will be well represented at the city level, but they have very different policy views and it\u2019s important for people to become familiar with what those views are, to see if they want L.A. to look more like Caruso wants it to look, or more like Bass wants it to look. And those visions are not the same. So, if you care about what your city looks like, you\u2019ve got to vote for mayor, you\u2019ve got to vote for city attorney, you\u2019ve got to vote for district attorney. You\u2019ve got to vote in the propositions, for the judgeships. There\u2019s so many issues at stake if you\u2019re not sure who to vote for, there\u2019s a whole other process. Do you factor endorsements? Do you talk to friends and family? Do you spend a lot of time researching these issues yourselves? There\u2019s a lot to decide. Point is, just fill out the ballot to whatever degree you\u2019re comfortable, make the best decisions you can, and at least you will have participated in the process and your voice will count.\n\nWhat do you hope to see in this election in terms of student turnout and engagement?\n\nWe want engagement to be as high as it\u2019s ever been. We want students to feel like they are part of this democratic process, because they are, and to feel close to it. So to that end, we are going to host an election night watch party at the Annenberg Media Center in coordination with about ten other campus entities. We\u2019re going to bring political experts and media to the room. So as election results come out, we can hit mute on the TV screen and then talk about what just happened and help us understand what happened with these political experts who are on hand. Student leaders who are there, the political VIPs who are there, they can then share their views with the media who will have been assembled there. And I think it will add a level of excitement and proximity to elections that a lot of people who are not at USC will not get to experience. They\u2019ll just be sitting on the couch watching this on TV. We will really be fully engaged. And that engagement, to answer your question, is what we\u2019d like to see the most. It doesn\u2019t matter who you vote for. It matters that you vote and that you participate.\n\nTo register to vote, visit the USC Votes website. Election day is November 8.\n```"}

The study, published last week, found that mothers suffering from stress for personal reasons or because of where they live had babies born with lower weights.\n\nThe researchers, focusing on low-income Hispanic women in Los Angeles, began work in 2015 in what Zhongzheng \u201cJason\u201d Niu, the study\u2019s first author, called a \u201cbig effort.\u201d It included 628 women pregnant with a single child, 21% of whom reported experiencing high stress levels. During the data collection process, the participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire to understand stressors and their ability to cope with them.\n\n\u201cSome people may have a higher resilience or they have better support,\u201d said Niu, a postdoctoral scholar and research associate at the USC Keck School of Medicine. \u201cSo even though the stressful event is the same, people have different reactions to that.\u201d\n\nThe researchers used the CalEnviroScreen Score to identify disproportionately burdened California communities. The website allows users to see places in California experiencing cumulative burdens of environmental pollution and socioeconomic factors that might increase susceptibility to the effects of pollution. The overall CalEnviroScreen score is calculated by multiplying the pollution burden and population characteristics scores. More than half of the participants in the research study lived in areas with a score greater than 50 out of 100. The greater the score, the greater the burden.\n\nBabies exposed to air pollution in the womb have their lung development affected, or they can be born too early or too small. Low birth weight and premature birth are leading risk factors for death in the first month of life. They are also related to higher mortality rates in people. Such kids are more vulnerable to problems like lower-respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, brain damage and inflammation, blood disorders and jaundice.\n\nThe study focused on three air pollutants: nitrogen dioxide (released from the burning of fossil fuels), fine particulate matter PM2.5 (from the combustion of gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood produce) and PM10 (dust from construction sites, industrial sources or wind-blown from open lands), and found strong relations between exposure to these pollutants and lower birth weight.\n\nAccording to Rupa Basu, chief of the air and climate epidemiology section at the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, it\u2019s important to include environmental racism when talking about environmental pollution. \u201cSo there are some differences by the exposure [of PM2.5]. So if you look at areas that generally have more Black, Latino and also Asian populations, they tend to have generally higher levels of PM2.5 and other exposures. And it\u2019s because places where people live are closer to freeways, closer to fossil fuel combustion areas, and I think there\u2019s also less resources going into those areas to decrease the emissions.\u201d\n\nL.A. is one of many cities in California with the most polluted air in the country, according to an American Lung Association analysis this year, a national report card on air quality throughout the nation. \u201cThe biggest issues are systemic regulatory failure, systemic disinvestment, the lack of political power and political will to change the oppressive systems that are continuing to allow industry to sit next to communities [and] to continue to pollute...and not really address the problem from a root cause,\u201d said Paula Torrado Plazas, manager of the health and environment program at Physicians for Social Responsibility-L.A.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about the USC study is that it uses models that focus on the sensitive time periods of exposure, which is early to mid-pregnancy, when the organs in the baby are forming. For mothers with heightened levels of stress or those who live in neighborhoods with high levels of pollution and scarce health care resources, the study found wider critical periods in pregnancy and more changes in the babies.\n\n\u201cThere is no safe level of air pollution,\u201d emphasized Niu. According to Basu, newer studies are showing the connection between mental health and exposure to pollution. Smaller pollutants could pass the brain blood barrier and cause cognitive impairment, for example, neurological developmental disorders in infants and children.\n\nNiu explained studies have shown that exposure of women to air pollution could have a direct effect on the placenta, which in turn may be unable to provide enough nutrients for the baby to grow. Add to that the psychological stress, and the regulatory system in the women\u2019s body gets impacted, hurting the baby.\n\n\u201cFrom a public health point of view, it\u2019s important to realize that fetuses, infants, pregnant women, they\u2019re the most vulnerable of all populations,\u201d Basu said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re seeing effects in these populations, then it is...a huge environmental stressor.\u201d\n\nPlazas said that addressing stressors, cumulative impacts and investing in community driven mental health solutions needs a big picture perspective. One community health center, she said, isn\u2019t enough. \u201cThere\u2019s not even close to what communities need.\u201d Plazas said. \u201cI think there need to be stronger political champions and justice champions that are bringing resources to the communities and are allocating funds in a way that is equitable and not continuing to fuel fossil fuel dependency, but are actually attributing to the solutions that communities are advocating for.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to correctly quote a source, as well as to correctly name Physicians for Social Responsibility-L.A.

In order to increase awareness, USC Student Affairs has planned several events throughout the month to commemorate the historical month. Events will include the 4th annual Pow Wow, a presentation on the \u201ctrue story of Thanksgiving\u201d and a presentation by award-winning Chef Pyet, who specializes in indigenous fusion cuisine.\n\nEducating people about Native culture is essential in helping society move forward in support of indigenous tribes, said Jair Peltier, a PhD candidate studying tribal sovereignty and a cultural ambassador to the Native American Pasifika Student Lounge. \u201cFor many years it\u2019s been native [people] fighting alone because nobody\u2019s listening. Nobody knows the history, nobody knows the realities,\u201d Peltier said. \u201cBut by becoming more aware, by becoming more involved, then maybe we can actually overcome these historical atrocities and tragedies.\u201d\n\nStill, Peltier acknowledged that events celebrating Native Heritage at USC, a school which sits on land that belonged to the Gabrielino-Tongva people, are still fairly limited. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of groundwork,\u201d said Peltier. \u201cWe plan to have more events next summer, or next year, actually. But this year it\u2019s really kind of the preliminary kind of time where we\u2019re seeing if we can really get these things going and get them accomplished.\u201d\n\nKaitlin Becenti, a sophomore majoring in journalism and a member of both the Navajo tribe and the Native American Student Assembly (NASA), also explained the difficulties of being away from home during Native American Heritage, and missing out on family celebrations. \u201cMore of our traditions or culture takes place at home,\u201d Becenti said, \u201cwhich unfortunately I\u2019m not home to do.\u201d\n\nHowever, one notable event meant to educate USC students is an event hosted by Emily Eid called \u201cFrom Alcatraz to the BIA: Portraits of Modern Native American Leaders,\u201d which hopes to combat the widespread \u201cvanishing Indian\u201d stereotype. \u201cThe historical narrative has always been that Native people were here and then they weren\u2019t here, and now... the United States is here,\u201d Peltier said. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t really been good education as far as indigenous rights and indigenous history.\u201d\n\nAnthony Morales, the tribal chairman and chief of Gabrielino-Tongva San Gabriel Band of Missions Indians, spoke to Annenberg Media about the Native American Heritage Month and its celebration in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor because the Native American community is being recognized and there [are] events, especially here in L.A... recognizing Native Americans, not only my tribe\u2014the tribe of Los Angeles\u2014but other tribal nations that now make L.A. their residence, their home. It\u2019s a show of honor that they recognize Native Americans and they designate the whole month of November as Native American month.\u201d\n\nMorales noted that other than USC\u2019s celebration, L.A. city council member Mitch O\u2019Farrell from the Wyandotte Nation hosts a celebration for Native American Heritage Month every year on the first Friday of November. Morales also encouraged people to check out the Autry Museum of the American West, which often holds events celebrating Native American culture.\n\nBeyond USC, community organizations are holding numerous events to honor and celebrate Native American Heritage month. The Los Angeles County Library is hosting numerous events such as an in-person art class in which you can learn about Yankton Dakota artist Mary Sully and create inspired artwork. The Glendale Central Library is hosting conversations with Native American history experts and authors David Heska Wanbli and Weiden Walter R. Echo-Hawk.

The celebration, known as the \u201c1st Annual Day of the Dead Community Event,\u201d will be held between 4:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on November 3 in the Health Science Campus Pappas Quad and will feature \u201cfree immunizations, health education, danzantes (traditional folk/indigenous dance), music, free food, a community altar and more,\u201d according to the USC events webpage.\n\nThe event was coordinated by Luis Larios, a graduate student at the USC School of Pharmacy. Larios says he first came up with the idea for the event during his first year at the school and thought it would be a good way to celebrate the cultures of East L.A. communities.\n\n\u201cD\u00eda de los Muertos is a day that I keep close to my heart because I\u2019ve lost a lot of family members within these past few years, and it\u2019s been a good way for me to grieve,\u201d Larios said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do something for my community, and so I thought today would be a good day to give back.\u201d\n\nLarios actualized this idea while working under Dr. Melissa Durham, the assistant dean of diversity and inclusion at the USC School of Pharmacy.\n\n\u201cHispanics... are a huge majority of our surrounding community,\u201d Durham said. \u201cSo, we want to really showcase our commitment to connecting with that community and also raise awareness and provide education for everyone about this beautiful holiday.\u201d\n\nD\u00eda de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a holiday celebrated on November 2, although some communities extend it from October 31 through the first week of November. It aims to honor the return of the souls of deceased loved ones to the world of the living. While the celebration has roots in Mexico and Central America, D\u00eda de los Muertos has spread throughout the world, with celebrations held throughout communities through the United States, South America, the Philippines and even parts of Europe and Australia.\n\nAt the center of the celebration are altars called ofrendas, which are erected near gravesites, community centers and in homes. Ofrendas are typically decorated with photos, food, candles and various other items for the dead to enjoy during their time back on earth.\n\nSofia Reyes, a graduate student studying public health, said that even though she is not near her family to celebrate D\u00eda de los Muertos, she keeps her traditions strong by making a miniature ofrenda to honor her relatives and pets who have passed away. While she will not be able to attend the School of Pharmacy\u2019s celebration, she said she thinks it\u2019s a good way to celebrate culture and share resources.\n\n\u201cI think this event is really important,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a double-whammy. It\u2019s like we\u2019re celebrating you, and we\u2019re celebrating your traditions since we\u2019re in your space, and we\u2019re also offering support.\u201d\n\nAttendees are encouraged to bring photos of deceased loved ones and offerings to decorate the altar and \u201ctree of life\u201d at the event. Real candles will not be allowed, but battery operated lights are welcome. Those interested in attending can register here.\n```"}

(Photos courtesy of Jackie Rodriguez)\n\nBy Citlalli Ch\u00e1vez-Nava November 02, 2022 at 5:23 pm PDT\n\nFor Jackie Rodriguez, leading a planet-conscious lifestyle is not a recent fad. Instead, at the core of how this sustainable fashion influencer approaches her consumption decisions are the working-class values her Salvadoran immigrant parents passed down through their embrace of home-cooked meals, thrift store shopping and many other prudent budgeting habits while living in a suburb of the San Gabriel Valley.\n\n\u201cDesde chiquita (since I was a little girl), it was instilled in me to not be wasteful,\u201d she said in a video interview. \u201cTo conserve, whether that was energy, food, money \u2014 anything. So I think that\u2019s always kind of been a big value and driving force in my life.\u201d\n\nThese concepts are central to Rodriguez\u2019s distinctive style in which she links environmental values with a more mindful approach to consumption as a way to advance generational wealth discussions among Latina millennials \u2014 a perspective she felt was missing from the sustainable fashion movement.\n\nRodriguez drew this connection because she recognized that first-generation college educated Latinas like her are often the first in their families to hold higher-earning professional positions \u2014 and with that comes a responsibility to not only provide for oneself, but also to save and invest wisely to support family members in the future.\n\nRodriguez took the time to talk about her unique sustainability perspective while on lunch break at her Washington D.C. office, where she works as a communications professional. Her hair was parted down the center and pulled back into a neat ponytail, and she was dressed in a completely thrifted outfit consisting of a flowy white dress, a vintage lime-green blazer and elegant handcrafted earrings.\n\nWhen asked to define sustainability, a term that is often overused and co-opted as a marketing tactic by corporate brands in our culture, Rodriguez says it\u2019s important to adopt a new mentality as consumers.\n\n\u201cFor me, it means only using or having truly what you need,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course, I\u2019m not perfect.\u201d\n\nYet, she explains that sustainability demands more than solely buying less, it requires shifting our mindset to consume clothing, food or home goods with the purpose and intention to ensure future generations will also have access to the resources we are using, too.\n\nThis lifestyle is present across her thoughtfully curated Instagram feed, where she features picturesque shots modeling her own fashionable secondhand outfit arrangements, alongside slideshows and short videos where she unpacks evolving climate news and policy.\n\nHer posts also feature bilingual sustainability slogans and analysis, and she evaluates how her spending decisions impact not only the planet, but also her family\u2019s financial legacy.\n\nRodriguez avoids buying anything made from polyester, nylon or synthetic fibers, which are made from petrochemicals extracted from oil and gas and whose production has been known to disproportionately affect Black and brown neighborhoods near the port in Los Angeles, \u201cCancer Alley\u201d in Louisiana or the Ohio River Valley, which all experience higher rates of air pollution.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study by the Biomimicry Institute, about 60% of textiles are currently made using fuel-based synthetic fibers that don\u2019t decompose naturally and accumulate in the environment as toxic chemicals.\n\nAnd so, Rodriguez looks for clothing made with 100% natural fibers.\n\nRodriguez is well-attuned to discussions about sustainability in the fashion industry and dives deeper to discuss sustainable fashion policy. She mentions shifting our economy away from a linear mode of production and advocates for a circular approach that forces clothing companies to consider the full life of a product.\n\nA circular approach could lead to buy-back, recycling or composting initiatives, which are crucial to reducing the harm the fashion industry has on the planet, she said.\n\nRodriguez highlighted the importance of degrowth, a process by which both production and consumption are essentially slowed or reduced so that our economy syncs up with our planet\u2019s limited resources.\n\nFor people looking to curb their purchasing habits, the most essential tip she shares involves buying less and, if you must buy, buy smarter.\n\nBefore purchasing anything, Rodriguez runs through a list of qualifications: first, she considers whether she truly needs what she\u2019s about to purchase; second, if it\u2019s a true necessity, she buys secondhand items as much as possible; third, if secondhand is not available, she considers the quality or the durability of the item and how the way it was made impacts local workers and communities.\n\nAmid the challenging climate reality that unfolds before our eyes, Rodriguez promotes a refreshing, empowering and almost contagious approach by linking sustainable fashion and personal financial legacy.\n\nShe makes sustainable practices seem very practical.\n\n\u201cI consider building generational wealth,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s 10 cents or a penny, at the end of the day, it adds up...So when I decide to buy [something] new or actually spend money, I ask, ` What\u2019s going to be the return of investment ?\u2019\u201d\n```"}

These gourds are unchosen, unhoused and uncarved. But this fall, they won\u2019t go to waste. The animals at the Los Angeles Zoo are going to eat them. \n\n\u201cSome animals eat them; some attack them and rip them apart; some play with them; some small animals hide inside the pumpkins; some forage for their diet that is placed inside a carved pumpkin; some animals like primates love to forage and pick the seeds out and the elephants love to squish them,\u201d said Rebecca Wilson, communications specialist for the zoo, in an email. \n\nAccording to Wilson, the Westfield Mall will donate about 100 pumpkins to the zoo. Trader Joe\u2019s in Manhattan Beach has also agreed to donate their pumpkins, and each Trader Joe\u2019s location may pick a different non-profit. \n\nSteve Benveniste from Toluca Lake Pumpkin Festival in North Hollywood sold out of pumpkins this year, but in years when he\u2019s not so lucky, he donates to animal organizations. \u201cUnless they\u2019re rotted, they\u2019re still perfectly good pumpkins,\u201d he explained. \n\nIn recent years, he\u2019s donated to the L.A. Zoo and Griffith Park Petting Zoo. Robert Quroz from Advent Pines pumpkin patch in Arcadia uses unsold pumpkins to feed the animals in his petting zoo. He rents the animals from a local farm, which takes any leftover pumpkins with them. \n\nThe Gentle Barn, an animal sanctuary in Santa Clarita, accepts pumpkin donations from the public to feed its pigs, goats, chickens, turkeys and other animals. Each year, the staff has a \u201cpumpkin smashing party\u201d to break them down and make it easier for animals to eat them. \n\nDonating pumpkins is also the most eco-friendly disposal option. When pumpkins end up in the landfill, either carved or uncarved, they emit methane gas as they begin to break down. This gas is invisible, toxic and corrosive to the Earth\u2019s ozone layer. \n\nCarved pumpkins are safest when composted, but uncarved pumpkins can be donated as food and broken down more quickly and naturally by animals. \n\nFor students who have carved pumpkins or who are unable to donate, USC\u2019s Zero Waste initiative will be composting pumpkins on campus in an event called \u201cThe Great Pumpkin Smash,\u201d through November 4. Students can bring their jack-o\u2019-lanterns to smash and then compost sustainably. \n\nWhile the L.A. Zoo is accepting limited donations, they follow certain protocols to ensure the safety of their animals. This year, Wilson explained, they had to factor in the dangers of COVID-19 and the bird flu, because pumpkins may contain traces of bacteria on their surface. \n\nAny requests are run by the zoo\u2019s director of animal programs, Beth Shaefer, the chief veterinarian, Dominique Keller and the nutritionist, Emily Schwartz. Then, the donated pumpkins are left to sit for at least 72 hours to avoid any contaminants. Finally, they may be washed off before being given to the animals. \n\nMembers of the public can request to donate to the L.A. Zoo or take unused, uncarved pumpkins to The Gentle Barn for animals in need of food.\n```"}

Takeoff was killed in a shooting on Nov. 1 (Photo courtesy of Charito Yap/The Come Up Show).\n\nBy Taylor Marie Contarino November 02, 2022 at 1:54 pm PDT\n\nViolence in the hip-hop music community has been increasing at an alarming rate. On Tuesday, Takeoff, a member of the rap group Migos, was pronounced dead following a shooting in Houston. Barely two months prior in September, PnB Rock died following a robbery at Roscoe\u2019s Chicken & Waffles in Los Angeles. These events have left fans and industry professionals alike feeling shocked and despaired and searching to find answers to the recurring violence in the industry.\n\nAmerica is no stranger to senseless deaths within the hip-hop music community. One CNN report found that since 2018, at least one rapper every year has died from gun violence. In 2020, the New York-based drill rap artist Pop Smoke was shot and killed during a home invasion. But why is it all happening, and when will it end?\n\nRichard Parrott IV, a music journalist and a voting member for the Grammys, found out about the death of PnB Rock in \u201creal time\u201d through Twitter. He said the footage of the incident was already circulating almost immediately after the news broke.\n\n\u201cI got a text that he [PnB Rock] got shot. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not uncommon anymore,\u201d Parrott said. \u201cI went on Twitter, and I saw a video of his last moments. I think people are very desensitized to serious issues now, and I think some of that might be the internet.\u201d\n\nNew deaths within the hip-hop music industry have become more widespread and visible with social media apps. The explicit videos of the deaths of PnB Rock and Takeoff both circulated on Twitter, subjecting viewers to graphic and violent images.\n\nA devout music enthusiast and artist himself, Parrott believes that social media not only influences the current state of hip-hop by spreading violent images, but it\u2019s also influencing the way people view artists, and even the world through the narrow lens of the platforms.\n\n\u201cPresent day, people look at artists not as real people, but as characters. People feel like they\u2019re watching a drama,\u201d he said.\n\nThis violence issue extends back to the origins of rap. In the 1990s, Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. were caught in the crossfires of violence in the music industry and both lost their lives over it. Over the past several years, rap fans have also witnessed the deaths of industry icons such as Nipsey Hussle, Pop Smoke and Young Dolph.\n\nTakeoff released an album just last week in collaboration with his uncle and bandmate Quavo under Motown Records and Quality Control Music. The project, \u201cOnly Built For Infinity Links,\u201d follows a previous solo album by Takeoff called \u201cThe Last Rocket,\u201d which hit No. 4 on the United States Billboard charts.\n\nJae Deal, a composer, arranger, music producer and professor, described that violence in the hip-hop community has been around for some time now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see rappers like Snoop Dogg, Ice-T\u2014 people have been around for a long time denouncing gangster activity, violence, and say that was a part of their artistry early on,\u201d Deal explained. \u201cBut now, they\u2019ve evolved, and they can see a bigger picture. Then, they take younger rappers under their wing and mentor them.\u201d\n\nDeal and his colleague Sean Nye, a musicologist and a professor at USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music, teach a class on hip-hop history and culture. Nye said he believes in fostering a greater conversation surrounding violence within the music industry, including gun violence, as well as substance abuse.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m trying to] build the conversation, the generational conversation about it... not just attacks and shootings, but the overdoses.\u201d Nye said. \u201cThe list is getting long,\u201d he continued. \u201cI also just worry for the mental well-being of fans, with the loss of artists like this. This occurred in the rock music community with the discussion of the \u201c27 Club,\u201d a term for the large number of artists who passed away at the age of 27. This had happened in rock and it was felt as a tragic kind of generational experience.\u201d\n\nLooking forward, members and fans of the hip-hop music community are still searching for solutions to violence in the industry, and they believe that healing begins within the community itself.\n\n\u201cI feel that a lot of the healing can come from the actual rappers in the community among themselves,\u201d Deal said.\n```"}

When my father stabbed my mother in the lungs \u2014 that\u2019s how she felt.\u201d Students from USC and UCLA listened carefully as Noah, a student at Seoul National University studying political science and international relations, described the events leading up to his escape from North Korea. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t breathe and had to rely on an oxygen tank for the next six months. I was devastated,\u201d Noah said.\n\nThe shame Noah\u2019s family received after the attack drove him to escape North Korea a year later. Noah was one of three speakers at last Wednesday\u2019s \u201cUSC x UCLA\u201d event held in collaboration with the North Korean non-profit Liberty, also known as LiNK. Liberty was created in order to advocate for North Korean refugees and aid in their resettlement.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Korean peninsula was divided into two separate regions by the Soviet Union and the United States. The border hardened after years of war in the region, mainly pitted between communist forces in the north and republic forces in the south. Although North and South Korea share the same language, their cultures diverged under the reign of different governments.\n\nDomestic violence, limited food resources and other factors in the regime create an unsafe environment in North Korea. Many plan, but few succeed, in escaping the country\u2019s violation of human rights. \u201cThere was no one to save us. No police. No law. No regime. No one helped my mother,\u201d said Noah. \u201cThere are still so many women and children in North Korea whose voices cannot be heard.\u201d\n\nAlongside Noah were LiNK fellows and refugees Hannah and Harry, also representing the small percentage of individuals that have escaped the North Korean regime. Hannah, a student at Kookmin University studying Chinese language and literature, shared how she was sold to a man in China when she was 15 years old. He was twice her age. \u201cI lived in constant anxiety... so I escaped with my one-month old daughter in my arms,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cAnd even though it was a very hard and dangerous journey, we ran together towards freedom ... a future that guaranteed us a safety and home.\u201d\n\nLiNK has helped more than 1,300 refugees escape North Korea through secret rescue routes, calling it a \u201cmodern-day underground railroad.\u201d Yet, there are still 25.8 million North Koreans enduring a violation of human rights and limited access to the outside world.\n\nHannah and Noah lived under numerous restrictions while they lived in North Korea. Still, they managed sometimes to find ways to at least mildly circumvent them. \u201cMy friends and I would secretly watch Korean dramas and dance to music at night,\u201d said Hannah as Noah subsequently agreed. \u201cWatching South Korean movies is very dangerous ... but those were my favorite memories during my childhood.\u201d\n\nAfter years of living under North Korean restrictions, Hannah and Noah said they experienced profound culture shock when they finally managed to escape. They were finally able to live without that danger.\n\nUniversity collaborations with LiNK continue to advocate for the rights and awareness of North Korean refugees beyond its immediate communities of interest. Orion Dennin, an advocacy intern with USC\u2019s LiNK team expressed his passion in expanding the limited knowledge college students may have on North Korea. \u201cI feel like students believe what they see in the news and media,\u201d Dennin said. There\u2019s a lot of fear mongering and a lot of one dimensional portrayal of North Korea. This event, which draws a burst of nuance to it, shows that they\u2019re not just robotic figures.\u201d\n\nThroughout the month, LiNK will continue to visit college campuses to inform students about their mission to de-stigmatize and share the story of North Korean refugees.

In a vibrant event the community joined to celebrate with face painting, food and music ranging from baile folkl\u00f3rico acts to salsa ensembles. After the fun of face painting and all of these events came the euphoria of a stellar performance. Lupita Infante performed accompanied by Mariachi Herencia De M\u00e9xico, a Chicago-based mariachi group who is mainly formed by young musicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible journey. I\u2019ve gotten to meet 13 of the members. We\u2019ve been traveling together so you get to know people really well,\u201d said Infante, granddaughter of the legendary mariachi music star Pedro Infante. Infante is a featured artist on the mariachi\u2019s most recent album titled \u201cHerederos\u201d and is aware that her collaboration with the group serves as a trailblazing effort for the future of the genre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just our job [as musicians], but I feel like it\u2019s our duty. To carry these traditions. To have them be passed on to the new generations,\u201d she adds.\n\nWith a great number of Latin Grammy nominations and quite some awards under her belt, Infante embodies the name of the newest album as she, together with the young mariachi group, looks to take this inheritance of a genre forward and transmit its emotions to the generations to come.\n\nMarco Villela, a sophomore studying music education at DePaul University, came into the group after his mother scheduled an audition behind his back. Since then his love for classical music, jazz and mariachi music has led him to huge stages. Only 19 years old, Villela is one of the longest participating members of the group and feels inclined to continue the legacy of mariachi music.\n\n\u201cThis is what our parents listen to, this is what our grandparents listen to,\u201d he says, reminiscing about how before joining the mariachi he was not as big a fan of the genre. \u201cNow that we are listening to this [music] we are appreciating this culture, like culture diffusion,\u201d adds Villela.\n\nAt such an early age, Villela is for sure the heir to the music of previous generations. He was part of the group\u2019s first album and recalls a collaboration-packed first experience; with greats like Mariachi Sol de M\u00e9xico, Los Camperos and Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n. From a collaboration with Camila Cabello at a Christmas special in the White House, to the Univisionarios stage on national television and even to this performance with Lupita Infante. Villela has even toured the country and recognizes that this early in his career it is unheard of to do such things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool to be able to say that I am a college student and I am touring the world.\u201d\n\nLike Lupita infante, Marco Villela has put in a lot of effort, sacrifice and commitment to making the best of his career. From being a jazz enthusiast and not thinking of joining a mariachi, to becoming the arranger for the group and composing pieces later interpreted by greats like Chiquis Rivera, Joss Favela and Jose Manuel Figueroa. With such collaborations, the future of Mariachi music will remain in good hands.\n```"}

(AP Photo/John Locher, File)\n\nBy Jonathan Martin November 01, 2022 at 8:55 pm PDT\n\nUSC students are divided over whether they would welcome gambling on sports and other events if California voters pass the long-shot Proposition 27 on November 8. The proposal, which trails in recent polls, permits those over the age of 21, as early as September 2023, to place wagers over the internet and mobile devices for those not on tribal lands. The measure also allows gamblers to bet on non-athletic events such as video game events or award shows.\n\nProp. 27 has become a polarizing issue. Supporters of the measure have raised over $169 million, with notable supporters being two of the biggest sports betting organizations Fanduel Sportsbooks and Draftkings. Opposition to the ballot has raised a total of $214 million, with $91 million coming from the \u201cNo on 27\u2032\u2032 committee.\n\nFor Chas Messman, a 22-year-old specialized journalism graduate student, voting yes on Prop. 27 is \u201can absolute no-brainer.\u201d The prop would permit him to use his phone to bet on USC sports and professional football, baseball and basketball. \u201cIt really adds to the fan experience and it puts a lot more money into sports. And we\u2019re going to see bigger and better things from the leagues themselves with this added money being inflected into the sport,\u201d Messman said.\n\nOther students don\u2019t feel the same excitement about the voting measure and the accessibility to gambling. Zach Coulter, a junior political science major, said he\u2019s against gambling online because it can lead to addiction. \u201cIt kind of ruins lives and it\u2019s probably one of the worst vices,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cI feel like it is incredibly detrimental to the future of children. I think having the ability to gamble potentially your entire life away, just at the tip of your fingertips on your phone\u2014it\u2019s just incredibly irresponsible.\u201d\n\nRafael Cardenas, a 21-year-old junior environmental science major, also sees the measure as a negative because of potential addiction. \u201cYou could lose a lot of money gambling,\u201d Cardenas said. \u201cYeah, you make a lot in the beginning, and then you get a little greedy. And that comes with gambling all the time. Addiction.\u201d\n\nProponents say if Prop. 27 passes, it will also serve as a means to cut down on illegal sports betting already prevalent in the state of California. The majority of the tax revenue from the measure would go to combating homelessness, with the remaining 15% going toward Native American tribes.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore\nNovember 01, 2022 at 8:11 pm PDT\n\nUSC improved its overall record to 7-1 after a thrilling 45-37 victory over Arizona Saturday. Although the offense played a stellar game piling up over 600 yards of total offense, the Trojan defense gave up over 500 yards to the Wildcats. As the Trojans prepare for Saturday\u2019s homecoming matchup against Cal, the focus is on the defensive side of the ball and figuring out what has caused some struggles over the last few games.\n\n\u201cI think our effort is there,\u201d junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu said after practice Tuesday. \u201cSometimes, you want to go so hard, but sometimes you do too much. I think we just have to execute, do our jobs and we\u2019ll be straight.\u201d\n\nAnother big theme for the Trojans\u2019 defensive struggles was complacency. Tuipulotu noticed how, on a few too many occasions, the defense did not play up to its potential against Arizona.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we let up, but it looked like we let up,\u201d Tuipulotu said. \u201cWe just have to keep applying pressure and keep going.\u201d\n\nSenior linebacker Shane Lee also addressed how the defense fared in some of the different schemes used against Arizona. Lee emphasized how the bye week was useful in terms of practicing different schemes.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple of weeks with [the] bye before last week to get some of the stuff installed and work on it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt put a lot of guys in the right places to make some plays.\u201d\n\nLee also spoke about keeping morale high after big plays were given up against Arizona Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s football at the end of the day and both teams are going to make plays,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the game great \u2014 you got great players on both sides.\u201d\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley said after practice that players who have been injured over the last few weeks are on course to return soon, but he didn\u2019t say who will or will not be playing Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing better, and everybody participated but not in a full manner,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe have a lot of guys making a lot of progress and a lot of guys that will be close for the game.\u201d\n\nKey players who did not play against Arizona Saturday due to injury include junior wide receiver Jordan Addison, sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams and sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry.\n\n\u201cMy gut feel is we\u2019ll probably end up getting a few of them back, but maybe not all,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d definitively say anyone\u2019s for sure in and certainly won\u2019t say if anyone\u2019s for sure out right now.\u201d\n\nGetting Addison and Williams back is critical for the Trojans, as Addison is USC\u2019s leading receiver this season with 585 yards and seven touchdowns on the season. Williams is second on the team in receiving yards and touchdowns with 493 yards and four touchdowns. Gentry, a transfer from Arizona State, has proven to be a critical piece to USC\u2019s defense and leads the Trojans with 52 tackles on the season. Gentry also has one sack, one interception and two pass breakups so far for USC.\n\nAs the week progresses, the Trojans will prepare for their homecoming game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against Cal.\n```"}
{"key": "/2022/11/01/california-proposition-28-aims-to-secure-funding-for-arts-education/", "response": "```\nCalifornia Proposition 28 aims to secure funding for arts education\n\nThe proposition is campaigning virtually unopposed ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThousands of teachers rally outside The Broad, a contemporary art museum downtown Los Angeles on Dec. 15, 2018. A ballot measure would require lawmakers to use 1% of all state funding for public schools for music and arts education programs. For schools with 500 or more students, at least 80% of the money must be spent to employ teachers while the rest could be used for training, supplies and education partnerships. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\n\nBy Chris Bibona November 01, 2022 at 6:16 pm PDT\n\nAs of November 8 at 9 p.m. PST, Proposition 28 has passed and will increase spending on arts programs in public schools.\n\nCalifornia voters will have the opportunity to ensure additional funding for arts education in public schools with Proposition 28, one of seven measures on the November 8 ballot. The initiative, intended to preserve arts and music for K-12 education without raising taxes, is expected to provide an additional $1 billion in funding for programs including theater, dance, band and painting, as well as graphic design, computer programming and film.\n\n\u201cEvery human being expresses themselves in some shape or form and we should be lifting up all students to find their voice of expression,\u201d said Anne Fennell, president of the California Music Educators Association. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s in art, maybe it\u2019s in words, maybe it\u2019s in music or movement, but when a human being begins to learn to express who they are through alternative modes, [they] grow their own opportunity of what is possible in their lives.\u201d\n\nThe proposal distributes funding based on a formula. The amount required each year would be 1% of the required state and local funding that public schools received the year before. Hence, with a $102 billion budget for K-12 schools in 2022-23, just over $1 billion would be allocated for Proposition 28 spending in the following fiscal year. That amount is 0.5% of the state\u2019s General Fund budget.\n\nBy reserving a fixed amount of funding, the intention of the measure is to protect art and music education in the event of budget cuts. Historically, these disciplines are reduced ahead of STEM materials, as seen during the Great Recession and COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\nFennell said passing the legislation would mean not only retaining current arts instructors but increasing the amount of credentialed arts educators. Prop 28 also requires 80% of funding that individual schools receive go towards hiring arts-related staff in schools with 500 or more students. The remaining 20% is reserved for training, supplies and other programs.\n\n\u201cWe need teachers that are experienced in an art form to be able to teach it well,\u201d Fennell said. \u201cWe have subject-specific credentials to ensure the highest quality education.\u201d\n\nFurther, Prop 28 will allocate 30% of appropriated funding towards economically disadvantaged pupils. A 2022 survey of arts education in California by SRI Education reported that school leaders found academic barriers such as inadequate funding, materials and facilities more common in majority Asian, Black and Latinx schools than in primarily white schools.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really a history here [in California] of trying to save money on taxes that has really had a disproportionate effect on balanced curriculums in schools,\u201d said Peter Webster, former scholar in residence at USC and professor emeritus from Northwestern University. \u201cFor populations of kids who are in disadvantaged areas in the state, [Prop 28] is going to make a big difference.\u201d\n\nProp 28 is among the most bipartisan measures on the November 8 ballot. In fact, no argument against the measure was submitted on the Official California Voter Information Guide. Los Angeles Times columnist George Skelton called the measure one of the easiest \u201cyes\u201d votes on this year\u2019s ballot, citing a clear educational benefit for young students.\n\nThe Yes on 28 campaign has received support from dozens of celebrities including Lionel Ritchie, Katy Perry, Jason Momoa, Barbra Streisand and Anderson Paak.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s played a significant part in [the campaign] because what we see is these individuals making a living in the creative economy,\u201d Fennell said. \u201cThey have lifted our culture, our state and our nation. They are saying, \u2018Here I am as a living example of what is possible, and that everyone can have this opportunity to discover who they are as an artist.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Yes on 28 political action committee raised about $10.6 million in contributions, according to Ballotpedia. The top donor is Austin Beutner, the former Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent ($4.27 million).\n\nThe editorial boards of The Sacramento Bee, Orange County Register, San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Times have all endorsed Prop 28. Some editorial boards in opposition include the San Diego Union-Tribune, Santa Cruz Sentinel and Mercury News.\n\nArguments range from fiscal irresponsibility amidst economic downturn to notably high per-student expenditures during a low point in student enrollment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer that it\u2019s needed,\u201d Webster said. \u201c[The arts] intend to give much more of a creative outlet for the artistic side of a child\u2019s life, other than the most linear STEM studies. Just talk to people about what the arts do for us \u2014 music around the world. The argument that it shouldn\u2019t be included in schools is often very, very spurious.\u201d\n\nThe in-person voting period is open from now until 8 p.m. Election Day, November 8.

Viewership for this tournament, however, could see an increase because the U.S. is once again competing.\n\nHere on campus, fans can gather and watch the competition with their peers.

Maddy Brown has the details on the incident, reactions to the artist\u2019s death, and his legacy.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, rapper Takeoff was shot and killed outside the 810 Billiards and Bowling Alley in Houston Texas. He was only 28 years old. Takeoff, whose legal name is Kirshnik Khari Ball, was at the bowling alley with his bandmate and uncle, Quavo, as well as 40 to 50 other people who had gathered there for a private party.

Just three years later, the group starting gaining popularity after releasing the hit song \u201cVersace.\u201d The band gained even more recognition in 2016 after releasing \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d although Takeoff was absent from that track. The Migos\u2019 next two albums, Culture and Culture II, both reached number one in the US charts. Together, the group was responsible for multiple top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 such as \u201cMotorSport,\u201d \u201cStir Fry\u201d and \u201cWalk It Talk It.\u201d\n\nDespite their success, the band parted ways earlier this year after Takeoff and Quavo had a disagreement with Offset, citing lack of loyalty as the reason. Takeoff and Quavo then formed the duo Unc and Phew and released the album Only Built for Infinity Links on October 7th. The new album reached number seven in the US charts last month.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Maddy Brown.\n```"}

Takeoff, 28, and his uncle and fellow group member, Quavo, were playing a game of dice. Takeoff was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia. He was raised by his mother, alongside his family and group members, Quavo and Offset. The group formed in 2008 under the stage name Polo Club but later changed their name to Migos.\n\nMigos took the hip-hop world by storm in 2013 with their hit song \u201cVersace,\u201d which caught the attention of rapper Drake. Drake and Migos would later go on to collaborate on songs like \u201cHaving Our Way\u201d and \u201cWalk It Like I Talk It.\u201d\n\nChadwick Hemus, co-owner of The Record Parlour in Hollywood, met the group when Beats by Dre hosted a pop-up event in 2018. Hemus said Takeoff\u2019s death leaves a big void. \u201cHe\u2019s one-third of the act, so I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be doing, but it\u2019s going to make a big difference for them,\u201d Hemus said. \u201cUnfortunately, I think there\u2019s always been an element of tension and violence that has run throughout the underbelly of the music industry.\u201d\n\nTakeoff\u2019s death is the latest in the string of rappers who have died from gun violence. In September, rapper PnB Rock was shot and killed by a father-son duo. Other high-profile rappers who have suffered the same fate include Young Dolph, who was fatally shot in Memphis, and Grammy award winner, Nipsey Hussle, who was fatally shot in Los Angeles in 2019.\n\nSome fans believe lyrics can contribute to how people view rappers in real life. \u201cWe all know that our words mean a lot, and I think when you are rapping about your death and rapping about people hating on you and looking for you and wanting to kill you, I feel like you create that energy and that frequency,\u201d said Jeris Dupree, a fan of the group since 2013. \u201cFlossing is just a thing that people do in rap music and all over the world, but in rap music, it\u2019s highlighted. We live in a society where people want what you have.\u201d\n\nDupree said he hopes to see an embrace of positivity through music, instead of lyrics that mirror negative thoughts and actions. \u201cThe other point, too, is spreading high frequencies through our music,\u201d Dupree said. \u201cAlso rapping about more positive things so we\u2019re not always thinking about guns and negative connotations that spread rampant through our communities. Just changing the frequency and the way people are thinking and spreading more love and positivity will help people get away from negative thoughts and actions.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Jeremy Kole and Marco Ramirez\nNovember 01, 2022 at 5:33 pm PDT\n\nEver dreamed of getting that famed blue checkmark next to your Twitter handle? Soon you\u2019ll be able to ... for a small fee. Jeremy Kole has the scoop. Twitter\u2019s new verification policy has social media up in arms. Today, Elon Musk unexpectedly announced the new verification subscription will cost $8 a month by tweeting a meme of himself sporting his devilish red and black leather armor Halloween costume.\n\nInitial reports indicated that Musk would charge $20 a month for a blue checkmark, sparking outrage amongst celebrities, athletes, and journalists, including Stephen King, who tweeted: Stephen King: $20 a month to keep my blue check? F**k that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I\u2019m gone like Enron.\n\nIn response, Musk attributed the price hike to paying the bills, saying that Twitter cannot solely rely on advertisers for money. But the $20 price tag is no more. Today, Musk tweeted: Elon Musk: Twitter\u2019s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn\u2019t have a blue checkmark is bullshit. Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.\n\nTwitter will now package verification alongside their current subscription Twitter Blue, which gives users access to premium features to customize their Twitter experience. The new Twitter Blue will now offer a variety of benefits, including the ability to post long video & audio clips and half as many ads.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Musk wants to make more money, but this new approach is cause for concern. Verification has always been viewed as a sign of authenticity and legitimacy, but now anyone with $8 can earn the fabled blue checkmark.\n\nKREM 2 News Reporter Nathan Hyun went through a three month process to earn verification, and was ecstatic to see he was approved. For Hyun, the blue checkmark conveyed that people could trust him. But Hyun is unhappy with the change to a subscription based verification model.\n\nNathan Hyun: For journalists like myself and for other reporters, the reason why we why verification matters to us is because that\u2019s how people know we\u2019re authentic and we\u2019re real. And now average people, the everyday people can get a checkmark and really puts down it really puts down the trust trustworthiness of how much people can believe us in our reporting.\n\nHyun is unsure if he will pay for his checkmark, and doesn\u2019t understand why he needs to pay for people to trust him.\n\nNathan Hyun: I just know if I lose the verification, I think people are going to trust me less.\n\nTwitter introduced the verification system in 2009, to increase trust in the social network. Ironically, Musk\u2019s new change appears like it will only increase distrust.\n```"}

(Courtesy of AP Photo/Marshall Ritzel)\n\nBy Shreya Agrawal November 01, 2022 at 3:10 pm PDT\n\nFlavored tobacco products are all the rage amongst young people. In fact, recent studies show more than two million kids from middle school through high school in California currently use e-cigarettes. And eighty percent of those kids started out with a flavored tobacco product.\n\nDarcie Green is the executive director of Latinas Contra Cancer. She says flavored tobacco products specifically target children.\n\nDarcie Green: \u201cI participated in a press conference a few weeks ago for Yes on Prop 31, and one of the panelists in the press conference, he said, \u2018You know, we don\u2019t need pi\u00f1a colada, or horchata flavored tobacco any more than we need pi\u00f1a colada or horchata flavored cleaning supplies.\u2019\u201d\n\nKelly Hardy: \u201cYouth use of tobacco in California was really going in the right direction, was decreasing, and then we saw just a surge in vaping, and especially vaping these flavored products, that more youth were starting, were becoming addicted to tobacco again.\u201d\n\nKelly Hardy agrees. She\u2019s a senior managing director at Children Now in LA.\n\nKelly Hardy: \u201cBig tobacco companies do target youth, and especially youth of color, and try to get them hooked on the product that is going, that they can be addicted to for the rest of their life, and it shortens the lives, especially of black and brown folks.\u201d\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t the first time tobacco companies have marketed to communities of color. Since the 1950s, tobacco companies specifically marketed menthol cigarettes in black communities.\n\nDoctor Phillip Gardiner is the co-chair for the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council. For the past twenty years, he\u2019s been trying to get menthol cigarettes off the market, for good.\n\nDoctor Phillip Gardiner: \u201cWe already knew then that menthol was the main killer of African Americans, had been for decades, remains so today. When you look at it, the main killers\u2013\u2013heart attacks, strokes, and cerebral vascular disease are brought about by smoking, and the main thing that is the vector into our community have been menthol cigarettes. There are more promotions and advertisements in our community, they are more, they are cheaper in our community. We actually have data that shows this.\u201d\n\nDoctor Gardiner says, after World War Two, many companies in the U.S. started making special food products and care products aimed at the Black community, including menthol cigarettes.\n\nDoctor Phillip Gardiner: \u201cIt became clear that possibly there would be a market where you could particularize different smokes for different folks. Brown and Williamson in the 1950s, in the late 1950s, held a series of focus groups among black and white smokers that found that advertising for menthol cigarettes resonated greater with African Americans, to which they put a good ninety percent of their budget, to television advertising.\u201d\n\nIn 1950, less than ten percent of black smokers used menthol cigarettes. But today, more than eighty five percent do.\n\nDoctor Phillip Gardiner: \u201cThe tobacco industry is showing black faces on TV smiling, smoking menthol cigarettes, smoking cool cigarettes and stuff like this. You can see that this was something that the tobacco industry, this was a way to make money off the lives of black people, and it works so effectively that they kept doing it.\u201d\n\nOpponents of Prop 31 say there are problems with the measure. Beth Miller is a spokesperson for the No on Prop 31 campaign. She sent us a statement that said the politicians who wrote Prop 31 say it will reduce underage tobacco use, but it\u2019s already illegal to sell any tobacco products to anyone under the age of 21 in California.\n\nShe went on to say the ban would impose a total prohibition on products that millions of adults choose to use, and, would ban the sale of many FDA-authorized alternatives for adult cigarette smokers, which would cause serious and lasting damage to tobacco harm reduction goals.\n\nMiller also says it will increase crime and expand illegal markets.\n\nBut Doctor Gardiner disagrees.\n\nDoctor Phillip Gardiner: \u201cMenthol cigarettes and flavored cigarettes have been banned in many cities throughout California and around the country. No illicit market has arisen, none. People keep talking about that, but that has not arisen in Canada, which outlawed it nationally, and in all its provinces, starting in 2018 and I think, culminating in 2020.\u201d\n\nDarcie Green thinks the failure to ban flavored tobacco products can seriously risk the lives of kids.\n\nDarcie Green: \u201cWe, as adults have choices, right? We can drive to other communities, right? We can order things online. We have choices. Children have the choices we put in front of them.\u201d\n```"}

Experts and students speak on their expectations and experience.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping at an event to introduce the new members of the Politburo Standing Committee on Oct. 23. (Photo courtesy of Andy Wong for AP News)\n\nBy Ethan Huang November 01, 2022 at 3:05 pm PDT\n\nXi Jinping began his unprecedented third term as the president of the People\u2019s Republic of China this past week after announcing his reinstatement at the five-yearly Communist Party congress. While it may sound like \u201cmore of the usual\u201d going forward, there is a question as to what this third term means for the future of the country and its people.\n\nJinping abolished term limits in 2018, which led many people in China and around the world to believe that the president would stay in power for a third term. \u201cThe fact that he extended his presidency to a third term is really not a surprise to me,\u201d said \u201cM,\u201d a student in Hong Kong who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cThe reason why he extended [the presidency] while he was president was because he wanted to continue being president.\u201d\n\nWith this new term, Jinping seems focused on surrounding himself with loyalists who do not question his decisions. This was even the speculated reason for why former president Hu Jintao was escorted out of the closing ceremony of the Communist Party congress in a dramatic unscripted moment.\n\n\u201cWell, the standard interpretation has been that Xi Jinping has packed the standing committee of the Politburo with loyalists to him,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Southern California. \u201cThose people who did not come up with him and haven\u2019t worked with him previously and that he didn\u2019t think were really 100% of his team, even though they claimed allegiance to Xi Jinping... they\u2019ve all been eliminated.\u201d\n\nPeople from China recognize this as well, and feel a dangerous omen for the country moving forward. \u201cI feel like one thing is that definitely overall it is not good for the country or good for the people,\u201d said \u201cD,\u201d a student who was born in Beijing, but is currently studying at USC. \u201cI know that there are seven people in the highest power in the country and he appointed all of them... It makes it easier for him and it gives him more control with what he wants to do with the country.\u201d\n\nIn looking into the future, the question begs what Jinping plans to do next, not only within China, but internationally as well. With the \u201czero-Covid\u201d policy still in place, lockdowns continue, closing borders even to citizens and establishing strict quarantine measures for positive testers along with anyone that may have been exposed.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to test positive to go to quarantine, and I think that says a lot about what he wants to do,\u201d said \u201cD.\u201d \u201cBefore the National Congress of the Communist Party last week, my mom went on a business trip to another province. Her \u2018health code\u2019 turned red when she was preparing to fly back to Beijing for the mere reason that she was in another province and that the National Congress was going to start soon back in Beijing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other controversial issues including the Uyghur genocide, the National Security Law that placed Hong Kong under mainland jurisdiction and the growing tensions with Taiwan plague the country. \u201cXinjiang and the Tibet issues and the Hong Kong and Taiwan issues... I think he\u2019s trying to gain control over Hong Kong and Taiwan again and he\u2019s trying to eliminate people who are not ethnically Han,\u201d said \u201cD.\u201d\n\nNow, with the increased pressure after United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan, the stakes for a potential takeover of Taiwan hang in the balance. \u201cThey also realize it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult because such a high percentage of people in Taiwan consider themselves Taiwanese and not even Chinese,\u201d said Rosen. \u201cThe United States is more and more moving toward almost a de facto recognition, without saying it, of Taiwan as a separate entity, a separate country.\u201d\n\nAt the congress, Jinping was met with thunderous applause after declaring that China would \u201cstrive for peaceful reunification,\u201d but that it would \u201cnever promise to renounce the use of force.\u201d The congress and the third term sparked rare demonstrations in the mainland, as some people hung banners in protest with handwritten messages like \u201cSay no to Covid test, yes to food. No to lockdown, yes to freedom. No to lies, yes to dignity. No to cultural revolution, yes to reform. No to great leader, yes to vote. Don\u2019t be a slave, be a citizen.\u201d Another even read, \u201cGo on strike, remove dictator and national traitor Xi Jinping.\u201d\n\n\u201cM\u201d cited these demonstrations saying, \u201cThat was a really iconic moment and I was really moved by this.\u201d For her, having studied abroad as an international student has allowed her to reflect on the state of her country. She said that while people still like their country, the notion of nationalism did not really come to the forefront until Jinping\u2019s presidency. Having grown up in an educational system that taught children to recite \u201csocialist values,\u201d \u201cM\u201d felt that being a nationalist is a necessity for one to live a normal life.\n\n\u201cIt was not a question to consider, we were told that we have to like the country... you don\u2019t need a reason, you just need to love it,\u201d \u201cM\u201d said. \u201c[The people] really forgot what it\u2019s like to really have a voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cM\u201d said that she has seen the opportunity people have to freely discuss social topics and criticize the government in the United States without being labeled. She cites how witnessing students discuss social issues ranging from LAPD or the privatization of jails has shifted her point of view on her freedom of speech and the media.\n\n\u201cI no longer feel afraid of speaking [Jinping]\u2019s name,\u201d said \u201cM.\u201d \u201cWhen western media reports on China, some things get distorted because it\u2019s based on stereotypes... but at least we have a channel for free speech.\u201d\n\nAs Jinping\u2019s third term begins, citizens of the country and the world wait in cautious and growing nervous anticipation as to what is next on the horizon.\n```"}

Fans of Styles are known for going the extra mile for their concert looks \u2013 the question is why, how and when did this trend begin, and how has it redefined this new era of concerts?\n\nArguably, the most defining element of \u201cHarry Styles-esque fashion\u201d is the feather boa. This specific trend began with Styles\u2019 opening performance at the 2021 Grammy Awards, where he performed his hit song \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d whilst dressed in all-black leather, adorned by a green feather boa. The immediate inception of the boa craze began following the fandom\u2019s obsession with this outfit.\n\nOnce the \u201cLove on Tour\u201d began, fans all over social media started using the hashtags #HSLOTfashion and #HSLOToutfit to begin planning out their outfits months in advance. TikTok users spread the message about the loud and bold fashion trends that men and women alike could participate in, showcasing different styles one could wear and highlighting stores to make purchases from.\n\nNew trends were born with the additional leg of the tour: mimicking Styles\u2019 best and most popular outfits. His iconic \u201cFine Line\u201d album cover, complete with a long sleeve hot pink button-up and white slacks, accompanied by suspenders, became a viral outfit that many fans copied.\n\nAs the tour progressed, people became more creative with their do-it-yourself costumes. In the most recent leg of the tour, Styles has been doing \u201cresidencies\u201d in major cities, like his 15 nights in New York City and Los Angeles. This year, \u201cHarryween,\u201d Styles\u2019 Halloween concert, fell during his time in L.A. For this show, Styles, his band and, of course, the audience will all be in costume.\n\nFans started placing their bets on what Styles will be dressed as days before the show. Some guesses included Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas and Cruella DeVille and the Dalmations, among others. Styles and his crew ultimately went as Danny Zuko and the Pink Ladies from Grease.\n\nWith these trends and their explosion on social media, Harry Styles concerts have become fashion shows that reveal deeper insights on the emergence of a new era of concert fashion and Harry Styles-esque fashion.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with fans at some of Styles\u2019 most recent L.A. shows and concluded that fans spent anywhere between $50 and $300 on their outfits. Fans all had different accounts of how much time and money they spent on their fits and what dressing up for the shows meant to them.\n\n\u201cHarry Styles fashion is, in fact, a lifestyle that I like to live by. It cures my depression, really. It makes me have something to look forward to every year,\u201d said Pamela Wagner, who was in attendance at the first night of shows in L.A.\n\n\u201cI spent about three months planning my outfit,\u201d said Kaily Gutierrez, a Harry Styles fan and fellow Night One attendee. \u201cIt meant a lot to look good because I love Harry Styles and I\u2019ve always loved Harry Styles since One Direction.\u201d\n\nWe can find the influence of Styles\u2019 music everywhere, including on campus here at USC. Mariam Bagdady, a junior majoring in journalism, will be attending five of 15 shows in the L.A. \u201cLove on Tour\u201d residency.\n\n\u201cHaving a good outfit was extremely important to me. Harry has an eccentric way of dressing and he\u2019s known for making statements with his fashion choices,\u201d Bagdady said. \u201cHis shows have essentially become a gala of fans showcasing their best creations, and that\u2019s what concerts should be all about.\u201d\n\nTo many, defining what Styles-esque fashion means to them is incredibly important. It has transformed \u201cjust a concert outfit\u201d into a form of self-expression for many including Bagdady and concert attendee Mia McClellan, both of whom were in attendance at L.A. Night One.\n\n\u201cHe honestly inspires me to go outside of my comfort zone and express myself in any way I want without feeling embarrassed about how I want to express myself,\u201d McClellan said.\n\nWhen defining what this new \u201cStyle\u201d meant to her, Bagdady said, \u201cHarry fashion is being as camp as possible. It\u2019s the decision to step out of boundaries and include as many patterns, feathers and pearls as possible. But it\u2019s also the choice of creating a fit that is entirely you. It\u2019s stepping out as authentically yourself as possible. It\u2019s a Met Gala without the insane price tag.\u201d\n```"}

In 2021 alone, Americans spent more than $105 billion on lottery tickets, with a majority of ticket purchasers falling between the ages of 18 and 40, according to a study by the Journal of Gambling Studies.\n\nTeya Hisel, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, thinks Americans\u2019 obsession with the lottery reveals a deeper issue: how we view money.\n\n\u201cI think [lottery tickets] continue to perpetuate the American idea that you\u2019re one paycheck away from having the big bucks,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of us are one or two paychecks away from being housing insecure, from being low income, from having our basic needs met.\u201d\n\nLauren Schulson, a junior double majoring in health and human sciences and psychology, thinks otherwise. Her great-grandfather had won $4 million in a lottery and used it to buy a house for his family and pay for the treatment of Schulson\u2019s grandmother when she was sick.\n\n\u201cI really do think that the lottery is a great opportunity to change ordinary people\u2019s lives,\u201d Schulson said.\n```"}

O\u2019Farrell and Soto-Mart\u00ednez represent two distinct sides of Los Angeles: the Angelenos who are struggling to afford gentrifying neighborhoods and fighting for an equitable city and those who have the means to afford the unaffordable rent, who want to push out unhoused people from sight.\n\nIn the race for District 13, Angelenos have made clear that O\u2019Farrell represents the latter, and Hugo represents the former. This upcoming election will show which class will turn their envisioned Los Angeles into a reality.\n\nOn March 24, 2021, at the behest of O\u2019Farrell, about 400 officers from the Los Angeles Police Department entered Echo Park to forcibly displace and remove over 180 unhoused Angelenos and their allies. Activists and unhoused folks were occupying the park to protest against the housing crisis and rising rent. O\u2019Farrell called the clearing a success. He ordered that the unhoused folks be put into temporary transitional housing through projects Roomkey hotel rooms, Project Homekey sites and A Bridge Home shelters.\n\nCommunity members, along with Soto-Martinez, opposed the forcible removal of the unhoused individuals, claiming that the park had been turned into a much-needed safe haven. Soto-Martinez questioned what would happen once their stay at the temporary housing services were up.\n\nThe clearing of the encampment was followed by a $500,000 renovation and repair project of the park, making the area more appealing for local residents.\n\nThe clearing of Echo Park is a microcosm for the stances of O\u2019Farrell and Soto-Martinez. O\u2019Farrell views the solutions to homelessness as a quick move from street homelessness into an expanding shelter system. The focus is to decrease the plight and sight of homelessness across his district and Los Angeles in general.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Echo Park raid, O\u2019Farrell stated, \u201cWe returned the crown jewel of the park system to the community for everyone, housed or unhoused, to enjoy. That\u2019s what parks are for.\u201d\n\nIn regard to homelessness policy, O\u2019Farrell attempted to ban free meals for the people experiencing homelessness at Echo Park and accomplished a ban on overnight RV parking in the Media District. He also supported the displacement of tenants in Hollywood in favor of a hotel.\n\nWith a year-over-year increase of 22% in the homelessness population in his district, the council member\u2019s own record on homelessness has not proven to focus on the quick transition of giving affordable housing to those on the street. Rather, it follows the city\u2019s track record of criminalizing homelessness rather than ending the crisis.\n\nSoto-Martinez has pushed back against the housing policies of O\u2019Farrell, which are consistent with making the city look more enticing to developers and high-income residents. Soto-Martinez is running on monumentally increasing the affordable housing stock and has criticized O\u2019Farrell for only allocating a minuscule percentage of new units to be affordable.\n\nUnder the proposed policy of Soto-Martinez, the city would convert hotels, office space, retail space, and underutilized public property into affordable housing. His policy would also focus on expanding successful programs that produce affordable housing and require new development set aside a larger portion of new units for lower-income residents.\n\nThe homelessness and housing policies of Soto-Martinez are focused on rapid transition of people experiencing homelessness into permanent housing. On Soto-Martinez\u2019s website, he states, \u201cAs I lay out in my housing policy, we need to go farther and faster on social housing, community land trusts and other underexplored housing options.\u201d\n\nAs opposed to Council member O\u2019Farrell\u2019s approach to making homelessness illegal in public spaces and using the police as a means to force people experiencing homelessness into temporary shelters that, according to Soto-Martinez, are not real solutions to the crisis L.A. faces.\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council District 13 race represents a larger issue of two contentions in L.A.: the desires of developers to build luxury housing for high-income residents versus of vulnerable residents who want a home.\n\nThis article is part of a series about Los Angeles housing issues and solutions.

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Irene Kim, Chris Ajose-Nixon, MJ Newsom, and Logan Drone\nOctober 31, 2022 at 8:34 pm PDT\n\nAs turnout for the November 8 general municipal election is expected to hit an all-time high, local and out-of-state USC students share mixed perspectives on voting for upcoming elections. In California, voters have the option to vote in-person at a voting center or receive a Vote-By-Mail, or VBM, ballot. California Election Law allows a voter to conditionally register and cast a ballot through the Conditional Voter Registration, or CVR, even if they are not yet registered. They will then be able to vote in any future election once their registration becomes active.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a top issue on the ballot is the homelessness crisis. Nikki Hagigat, a senior and health and human sciences major, is eager to vote for this reason in particular. \u201cI feel very strongly about trying to elect someone that will solve the homeless crisis in a healthier, more justifiable way,\u201d said Hagigat, a California resident.\n\nRick Caruso and Karen Bass, both of whom have strong ties to USC, are the two mayoral candidates tackling this issue in what is shaping up to be a tight race. Brianna Sanchez, a freshman majoring in legal studies and political science and California resident, said she registered to vote for this upcoming election to fulfill her civic duty. \u201cVoting is a privilege. My parents are immigrants, so they didn\u2019t have that chance to vote when they first came here,\u201d said Sanchez. \u201cSo now, I want to make sure that I use that ability to use my voice.\u201d\n\nHowever, California resident Daniel Annune, a sophomore majoring in business administration and computer science, said preparation was important before voting in the upcoming election. \u201cI\u2019m not very knowledgeable about the current state of politics and what my choice would be and who I would have or should pick,\u201d said Annune. \u201cSo before I make a decision in voting, I have to do a lot more research.\u201d\n\nFor the roughly 50% of USC students who are out-of-state residents, it is common to vote through absentee ballots. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many states have advocated for mail-in voting. \u201cI think they are an important piece of voting that allows people, especially college students who are outside of their home state, to still have an influence on their elections,\u201d said freshman Dominic Mendoza, a jazz studies major from Washington. Mendoza is planning on voting absentee in his hometown county.\n\nWith the midterm elections about a week out, students like Flavia Delle Femine, a junior studying at the Thornton School of Music, are aware of the engagement necessary to make change in their communities. \u201cFor people like myself who are young voters, who are really important for elections, voting gives them a chance to participate even when they aren\u2019t near their hometown,\u201d said Femine. \u201cWhether you are overseas or across the country, you can still vote and participate \u2014 so please, vote!\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Philip Salata)\n\nBy Vani Sanganeria October 31, 2022 at 8:07 pm PDT\n\nJournalist Cerise Castle was covering protests in response to George Floyd\u2019s murder for a local radio station in 2020 when a Los Angeles Police Department officer shot her with a rubber bullet. She was left with a severe leg injury and a doctor\u2019s mandate to leave the field for six months of bed rest.\n\n\u201cIn that moment, as a Black woman in journalism,\u201d said Castle, \u201cI just did not feel comfortable sitting down and being still.\u201d Days after she was shot, Castle read about an 18-year-old security guard who was killed in Gardena by two L.A. sheriff deputies as part of an initiation into a deputy gang in the Los Angeles Sheriff Department.\n\n\u201cI needed to meet the moment here and start investigating,\u201d she said. On June 27, the International Women\u2019s Media Foundation awarded Castle the 2022 Courage in Journalism Award for \u201cA Tradition of Violence,\u201d a 15-part investigative series she developed during her six-month recovery. The report exposed 18 deputy gangs, 19 documented murders \u2014 all of whom were of people of color \u2014 and over $100 million dollars in paid lawsuits by the LASD as of March 2021.\n\nA year later, the Los Angeles County Civilian Oversight Commission launched a formal investigation into deputy gangs as a result of Castle\u2019s investigation. Castle joined USC Annenberg Dean Willow Bay, 2022 IWMF Gwen Ifiil award winner Mc Nelly Torres and IWMF Executive Director Elisa Lees Mu\u00f1oz in conversation with USC students and faculty Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe IWMF first created the Courage in Journalism Awards to give global recognition to the bravery of women journalists covering the post-Soviet Union [era],\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cWhich, as we have found over the years, actually does give them a mantle of protection. When they go back home and they are an internationally recognized journalist, it\u2019s a little bit harder to attack them and imprison them.\u201d\n\nThe safety of women and non-binary journalists in both newsroom and state politics, Mu\u00f1oz said, has become the IWMF\u2019s priority since its founding in the 1990s. The organization provides resources, training and assistance to female and non-binary journalists for issues such as sexual harassment, digital doxxing, government oppression and censorship, unequal pay and attacks on press freedom, according to its website.\n\n\u201cThis award represents [Gwen Ifil\u2019s] spirit,\u201d said Torres. Ifil was an American journalist, author and television newscaster who became the first Black woman to host a nationally televised news program with Washington Week in Review in 1999. \u201cWe have that in common \u2014 doing this job with integrity and love. We do this because we love it, because the job doesn\u2019t love us,\u201d Torres said.\n\nTorres is an editor at the Center for Public Integrity, where she manages a team of reporters investigating issues of inequality. She worked as an investigative producer for NBC6 in Miami and co-founded the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting in 2010. She was also the first Latina to be elected to the Investigative Reporters and Editors\u2019 Board where she served from 2008 to 2014.\n\n\u201cMc Nelly has been a powerful proponent of journalists of color in the newsroom, and we\u2019re proud to honor that work with this award,\u201d Elisa Mu\u00f1oz said in a September 8 announcement of Torres\u2019 award. \u201cShe\u2019s not only broken barriers for Latinas in investigative journalism, but she continues to reach back and lift up young journalists as a mentor and leader in her field.\u201d\n\nTorres also covered education for the San Antonio Express-News, where her investigation into a San Antonio school board contributed to the conviction of a school building architect accused of bribery. She said she was regularly harassed by the architect, who sent her multiple letters threatening legal action against her.\n\n\u201cBy the time I finished my reporting, [he] was headed to prison,\u201d Torres said. Castle, a lifelong Angeleno who grew up in the Black and brown neighborhoods patrolled by the LASD, said she was forced into hiding at an undisclosed location for two weeks after her report was published.\n\nUnder the advice of the IWMF and nonprofit publication Knock LA, Castle said she could not use her cell phone or access the internet due to the LASD\u2019s surveillance technology. \u201cI worry about having my office raided and hard drives taken,\u201d said Castle. \u201c[LASD] even tried to subpoena me in several proceedings asking for all of my notes, my computers, my cellphones.\u201d\n\nOn September 14, the LASD raided the homes of L.A. County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl and L.A. County Civilian Oversight Commissioner Patricia Giggans, two prominent critics of L.A. Sheriff Alex Villanueva. On September 22, a judge ordered the LASD to turn over seized items to the California Attorney General\u2019s Office following concerns that the raid was politically motivated by Villanueva.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that the sheriff department has a team of people that monitor my every move online,\u201d said Castle. \u201cI know that I\u2019ve been followed at certain points.\u201d Castle is the only freelance journalist among a few reporters covering the LASD, all of whom are also women, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all under investigation by the sheriff\u2019s department,\u201d said Castle. \u201c[Working] freelance has resulted in me just being banned outright from entering some government buildings. [LASD] even tried to arrest me a couple of times a day for that.\u201d\n\nAs a Black and queer journalist, Castle said the rampant bigotry of the industry also barred her from entering buildings she worked in. On her first day at local radio station KCRW, Castle said a colleague verbally assaulted and interrogated her about entering the building.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018You don\u2019t look like someone who would work here,\u2019\u201d said Castle. \u201cAnd I had that interaction repeated at minimum once a week. Sometimes there were employees who would take it upon themselves to physically prevent me from entering the building.\u201d\n\nCastle accepted a buyout and left KCRW in February 2021, detailing the various racist and homophobic microaggressions she experienced there in a Twitter statement. In her conversation with USC students, she recalled colleagues regularly confusing her for the only other Black woman at the office who was a foot shorter than her, had different colored eyes and worked in a different department.\n\n\u201c[Colleagues] would tell me I sound like a gangster,\u201d said Castle. \u201cThey said, \u2018You sound like someone from the streets.\u2019\u201d Torres said she left NBC for similar reasons. She recalled her manager frequently ridiculing her accent in front of the entire newsroom and taunting her to \u201cjust speak English.\u201d\n\nWhile reporting on police in Oklahoma, she remembered a colleague remarking that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like a cop reporter.\u201d \u201cThis is a very racist industry,\u201d said Torres. \u201cAnd now that I\u2019m an editor in a newsroom I started last year, I\u2019m not going to sit down and allow anybody to come and attack my reporters who are people of color.\u201d\n\nCastle said she wishes her journalism professors at Emerson College warned her about the risks of being a journalist. It wouldn\u2019t have changed her choice of career, she said, but rather prepared her to prioritize her mental health.\n\n\u201cAfter I spoke out, I heard from all kinds of people, like Asian reporters, even men, whose experiences in other newsrooms mirrored my story,\u201d Castle said. \u201cBefore I opened my mouth, I was a husk of a person,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was hard for me. I have depression, and unfortunately, that is not a unique experience in this industry.\u201d\n\nAn attendee at the event asked Castle and Torres why newsrooms don\u2019t provide post-traumatic stress disorder counseling to journalists the way governments do for police officers \u2014 another profession exposed to trauma and aggression.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a cultural problem,\u201d said Torres. \u201cI had to be tough because I was always competing.\u201d Torres recalled her first time covering an execution. She said her manager asked her if she was OK, to which she felt obliged to respond with a simple and straightforward, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nIn Torres\u2019 current newsroom, employees now have access to resources for talk therapy and a culture that values mental wellbeing, she said. \u201cWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned, we said, \u2018If you need to take a day off, take time off, you need to walk away, do it. ... When you\u2019re a leader, you have that power to make a change.\u201d\n\nWhen a group of anti-vaxxers doxed and leaked private information of an employee covering the COVID-19 vaccine, Torres said she used the digital safety and mental health resources provided by the IWMF to protect her.\n\n\u201cHer address was posted on InfoWars for a couple of hours. She was harassed and got voicemails threatening to kill her and her children. It was just horrendous,\u201d Torres said.\n\nThe IWMF website has an online violence response hub that provides safety protocols to journalists covering stories with significant backlash. Mu\u00f1oz encouraged students to institute digital privacy measures before it could be too late, pointing to services such as DeleteMe that erase all private information from the internet.\n\n\u201cOnline violence is leading to so many women and girls of color leaving the profession, but also some extreme amounts of self-censorship,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cNot just in what you write but in whether or not you decide to take up a story that is going to lead to tremendous backlash.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Villanueva threatened to post Castle\u2019s home address online, which prompted her to move to a new place. \u201cI\u2019m constantly thinking about my digital security,\u201d said Castle. \u201cThat means using a [virtual private network] any time I go online. Everything I write digitally is encrypted. I never write a source\u2019s real name anywhere. I backup everything to the cloud, with multiple hard drives for a select group of folks. They keep that in a secure location from the safe that I use for my hard drives and SD cards.\u201d\n\nAs a millennial, stepping away from social media has also been a challenge, said Castle. \u201cThere was a deputy gang member that went after my makeup artist after I posted her on my Instagram,\u201d said Castle. \u201cI had to stop posting personal stuff online because it led to threats against my family members and friends.\u201d\n\nWhen a student asked Castle what keeps her going, she accredited her motivation to internal outrage and external impact.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a time of climate disaster. We are in the midst of a multi-year pandemic. We are seeing a rise in hate and white supremacy. All of those things are very present in my mind at any given moment,\u201d said Castle. \u201cIt breaks my heart to hear my grandmother tell me, \u2018Things are worse for you today than it was for me at your age.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut moments of validation and impact make the challenge worth it, Castle said. She recalled a student\u2019s email about Castle\u2019s reporting on misconduct by a high school principal. The student thanked her for relieving years of emotional weight and self-doubt rooted in the principal\u2019s abuse.\n\nAfter her deputy gang report was released, Castle remembered her awe at seeing \u201cGoogle LASD Gangs\u201d spray painted in large letters across the L.A. Hall of Justice Building.\n\n\u201cI can sleep well at night knowing I\u2019m doing truly everything I can to fix all of these fires that are blazing so strongly at this time,\u201d she said.\n\nTorres said letters and emails of gratitude from strangers reinforce her sense of responsibility as a journalist. She remembered covering a sexual assault case involving a stepfather accused of abusing three young girls. For months, Torres said she fought off harassment from the defendant and their relatives. She was almost taken off the case after a heated argument with the judge.\n\n\u201cOn the last day of the trial, I got into the elevator to go to the courtroom. The kids were in there,\u201d said Torres. \u201cOne of the girls looked at me and she said, \u2018Miss Torres, I want to thank you for how you have treated this case with integrity.\u2019 And then she gave me a hug.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but no Pulitzer can beat that,\u201d said Torres. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d```"}

Democrats denounced Rick Caruso\u2019s party affiliation change from independent to Democrat ahead of the midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just change your party registration, change your viewpoints and spend tens of millions of dollars trying to convince people that you\u2019re somebody you\u2019re not. If you lie about who you are, if you lie about who other people are, how could you possibly bring the city together to meet the needs that we have in Los Angeles right now?\u201d said Bass, flanked by a group of Democratic officials during a press conference at her campaign headquarters.\n\nBass\u2019 statements come two days after being endorsed by former president Barack Obama. Caruso\u2019s long history of changing party affiliations began in 2011 when he switched from Republican to \u201cdecline to state,\u201d according to public records. He then re-registered as a Republican in 2016 and switched to independent in 2019.\n\nIn the last 60 years, Angelenos have voted in a Republican mayor only twice, both terms being served by Richard J. Riordan. Caruso registered as a Democrat three weeks before filing to run in the 2022 mayoral election.\n\n\u201cRick Caruso is lying to Angelenos,\u201d said Korean American Democratic Committee President Steve Kang. \u201cHe\u2019s been a Republican nearly his entire life, supporting far right extremists worth millions of dollars. He\u2019s only been a Democrat in the last year, and he did it so that he could trick voters into thinking he\u2019s something that he is not.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his voter registration changes in June, Caruso said, \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat, and I\u2019m proud to be a Democrat. What fascinates me is that we\u2019re even having this conversation because the electorate, the voters in the city don\u2019t care about this. What the voters of the city care about is crime and homelessness and corruption.\u201d\n\nL.A. County Democratic Party Chair Mark Gonzalez also spoke out against Caruso at Monday\u2019s press conference, specifically citing mailers he received about Caruso\u2019s endorsements by other Democrats.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be abundantly clear: Rick Caruso is not endorsed by the Democratic Party. Karen Bass is the only real pro-choice Democrat, which is why President Barack Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders, President Biden and Vice President Harris have endorsed the only Democrat in this race,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nUnlike other states, California allows Democrats to run against Democrats because of its top-two open primary system. This allows the two top candidates in the primary, regardless of affiliation, to face off in the general election.\n\nBass\u2019 criticisms of the real estate tycoon range from his failures to rectify the homeless crisis in L.A. and his use of personal funds on political advertising. In response to a question by Annenberg Media, Bass said, \u201cMy message to Rick Caruso is, number one, he shouldn\u2019t lie. $100 million could have better been spent helping people. Please tell me why you\u2019ve never built one unit of affordable housing, nor did you ever allow any affordable housing in the development you have built.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nBy Anthony Slade, Kimberly Aguirre, Vincent Demonte, and Dana Hammerstrom\nOctober 31, 2022, at 6:43 pm PDT\n\nNext Tuesday, the California midterm elections will give voters the chance to weigh in on seven propositions addressing issues ranging from reproductive rights to flavored tobacco products. Here is a rundown of the measures up for consideration and what they mean for California residents.\n\nProp 1: Abortion\nProp 1 will ask California voters whether or not the state should codify abortion rights into the California State Constitution. A \u201cyes\u201d vote supports the amendment to cement abortion into the state constitution, disallowing the state to interfere with a woman\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion. A \u201cno\u201d vote opposes abortion\u2019s codification in the state constitution, leaving reproductive rights up to existing laws and statutes.\n\nThe Democratic Party, Peace and Freedom Party, as well as Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Dianne Feinstein have voiced their support for Prop 1. Over $14 million have been contributed to support the proposition from organizations like Yes on Prop 1, Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, and Newsom for California Governor 2022. The Republican Party has opposed the proposition, with almost $300,000 contributed by committees like Stop Prop 1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely frustrating that the topic is up for vote,\u201d said Sabrina Dimesa, a senior majoring in economics from Hermosa Beach, California. \u201cI feel like that is a right that should be protected regardless \u2014 it\u2019s an inalienable right.\u201d\n\nRecent polling suggests that 69% supported the measure, while 25% opposed it.\n\nProp 26 & Prop 27: Sports Wagering\nBoth propositions look to expand the availability of sports gambling in California. Prop 26 would legalize sports betting on Native American territorial lands and race tracks across the state. A \u201cyes\u201d vote supports the legalization of sports gambling on Native American territories and racetracks in the state. A \u201cno\u201d vote opposes this legalization, maintaining sports gambling\u2019s illegal status.\n\nProp 27 would allow licensed tribes and gambling companies to offer online sports betting on mobile devices. Additionally, 10% of the sports bets would go toward addressing homelessness and assisting those with gambling addiction problems. A small portion of the money raised will also go to tribes not involved in online sports betting.\n\nA \u201cyes\u201d vote supports the legalization of online gambling, while a \u201cno\u201d vote opposes it.\n\n\u201cBizarrely, what is at its core a proposition about legalizing sports gambling seems to the outsider to be about homelessness,\u201d said Douglas Becker, USC associate teaching professor of political science and international relations. \u201cIt really has very little to do with homelessness, and I have to admit being very frustrated with that...It just seems like a strange policy perspective there.\u201d\n\nProp 26 has received support from the Peace and Freedom Party, with over $130 million in contributions from organizations including the Pechanga Band of Indians and the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation. Prop 26 has received opposition from the Republican Party, with over $43 million raised by No on 26, the California Commerce Club, and other organizations.\n\nProp 27 has garnered additional opposition from Newsom, both the Democratic and Republican parties, and the Peace and Freedom Party. Organizations like Yes on 26, No on 27, and the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians have contributed to the almost $250 million opposing the proposition.\n\nRecent polling suggests that neither measure will pass.\n\nProp 28: Public School Arts Funding\nThis proposition would nearly double California\u2019s funding for public education\u2019s arts and music programs, sending 30% of the allotted funding to schools serving low-income students for years to come. A \u201cyes\u201d vote would support the increased budget for arts education, while a \u201cno\u201d vote would oppose this increase in funding.\n\nThe measure has garnered support from the Democratic Party, The Yes on 28 Committee, and SEIU California. There has been no official opposition to this proposition. Over $10 million was contributed to support the proposition from Yes on 28, Hollywood stars like Sylvester Stallone and Barbara Streisand, as well as from teachers unions.\n\nProp 29: Kidney Dialysis Clinics\nProposition 29 would require dialysis clinics to have an on-site physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant; report data on dialysis-related infections; and not discriminate against patients based on the source of payment for care. This measure is similar to Prop 8 and Prop 23, which were rejected in California in 2018 and 2020 respectively.\n\nA \u201cyes\u201d vote would support these new provisions to dialysis clinics, while a \u201cno\u201d vote would oppose them.\n\nThe measure has garnered support from the Democratic Party, the Peace and Freedom Party, and Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection, with almost $8 million raised for the proposition. It has received opposition from the Republican Party and organizations like the American Academy of Nephrology PAs and the California Chamber of Commerce, who have raised almost $90 million against the measure.\n\nProp 30: Wealth tax for zero-emission vehicle programs\nProposition 30 aims to tax wealthy Californians who make more than $2 million per year in income. The 1.75% tax will be used to fund zero-emission vehicle projects, charging stations, and funding for wildfire prevention programs.\n\nA \u201cyes\u201d vote would support this wealth tax, while a \u201cno\u201d vote would oppose it.\n\nProp 30 has garnered support from the Democratic party, with nearly $50 million raised by groups like Yes on 39 and Lyft Inc. The Republican Party, the Peace and Freedom Party, and Newsom have openly opposed the proposition, with almost $25 million raised by No on 30 and other institutions to lobby against it.\n\n\u201cI find it interesting that the political leadership like Gavin Newsom has opposed it,\u201d said Becker. \u201cIf it\u2019s green, I would think Californians would vote for it \u2014 certainly students at USC [would].\u201d\n\nPolling shows that 41% supported the proposition, while 52% opposed it.\n\nProp 31: Flavored tobacco\nThis proposition poses the question to voters over whether or not SB 793 should be repealed or upheld in California. SB 793 was proposed in 2020 and aimed to ban flavored tobacco products across the state, with a $250 fine for those who commit an offense.\n\nA \u201cyes\u201d vote upholds SB 793, banning the sale of flavored tobacco products. A \u201cno\u201d vote repeals SB 793, allowing flavored tobacco products to be sold.\n\nThe proposition has garnered support from Newsom, the Democratic Party, the Peace and Freedom Party, and the California Teachers Association, with over $35 million contributed by Yes on 31, Michael Bloomberg, and others. The Republican Party and a myriad of tobacco brands have opposed the proposition, raising over $23 million against the proposition.\n\n\u201cProhibition will not work,\u201d said Daphne Yaman, a junior majoring in journalism. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of marketing toward a younger audience. I think that\u2019s the problem, but I don\u2019t think that banning the sale of them would benefit anybody.\u201d\n\nRecent polling suggests that the measure will pass.\n\nRegistered California voters can cast their ballot from now until Tuesday, November 8.\n```"}

Elon Musk is the decision maker and it looks like he hasn\u2019t wasted a single minute. Annenberg Radio\u2019s Eric Yeh has the story.\n\nYou see tons of people today sitting or walking around with their heads down buried in their phones. Then, you\u2019ll occasionally hear, typing, clicking, ding, and a bird whistle. What do these sounds have in common? Twitter.\n\nWith Elon Musk officially acquiring Twitter, his ownership raises many different reactions about how the social media platform will be run in the future. Clayton Owens is a real estate development major at USC Price. He says Musk is the right guy to run Twitter.\n\nCLAYTON OWENS: I mean, I think Elon\u2019s a smart guy, so I would think that it\u2019s a beneficial thing for Twitter because I feel like it has died down since it first came out with Instagram and now like BeReal taking over, TikToks, stuff like that. But I mean, Elon Musk is one of the most smartest people in the world. So I would think that it\u2019s in good hands.\n\nMusk grabbed Twitter after months of back and forth on whether his 44 billion dollar deal would go through. But second year law student Adam Burch objects to the new owner.\n\nADAM BURCH: I\u2019m not a huge fan of Elon Musk. In the past, he has shown a willingness to engage in conspiracy theories as well as the proliferation of verifiably false media content on social media platforms. On day three of his owning Twitter, Musk retweeted an unproven allegation that there might be more to the story of the attack on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband. He later deleted the tweet.\n\nLaw student Adam Burch says we have to be careful with free speech.\n\nADAM BURCH: While I respect his viewpoint that places like Facebook and Twitter should be a public square where anybody could express their ideas, I also think that it\u2019s a fraught position because social media companies have such influence over people that the spread of disinformation is so powerful that we\u2019ve seen in the last few years that, you know, a sort of naive libertarian viewpoint like that could lead to serious damage. You know. Psychologically on an individual level as well as, you know, the erosion of critical thinking and democratic principles in the macro.\n\nMusk has said he plans to do away with permanent bans on Twitter. Since taking over, he tweeted that Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.\n\nWe asked a small group of USC students if they\u2019d stop using Twitter now that Elon Musk owns it or change their use of the platform in any way. Not a single student was planning any changes at all! They say they don\u2019t care who owns Twitter.\n\nBut maybe they should, says Communications Law Professor at USC Annenberg, Michael Overing.\n\nMICHAEL OVERING: The fact that he let go, all of the employees that he wanted to let go, the fact that he is trying to now revamp. But all of that just says, well, that\u2019s free enterprise in the United States. Does it mean that people are going to agree with what he does? Absolutely not. There\u2019s just no way of knowing at this moment when we\u2019ve only had three days to know exactly where the platform is going to go and whether or not it\u2019s going to continue to have relevance even. That depends on whether you and I and all of us believe, as Musk said, that the bird is free and we continue to use his platform for our communications.\n```"}

Simplicity or uniqueness, spooky or funny?\n\nBy Sophia Hammerle, Mia Thompson and Anjali Patel October 31, 2022 at 4:51 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s spooky season, and Trojans began celebrating as early as last week. From ghosts and fairies all the way to movie characters and animals, there is no limit on the options for costumes. So what really goes into choosing one? Sophia Hammerle set out in orange and black attire to report on student\u2019s Halloween wardrobes.\n\nAs I walked down McClintock Avenue this morning, dodging skateboards and electric scooters, it was like any other Monday on campus. Wait, was that a skeleton sitting outside the aquatic center? I stared at a guy walking toward me, trying to figure out if he was dressed up as Fred from Scooby Doo, or if he just really liked that orange scarf. Suddenly Donkey Kong was approaching me, banana in hand. Later, in class, I watched Cruella De Ville stroll past the window outside. A smattering of USC Students wore their Halloween costumes to class today. Some were more subtle than others, ranging from pumpkin earrings to a Spiderman morph suit.\n\nRFERARI: I am a goomba from Mario.\nTOMMY LAPENNA: I\u2019m Donkey Kong.\nTIGER ZENG: Pikachu.\nAVERY LONGDON: I\u2019m a vampire today.\n\nThe diversity in costumes reflects an equal diversity in motivations behind why we dress up. Avery Longdon, a junior studying environmental science and health, had to balance her job responsibilities with her costume.\n\nLONGDON: I picked this costume because I have to wear business casual clothes to work, but they also told us to dress up. So I figured I could wear business casual and a vampire cape. So, you know, I\u2019m getting a lot of things done with this outfit.\n\nFor Tommy Lapenna, a music industry major, it was more important to stand out.\n\nLAPENNA: I want to go all out on like, everything I do. And this is just, why would I hold back here?\n\nWorking with what they already had was important to R Ferari, a third year graduate student in interactive media.\n\nFERARI: For me, I want to go for ease, accessibility and definitely something that\u2019s going to be unique. So not something that someone\u2019s going to expect, but also something that I can easily get within my reach.\n\nTiger Zeng, a junior studying mechanical engineering and French, who participated in a group costume with the men\u2019s rowing team, considered several factors when choosing his costume.\n\nZENG: For me, there\u2019s a lot of considerations. Obviously, as a student, costs come first, but also I like the original design and the cuteness, obviously, because I\u2019m Pikachu.\n\nYuri Mehta, a freshman studying industrial and systems engineering, indulged in childhood nostalgia with his costume.\n\nMEHTA: I picked Harry Potter because it was my favorite book when I was a child.\n\nFor all the variety in costumes, what was most important to students was to embrace the opportunity to dress up as something that truly resonates with them.\n\nLONGDON: I think you should be whoever you want to be in your costume. Halloween is one of the nights in the year where you can just like wear whatever you want and you have a really good excuse for it. So whatever is speaking to you, whether that\u2019s scary or not, you should wear that. Tonight is the perfect night to do so.

(AP Photo/Wade Payne)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade October 31, 2022 at 4:26 pm PDT\n\nI can hear it already. \u201cGeorgia is No. 1 in the first College Football Playoff rankings of the season.\u201d Or maybe it\u2019ll be Ohio State. But one thing is clear: Tennessee should be ranked No. 1 in the College Football Playoff rankings.\n\nThe first CFP rankings come out tomorrow, and this first set of rankings is more important than it may seem. The AP poll is tossed to the side and now there will be a new order to these teams. A team isn\u2019t going to jump another team if both teams win. A team isn\u2019t going to fall below another team if both teams lose. The first week of CFP rankings determines how the rest of the season\u2019s rankings are set up.\n\nTennessee should be at the very top. This is what the AP voters got wrong. After Tennessee\u2019s 52-49 victory over then-No. 3 Alabama, the Volunteers jumped three spots to No. 3. Why didn\u2019t Tennessee move up to No. 1? Did the teams ahead of the Vols have a better win at the time? That depends if you consider Georgia\u2019s Week 1 win over Oregon \u2014 a team with a new quarterback and a completely new coaching staff \u2014 or Ohio State\u2019s win over then-3-3 Notre Dame to be better wins than Tennessee\u2019s win over No. 3 Alabama.\n\nTo this day, the Vols have the best win in all of college football. You might think that Georgia or Ohio State could beat Tennessee on a neutral field, but that\u2019s not how the rankings work. That should be a metric used to split hairs, but there\u2019s no need for that when one of the team\u2019s resumes is far superior to the rest.\n\nIf the games matter, Tennessee will be No. 1 tomorrow. Plain and simple. If you need more convincing that this Tennessee team is deserving, let me give you some more evidence. According to ESPN, Tennessee\u2019s strength of schedule is 19th in the country and its strength of record is No. 1. Georgia and Ohio State are both in the top five for strength of record but neither is in the top 50 for strength of schedule.\n\nTennessee has, arguably, one of the best offenses we\u2019ve ever seen. The Vols are averaging 49.4 points per game and that\u2019s against the likes of Alabama, LSU and Kentucky. Heading into this week, Kentucky had college football\u2019s longest streak of allowing 24 points or less. Tennessee snapped that 11-game streak by scoring 27 points in the first half alone.\n\nThis week, Ohio State struggled to beat Penn State, a team Michigan crushed by 24 points just two weeks ago. That seems like a good reason to put Tennessee ahead of the Buckeyes. Yet the teams are tied at No. 2 in the AP poll. That doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense!\n\nIt might not factor too much into the rankings but Tennessee has two of the best players in the country in junior wide receiver Jalin Hyatt and redshirt senior quarterback Hendon Hooker. Hyatt is probably the greatest receiver Knoxville has ever seen since he has already broken Tennessee\u2019s record for most receiving touchdowns in a single season and the school\u2019s record for most receiving touchdowns in a single game. Hyatt broke that second record against Alabama when he hauled in five touchdown passes. Hyatt only had six total receptions in that game and recorded 207 receiving yards.\n\nHyatt\u2019s signal caller, Hooker, has also had a phenomenal year and should be the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nWhat more does Tennessee have to prove? It feels like the Vols are being punished for starting the season unranked, but ol\u2019 Rocky Top has proved its worth. If we\u2019re still using preseason rankings to justify keeping Georgia and Ohio State in front, we\u2019re doing it all wrong.\n\nI trust the CFP committee to get this right. Even if the committee doesn\u2019t, this week\u2019s bout between Tennessee and Georgia will settle things once and for all. But it would be nice to see the games matter. Tennessee\u2019s win over Alabama should be enough justification to put the Vols at No. 1 until they\u2019re beaten or someone else emerges with an even more impressive victory or string of wins. Up to this point, that just hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nSo, put Tennessee in its rightful place.\n\n\u201cCollege Football Roundup\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}
