(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Scarlett Khanbeigi March 10, 2024 at 10:39 pm PDT\n\nThis Sunday, Jimmy Kimmel hosted the 96th Academy Awards in the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Kimmel was supported by a cast of charismatic hosts and energetic performers, helping to bring to life this star-studded night in Hollywood. In case you missed it, here are some of the top moments from this year\u2019s Oscars.\n\n1. Past and present winners unite\nFor the first time since 2009, previous winners in the four acting categories took the Dolby stage to present the Academy Awards for best supporting actress, best supporting actor, best actress and best actor. Among these 20 famous presenters were Jamie Lee Curtis, Ke Huy Quan, Michelle Yeoh and Brendan Fraser, who were the recipients of these respective Oscars during last year\u2019s show. Through the heartfelt words of these lauded icons recognizing each nominee, generations of actors and actresses were joined together in a celebration of the film industry\u2019s finest acting talent.\n\n2. Billie Eilish and Finneas make history\nSet against an aptly-lit pink background, sister-brother duo Billie Eilish and Finneas O\u2019Connell gave a poignant performance of \u201cWhat Was I Made For?\u201d from the 2023 film \u201cBarbie.\u201d This song earned \u201cBarbie\u201d its only Oscar win of the night, although the film was nominated for eight awards. In winning the Oscar for best original song, Eilish (22) and O\u2019Connell (26) became the first and second youngest individuals to have won two Oscars. They had previously received their first Academy Award in the same category for their song \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d in 2022.\n\n3. John Cena presents best costume design with nothing on\nIn 1974, a streaker interrupted the 46th Academy Awards to run across the stage completely naked. 50 years later, in what may be the most shocking, yet hilarious moment of this year\u2019s awards show, John Cena shuffled sideways in front of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names to present the winner for Best Costume Design wearing nothing but Birkenstocks. Using the presenter\u2019s envelope to cover himself, Cena shook his head in exasperation and sighed, \u201cCostumes...They are so important.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel came to Cena\u2019s \u201crescue\u201d by creating a makeshift toga out of a rose gold curtain, allowing him to announce Holly Waddington from \u201cPoor Things\u201d as the winner, without flashing the audience.\n\n4. Ryan Gosling channels his \u201cKenergy\u201d\nWearing a bedazzled hot pink suit and shades, Ryan Gosling and a band of \u201cKens\u201d in cowboy hats performed \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d in the style of Marilyn Monroe singing \u201cDiamonds Are a Girl\u2019s Best Friend\u201d in \u201cGentlemen Prefer Blondes.\u201d This performance was not just relegated to the stage however, and Gosling passed the microphone to the women of \u201cBarbie\u201d\u2014 Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie and America Ferrera \u2014 and Gosling\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d co-star and 2024 best actress winner for \u201cPoor Things,\u201d Emma Stone. On top of this round of karaoke and a montage of larger-than-life Barbie heads, Slash, the lead guitarist of Guns N\u2019 Roses, came out on the stage, making \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d one of the most entertaining performances of the night.\n\n5. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d steals the show\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d the second part of the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d cultural phenomenon, came out on top this Oscars season, taking home the Academy Award for seven out of this film\u2019s 13 nominations. In addition to winning for best film editing, best cinematography and best original score, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d allowed three big names in the film industry to earn the title of \u201cOscar Winner\u201d for the first time tonight \u2014 Robert Downey Jr. for best supporting actor, Cillian Murphy for best actor and Christopher Nolan for best director. Upon receiving his Oscar, Nolan expressed that being a \u201cmeaningful part\u201d of the \u201cincredible journey\u201d that is movies \u201cmeans the world to [him].\u201d Solidifying Nolan\u2019s place in film history, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d closed out the 96th Academy Awards with its win for best picture, the most anticipated award of the evening.\n```"}

(Photo by Desirae Ridley)\n\nBy Will Simonds March 10, 2024 at 6:57 pm PDT\n\nWhen USC women\u2019s basketball upset Stanford in Palo Alto, freshman guard JuJu Watkins did it almost completely on her own. The Trojans needed every bit of her record-setting 51 points to take down the Cardinal 67-58 last month. The teams met for a second time in Sunday\u2019s Pac-12 tournament championship, and the game couldn\u2019t have played out more differently on the Trojans\u2019 end. But the end result was the same.\n\nWatkins had a season-low nine points Sunday, but graduate guard McKenzie Forbes more than made up for it. Her 26 points led the way in a 74-61 win over Stanford, as USC claimed its first Pac-12 tournament title since 2014. Playing all 40 minutes, Forbes shot 11-for-21 from the field, adding four 3-pointers, five rebounds and three steals.\n\nDuring the postgame ceremony, Forbes teared up while talking about the importance of her family being in attendance. Mason Forbes, a redshirt senior forward at St. Mary\u2019s, plays in the WCC tournament semifinals in Las Vegas on Monday, but he made it out in time to watch his sister win the Pac-12 tournament\u2019s Most Outstanding Player.\n\n\u201cWhen the confetti was falling ... I said to Coach G, \u2018Am I dreaming?\u2019\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot in my career, but I\u2019ve never wavered and never stopped believing in myself and my capabilities.\u201d\n\nForbes noted the impact of her three older brothers in giving her the confidence to score efficiently in this game, even after some inconsistent shooting performances in recent weeks.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like Forbes had to do everything like Watkins did in order to fell the Cardinal. Instead, the Trojans got major contributions from almost everyone else. Junior center Rayah Marshall had 10 points and 18 rebounds \u2014 USC is now 16-0 this season when she scores double-digit points. Marshall\u2019s impact on the boards was particularly vital Sunday against the star frontcourt of senior Cameron Brink and junior Kiki Iriafen; Marshall outrebounded Stanford\u2019s twin trees in the frontcourt on her own.\n\nGraduate forward Kaitlyn Davis filled up the stat sheet again, tallying six points, five offensive rebounds (out of seven total) and five assists. Although she fouled out in the fourth, she exited the game to a raucous ovation after a team-high plus-14 in 30 minutes.\n\nAfter a combined zero points in these teams\u2019 first meeting, the two Kaylas \u2014 graduate guard Padilla and senior guard Williams \u2014 had 21 between them this time around, including four first-half triples.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuses on a championship Sunday,\u201d USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said of her players\u2019 mentality. \u201cCoaches are always going to give game plans, but it\u2019s up to them to bring it to life. ... I can\u2019t credit them enough for being in the right mindspace and doing it together.\u201d\n\nWatkins didn\u2019t score her first point until the 1:36 mark of the second quarter, as Stanford went all out to stop the stud freshman. To the surprise of many, her two free throws at that time extended USC\u2019s lead to five, one they wouldn\u2019t relinquish.\n\nNot only did Watkins not even make a field goal in the first half, but Stanford was more efficient making shots from the field and 3-point range. But, it was USC that held a 40-31 halftime advantage.\n\nHowever, Stanford had been in this exact halftime spot in every game of this tournament. The Cardinal trailed by eight at the half against both Cal in the quarterfinals and Oregon State in the semis, but they went on to win comfortably in each instance.\n\nSo, while head coach Tara VanDerveer couldn\u2019t have been thrilled about a nine-point deficit in the title game, Stanford certainly wasn\u2019t out of it by any means.\n\nStanford outscored Cal and Oregon State by a combined 43-18 in the third quarter in those previous games. As a result, head coach Lindsay Gottlieb\u2019s halftime directive was obvious: don\u2019t step off the gas pedal.\n\n\u201cThe pregame message was never get off the treadmill,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe last few games, we\u2019ve started out really hot and then got pushed back. ... We did a good job of continuing to be aggressive and scoring on offense, even when we needed to get stops as well.\u201d\n\nIn case it wasn\u2019t clear whether her squad got the memo, look no further than this save by Marshall to set up a huge three by Forbes with the shot clock winding down:\n\nThe Trojans matched the Cardinal shot-for-shot in the third period, maintaining their nine-point lead heading into the final 10 minutes. The fourth quarter started with another 3-pointer by Padilla, and a couple more big shots by Forbes wrapped it up, shutting down the possibility of another second-half comeback by the Cardinal.\n\n\u201cToday was their day,\u201d VanDerveer said of USC\u2019s performance, especially in the second half. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we were so bad. I thought they were very good.\u201d\n\nVanDerveer added her team simply didn\u2019t do the basic things well, particularly pointing out the Trojans\u2019 18-6 advantage on the offensive boards. In fact, Sunday was the first time in over five years that the Cardinal lost the rebounding battle by at least 15, according to ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nBrink and Iriafen had solid offensive nights, combining for 37 points, but the rest of the Cardinal shot just 9-for-26. Gottlieb and Forbes praised Padilla\u2019s effort in particular to limit her opposing 3-point specialist in Stanford\u2019s senior guard Hannah Jump, who had just three points.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s a full circle moment for Gottlieb in multiple facets. First, VanDerveer was one of the coaches who responded to Gottlieb when she wrote a letter to every Division-I head coach during winter break of her final year of college as she tried to break into the coaching industry. Now, USC\u2019s head coach just overcame her mentor in the final conference meeting between their schools, adding that she might not be a coach if not for VanDerveer.\n\nGottlieb got emotional talking about how much the Pac-12 has meant to her career, and even her personal life, as she met her husband while coaching at Cal previously.\n\n\u201cIt is meaningful to me to get the last one in this iteration,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe conference has just been an unbelievable platform for female athletes. ... There is some sadness in terms of this being the last [Pac-12 tournament], but at the same time, a lot of pride in us winning the last one as a group. This group will be remembered forever for that.\u201d\n\nThis win gives USC, now 26-5 on the season overall, an even stronger case to claim a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament when the bracket is revealed next Sunday. In the meantime, one thing is clear: the Trojans are going to celebrate this win together. As Gottlieb noted, most teams don\u2019t get to celebrate, and it\u2019s particularly special given USC\u2019s unlikely path to this point.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Yang)\n\nBy Dylan Luden March 10, 2024 at 12:30 pm PDT\n\nAfter winning three straight games to close out the season, could the USC men\u2019s basketball team pull off some magic in Las Vegas at the Pac-12 tournament? In its final regular-season game before the conference dissolves, USC pulled off its biggest win of the season, upsetting No. 5 Arizona 78-65 on Saturday\u2019s Senior Night at Galen Center. It was the first time the Trojans beat a top-five team since 2008 and their first win against the Wildcats since January 2021 in Tucson.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re an outstanding basketball team that scores 90 points a game, and they\u2019re very explosive,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cIt was very important for us to come out and play with some momentum on Senior Night heading into the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas.\u201d\n\nAfter beating Washington on the road in Seattle on Sunday and Arizona State at Galen Center on Thursday, the Trojans came into the game against the behemoth Wildcats with some momentum before the game tipped off. Arizona is the best team in the conference and is led by the potential Pac-12 Player of the Year in senior guard Caleb Love, who\u2019s averaging 19.3 points per game after transferring in from North Carolina. Stopping him on any given night is a tough task, but the Trojans figured out how to stop him Saturday. Love only had two points on 1-for-10 shooting.\n\nThe entire USC defense stepped up to play tough, physical basketball, which resulted in a season-high 15 steals. The main beneficiary was junior guard Kobe Johnson, who tied his career high in steals with six. Along with 19 points, Johnson couldn\u2019t have asked for a better performance on the night.\n\n\u201cEvery time we play Arizona, we know it\u2019s going to be a physical game,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe knew coming into it right away that we needed to be the more physical team. The game plan the whole week focused around Love, because we know how good of a player he is. We pressured him and forced him to take tough shots.\u201d\n\nGraduate forward DJ Rodman also had a season-high 19 points to lead USC alongside Johnson. Rodman has spent his whole career in the Pac-12 \u2014 having played four years with Washington State previously \u2014 but wanted to show out on his Senior Night with most of his family in attendance.\n\n\u201cI know my sister Trinity wasn\u2019t here, which sucks a lot, but my mom and older sister are here with my niece and nephews,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cToday was the first game that they\u2019ve been to together, and I just wanted to have fun and not get too emotional.\u201d\n\nFreshman guard Isaiah Collier was right behind Johnson and Rodman with 16 points of his own. Collier was a major X-factor on both sides of the floor and provided the dagger to finish Arizona off. His big 3-point play boosted the Trojans\u2019 lead to 10 points with less than four minutes left.\n\nOn the other side, Enfield mentioned how dangerous Arizona\u2019s redshirt senior Oumar Ballo can be. The Trojans didn\u2019t have an answer for the 7-foot, 260-pound center from Mali, as he secured his 16th double-double of the year and his 10th in 11 games. USC didn\u2019t have anyone to really match up with Ballo, so they focused on the Wildcats\u2019 guards instead. Besides Ballo and fifth-year forward Keshad Johnson, who both finished with 17 points, no other Arizona player finished the night with double-digit points.\n\nGoing into the Pac-12 tournament, USC couldn\u2019t have asked for better fortunes. Its roster is back and fully healthy, which Enfield noted as a big reason for the Trojans\u2019 struggles so far this season. The defense is playing to its expectations as one of the best in the conference, and the offense is clicking \u2014 converting shots and not forcing any errant passes or shots. The Trojans almost made half of their shots on the night, going 28-for-57 from the field.\n\nIf USC can keep this up on both sides of the floor next week, it has a chance to shock a lot of fans and live up to its lofty expectations from the beginning of the season. No. 9 seed USC will face No. 8 seed Washington in a rematch from last Sunday to kick off the Pac-12 tournament at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Tipoff for the game is set for noon on Wednesday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/10/kings-fall-to-the-stars-as-power-play-woes-haunt-los-angeles/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Kings may have taken an early lead 26 seconds through the first period, but failed to find the back of the net again against the red-hot Dallas Stars. Los Angeles had won three of its last four entering Saturday night, however, a lackluster offensive performance prevented it from finding any game-changing momentum needed to beat Dallas.\n\nWinger Kevin Fiala, who scored the overtime winner against the Senators Thursday night, wasted no time as soon as the puck dropped in the first period. Blueliner Drew Doughty dished a beauty to Fiala, who was open in the slot to put the Kings on the board first. Fiala now has 10 points in his last six games, including five goals.\n\nHowever, it all went downhill from there for LA. Dallas\u2019 fourth-line center Radek Faksa and elite winger Jason Robertson broke open the game midway through the second period, each tallying goals just 18 seconds apart to take the lead. Robertson\u2019s goal\u2014off a rebound chance that put goalie Cam Talbot out of position\u2014was the eventual game-winner.\n\nDesperate to tie the game, the Kings never found an answer despite killing four straight power plays. When center Phillip Danault got called for tripping almost five minutes through the third period, Stars center Wyatt Johnston effectively put the game out of reach, notching his 23rd goal of the season. Winger Joe Pavelski scored on the empty net to seal the final score at 4-1. Pavelski and Robertson each posted two points in the victory.\n\n\u201cI thought our [penalty] kill was great tonight,\u201d said defenseman Matt Roy. \u201cThey\u2019re a hard team to play against, they just keep coming and coming.\u201d\n\nWhile earning four power plays of their own, the Kings couldn\u2019t convert any of them, as Dallas\u2019 penalty kill rose to the challenge. Netminder Scott Wedgewood was nearly perfect with 24 saves.\n\n\u201cWhen you create offense where you have the puck and you\u2019re dangerous, you just feel better,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do that at all on our power play tonight, so we have nothing to feel good about.\u201d\n\nTalbot made his sixth-straight start between the pipes for Los Angeles. The 36-year-old faced 34 shots and made some impressive saves, but it wasn\u2019t enough, as the Kings\u2019 defense failed to back him up when it mattered most.\n\nKings winger Adrian Kempe returned to action for the first time since Feb. 26, when he suffered an upper-body injury in Edmonton. Despite his recent ailment, the Swede led all Los Angeles forwards with 20:51 of ice time. Kempe nearly found the equalizer with an impressive shorthanded chance late in the second frame, but it was to no avail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to get right back into the heat, get the legs back into it,\u201d said Kempe. \u201cWe spent too much time in our D-zone and giving them momentum when they\u2019re on the power play.\u201d\n\nIn two matchups between these sides thus far, the Stars have taken both with ease. On Jan. 16, Dallas trounced the Kings 5-1. With the final head-to-head bout scheduled on Mar. 16, Los Angeles will need to play a complete game to avoid the season sweep. The Stars are a team that LA could face in the first round of the playoffs, and their stout depth has been the leading factor to their playoff-worthy success this season.\n\n\u201cI thought we were ready for [the Stars], they shouldn\u2019t have caught us off guard,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cThey play a playoff-style game, we did not ... We didn\u2019t have it in us.\u201d\n\nWith the Vegas Golden Knights\u2019 recent slide, the Kings have found their way into the Pacific Division\u2019s top three. However, with almost 20 games remaining, and given Vegas\u2019 strong trade deadline acquisitions, Los Angeles will need to be atop of its game to edge out the Knights and avoid the Wild Card.\n\n\u201cAny time we play a team that\u2019s on top in the standings, it\u2019s a big game,\u201d said Roy. \u201cBut we believe when we play our game, we can play against anyone and we can beat anybody.\u201d\n\nThe Kings will conclude their homestand Monday against the New York Islanders. The Isles gave Los Angeles trouble last time around, so it\u2019ll be a crucial game for Los Angeles. After that, LA will venture to the Midwest for matchups against the St. Louis Blues and Chicago Blackhawks.\n```"}

On their own, the results likely undersell the drama that ensued on Thursday and Friday. Despite the higher-seeded team having won every game \u2014 perhaps a rather ordinary scenario \u2014 the drama has been anything but that. The first two double-overtime games in tournament history. The No. 1 seed needing a pair of second-half comebacks to advance to the final. Plenty of star freshmen making waves in Vegas for the first time, and seniors closing out their careers in style. It\u2019s been an undoubtedly fun few days.\n\nOn one hand, all of that excitement has been exacerbated by the fact that it\u2019s the final installment of the Pac-12 tournament, or at least this version of it. There\u2019s something that feels right about sending off the conference with a bang, especially given the preeminent strength of West Coast programs this season, with six Pac-12 teams in the AP Top 25. It\u2019s also been bittersweet. It kind of stinks that we won\u2019t be able to see high-stakes matchups between Oregon State and Stanford or UCLA and Utah anymore on a consistent basis, with all four schools splitting into separate conferences. All things considered, it\u2019s been an emotional week \u2014 one that will definitely be remembered by everyone lucky enough to attend (or have access to Pac-12 Network).\n\nSpeaking of which, it\u2019s at least comforting that the final women\u2019s basketball game on the Pac-12 Network closed with the Spirit of Troy playing \u201cTusk.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s been totally worth it after all.\n\nWhat a day. Goodnight, Trojan Fam \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b  pic.twitter.com/v0R6nHrg1w \u2014 USC Women's Basketball (@USCWBB)  March 9, 2024\n\nKaitlyn Davis does everything\n\nGraduate forward Kaitlyn Davis isn\u2019t typically the first player you\u2019ll notice when checking USC box scores. But, as of late, she\u2019s establishing herself as perhaps the most important player on the team down the stretch this season. One recurring example of her impact in recent games has come in almost identical situations. Let\u2019s start with the double-overtime win in Tucson against Arizona on February 29. After hitting a jumper while being fouled, Davis misses the ensuing free throw while down three with under 20 seconds left. She grabs her own rebound, though, and kicks it out to her fellow \u201cnerd,\u201d graduate guard Kayla Padilla. Then, Davis flies in for  another  offensive board off of Padilla\u2019s miss and finds her sharpshooting teammate  again . This time, it pays off, as Padilla sinks a game-tying three, and USC would go on to win after two extra periods.\n\nNow to Friday\u2019s win over UCLA, another double-overtime victory just over a week later. This time, it\u2019s freshman guard JuJu Watkins at the line with USC down by three with under a minute to go in overtime. And, of course, it\u2019s Davis who comes up with a crucial rebound off a missed foul shot. She again finds Padilla, but in this case the ball is forwarded to the third member of the nerd trio \u2014 graduate guard McKenzie Forbes \u2014 who buries the game-tying 3-pointer in a game USC would go on to prevail.\n\nIt\u2019s a play that you can\u2019t necessarily draw up in practice, but one that head coach Lindsay Gottlieb has nevertheless dubbed the \u201cIvy special.\u201d After Saturday\u2019s practice, Gottlieb effusively praised the variety of ways in which Davis contributes to this Trojan squad. \u201cKD\u2019s willingness to put her body on the line for 50-50 balls, the rebounds, the critical plays, it\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe team really appreciates it. It\u2019s a huge X-factor for us.\u201d\n\nThe list of those critical plays from Davis \u2014 just in last night\u2019s game alone \u2014 goes on. Consider this block of Lauren Betts on literally the next possession, which was equally as massive in forcing a second overtime: \n\nOr this steal to finally seal the deal, blowing up an ATO set by the Bruins looking for an open three: \n\nThere\u2019s plenty more examples that could be used to fully illustrate Davis\u2019 all-around impact, but it\u2019s time to switch gears to another teammate whose effects aren\u2019t quite as obvious.\n\nIndia Otto, a.k.a. \u201cMini-Lindsay\u201d\n\nNow in her fifth season, graduate guard India Otto is the longest-tenured member of the program, alongside assistant coach Courtney Jaco. As a result, Otto has a unique perspective on how far this group has come since Gottlieb\u2019s arrival in 2021. After enduring a pair of seasons of mediocrity under former coach Mark Trakh, Otto was just one of a very few players that stayed through the transition to Gottlieb, especially after a dismal 12-16 first season in 2021-22. She noted Saturday that the only constant over her five years at USC has been the incessant change within the program. Luckily for her, that change has shifted in a more positive direction over the final two seasons of her Trojan career. Nevertheless, she\u2019s amazed that this team has a chance to take home a Pac-12 tournament championship on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly such a special group,\u201d Otto said. \u201cI knew that we had a lot of talent coming in, ... but I don\u2019t think anyone could have imagined how this season is going.\u201d\n\nObviously, Watkins\u2019 instant stardom is a major reason for the team\u2019s success, but Otto has played a crucial role in her teammate\u2019s \u2014 and best friend\u2019s \u2014 development. The pair met when Otto was a high school junior and Watkins was a seventh grader at Windward School, and the former instantly saw something special in a young Watkins. Otto is still amazed daily by what Watkins does on the court \u2014 \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need any mentorship from me basketball-wise,\u201d Otto said \u2014 but she definitely has a hand in the freshman\u2019s poised, veteran-like demeanor. The two are almost attached at the hip; even during Watkins\u2019 press conferences, Otto is typically lingering in the back of the room, observing her star teammate with admiration and pride.\n\nThere\u2019s clear parallels between Otto and Gottlieb, a former player-coach at Brown, in their consistent love for the game of basketball and how they see the world. They\u2019ve had similar college experiences, functioning like teachers while also being teammates. Gottlieb grew up in a family of lawyers and dreamed of being a Supreme Court justice as a kid; Otto is pursuing her master\u2019s degree in law. Even Gottlieb\u2019s daughter Reese has mixed the two of them up before, earning Otto the teasing nickname \u201cMini-Lindsay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take a lot of pride in that,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThat\u2019s meaningful to me if people would compare her to me.\u201d\n\nOtto won\u2019t rule out following in Gottlieb\u2019s footsteps as a coach, but she currently aspires to be an agent in order to stay around basketball. In the meantime, though, Otto\u2019s 23rd birthday is Sunday. And she\u2019d like nothing more than a present in the form of a Pac-12 tournament championship title.\n\n\u201cThat would be the best birthday gift I could ever ask for,\u201d Otto said. \u201cIt would mean more than I could ever describe.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Sammie Yen\nMarch 09, 2024 at 7:00 pm PST\n\nThe No. 12 Trojans (11-9, 2-4 MPSF) may have struck first, but they couldn\u2019t maintain the fight against No. 9 Ohio State Buckeyes (15-4, 8-2 Big 10). Of Ohio State, USC head coach Jeff Nygaard noted, \u201cThat\u2019s a team that has some battle-hardened seniors, 22-to-23-year old guys that can sustain a physical output for long periods of time.\u201d\n\nUSC came out of the gate swinging with an aggressive hunger. All of its hard hitters got a chance to shine at the net, sending a barrage of attacks through the Buckeyes\u2019 blocks. Early on, sophomore outside hitter Dillon Klein hit one home. Redshirt junior opposite hitter Jack Deucher contributed a few kills, solidifying himself as a consistent offensive threat. Freshman middle blocker Wesley Smith soared through the air before sending it home to tie the game 6-6.\n\nThe set showed a cycle of beautiful sequences. Freshman setter Caleb Blanchette to junior libero Austin Stuard, who takes the assist to Klein. A monster block from senior middle blocker Kyle Paulson. The Ohio State defense devastated by Smith again and again. Cardinal and gold covered just about every inch of the floor.\n\nThe Trojans never wavered from a calm, cool complexion, even as Ohio State inched back to only a two-point deficit at 24-22. At match point, sophomore outside hitter Riley Haine notched his first kill to win the Trojans their first and only set of the night.\n\nThe second set told a very different story. Ohio State punched back even harder, and the Trojans just couldn\u2019t answer. \u201cThey came out on a focused mission of being right-back aggressive. They clearly out-aggressed us [in] game two,\u201d Nygaard said.\n\nThe Buckeyes found their stride, with all of their attackers significantly improving their hitting percentages. The second set alone saw them with 14 kills, whereas the Trojans only produced five. The visiting team took an early, tight 5-4 lead, which soon evolved into a seemingly insurmountable 19-9. The Trojans seemed to drop the ball even on Ohio State\u2019s obvious last-ditch, sloppy plays. In the second set, USC could not match up with the Buckeyes\u2019 pure physicality and fell 25-11.\n\n\u201cSomething we\u2019ve been saying all week is, \u2018They\u2019ll throw a punch, but we need to throw a punch back,\u2019\u201d redshirt junior outside hitter and libero Jackson Reed said. Reed donned the libero jersey, a position he had been training for despite his classification as an outside hitter. While the team is young, Reed boasts three years under his belt. His stepping into the libero position grounded the team, as several plays were sourced through his actions.\n\nIf the second set was a Buckeye punch, the third set was USC\u2019s valiant attempt in fighting back. The third set was dictated by fluid movement and constantly changing ebbs of momentum. The Buckeyes\u2019 blocks turned into an impassable barrier, but Deucher continued to dunk on the competition. For much of the set, USC was able to preserve its lead due to robust kills by Haine and Klein that found the open corner or unprotected line. For a moment, the team showed signs of the beautiful sequences in the first set. Most notable was when the scoreboard read 20-all, Klein put over a beautiful serve, which led to a thrilling joust won by Paulson, which resulted in a deafening kill by Deuchar.\n\nHowever, the Trojans never ran away with more than a five-point gap between themselves and the Buckeyes. Ohio State followed through with a slow but steady comeback to take the third set 25-23.\n\nThe fourth set continued to see that dogfight through but kept the Buckeyes in the lead for most of the set. The Trojans were never able to persist long enough to overcome the deficit: a triple block, more like a fortification, by Smith, Blanchette and Klein might have shifted the momentum in USC\u2019s favor, but that hope was immediately deflated with a Buckeye kill. It was back-and-forth for a while. Klein contributed three kills at the end to give USC the 18th, 19th, and 20th point to Ohio State\u2019s 21. But the Trojans failed to capitalize on their short run, and the Buckeyes took the game with a 25-20 victory.\n\nBy the end of the fourth and final set, Ohio State had racked up a total of 14 blocks, while USC was sitting on 4.5 blocks, the team\u2019s worst mark of the year, averaging 9.6 blocks per game.\n\nNygaard remains steadfast about the team\u2019s aggressiveness as a key component to their progress. \u201cWe have the ability. We\u2019re just growing and flexing that muscle. What I love is that our guys come back, learn more, and become better every night out.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will continue their conference play on the road against Pepperdine Thursday at 6 p.m.\n```"}

Since then, they\u2019ve split a 1-1 record in tournament matchups.\n\nComing off of a double-overtime win against crosstown rival UCLA has to be a momentum booster for USC. Junior center Clarice Akunwafo, who\u2019s expected to be a key rotational big on Sunday, established her interior presence that game. The 6-foot-6 center kept the Bruins\u2019 leading scorer, Lauren Betts, scoreless whenever she was on the court.\n\n\u201c[Clarice] has been terrific. She\u2019s an incredible athlete \u2014 a really good individual post defender,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cShe screens and rolls really hard, so she\u2019s a hugely important player for us. I think she\u2019s shown a ton of improvement this year.\u201d\n\nBut having one solid post defender won\u2019t be enough to contain the Cardinal\u2019s dynamic frontcourt of Pac-12 Player of the Year Cameron Brink and Most Improved Player of the Year Kiki Iriafen. Luckily, the Trojans have three capable answers in Marshall, Akunwafo and graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis.\n\n\u201c[Stanford] comes into every game with two incredible post players who pose a problem,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t able or willing to guard them, you\u2019re not going to win. ... So, our post players have to be really willing to run and battle and take away layups. And then, obviously, we need to guard the 3-point line in [Hannah] Jump. But, defensively, I think we know the task is at hand, and we got to just do it.\u201d\n\nUSC boasts a perfect 15-0 record whenever Marshall has scored at least 10 points this season.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to winning, I\u2019m going to do whatever it takes for my team, even through the scars, through the bruises,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI\u2019m just looking to be there in ways that they need me to be there.\u201d\n\nIn the teams\u2019 only other meetup this season, USC struggled with foul trouble. It was one foul-out after another in February\u2019s game at Stanford\u2019s Maples Pavilion. Marshall picked up her fifth in the third quarter, and Akunwafo and Davis also fouled out midway through the fourth. That left 5-foot-10 graduate guard Roxane Makolo and 6-foot-1 sophomore guard Taylor Bigby covering the 6-foot-4 Brink.\n\nDespite losing all three of its bigs, USC still outscored Stanford in the second half 36-27 for a nine-point win. USC\u2019s leading scorer, freshman guard JuJu Watkins, claimed 51 of the team\u2019s points, setting a school record against the Pac-12 regular-season champs. Her efforts this season earned her Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honors.\n\nWatkins, who had to temporarily leave Friday\u2019s game against UCLA twice with ankle injuries, is good to go for the all-or-nothing game.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been doing treatment pretty much around the clock,\u201d Gottlieb said after Saturday\u2019s practice. \u201cJuJu is incredibly tough; it\u2019s an overused word, but she\u2019s really, really tough. I expect that she\u2019ll play and give us everything that she has.\u201d\n\nIf JuJu\u2019s career-high 51 is any indicator of what she\u2019ll bring to Sunday\u2019s game, Cardinal fans better tuck that gambling money away and save it for a rainy day.\n\nUSC will face off against Stanford at 2 p.m. Sunday at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n```"}

(Photo by Desirae Ridley)\n\nBy James Bao March 09, 2024 at 11:15 am PST\n\nFinding one specific moment to lead this recap is near impossible. The second-ever double-overtime thriller in the Pac-12 women\u2019s basketball tournament delivered just what the fans wanted \u2014 50 minutes of straight highlight reels. The familiar crosstown rivals weren\u2019t battling on their turf this time, after each team won at home to split their regular-season series. Instead, they took it to Las Vegas for a decisive third meeting this season, where No. 2 seed USC outlasted No. 3 seed UCLA 80-70 to punch a ticket to their first Pac-12 tournament championship game since 2014.\n\n\u201cObviously, words aren\u2019t going to feel like it does it justice,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cWhat an epic evening for women\u2019s college basketball, for our program, for the L.A. rivalry.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, it was far from a smooth-sailing victory for USC. The semifinal matchup settled in 50 minutes, but the first 50 seconds were enough to make Trojan fans hold their breath. That\u2019s when freshman guard phenom JuJu Watkins went down clutching her ankle after a Bruin basket, and was helped into the locker room. Four minutes ticked by with Watkins off the court \u2014 an eternity for USC. But she returned and posted six points right away, propelling the Trojans to a dominant 24-8 first quarter. Watkins would later exit in the first overtime for a couple minutes after another hard fall, but she returned yet again after some time on the bench to help force another added period.\n\n\u201cEven when I went out, I knew I had to get back in because I think my team needed me,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just an ankle. Nothing I\u2019m not used to.\u201d\n\nAfter a scorching start, making nine of their first 16 shots, USC went ice cold. The team only converted 6-of-33 attempts during a brutal shooting drought that lasted into the fourth quarter. This offensive collapse completely dismantled their early lead; UCLA surged back in front in the second quarter, though USC still held a 37-31 halftime advantage.\n\nThe game became a grueling tug-of-war as fatigue crept in on both teams. Their offensive efficiency plummeted, but the Trojans repeatedly found their way to the free-throw line. The reliance on drawing fouls was especially clear in the second half and overtime periods. Out of their 43 total points during this stretch, 22 came from the charity stripe. USC\u2019s combination of physicality and smart defense earned them a significant advantage at the line, attempting a total of 37 free throws compared to UCLA\u2019s 17.\n\n\u201cIt was, like, a bruising, physical game,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cNothing about it was particularly pretty except for the beauty of toughness.\u201d\n\nAnd, indeed, the closing moments of regulation were far from a thing of beauty. As the clock read 1:18 remaining, Watkins found UCLA defenders all over her, as usual. Watkins had three shots to give USC a critical lead \u2014 and missed all of them. A rare block by graduate guard Kayla Padilla meant the Trojans had one more potential game-winning attempt. And of course, the ball found Watkins. But it didn\u2019t stay in her hands for long, as she turned the ball over with 2.1 seconds left. UCLA\u2019s inbound found sophomore guard Kiki Rice, who was matched up against graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis. Rice hesitated, and the final buzzer sounded before a shot could be attempted. Overtime.\n\nThese additional minutes saw even more physicality, but the same fate for the Bruins, as they couldn\u2019t get a shot up before the final buzzer. After a game-tying 3-pointer by graduate guard McKenzie Forbes, Davis\u2019 clutch block on sophomore center Lauren Betts was called a held ball, which gave possession to the Trojans. A Watkins miss on the other end led to a UCLA timeout. Graduate guard Charisma Osborne had the final possession; she dribbled along the baseline but didn\u2019t shoot as time ran out. Double overtime.\n\nThe second extra period finally drew the curtain on the chess match, arguably the best battle of USC\u2019s season. But one team was destined to run out of moves \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t going to be the Trojans. A 13-3 run in the final five minutes for USC put the game out of reach. Watkins finished the game with a game-high 33 points and 10 rebounds, while Forbes poured in 17 points. Despite only eight in the scoring column, Davis came down with a season-high 16 rebounds and was behind some of USC\u2019s most significant moments in the win.\n\n\u201cI cannot say enough words about [Davis and Watkins],\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe stat sheet does not define and properly show how their guts are still lying on that court.\u201d\n\nWatkins also set the new tournament record for points in a game by a freshman, passing the previous record of 31 by USC\u2019s own Cassie Harberts in 2011. Despite shooting just 5-for-18 from the field, Osborne led her team in scoring with 21 points along with five rebounds. The Trojans found success battling for position in the paint, as they kept UCLA\u2019s leading scorer Betts to a meager 16 shot attempts in 41 minutes of action. Notably, the UCLA star was held scoreless whenever junior center Clarice Akunwafo guarded her.\n\n\u201cI would imagine we\u2019ll see a lot of Clarice on Sunday with her size,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cC is an incredible athlete, pound for pound, physically, she\u2019s a great individual defender.\u201d\n\nNo. 2 seed USC\u2019s win sets a final matchup on Sunday at 2 p.m. against No. 1 seed Stanford at MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n```"}

Stanford had a first-round bye, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been a cakewalk for the Cardinal. They battled it out in a comeback win against Cal on Thursday after trailing by nine in the second quarter.\n\nThe Cardinal faced a similar fate Friday. The team was fired up at the start of the game, going on an 8-0 run with the help of senior forward Cameron Brink\u2019s three consecutive baskets. However, after a layup by Jump, the Beavers shifted gears and presented Stanford with a 17-2 run of their own. Oregon State sophomore forward Raegan Beers found her groove down low and contributed four layups to the Beavers\u2019 run, three of those in just under a minute.\n\nThe first quarter quickly became a familiar start for the Cardinal, who found themselves trailing by 12. Halfway through the second quarter, sophomore forward Timea Gardiner sank two free throws to push the Beaver margin to a comfortable 16 points. That was the last time the Beavers would score for the rest of the half.\n\nEven after holding Oregon State scoreless for the last five minutes of the first half, Stanford found itself in a moment of deja vu, trailing by the same margin as it was Thursday against Cal at the half. In that previous spot, the Cardinal turned it around in the third quarter and outscored the Bears by 22 in the second half to win 71-57.\n\n\u201cI hope that being down at halftime is not a habit of our team,\u201d head coach Tara VanDerveer said postgame. \u201cBut I\u2019m really excited. I think that this can be a game that can really help us a lot, being down and being able to battle back.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s and Friday\u2019s games were the only time all season Stanford has trailed at the half in consecutive games. With Cardinal fans hoping for a replay of Thursday\u2019s storyline, Stanford took a lead at the 4:33 mark of the third quarter, just 15 seconds later than it did the same against Cal.\n\nThe duo of Jump and junior forward Brooke Demetre each scored eight points in the third quarter, the same as the Beavers\u2019 total. Demetre\u2019s consecutive 3-pointers helped flip the Cardinal\u2019s three-point deficit into a nine-point lead that eventually carried them to victory.\n\n\u201cMy thing is just always being ready and getting my shot within the offense,\u201d Demetre said. \u201cWe needed shots at that point. And definitely after I shot them, I felt a momentum shift. ... It\u2019s exciting, but just doing what I need to do for the team.\u201d\n\nBrink, the Pac-12 Play of the Year, also contributed her fair share and was just one assist away from a triple-double: 16 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists.\n\nStanford now has a 7-0 all-time record against Oregon St. in the Pac-12 tournament. Sunday\u2019s championship game at 2 p.m. will be Stanford\u2019s chance to redeem itself, having lost to UCLA in last year\u2019s tournament semifinals.

There is no area for submission of new applications nor context for future steps.\n\nSimilarly, for students pursuing multiple degrees, the Exceptional Funding program covers more than 18 units during the respective fall and spring semesters and/or eight units max for summer. \u201cWe assess our programs on an ongoing basis to ensure we are providing the best support for the largest number of students,\u201d the Office of Academic Programs wrote in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cUSC continues to offer an exceptional range of resources to support academics. Students should consult with their advisors to get information about available opportunities.\u201d\n\nThey confirmed over email that around 2% of undergraduates qualify for AAA, that is at least 400 students. This decision has left many students disappointed, especially those trying to complete two majors in a span of just four years. \u201cMy academic plan was made with AAA. If I want to graduate [now], I have to go more in debt,\u201d said Coby Russo, a sophomore studying public relations and theater. \u201cI can\u2019t graduate with my double major in 4 years without [the AAA scholarship.]\u201d\n\nIn addition to Russo, other students claim that they did not receive the email and instead found out via social media. Upon reaching out to the university asking whether the email was sent out to the entire student body, the Office of Academic Programs confirmed the information was relayed first to academic advisors who then shared with impacted students.\n\n\u201cWith the information that we do know it is disappointing to see a program that has helped students with their academic endeavors come to an end,\u201d said Bryan Fernandez and Brianna Sanchez emphasizing this is their opinion as students in a statement to Annenberg Media. However, in their role as USG president and vice president elect, the duo would like to speak to students to gauge how this will impact the community. \u201cWe will definitely keep the opinion of students at the forefront of our advocacy work.\u201d\n\nCurrently a  change.org  petition circulating among USC undergraduate students is calling on the administration to \u201creconsider their decision but also ensure that all current students who had factored AAA into their plans receive the opportunity to apply for the funds they were promised.\u201d The petition was started anonymously and at the time of publishing had 1401 signatures; it urges students to email the USC Board of Trustees in response to the decision.\n\n\u201cUSC prides itself in these opportunities,\u201d said Klarrisa Palacios, a sophomore studying law, history and culture, and consumer behavior. \u201cBut by taking away the academic honors fellowship and the Academic Achievement Award, it directly negates that statement.\u201d```"}

If you\u2019re a fan of basketball, you know the name Caitlin Clark. The Iowa senior guard needs no introduction, but if you haven\u2019t heard of her, she has become the leading face of college basketball, recently  surpassing the NCAA Division 1 women\u2019s  all-time scoring record on February 15 and becoming the NCAA D1 all-time  leading scorer on March 3 . After Clark broke these records, I, along with numerous other basketball enthusiasts, took to social media to consume and appreciate official edits, slow-motion replays and multimedia graphics of Caitlin Clark\u2019s accomplishments. Just as I knew it would, the praise and recognition for Clark warmed my heart. However, I couldn\u2019t help but be slightly bothered by more pessimistic remarks. Under  Instagram posts by the Big Ten  simply celebrating Clark\u2019s game marking her 3,685 career points (exceeding the 3,667-point record held by LSU\u2019s \u201cPistol\u201d Pete Maravich), people were not so supportive. [theshoe_2004] wrote, \u201cShe broke the women\u2019s record, not the men\u2019s. Playing with [a] smaller ball, it\u2019s obviously easier to make it into the same sized hoop the men use.\u201d Another user said, \u201cPete had a bigger ball, more competition, only played for 3 years, and he didn\u2019t even have the 3-point line.\u201d Yet another faceless account commented, \u201cWhoever made this post is [g]uaranteed a bitter feminist who can\u2019t accept reality haha.\u201d It is futile to entertain or to engage with keyboard warriors. I know I shouldn\u2019t. After all, this type of online contempt isn\u2019t exclusive to women\u2019s basketball. Whenever you dive into hot-button topics in sports like LeBron versus MJ, the role of politics, or betting and fixing games, strangers often turn vicious and tend to spew hatred from a computer. But these comments under the post about Clark do not circulate a new narrative. In fact, those words and those sentiments speak to a larger discussion and attitude towards women\u2019s sports and, more specifically, the quality of women\u2019s sports compared to men\u2019s sports. Too many people believe the quality of female athletes is lacking. Too many people believe that the athletic ability in women\u2019s sports just doesn\u2019t stack up to that of men\u2019s sports. Too many people believe women\u2019s sports aren\u2019t worth watching. A  2021 Purdue study  found that since 1989, coverage of women\u2019s sports has received around 5% of airtime on network news channels, sometimes seeing small spikes around select major events. These quick segments are classified as \u201cone-and-done\u201d stories, as they are eclipsed by thorough male sports coverage, either in-season, out-of-season or comedic segments that are irrelevant to sports itself. There is a debate that women\u2019s sports are televised less simply because there is less interest in the sport, but in order for there to be interest in the women\u2019s sports, it has to be readily accessible. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a cyclic process. Additionally, mainstream media tends to focus on tangential aspects of these athletes\u2019 lives. In postgame press conferences, questions may target weight, clothing or love life.  This video  shows the stark disparity in treatment when male athletes are asked questions typically posed to their female counterparts. These male athletes are uncomfortable and disrespected, and it\u2019s only then do we start to see the absurdity directed towards women\u2019s sports. Another issue is the representation of female athletes.  A 2019 article compared the depiction  of Olympic athletes in Sports Illustrated and found that female athletes are portrayed in passive poses with emphasis on aesthetics. In this way, they\u2019re not viewed as athletes. Conversely, male athletes are portrayed in action, exuding the very essence of strength. This distinction in appearance versus capability points to this diminished value of female athletes. I believe people should watch women\u2019s sports for the same reasons we love watching sports in general. There\u2019s tension, heartbreak and intelligence. These are universal moments that resonate with everyone. Serena Williams has shown us the definition of a comeback. Simone Biles has shown us what true dominance looks like. This incessant need for comparison is frustrating. Pete Maravich made history. Caitlin Clark is making history. Both players have pushed the boundaries of achievement in their respective eras. Both players\u2019 journeys required masterful dedication and polished skill. I don\u2019t intend to force you to watch women\u2019s sports. I am not trying to coerce you into turning on the WNBA or the USWNT as a quota. Similarly, I am not trying to villainize those of you who are avid fans of the NBA or the Premier League. Whichever leagues and teams you choose to watch are your personal prerogative. But to those who vehemently ridicule and refuse to watch women\u2019s sports in the name of superiority, I implore you to reexamine your prejudices. \u201cSports Mythbusters\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Kelsey Goldbach)\n\nBy Kelsey Goldbach\nMarch 08, 2024 at 3:30 pm PST\n\nWhen George Clinton swaggered onstage, the entire crowd of Bovard Auditorium leapt to their feet for a roaring standing ovation. The 82-year-old GRAMMY winner and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee donned a flashy red rhinestone hat and floor-length sequined black and white coat that gleamed against the stage lights every time he moved.\n\nClinton is the musical mastermind behind Parliament-Funkadelic, referred to lovingly by many as \u2018P-Funk,\u2019 a band that exemplified an eccentric sort of Afrofuturism that shook the rock world with a new sound \u2013 funk. Iconic songs like \u201cAtomic Dog,\u201d \u201cFlashlight,\u201d \u201cKnee Deep,\u201d \u201cMaggot Brain\u201d and \u201cOne Nation Under a Groove\u201d comprise merely a fraction of the legacy Clinton will leave behind.\n\nLegacy was a central theme in his appearance at Pop Conference on March 7. Clinton spoke with renowned journalist, writer and editor Danyel Smith in the keynote discussion. The conference, which is entering its 22nd year, features over 40 talks, roundtables and panels.\n\nSmith was able to ask Clinton about Parliament-Funkadelic\u2019s origins, influences and how he made his mark on the music industry. P-Funk came to be as a result of the doo-wop music that Clinton grew up hearing in 1950s New Jersey. \u201cDelinquent\u201d sound, Clinton recalled, was all the rage from The Temptations and Gladys Knight and the Pips, to Little Richard and Elvis Presley.\n\nIt was with their influence that in the early 1960s, a teenaged Clinton formed Parliament. The group initially conformed to the style of the time with matching suits and coordinated dance steps \u2014the latter of which Clinton was still able to mime when Smith played one of Parliament\u2019s oldest songs.\n\nThough the band was passed on by Motown in the late 1960s, Clinton took on the role of songwriter and producer. Parliament\u2019s first hit, \u201cTestify,\u201d was produced by one of Detroit\u2019s independent labels.\n\nBut as Beatlemania swept the nation and rock bands like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin dethroned doo-wop, Clinton felt it was time for a change. \u201cI went completely off. They [the other band members] did it one by one; they still tried to keep the suits together and all that. But I just went for it, because I knew we had to change [...]. They were calling it \u2018the hippie [look].\u2019 It was like practicing being poor,\u201d Clinton laughed.\n\nWith P-Funk\u2019s new look \u2014which sometimes, he recalled, included a cut-up Holiday Inn bed sheet worn as a poncho or a towel pinned and tied like a diaper\u2014 Clinton came into his own as a producer. His unique style of voice manipulation and music mixing are defining features of that P-Funk sound.\n\nThe heavy bassline and electronic bounce is distinctly Clinton/P-Funk \u2014the kind that makes the listener want to \u201ctake their shoes off and kick up their feet.\u201d The revolutionary stylistic methods, in combination with classical stylings of expert keyboardist and Julliard-trained founding member of P-Funk Bernie Worrell, kick-started the psychedelic era that P-Funk is most known for.\n\nThe band, founded and joined by formally educated or otherwise exceptionally talented songwriters, musicians and producers, quickly found their rhythm. 1971\u2019s \u201cMaggot Brain\u201d was produced in only two days.\n\nBut some of their risque material, often toeing the line between hilarious and vulgar, was a point of contention with their record label. The song \u201cPromentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad (The Doo Doo Chasers)\u201d was one such example.\n\n\u201cThe record label made us pay [the fees] out of our pocket, but I wanted it. I wanted it on there. It [the album] had to have some kind of shit on it,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI remember the A&R guy said, \u2018why did he mess up \u2018One Nation [Under a Groove],\u2019 now?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to put out an album that I thought was perfect. We always throw something in so somebody says, \u2018why did he do this?\u2019\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cWe felt like we could do anything. Funkadelic usually was very strange. We didn\u2019t try to make straight records with funk.\u201d\n\nThe dynamic sound and expert technique P-Funk is known for can be partially traced to the large number of artists who encompassed the band. P-Funk was like a revolving door, with many musicians (some known and others nameless) circulating in and out of the band over the years.\n\nClinton recalled a story in which a young man off the street offered to play a guitar solo for $25. The lick wound up on the \u201cGet Off Your Ass and Jam\u201d record.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment that sound came on, he hit that note. He played from top to bottom without stopping,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cNobody could say the word. I was gonna give him more, but he was gone so quick! We never found out who he was.\u201d\n\nMany groups spawned as a result of P-Funk\u2019s connections and broader influence, such as Zapp & Roger \u2013 who are most well known for their hits like \u201cI Want to Be Your Man\u201d and \u201cMore Bounce to the Ounce,\u201d as well as their influential use of the talk-box.\n\n\u201cMore Bounce to the Ounce,\u201d released in 1980, was where the technique of sampling really hit its stride, Clinton explained. Sampling refers to the use of a portion of another song in a new track. At that time, sample machines were not as widely available.\n\n\u201cWe literally had to cut the tape. That baseline is only five seconds long; we cut it out of another song called \u2018Funky Bounce,\u2019 which was on Zapp\u2019s first album. I didn\u2019t hear a hit single on the record at first, but that baseline was so infectious,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cRoger [Troutman] wasn\u2019t even there when we did it because he had [already] given me that one \u2013 it was ready to put out. We got the [new] groove, I called him in and told him to play his \u2018West Montgomery\u2019 licks that he liked to play. And that was the whole song. We just did [sang] \u201cMore Bounce,\u201d and he [Roger] did the harmony with the talk-box on the mono and the guitar.\u201d\n\nSmith also asked Clinton about the challenges of being an artist and musician in the age of social media. In the 1970s and 1980s, Clinton explained, they would go on the air and \u201cclown with the DJs\u201d to garner attention for their music. But because of the relative decline in nationwide listenership for radio programs over the past 50 years, the way in which artists market their music has changed.\n\nSocial media platforms like TikTok have replaced those traditional outlets for promotion. Clinton himself sometimes uses TikTok with his grandkids (who, he said, affectionately call him \u201cGranddude\u201d). He even has a Patreon account where fans can get access to unreleased cuts from \u201cOne Nation Under a Groove,\u201d \u201cMaggot Brain\u201d and \u201cThe Mothership Connection,\u201d among others.\n\nThroughout the talk, Smith asked Clinton multiple times when he figured out that he could sing (and decided that he wanted to share his voice with the world). But with so many stories to tell and songs to discuss, the audience didn\u2019t really get the full answer until the final few minutes of their conversation.\n\n\u201cThere was a guy right on Hollywood Boulevard, he was singing \u2013 an old guitar player who was about 65 or 70 years old. I told him to teach me his song. And I actually recorded that song with this guy. And we weren\u2019t going to actually follow the song like that,\u201d Clinton recalled about one of his most formative moments.\n\n\u201cWe kind of went [as if] I knew what I was doing. And so I started to get [into] singing without a character \u2013 I was in characters all the time. But, during \u2018One Nation [Under a Groove],\u2019 that was momentum. I was feeling so good \u2013 on top of the world.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 Pop Conference will continue throughout various locations on USC\u2019s campus until Saturday, March 9.\n```"}

We are entering the last quarter of the NBA regular season, and former USC men\u2019s basketball players have been getting into the groove for possible postseason action. They are hoping to end the regular season in great form before May hits. However, only four former Trojans suited up on NBA floors within the past week. This week, we will be highlighting two Southern California-born Trojans and former draft lottery picks in the first week of March.\n\nDeMar DeRozan\n\nThe Chicago Bulls have been heavily reliant on the scoring output of six-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan. The Compton native has scored in the double-digits for 21 consecutive games, dating back to the middle of January. Deebo has averaged nearly 27 points per game in the past seven days of NBA action. In the 61 games that he has suited up, DeRozan has scored 20-plus points in 44 of them.\n\nHowever, DeRozan started the month of March off cold. In a division matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks, the former Raptor and Spur notched a measly 12 points in a 16-point loss. He also dished out nine assists, the sixth game this season where Deebo has dealt out nine-plus dimes.\n\nThe 15-year veteran forward showed how valuable he is for the Bulls three nights later against the Kings. DeRozan scored 19 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter to help Chicago secure a massive victory in Sacramento. He recorded a true shooting percentage of 95.5% in an efficient three-level shooting clinic.\n\nThe 34-year-old proved his clutch gene yet again on March 6 against the Utah Jazz. DeRozan scored 17 points in the fourth quarter and 29 points in total in a two-point victory in Utah. He complemented that scoring masterclass with seven assists and six boards.\n\nIn the second night of a back-to-back, the Bulls traveled to San Francisco to take on the Golden State Warriors. DeRozan scored 33 points, including a crucial and-one with 26 seconds left on the clock to secure the Bulls a third consecutive victory.\n\nThe Bulls currently sit in ninth place in the Eastern Conference with a play-in berth likely to be secured in the future, and they hope DeRozan can propel the team to clinch a playoff spot in the next six weeks.\n\nEvan Mobley\n\nIn the 2023-24 season, Evan Mobley has averaged his lowest minutes per game (31) in his career. However, his shooting efficiencies have escalated at all three levels. Despite only suiting up 38 times this season, Mobley has proved how valuable he is for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have reached as high as the second seed in the Eastern Conference when he has been available.\n\nMobley and the Cavaliers began last week in Detroit, taking on the Pistons. In almost 35 minutes played, the former Pac-12 Player of the Year made seven of his 13 shot attempts on his way to 22 points. He also collected 17 rebounds and dished out seven assists in a double-digit victory over their Central Division rivals.\n\nThe former No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 draft returned back to Cleveland on March 3 against the New York Knicks, a rematch from last year\u2019s first-round playoff matchup. The 22-year-old scored 13 points and coupled it with 13 rebounds. It was his third double-double in as many games, but the Cavaliers eventually fell short against the Knicks.\n\nThings would go from bad to worse for Mobley and Cleveland against the Boston Celtics. In a matchup between the No. 1 seed and the No. 3 seed, the former Trojan would only play 22 minutes \u2013 and score 4 points \u2013 before spraining his ankle, ruling him out for the remainder of the game. The Cavaliers\u2019 power forward is likely to miss extended time after an MRI confirmed the injury. Last year\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year candidate previously missed 21 straight games in December and January due to a knee injury. Mobley and the Cavaliers hope his ankle heals before the playoffs spring up.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Attendees listened to a panel of experts give their thoughts on current political trends and what the results will mean for Americans as the 2024 November Presidential election approaches. The panel, moderated by USC\u2019s Annenberg Media Center Director and Professor of Professional Practice of Journalism Christina Bellantoni, featured eight experts in political science and public affairs. The casual and interactive event aimed to provide students with expert political analysis as polling results rolled in throughout the night. While the event was a great opportunity for students to understand the political and electoral atmosphere that academics are watching closely, the room was not that full throughout the night.\n\nGuests for the panel were prominent journalists with expertise in politics, elections, public affairs and humanities. Among them was Kamy Akhavan, the Executive Director for the Center for Political Future and current professor who was previously CEO of ProCon.org for 14 years and USC Communication and political science professor Tom Hollihan. The panelists shared their thoughts on voter turnout, trends and voting patterns and campaign strategies. One of the biggest thoughts on everyones\u2019 minds was the surprisingly low voter turnout rate seen throughout the election night and the role of young voters. Throughout the night the message was clear: more people need to show up to the polls.\n\nMuch of the panel expressed the uniqueness of the turnout. Award winning political journalist and senior fellow at USC\u2019s Annenberg Center for Communication Leadership and Policy Jessica Yellin said, \u201cLower turnout in California is happening, we\u2019ve seen lower voting rates now than during the midterms.\u201d Akhavan stressed the need for younger generations to show up and make their voices heard urging,\u201dGen Z if you want to show up and make an impact in an election, this is the time to do it.\u201d Danielle Cendejas, a partner at The Strategy Group, explained what lower voter turnout means for this election and election night in November. \u201cControl of power and ideology is on the line,\u201d she said. Akhavan added that the margins between results meant that third-party candidates may hold more importance than in years before.\n\nWhen it comes to how the votes will split between candidates within parties, Yellin said, \u201cA lot of Nikki Haley voters are saying they will not vote for Trump or Biden in November.\u201d The low turnout has become a major concern for all parties involved as it seems to indicate a shift in the public\u2019s opinion and feelings towards voting. The extent to which voters vote is a reflection of the current political times. Eric Schmeltzer, President of Winning Progressive, his independent public relations firm, says, \u201cWhen I see polling now, I tend to see it as a snapshot of time.\u201d\n\nAs Bellantoni put it, this lack of interest creates a circular pattern with no clear result. \u201cIf everyone just shrugs and thinks \u2018I\u2019ve seen this before and I\u2019m not going to show up\u2019 then nothing changes,\u201d Bellantoni said, \u201cthe lack of turnout is leaving operatives worried not just for who ends up winning but also for engagement, part of the whole issue is you want people to be engaged. You want an electorate that has people thinking about who their leaders are and how they can get engaged.\u201d There is also the idea of political exhaustion among the public. Jane Coaston, a fellow at USC and a writer for the New York Times, said, \u201cI think that in some ways, you\u2019ve seen exhaustion from the American electorate and you see that in people\u2019s interest in news going down...I think that what we\u2019re seeing right now is an electorate that is just tired of literally everyone involved in politics, tired of the concept of politics.\u201d\n\nCoaston also references Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign strategy of allowing voters to not think too much about him in day to day life. \u201cIf you elect me, you can forget about me,\u201d says Coaston about the promise of the Joe Biden election,\u201dIt was one of his biggest appeals.\u201d Bellantoni shared the discrepancies between student opinions on campus and results at the polls. \u201cThe majority of them did it [vote] at the Village... not one voted for Adam Schiff, so it tells me that these two candidates are not representative of all of you and what your votes are.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the night there was a clear consensus that the lack of voter participation and political interest of students and Americans poses a real threat for November elections and the future of politics nationwide.\n```"}

The tournament began on Wednesday with a dozen contenders. Oregon, Washington, Washington State and Arizona State were knocked out in the first round, leaving eight schools hunting for the championship.\n\nNo. 4 Oregon State vs. No. 5 Colorado\nThe Beavers outlasted the Buffaloes 85-79 in the first-ever Pac-12 tournament double-overtime game. Colorado\u2019s junior center Aaronette Vonleh scored what could be considered the most stylish basket of her career halfway through the second quarter. A pass from Vonleh seemed destined for an easy two points as it headed for graduate guard Maddie Nolan, who was open in the post. But, dramatically, the fingertips of Oregon State sophomore forward Raegan Beers grazed the ball, launching it into the sky. Then, what seemed like a Beavers steal, tragically, landed in their own basket.\n\nHowever, the unlucky points against the Beavers didn\u2019t slow them down at all. In fact, they fueled an Oregon State 10-0 run to shrink an 11-point deficit into a mere one-point margin by the end of the first quarter. The energy of the orange-clad fans was impossible to ignore and vastly outnumbered their opponents. Their cheers drowned out any opposing chants \u2014 a morale booster for any team, especially in a neutral arena.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of the sea of orange that we played in front of today,\u201d Oregon State head coach Scott Rueck said. \u201cIt was amazing to see \u2014 not surprising if you\u2019ve been around a while; it\u2019s kind of what Beaver Nation does for us.\u201d\n\nFive Beavers cracked double figures in scoring. Leading the way was Beers with a double-double of 27 points and 13 rebounds, which were both game-highs. Buffaloes graduate guard Jaylyn Sherrod was overcome with emotion in the postgame conference and attributed the team\u2019s loss to her personal turnovers and game management down the stretch. But head coach JR Payne came to her defense.\n\n\u201cCoaches and point guards get all the blame and all the glory. Anytime things don\u2019t go our way, it\u2019s hers and my fault usually. And when things go well, we also get a pat on the back,\u201d Payne said. \u201cThere were a hundred different plays that happened tonight that could have changed the outcome of the game.\u201d\n\nSherrod posted a team-high 23 points along with six rebounds and seven assists.\n\nNo. 1 Stanford vs. No. 8 Cal\nThe Golden Bears stunned the Cardinal early, handing them their largest halftime deficit of the season. But Stanford took the second half by storm, cruising to a 71-57 victory. Packed with history, these two rivals met for their third matchup this season and their ninth encounter in Pac-12 tournament history. Stanford fans likely broke a sweat in the first half, which must be an unfamiliar feeling this season given the team\u2019s 27-4 overall record and No. 2 national ranking.\n\nPac-12 Player and Defensive Player of the Year Cameron Brink found herself in early foul trouble, picking up three personals by halftime. She also struggled offensively, shooting just 1-for-8 from the field in eight minutes of action.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be very happy at halftime sitting here,\u201d Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer said. \u201cBut [in] the second half our team really stepped up.\u201d\n\nAlthough disjointed in the first half, the Cardinal showed why they\u2019re the No. 1 seed in the second half. They outscored the Golden Bears 43-21 and shot 50% from the field while limiting Cal to just 21.4%.\n\nDespite falling to their opponent, Cal head coach Charmin Smith was proud of how her team performed.\n\n\u201cWe talked about bringing the fight to them, and I thought in the first two games we were very passive. We let them do things. We let them dictate. We were reactive,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIn this game, I thought we were the opposite. We were the aggressor. We dictated. We got some of their best players in foul trouble. We were aggressive. We were attacking. We were scoring. It\u2019s exactly what we wanted.\u201d\n\nStanford and Oregon State will meet in Friday\u2019s first semifinal game at 5 p.m.\n\nNo. 3 UCLA vs. No. 6 Utah\nThe final game of the quarterfinals stamped an all-chalk bracket two days into the tournament, with the higher-seeded Bruins defeating the Utes 67-57. Depth is a major strength for UCLA. The Bruins have one of the deepest teams in the conference, with almost four players averaging at least 12 points this season.\n\n\u201cAll 12 players, you have to guard us,\u201d senior forward Angela Dugali\u0107 said. \u201cWe all have different things that we\u2019re really good at. You take away one thing, we\u2019ve got another thing.\u201d\n\nDuali\u0107 poured in a season-high 17 points for the Bruins, including another season-high three 3-pointers. It wasn\u2019t hard to tell that both teams left everything out on the floor, shown by their consistent hustle and physicality. Despite going down twice with injuries, Utah\u2019s junior guard In\u00eas Vieira went back out both times after taking a short break. Senior forward Alissa Pili explained that that\u2019s how Vieira got her nickname.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they call her the Mosquito,\u201d Pili said. \u201cNo matter how many times you try to swat it away, it just keeps coming back.\u201d\n\nFive Utes played 30-plus minutes and four of them scored in double-digits. Pili led the team in scoring with 16 points and five rebounds.\n\nWith UCLA heading into the semifinals, it sets up a familiar crosstown rivalry away from Los Angeles Friday at 7:30 p.m. The Trojans and the Bruins will battle it out for a spot in the final.\n\nBefore the quarterfinals began, the Pac-12 honored USC\u2019s redshirt freshman Aaliyah Gayles as the first-ever Tammy Blackburn Inspiration Award recipient. Gayles suffered multiple gunshot wounds during a house party in 2022 and underwent multiple surgeries to repair the damage. Nonetheless, she signed with USC from her hospital bed. The honor recognizes women\u2019s basketball players, coaches and staff within the conference who have shown bravery, resilience and an inspiring spirit in the face of personal adversity. The award\u2019s namesake, Tammy Blackburn, is a veteran Pac-12 Network broadcaster and former basketball player for San Diego State who has been battling breast cancer since 2017.\n\nAs a tradition, the \u201cThrees for Equality\u201d program is happening again this year. The Pac-12 partners with Pacific Premier Bank to donate $150 for every 3-pointer made in the tournaments. The money will directly support organizations focusing on social injustice to make an impact beyond the court. Teams have made a combined 90 threes over two rounds, totalling $13,500 dollars raised thus far.\n```"}

The Trojans were able to seek revenge on the Sun Devils after falling to them on the road earlier this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you have your full roster, including your two leading scorers. Losing the two of them was devastating for our Pac-12 season,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cI am proud of the guys mentally; they have stuck together.\u201d\n\nTrojan fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis scored a game-high 28 points, shooting 75 percent from beyond the arc. \u201cHe looked [like] the guy we all have known and expect, but he has come along with his decision-making, defense and scoring,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nTrojan junior forward Kobe Johnson scored 15 points, adding four rebounds and two assists. Sun Devils graduate guard Jose Perez scored a team-high 25 points.\n\nThe Trojans could not have gotten off to a better start, led by Ellis controlling the offensive tempo and sinking two early threes. USC\u2019s sticky man-to-man defense created early problems for the Sun Devils, forcing them into contested shots. Defense led to offense for the Trojans, as they converted the Sun Devils\u2019 turnovers into points on the other end.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 free-flowing offense helped them take an early nine-point lead halfway through the first. However, offensive inconsistency has been a struggle all season for the Trojans. After controlling the pace to start the game, USC\u2019s offense went cold, going scoreless for six straight minutes.\n\nThe Sun Devils finally found a rhythm on offense, going on a 14-0 run to take their first lead at the 7:21 mark in the first half. USC\u2019s mistakes were the key to the Sun Devils regaining their momentum. Like the Trojans\u2019 early success, the Sun Devils converted when the Trojans coughed up the ball. By halftime, the Trojans had turned the ball over seven times, leading to nine Sun Devil points.\n\nAfter trailing by as many as five points in the final five minutes of the first half, the USC offense picked back up. Late buckets from freshman guard Isaiah Collier and Johnson had the Trojans and Sun Devils squared after one half, 32-32.\n\nThe offensive showdown did not slow for Arizona State or USC heading into the second half. Ellis stole the show with a barrage of threes, scoring 20 of his 28 points in the second frame. Foul trouble forced Enfield to shift around rotations and schemes, leaving the star freshman Collier on the bench for an extended time in the second half. The Trojans had four guys with three or more fouls.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to man, we were committing fouls on dribble penetrations and some dumb fouls,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get in the situation where our backcourt fouled out, so we went zone.\u201d\n\nEven with USC\u2019s 2-3 zone, the Sun Devils still produced 32 points in the paint, as they constantly caught the Trojans sleeping on backdoor cuts. However, the backcourt for USC stepped up in a big way on the boards, out-rebounding the Sun Devils 32-22.\n\nWith the game knotted at 49 at the 12:20 mark, the Trojans\u2019 12-2 run midway through the second half completely changed the game\u2019s tide. In typical fashion, Ellis got fans on their feet, rocking the Galen Center with his uncanny shooting ability from deep. In three minutes, Ellis knocked down three 3-pointers, with each one met by a loud roar from the stands.\n\nThe hot hand of Ellis had Sun Devils coach Bobby Hurley telling his junior guard Frankie Collins to not even let Ellis catch the ball. The Trojans never looked back, holding a lead the rest of the way. Down the stretch, USC had a response for every Sun Devil bucket. The defensive intensity was picked up, by senior center Joshua Morgan and Johnson making key plays to secure the win.\n\n\u201cTonight we did a good job of staying calm, handling the pressure well and maintaining the lead in the second half,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nUSC finished the game shooting a remarkable 50% from the 3-point line, as well as finishing with 18 assists on the night. \u201cWhen we have the ball moving and everybody is making their shots, that\u2019s when we are at our best,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nUSC will conclude regular-season play on Saturday at 7 p.m. against No. 5 Arizona at Galen Center.\n```"}

Sooner than later, palm trees will be swaying to the rhythm of hip-hop beats, beaches will be packed with hoards of college students soaking up the sun, and adrenaline junkies will shred waves like it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. From the neon-lit streets of Miami to the sand castles of Punta Cana, college kids\u2019 spring break scene is a non-stop hype train. It\u2019s all about living large, drinking a ton and making memories that\u2019ll last a lifetime.\n\nBut, this time around, spring break might look a little different. Earlier this month, the city of Miami announced that it will be \u201cbreaking up\u201d with spring break. The city will impose new rules in hopes of preventing the chaos that comes with hundreds and thousands of intoxicated teenagers on the beach. There will be new curfews, DUI checkpoints, closure of parking lots and bag checks at beaches, to name a few. And whether directly affected by it or not, we found that not as many people will be flying to Florida.\n\n\u201cI actually didn\u2019t have plans,\u201d USC junior William David said. \u201cLast week, I decided to get Rolling Loud tickets...Other than that, no clue.\u201d David feels like there\u2019s already so much to explore in Los Angeles. As a big music aficionado, he is more than happy to stay and experience his first big music festival \u2014 he already started shopping for a CamelBak and is working out to stay fit for four brutal days of moshing.\n\n\u201cI would like to be here,\u201d David said. \u201cI\u2019m new to LA. So there\u2019s just feels like there\u2019s so much potential and so many options for me. And so I\u2019m really excited about that and would rather stay here than go home or see friends that are mostly on the East Coast.\u201d\n\nWhile he is still unsure of his plans following Rolling Loud, he is thinking about sunbathing in Santa Monica or driving north on the Pacific Coast Highway. The scenery makes the drive worth it, he says.\n\nThese sentiments were also shared by Vittoria Corvelli, a sophomore at USC. She will be hosting three of her closest friends over for the week and taking them to her favorite places around L.A. While nothing is set in stone, she knows she will spend the first Saturday of the break going out with ten of her friends on a fun Korean Barbecue night. Hiking the Hollywood sign and hitting the beach are also in consideration.\n\n\u201c[In Los Angeles], we\u2019re able to explore more and do a bunch of different stuff like have a relaxing chill day at the beach, but then also go walk around the city,\u201d Corvelli said.\n\nWhile students are staying in L.A., there are also students flying in to visit. Joey Scannapico touched down in California last night from Penn State University to visit his friend. Kyumin Shin also flew from New York to stay at his former high school teammate\u2019s apartment. They both explained that staying at their friends\u2019 houses alone has saved them a lot of money.\n\nL.A., for all its tourist attractions and sun-lit beaches, is still not the same popular spring break destination that Florida always was. But changes are happening and it\u2019s worth noting before you book your next flight.\n\nA yellow brick road illuminating spring break\n\nBy: Myriam-Fernanda Alcala Delgado\n\nAdd this calendar to yours. By pressing the blue icon, a calendar fills the screen with a flight scheduled northbound, Pike\u2019s market tour, museums and queer nightlife. For this friend group, there is just one short day left before stepping foot in emerald city.\n\nAs week nine of classes winds down, students at the University of Southern California make last minute Target stops for travel size goods. It\u2019s spring break.\n\nWhile travel has started to kick back up since Covid-19 first hit in 2020, the week-long vacation is a long awaited tradition welcomed with open arms. Due to school and internships, Seattleile Au Chung has spent the last few years in Los Angeles. Though their packed schedule being a junior double majoring in political science and public relations takes up most of their time, Chung has spent past spring breaks exploring the angel city. This time around, they\u2019re excited to be able to show their hometown to friends.\n\nUnlike L.A. the northern city is rainy and overcast, \u201cit makes for a community that focuses on growth, freshness and renewal.\u201d\n\nJoining Chung on the trip are friends they\u2019ve made at the LGBTQ+ Center at USC. Marina Braga is a senior studying electrical and computer engineering, she is regularly seen running in and out of the Center, winning hackathons and networking for post-grad career options. This trip is a break from a busy schedule. She is playing a hands-off, go with the flow role as the thing she is looking forward to the most is being with friends.\n\n\u201cI normally see them [my friends] everyday but it\u2019s very short periods of time.\u201d\n\nSimilarly Jeremiah Lee, senior in pharmacology, wants to spend the trip getting to know their friends better and see them in a space outside of school. In the past, they\u2019ve gone on trips with one or two friends, spending the last break with a group of 15. Au Chung, group enabler and planner, wants to share this part of them to the special group of five. Being from a stormy, green-filled city is special.\n\nMy first year in college was during the pandemic so I spent the break in my hometown of snowy Colorado. The year prior, Mexico City. This will be my first time in Seattle. I met Au Chung at the Center, then Marina, Jeremiah and Claudia. Having a friend group who share similar experiences and identities takes a weight off of traveling to an unfamiliar place.\n\nAs junior communications major, Claudia Regalado, said, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to explain yourself.\u201d Code switching is a common skill learned by queer people in order to maintain safety in places like work, school and sometimes home. The chance to spend time with people you can be your most authentic selves with, is a breath of fresh air from the polluted heteronormativity in most spaces.\n\nOur group leaned into this community aspect by hand making a logo and pressing it onto a t-shirt (like an annoying Disney family). Opting for emerald green, gold and white, the back of each shirt also has a nickname for each member. Even if the ship will not be smooth sailing \u2014Chung ordered XL+ sizes for every member of the group \u2014it will be the memories and laughter which will prevail.\n\nSeattle is a big city. Of course, the Space Needle is a must on the shared google calendar. But, having a member of the group with extensive knowledge of the city, and of queer life there, has been beneficial to not falling into tourist traps. On the itinerary is a Mount Rainier hike (which no one but me, a Colorado snow lover, is ready for). Being away from the boxed-state has been a challenge as I\u2019m ending my senior year, a part of me wishes I was going home. This makes me look forward to the snow filled, forested terrain the most for the trip \u2014though the 36 hour train ride back is a dread.\n\n\u201cIn Seattle, everybody is nicer,\u201d said Chung. \u201cIt\u2019s very communal, some people think it\u2019s granola but I love it.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to REI and hiking sandals with long skirts, I am happy to have been invited on this queer friendly break to the northern part of the U.S. Lee, group expert in night life, sat around the Center table as Chung finished ironing the \u201cfamily\u201d tees listing options for the first night: Drag Show, kink friendly party, disco dance... \u201cDisco dance,\u201d we all agreed.\n\nSpring & Things: USC students share their plans after a hectic semester\n\nGoing out of town or staying local with a dash of self care tips.\n\nBy: Kaleef Starks\n\nAfter a busy beginning of spring semester, an influx of daily emails, stiff classrooms, heavy rain with hints of sunny weather and midterms that crept up \u2014 it\u2019s finally time to enjoy spring break. The one to two week period is recognized by school systems across the country. But how will Trojans enjoy their time off?\n\nNate Kassa, a senior majoring in computer science, is eager to hop on his flight to Paris for spring break. Most would be eager to see the Eiffel Tower, but Kassa is excited about trying French croissants and other pastries from a country known for its deserts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a dessert guy, so any type of pastry, croissant, chocolate croissant, anything that has to do with pastries, I\u2019m all in for it,\u201d said Kassa. \u201cI know it\u2019s a French pastry, so really seeing how it tastes authentically... I\u2019m a foodie and just want to try what\u2019s over there.\u201d\n\nAfter a quick group Facetime call with high school friends to discuss spring break plans and searching for a job in the tech industry without much luck, Kassa is excited to catch a break.\n\n\u201cThe last two weeks in particular, I\u2019ve been really busy, and I\u2019m trying to get a lot of stuff done before I go so I can enjoy my time and not stress at all,\u201d said Kassa.\n\nThe computer science major finds time for self-care by visiting the gym, lifting weights and tuning the world out by listening to music.\n\n\u201cI usually go by myself and lift, and it\u2019s kind of therapeutic for me,\u201d said Kassa.\n\nLike Kassa, Cheska Pangilinan is eager to get her spring break started, too. She will be traveling to four different states\u2014Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, D.C., to visit family members who she hasn\u2019t seen all year. Her first stop is San Antonio, to meet with family and pack for the road. Pangilinan will then head to New Jersey for a brief visit with other family members. After that she will head to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania to go skiing. She\u2019ll wrap up her travels in New York City and Washington, D.C., to visit prominent museums.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s essentially my break. I\u2019m booked and busy,\u201d said Pangilinan. \u201cOh my gosh, It seems like a break, but it also seems a little bit exhausting because we are heading to all of these different states per day.\u201d\n\nAs a senior majoring in environmental studies, Pangilinan enjoys quality time with her family. She is excited, as she and her family have never skied before. With a busy break, Pangilinan has not found much time for self-care but leans on friends to help her cope with the demands of classes.\n\n\u201cIf I have a little bit of time, I hang out with a friend for a piece of mind,\u201d said Pangilinan.\n\nMost students are, in Layman\u2019s terms, \u201cburnt out!\u201d Mental health therapists at USC assist students with having the knowledge and awareness of various forms of self care. Dr. Jessica Kim, Associate Director of Psychiatry Services at USC\u2019s Student Health, has an empirical approach to methods of self-care in three components. Dr. Kim stresses the importance of knowing about self-care methods that enhance physical wellbeing, social well being and psychological well being.\n\nDr. Kim also recommends that students apply the Pomodoro Technique in order to capitalize on time management and self-care simultaneously. The technique consists of setting a timer and working for 25\u201330 minutes while quickly following up with a five to ten minute break. During breaks, it is recommended that students take a walk outside, do a power nap or do another activity that allows their mind to rest.\n\n\u201cSome people think that because they worked so hard during midterm week it\u2019s now time to party, go out, and spend all their time socializing,\u201d said Dr. Kim. \u201cBut they\u2019re not fully recovering. They\u2019re actually just filling up all that time they were studying with now, just going out instead of finding rest for themselves.\u201d\n\nSleep is also an essential tool that Dr. Kim suggests students keep in their self-care tool bag. After a busy semester, most students are running on fumes and getting about six hours of sleep a night. While it is commonly recommended that people aim to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep a night, Dr. Kim highlights how \u201cthere\u2019s so much research that shows that lack of sleep can cause various medical issues and trigger mental health issues.\u201d\n\nSpring break plans and self-care go hand in hand. USC students will have a week to relax their minds as the semester trickles down to the end.\n\nSpring Breakers are switching their destinations this year\n\nA look inside the newest hot spots for spring break travel\n\nBy: Cierra Morgan\n\nStudents at the University of Southern California have chosen an array of destinations for their spring break vacation this year instead of the predictable yet stimulating Mango Deck on Cabo San Lucas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to London to visit my friends that are abroad,\u201d said Junior Jewel Abdo. \u201cFor spring break, I\u2019m going to London, Madrid, and Dublin,\u201d said junior Josh Flowers. \u201cI\u2019m visiting Europe for the first time in London this spring break with one of my roommates,\u201d said junior Alex Palakian.\n\nEurope has replaced Cabo San Lucas as the new hot spot for USC spring breakers, specifically the junior class. The pique of interest in planning a \u201cEuroTrip\u201d has to do with students wanting to visit friends studying abroad for the semester. What better time to pay them a visit than spring break?\n\n\u201cI definitely think a ton of juniors are going to be visiting Europe this spring break. I know a lot of people are especially going to London, Spain, and Dublin, of course, for St. Patrick\u2019s Day,\u201d said Palakian.\n\nWith the junior class jet setting off to Europe, the eagerness to experience the little and probably underwhelming things about a foreign country is on replay in students\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most excited about seeing my friends again this semester, but seeing the London telephone booths and meeting people with British accents are also high on my bucket list for this trip,\u201d said Abdo.\n\nVisiting friends abroad and hoping to get a fraction of the serotonin they have from being in Europe all semester was the starting point for a surplus number of students booking tickets to Europe. However, students are getting more passionate about their own journeys, they will be embarking on during the week off.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to experience St. Patrick\u2019s Day in Dublin. This holiday has always been my favorite bar crawling, and all, but real-time pub crawling in Ireland has to be the most college thing I could think to do,\u201d said Flowers.\n\nOne thing that is following students from the beaches of Cabo San Lucas to the streets of Europe is drinking day and night. It wouldn\u2019t be spring break without the booze, right? Taking a flight away from Europe but keeping the drinks afloat, the senior class of USC undergraduates is hitting several places this spring break.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be visiting Cancun this year with a couple of my other senior friends,\u201d said senior Kayla Sarno. \u201cI\u2019m going to D.C. for a few days to see my family and then to Philadelphia and Boston to visit friends from home,\u201d said senior Mateo Gutierrez.\n\nFrom flying back home to the East Coast and making their way down to Mexico, the senior class is on individual journeys this spring break. Maybe by senior year, people get a little sick of vacationing together. Nonetheless, the senior class will still participate in the traditional spring break activities wherever their journey might take them on their week off.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m most excited for is being on the East Coast because I miss it every now and then. Of course, I\u2019m excited for St. Patrick\u2019s Day because I love drinking for holidays, and I don\u2019t know how St. Patrick\u2019s Day is a big drinking holiday, but it is, so I\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d said Gutierrez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Cancun before, but I\u2019m already dreaming of sitting on the beach and relaxing with a pi\u00f1a colada in my hand,\u201d said Sarno.\n\nStudents are definitely in the spring breaker spirit this spring break, with the biggest common factor being distressing a semester\u2019s worth of dreadful assignments with a drink in hand to heal brain overload. With drinking, partying and loosening up this spring break continuing to be key to students\u2019 spring break trips, it may come as a surprise that many students are staying astray from the usual party scene that Cabo San Lucas has to offer; however, Cabo seems to be a destination popular for underclassman rather than older students which is feasible considering there\u2019s only so many times a person can party at El Squid Roe.\n\n\u201cI feel like my entire grade is going to Cabo this year. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not making it, but I can name at least 30 people who are,\u201d said sophomore Andrea Sia.\n\nIn that case, the consensus has been reached. Underclassmen can be seen on the Mango Deck at Cabo San Lucas, and upperclassmen will be experiencing the clubs of Barcelona, cocktails by the beach, and a St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebration that will be unforgettable or forgettable depending on how many shamrock shots are taken.\n\nWhat are your plans? Hopefully, it is something exciting, but in any case, it may be relaxing and thrilling all together.\n\nSpring Break Plans at USC: From exotic travel plans to staying on campus\n\nBy: Peter Makk\n\nAs we get closer to spring break at USC, students are preparing themselves for a week without homework, tests, lectures and a lot of stress. Students have many different ideas and plans for what the break will look like for them.\n\nZena Alkhatib, a senior majoring in economics, will be traveling all the way to Europe to meet some of her friends along the way.\n\n\u201cI am leaving early Wednesday to Madrid, Spain to visit my roommate who is studying abroad this semester,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there for a week, the first half I\u2019ll be in Mallorca, then we do a little boat ride and the second half in Madrid. There will be other USC students as well who are also in the same study abroad program, so it should be a lot of fun!\u201d\n\nSome students started going on trips already before the break even started.\n\n\u201cI will be in Mexico City with some of my friends, we\u2019ll check out the sights, eat good food and chill at the pool. I think we all deserve it,\u201d said freshman business major Adam Brezoczki. \u201cI just came back from Hawaii from kind of like a networking trip. I\u2019m heavily collecting my frequent flier miles.\u201d\n\nWhile some of the students like Alkhatib and Brezoczki are traveling long distances to get to their desired destination, other students seek a shorter trip, closer to Los Angeles.\n\nAbel Santa, a junior studying Neuroscience, plans to go on an adventure nearby to L.A.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go far because I already traveled a lot over the winter break.

(Photo by Desirae Ridley)\n\nBy Riley Sager March 08, 2024 at 12:59 am PST\n\nA first-round bye wasn\u2019t enough to stop the momentum of USC\u2019s successful road trip at the Arizona schools last week. The Trojans extended their hot streak with a 65-62 quarterfinal win against Arizona Thursday night at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nEven after only ten points and eight turnovers in the second quarter, the Trojans maintained their lead until midway through the third, when Arizona scored back-to-back layups. Only a couple minutes later, a 12-2 USC run, including six made free throws, helped secure the Trojans\u2019 lead until the final buzzer. Despite an inconsistent day, a layup by freshman guard JuJu Watkins in the final 30 seconds helped seal it.\n\n\u201cI think I was impressed the most that she had missed the last couple before that and she just \u2014 she knows when it\u2019s winning time and we rely on her,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said of Watkins. \u201cI thought we ended up being toughest when toughness was needed. I\u2019m grateful we get to play again tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans came onto the court with guns blazing. A strong defensive front, including junior center Rayah Marshall, kept the Wildcats off the scoreboard for the first 5:45. Watkins, the newly crowned Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, also had a valuable offensive presence in the first quarter, scoring 10 and bringing the team to an 11-point lead.\n\nThen, the momentum came to a screeching halt. Arizona outscored USC in each of the final three quarters, showing just how valuable that first-quarter advantage was for the Trojans. USC put up some big numbers in the second quarter, but not all were the good kind. The team scored half as many points as the first quarter and tallied 16 turnovers by halftime.\n\nWatkins didn\u2019t make a field goal and turned the ball over four times in the period. She would go on to finish with nine turnovers, her second-most of the season; Watkins also had just 17 points, much less than her season-long average of nearly 28.\n\nGottlieb acknowledged that Watkins\u2019 hard-fought 35 minutes were about more than the stat sheet. \u201cThe poise that she operates with helps our team, the competitiveness helps our team,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe way she interacts with her teammates. I think they have her back and she has theirs ... all things that are really, really impressive.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans cleaned up their act in the second half, cutting their turnovers down to five. Marshall also stepped up with 10 points after the half, finishing the game with a 15-point, 15-rebound double-double.\n\n\u201cAs good as [Marshall] was defensively last year, she\u2019s better this year ... she\u2019s really good but also quarterbacks us,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cLast year, she was just really good and knew what she was doing. But now she knows what everyone\u2019s doing, which is a huge growth.\u201d\n\nWhile Marshall consistently provides on the court as the team\u2019s leading rebounder, her day-to-day awareness and insight are invaluable to the growth of her teammates.\n\nAnother noticeable presence was graduate guard McKenzie Forbes, who ended the night with nine points, four rebounds and five assists.\n\n\u201cI think in every game I\u2019m coming in, my role might change depending on who we\u2019re playing or what kind of coverages they\u2019re in,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cBut I try to adapt as best as I can on the fly, make sure I\u2019m always in communication with Coach G and getting people where they need to be, getting the ball where it needs to go.\u201d\n\nOne of Forbes\u2019 greatest assets is her adaptability, which allows her to efficiently execute in almost any position.\n\nUSC will battle crosstown rival UCLA on Friday at 7:30 p.m. at MGM Grand Garden Arena for a spot in the Pac-12 tournament championship on Sunday.\n```"}

Awards are difficult to predict because they often depend on team performance and narrative. For example, last season, one could argue that Joel Embiid won the MVP award because voters simply grew bored of Nikola Joki\u0107's excellence. That\u2019s not to say Embiid didn\u2019t have an all-time season, but we have to take these sympathies into account.\n\nThat being said, Nikola Joki\u0107 is the front-runner for what would be his third MVP award in four seasons. French sensation Victor Wembanyama is the consensus Rookie of the Year\u2014though Chet Holmgren has earned consideration for the award. All of the other awards\u2014Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved, Sixth Man, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year\u2014are extremely tight at the moment.\n\nWe have about 25 more games to decide every NBA individual honor, which means it\u2019s officially crunch time. Here is a full preview of the upcoming NBA awards as we approach the end of the 2023-24 season regular season:\n\nMVP: Nikola Joki\u0107, Denver Nuggets\nThe league leader in box plus-minus and value-over-replacement player, Nikola Joki\u0107 once again has a well-grounded statistical case to take home his third career MVP. If Joki\u0107 were to sustain his leads in these catch-all categories, 2023-24 would be his fourth season atop those leaderboards. Though the Denver Nuggets seem less interested in pushing for the top seed that would bolster his MVP case, Joki\u0107's impact on team success is undeniable. Denver\u2019s net rating is an obscene 22.0 points per 100 possessions higher with him on the floor, which is easily the top figure in the league among players with at least 500 minutes of court time.\n\nRunner-Up: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s Thunder is currently first in the West, largely due to the 25-year-old guard solidifying himself as perhaps the toughest guard to defend in the league. SGA is on track to average over 30 points per game for the second straight year and also leads the league in steals per game. While Joki\u0107's on-off numbers are better than SGA\u2019s, that largely has to do with the supporting cast that blows leads while Gilgeous-Alexander rests. With Joki\u0107 on the floor, Denver has an excellent plus-10.0 net rating. OKC produces a superior plus-11.7 net rating with SGA in the game. The winner of this battle involving that particular stat depends on the definition of \u201cvaluable.\u201d Valuable can mean many things to various people, but I define valuable as the player whose performance is most excellent in the league.\n\nWorth a mention: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks; Luka Don\u010di\u0107, Dallas Mavericks; Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics\n\nRookie of the Year: Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs\nThe battle for Rookie of the Year between Victor Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren appears to be coming to an end. Wemby and Holmgren just matched up on leap day last week and it was clear that Wembenyama stole the show. Not only did the Spurs beat the Thunder in their third matchup of the season, but Wemby scored 28 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, while Holmgren scored 23 points and only grabbed seven boards. Wemby\u2019s 31 points and his team\u2019s win against the Pacers completed the restoration of order after Holmgren had jumped out to an early-season lead for ROTY.\n\nJust as so many expected when the Spurs used the No. 1 overall pick on the most highlighted prospect in years, Wembenyama is a franchise-making, league-changing star. Wembenyama should also be in the running for Defensive Player of the Year on the strength of his 98th-percentile defensive estimated plus-minus score. Wemby also leads the league in blocks per game and in total, and is on track to become the fourth player in the last 20 years to average at least three blocks and one steal per game. By also averaging 20 points per game, Wemby proves he belongs in his own tier among rookies.\n\nRunner-Up: Chet Holmgren, Oklahoma City Thunder\nHolmgren leads Wembenyama in estimated plus-minus and estimated wins, and he is also doing it for the first-place Thunder, so he deserves credit for contributing to winning basketball. At 17.1 points, 7.8 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 0.7 steals per game, and 2.7 blocks per game, the OKC big man trails Wemby in all five categories. However, Wembenyama is the only rookie this season beating Holmgren across the board in these statistical areas. The key difference between the two is their role on the team. The Thunder don\u2019t task Holmgren with the same level of defensive responsibilities that Wembenyama has and the former Gonzaga Bulldog has great talent around him compared to Wemby\u2019s Spurs teammates. However, Holmgren\u2019s 64.4% true shooting percentage is also well above Wemby\u2019s 56.3%.\n\nWorth a Mention: Brandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors; Dereck Lively II, Dallas Mavericks; Brandon Miller, Charlotte Hornets\n\nSixth Man of the Year: Malik Monk, Sacramento Kings\nNo bench player averages more fourth-quarter points or minutes than Malik Monk\u2014a great way to differentiate his bench contributions from those belonging to the empty stat-padders who always try to go after this award. Monk is not just a low-minute shooter who plays in \u201cgarbage time.\u201d He is one of the Sacramento Kings\u2019 best players and his team wants him on the floor during crunch time and crucial moments. Overall, Monk is putting up 15.1 points and 5.3 assists per game on a solid 44.8/36.7/81.1 shooting split.\n\nRunner-Up: Norman Powell, Los Angeles Clippers\nPowell has drained threes at a career-high 45.6% clip en route to a true shooting percentage that is well above the league average. He has also helped keep the Clippers in a tight race for first place in the Western Conference. Overall, Powell has averaged 13.7 points and 1 assist per outing on a 49.6/45.6/83.1 shooting split.\n\nWorth a Mention: Tim Hardaway Jr., Dallas Mavericks; Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107, Atlanta Hawks; Naz Reid, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDefensive Player of the Year: Rudy Gobert, Minnesota Timberwolves\nRudy Gobert is not the only reason why the Minnesota Timberwolves possess the league\u2019s best defensive rating, but he is by far the biggest. The NBA\u2019s second-best defense belongs to the Cleveland Cavaliers, who allow 110.4 points per 100 possessions, 2.5 more than Minnesota. That difference is bigger than the one separating Cleveland from the eighth-ranked Houston Rockets. While much has been made of Gobert\u2019s growth as a defender in space\u2014a surprising late-career development\u2014his dominance still comes from shutting down looks at the rim. Opponents attempt 5.9 percent fewer shots at point-blank range with Gobert in the game, the best figure of any big man with at least 1,500 minutes on the year.\n\nEven when offensive players muster the nerve to shoot near the basket, the results are worse when Gibert is the primary defender than they are with anyone else swapped into his position. Gobert\u2019s opponent field-goal percentage inside six feet (48.4 percent) is the lowest of any NBA regular. After a year off, Gobert is back to being the most impactful defensive player in the league. He\u2019s a great bet to pick up his fourth DPOY, which would put him in a tie with Ben Wallace and Dikembe Mutombo for the most in NBA history.\n\nRunner-Up: Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs\nWemby\u2019s strong statistical case was already laid out in his ROY campaign section, but there is still more to say about what he does on defense. Wembenyama had more blocks individually than seven entire teams in February. Wemby also possesses the holy trinity of defensive skills: quick feet, long arms, and a relentless motor. Even if he doesn\u2019t win this season, in the long run, he could challenge the aforementioned historical greats for most DPOYs of all time.\n\nWorth a Mention: Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers; Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat; Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nMost Improved Player: Scottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors\nThe Most Improved Player award often lands with someone who added more minutes and touches, but not necessarily new skills, to his game, making it a strange award to judge. Scottie Barnes has been showcasing his \u201cimprovement\u201d by becoming a credible three-point threat after beginning his NBA career as a jump-shooting liability for his first two seasons. Barnes takes about two more long-range shots per game than last season and hits them at a 34.6% clip, which is a huge improvement over his 28.1% mark from the previous season.\n\nBarnes was selected to the All-Star team for the first time this season (as a replacement player) and is now clearly established as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 franchise cornerstone. Barnes distributes the ball more as well, as well as getting to the foul line with increased frequency, and posting a better true shooting percentage with his increased usage rate. The Toronto star has also been more accurate from mid-range and from the charity stripe than he was last season. He is on pace for two-way superstardom thanks to legitimate gains across multiple areas and his incredible size for defense as well.\n\nRunner-Up: Coby White, Chicago Bulls\nThe 24-year-old has seen a career-high 36.3 minutes of action per game, however, his statistical increases are not just tied to his playing time. White was more of a combo guard earlier in his career, but his assist rate spiked from 16.3% last year to 21.5% this season, suggesting he\u2019s closer to a true point guard than many thought. White has also reached the foul line more frequently than ever and has increased his true shooting percentage to a career-best 58.6%. White\u2019s emergence has presented a bright sport amid an otherwise dark year for the Bulls.\n\nWorth a Mention: Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers; Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn, Houston Rockets; Jonathan Kuminga, Golden State Warriors\n\nClutch Player: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\nThough the Warriors just lost by more than 50 points to the Boston Celtics, Stephen Curry still deserves his spot as the Clutch Player front-runner here because his scoring in close-and-late situations has been remarkable. No other player else comes close to his 165 clutch points. Curry has shot 50.5% from the field and 47.5% from deep in clutch situations. His 28 made threes in crunch time is more than the next two most prolific late-game sharpshooters\u2013\u2013Buddy Hield with 11 and Derrick White with 10\u2014combined. Seeing as almost no player gets more defensive attention than Curry when games are close, it\u2019s hard to fathom how he manages to put up and then make so many deep shots. He is also 36-of-37 from the foul line (94.6 percent) in the clutch. Truly astonishing stuff.\n\nRunner-Up: DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls\nA former Trojan, DeRozan\u2019s 114 clutch points do not come close to Curry\u2019s total, but the Bulls are plus-52 in his 128 clutch minutes. Damian Lillard and DeRozan are the only players with at least 100 clutch points and a team plus-minus of at least plus-50, but DeRozan\u2019s shooting splits of 51.5/50.0/85.1 crush Lillard\u2019s 41.7/28.1/95.6, making him a deserving second-favorite.\n\nWorth a Mention: Damian Lillard, Milwaukee Bucks; Coby White, Chicago Bulls; Derrick White, Boston Celtics\n\nCoach of the Year: Mark Daigneault, Oklahoma City Thunder\nMark Daigneault may not want the distinction of winning Coach of the Year because of what the award tends to mean for postseason success. Gregg Popovich (in both 2003 and 2014) is the only coach to win a championship and COY in the same season this century. OKC is the second-youngest team in the league\u2013\u2013led by MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander at age 25 but otherwise driven by even younger players in their early 20s, which is not typically a title contender\u2019s age profile.\n\nDaigneault has his team of younglings playing exceptionally hard while also operating with a level of organization and precision you do not normally see from so many guys still on their rookie contracts. The Thunder play small and fast, driving and kicking more frequently than any other team, and still allow the league\u2019s lowest field-goal percentage at the rim. The team owes much of the latter aspect to Chet Holmgren, but the rookie\u2019s effectiveness in such a critical defensive role also comes in part from Daigneault\u2019s scheming. Oklahoma City doesn\u2019t have vets to settle things down in high-pressure situations and operate as coaches on the floor. Kenrich Williams, 29, is the only player over 25 averaging more than 14 minutes per game. We have to credit Daigneault for the tactics and leadership he\u2019s displayed that have the Thunder looking like the best team in the West, putting them several years ahead of a typical rebuilding schedule.\n\nRunner-Up: Chris Finch, Minnesota Timberwolves\nThe reasons Chris Finch sits behind Daigneault on this list are that he has a more experienced roster than OKC and a suspect offense that can look downright aimless at the worst times. Minnesota is just 16th in offensive efficiency (Oklahoma City is third), which is hard to understand when they have a veteran point guard in Mike Conley, a rising superstar in Anthony Edwards and perhaps the most prolific stretch big the league has ever seen in Karl-Anthony Towns. The Wolves\u2019 defense is elite, but a middling offensive rating has to count as an underachievement. That small demerit matters in a close race.\n\nWorth a Mention: Tyronn Lue, Los Angeles Clippers; Joe Mazzulla, Boston Celtics; JB Bickerstaff, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nExecutive of the Year: Brad Stevens, Boston Celtics\nFollowing appearances in three of the last four Eastern Conference Finals, Boston Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens could have taken the easy way out and done almost nothing in the 2023 offseason. Instead, he made some hard choices. Though it now looks like an absolute heist, the deal Stevens struck to send Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team trade that netted Kristaps Porzingis and two first-round picks was no sure thing at the time. Porzingis was coming off what seemed like an outlier year with the Washington Wizards and his durability was a real concern. Losing Smart, an integral presence within the franchise, felt like amputating a limb.\n\nLater in the offseason, Stevens then dealt reigning Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon and defensive dynamo Robert Williams III in a package for Jrue Holiday. Including the sign-and-trade that landed Grant Williams in Dallas, Stevens turned four rotation pieces into two. But with Porzingis fitting in perfectly and Holiday bringing everything Smart did and more, Boston has been the league\u2019s best team by a mile through about three-quarters of the campaign. Nothing is tougher in the NBA than leaping very good to great, and the moves Stevens made seem to have achieved that. The Celtics will ultimately be judged on their success or failure in the playoffs, but all the indicators to this point in the season suggest they\u2019re in pole position for their first ring in 16 years.\n\nRunner-Up: Leon Rose, New York Knicks\nDonte DiVincenzo was one of the best offseason values at four years and $50 million, the Josh Hart extension made too much sense and the decision to move Obi Toppin for two future second-rounders was the type of shrewd admission on a draft miss that the Knicks never used to make. Leon Rose wouldn\u2019t warrant a spot in the EOY conversation had he stopped there, but fortunately for the Knicks, he was far from finished. Deals to bring in OG Anunoby, Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107 and Alec Burks filled out the rotation and balanced the roster, even though Anunoby has suffered from a knee injury recently. That Rose managed to substantially improve the roster without dipping deeply into the franchise\u2019s trove of future first-round picks only adds to his case. If the Knicks intend to go star hunting this summer or next, they still have more than enough draft capital to target the biggest game.\n\nWorth a Mention: Mike Dunleavy Jr., Golden State Warriors; Daryl Morey, Philadelphia 76ers; Rafael Stone, Houston Rockets\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Craig Schwartz for the USC School of Dramatic Arts)\n\nBy Sara Balanta March 07, 2024 at 9:34 pm PST\n\nJourneying through the multiverse of Latin representations in media, butchered \u201cSpanglish\u201d and drug dealing novelas reign supreme. The production of Latin storylines that center women exempt of \u201cfiesty\u201d stereotypes are a rare find, leading SDA\u2019s most recent play \u201cBroken Shells\u201d to emerge as a unicorn of relatability. Presenting playful Spanish banter and aspects of toxic, yet loving motherly tendencies, the dramedy grips the heartstrings of audiences. With a focus on female direction, writing and casting to confront hereditary cycles of abuse, \u201cBroken Shells\u201d debuted as the perfect start to Women\u2019s History Month.\n\nThe play ran at USC\u2019s Scene Dock Theatre from March 1-3. Written by MFA Dramatic Writing student Cynthia Galaz Sotelo, the performance was part of SDA\u2019s New Works Festival, a showcase of the school\u2019s graduating student material. \u201cBroken Shells\u201d is a tale of Latin American generational abuse blanketed in a warm home in 80\u2032s Loma Dorada, Guanajuato Mexico. The play surrounds four teenage girls who struggle being raised by their abusive single mother Alma, a strongly religious woman who bears down strict restrictions on the perils of men and exploring the outside world.\n\nJuggling laughing and crying, with Smurf punchlines (the blue mythical characters are used as an ongoing motif for the seven deadly sins), \u201cBroken Shells\u201d paints an intimate portrait of female relationships in a Latin household. The play is led by curious 15-year-old Valentina, rotationally portrayed by USC senior Genevieve Hercules and freshman Marisabella D\u00edaz, both of whom are majoring in theatre. As Valentina navigates cycles of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her mother, she retreats into the solace of imaginary figures and her beloved pet crabs.\n\n\u201cWhen I first read the play, it was kind of scary how much it mirrored a lot of my experiences as a child. I just related a lot to Vale\u2019s [Valentina\u2019s] innocence and kind of isolation and feeling that loneliness and kind of escaping within yourself to try to compensate for the lack of [outside] exploration,\u201d Hercules said.\n\nThemes of girlhood and innocence shift starkly to terror, never knowing when a lighthearted scene will tragically end with Alma\u2019s raised voice. \u201cOne of the main things we discussed in rehearsals was \u2018How can we try to show these cycles of generational trauma and how they should be broken in a sense,\u2019 said the actress portraying Alma, theatre major and sophomore Honey Robinson.\n\n\"Broken Shells\" explores complicated family relationships. (Photo courtesy of Craig Schwartz for the USC School of Dramatic Arts)\n\nPlaywright Sotelo explores popular themes of overbearing religious duties and undying loyalties central to many Latin households. The play serves as a touchstone to the tug of war that emerges when one attempts to balance familial kinship while simultaneously enduring abuse at their hands. But Alma\u2019s dictatorship over the household is not one dimensional, as the background of her absent ex-husband and medical conditions gradually unfolds. Robinson pensively displays how the abuse from Alma\u2019s own mother resulted in the regurgitation of problematic behavior towards her daughters.\n\n\u201cOne of the most beautiful things that I was told after someone watched the play was that they were hurt by it, and they related to Vale [Valentina], but they saw why I did what I did, and they gained a sense of empathy for my character,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI know that the actions may not have been pleasant for anyone to watch or experience, but kind of just understanding her and seeing her as a human being first was my goal.\u201d\n\nDrawing on a diaspora of Latin cast members, \u201cBroken Shells\u201d also shines with Spanish dialogue that authentically connects with audiences. Sotelo and director Denise Blasor emphasize pronunciations to \u201ckeep the Spanish language\u2019s beautiful color, poetry and folklore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because there are just some jokes you would not get if you didn\u2019t speak Spanish. And I think that\u2019s a beautiful thing because every time that there was a joke and a spot where people would laugh, I\u2019d be like, \u2018See, they get it!\u2019\u201d Robinson said.\n\nHercules said she bonded with her cast due to their similar backgrounds, aspects of which came to manifest in the play itself. \u201cOne of us is from Puerto Rico, one of us has family in El Salvador, some of us have family in Guatemala \u2013 our families come from different places but [...] even though we\u2019re all different, the fact that we\u2019re all Latino [and] we all have similar experiences bonded us.\u201d\n\nThe four daughter\u2019s loyalty to each other allows them to find strength through their communal abuse. Concluding with an embrace between the cast, the family\u2019s bond remains strong in their fight to reconcile their tumultuous relationship.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing to see the powerhouse of women that were around us and the voices that were being amplified. It was an honor [...] to be surrounded by so many powerful talented women, and it definitely motivated me in a creative way to really go out there and give it my absolute best\u201d Robinson said.\n```"}

However, restorative plans are in action to restore the reefs in Monterey Bay.\n\nBy Nicole Bednar, Nathan Silva, and Katherine Havens\nMarch 07, 2024 at 6:19 pm PST\n\nToday, the Pacific Fishery Management Council will consider what sites of the Monterey Bay coral reefs to restore and preserve. The areas of Sur Ridge, Ano Nuevo, and Ascension canyons are all in essential fish habitat conservation areas, making efforts to preserve these regions strong. The effort comes as a result of an incident back in 2016 when trouble struck the towing voyage of a 528-foot dry dock (for us land lubbers it\u2019s a dock that can be drained to inspect a ship). Deep-sea coral about 40 miles offshore the San Francisco Bay was crushed and is still striving to recover.\n\nThe three sites being considered for protection are currently protected from bottom trawling - that is... dragging a fishing net along the bottom of the ocean - but not other forms of traps. Coral reefs are crucial to our Earth\u2019s ecosystem, both in and out of the water. Making up 50% of the Earth\u2019s oxygen, the rapid decline of reefs throughout the globe could have a huge impact on the world\u2019s population. Commercialized fishing is progressively destroying our reefs. Other causes of coral destruction include increased temperatures, pollution, and ocean acidification.\n\nPhyllis Grifman is the Executive Director of USC\u2019S Sea Grant Program. \"If we lose our coral, we lose such an important number of species. And every species in the ocean is important in the sense of farming an ecosystem. Coral is the basis for practically all ocean life.\" According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about a quarter of all marine life is dependent on coral reefs at some point in their life. Thousands of fish rely on coral as a source of protection, food, and breeding grounds. Without it, entire ecosystems will die.\n\nOrganizations like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, better known as NOAA, have programs set in place to protect and rebuild coral reefs. With regard to the Monterey Bay coral reefs, part of the Council\u2019s plan would implement annual catch limits to prevent overfishing and continuous invasion of the reefs. Grifman notes that protecting coral increases the number of fish on both sides of the equation, \"If you restrict fishing in certain areas, those areas are allowed to come back and return and become healthy, and then they produce more fish....

Both hard and soft coral only grow a couple centimeters per year, making the recovery a long one. It is currently predicted that complete restoration would take about 10 years! Although that seems like forever ways away, Grifman sees hope for the future of our reefs. \"There are a lot of reasons to worry, But, you know, there\u2019s also reason to be optimistic because there are scientists and activists who are working really hard on developing mechanisms to protect and restore.\"\n\nIf we want to see our oceans flourish and keep Kasunori in business, let\u2019s protect our reefs before it\u2019s too late.

With so many amazing performances this year, it\u2019s bound to be a historic night for Hollywood and USC. Lily Gladstone in \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d could be the first Indigenous woman to win the Oscar for best actress. Colman Domingo stars as Bayard Rustin in \u201cRustin,\u201d and could become the first Afro-Latino to win best actor. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is nominated in 13 categories, including Best Picture. It could break the record for most Oscar wins by a single film. Three multilingual films are also up for best picture: Anatomy of a Fall, Past Lives, and The Zone of Interest.\n\nCloser to home, Trojans also have the potential to make history on Sunday night - Among the nominees are 10 USC alumni. They include America Ferrera for best supporting actress in Barbie, Ludwig Goransson for best original score in Oppenheimer, and Erik Aadahl for best sound in The Creator. Among these Trojan nominations is the documentary Nai Nai and W\u00e0i P\u00f3 in the Best Documentary Short category. The short film, which is spoken in Mandarin, follows the lives of the two grandmothers of director Sean Wang. Wang graduated from USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts just seven years ago.\n\nWhile there, he met Sam Davis, who is the cinematographer of Nai Nai and W\u00e0i P\u00f3. Davis says the idea for the film originated while they were at USC.\n\nDavis: It was basically this little skit where his grandmas offer him blueberries, and he refuses, and then they look at each other and basically, telepathically decided to kill him. So, they murder him, and then they tie him up and murder him. And they bury him in the backyard. And then it says, \u201cHappy Holidays.\u201d And that was the skit. And it sort of went viral within our USC film school friend group.\n\nAs the pair developed Nai Nai and W\u00e0i P\u00f3, the film transformed into an inspiring story about his two grandmothers\u2019 special bond.\n\nDavis: Because one of the sort of early inspirations for the project was just the idea of making a film about old age or end of life but one that feels very youthful. Because we saw that Nai Nai and W\u00e0i P\u00f3, we saw this childlike spirit in them.\n\nIn a fun turn of events, three out of five nominees in the Best Documentary Short category are SCA alums, including Nai Nai and W\u00e0i P\u00f3, The Last Repair Shop, and Island in Between. Davis reflects on the impact that SCA had on him and his peers as they made their way into the film industry.\n\nDavis: Making movies is really hard. And doing it with your friends, I think is crucial. And it\u2019s just made the entire process so much more rewarding to be able to be on this crazy, crazy adventure with one of my best friends and his family, and our competition being some of my other best friends who also went to USC.\n\nDavis says the Oscar nominations have sparked friendly competition between him and his former classmates!\n\nDavis: It\u2019s a good reflection, obviously on our program and it\u2019s just fun to be competing against each other and still be able to be friends but, but want to obviously, take each other down. Hopefully the winner will bring their Oscar to campus!\n\nTune in to the Academy Awards this Sunday to see who takes the win.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Alia Noll.\n```"}

After a long winter filled with high winds and tons of rain, students are looking to hit the beach and spend time in the sun. Spring Break will begin on Sunday, March 10th, and end the following week on Sunday, March 17th. Students have a variety of excursions planned for their week-long hiatus. Some are planning to visit different countries to soak up some sun with their friends and families, while others are looking forward to a stay-cation here in Los Angeles.\n\nFor Dylan Roberts, a senior studying intelligence and cyber operations, it will be his first spring break staying in Los Angeles. Roberts is embracing this break\u2019s open schedule to spend more time in Los Angeles. Roberts: I feel like senior year just like a lot of things pile on to your workload, and just like taking time for yourself just to destress, relax, and you know just vibe out.\n\nTaylor Contarino, a senior studying journalism, is used to working throughout this break in the past. However, since it is her senior year, she decided to travel with her friends for her last spring break at USC. Contarino: I\u2019ve actually never been on a spring break trip before. I usually just work and catch up on schoolwork, but this year since I am a senior, my friends and I are traveling. We are going to be in Mexico for just a couple of days and I\u2019m really excited.\n\nNo matter the destination, the underlying theme is the same: rest. Contarino: What I am trying to get out of spring break is to learn about rest. I am planning on putting my laptop away for a couple of days, and I know it\u2019s going to give me severe anxiety, but I know that I need to allow myself to rest sometimes, so what I\u2019m trying to get out of spring break is the concept of rest and relaxation, even if it\u2019s just for three or four days before you know getting back to school.\n\nSpring Break falls right in the middle of the semester when students are finishing weeks of assignments and midterms. Talula Zies, a freshman studying history and philosophy, politics, and law, is in the middle of her second semester at USC. Zies has just finished her midterms and is expecting to soak in the sun. Zies: Rest is needed because midterms just almost killed me...because I haven\u2019t gotten sleep because of the extensive reading and studying, but I hope to get some beach time in, some sun, because I\u2019ve been in Leavey for the entire week.\n\nWhether it\u2019s catching flights or catching z\u2019s, students are looking for a chance of relaxation and serenity.

{"key": "/2024/03/07/local-schools-suffer-as-state-budget-deficit-swells/", "response": "```\nLocal schools suffer as state budget deficit swells\n\nCalifornia predicts it will need to find about $73 billion to save after state revenue fell short last year.\n\nLos Angeles Unified School District, one of almost 1,000 public school districts across California, faces the brunt of a state budget deficit posed to impact many of its 1,302 schools. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Sophie Sullivan\nMarch 07, 2024 at 5:37 pm PST\n\nThe state of California finances might be worse than last calculated. For Los Angeles schools, that means kids lose their counselors. In January, the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimated the state faced a $58 billion budget deficit. Now, they say it\u2019s bigger \u2014 about $15 billion more, to be exact. That means California has a $73 billion problem to solve.\n\nThe state spent more than it made, and will now need to find that money by increasing its revenue, minimizing its spending and shifting the dollars in its reserves. Minimizing spending is a broad term that cuts deep for schools with state funding. That decision is handed down to them by school districts like Los Angeles Unified (LAUSD).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to figure out how to make ends meet,\u201d said Antoinette Cass, the principal of Open Magnet Charter School. Cass said that since LAUSD revised the budget allocated for her school in the beginning of February, she has worked to address the needs and input of everyone from union members to stakeholders. She had a little less than two weeks to submit her budget for the next year. It\u2019s all in the name of keeping her staff employed, and keeping schools safe.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is saving the people within our community so that they have a job, and so that our school can flourish with the personnel that we have hired and have faith in,\u201d said Cass.\n\nThe compromise of preserving community is cutting back on the \u201cextras\u201d of a young education. For Open Magnet Charter, that means the loss of field trips, instructional materials and general supplies.\n\nLAUSD addressed the stress this year\u2019s deficit will have on schools in a statement on Jan. 10. Noting the existing challenge of weaning off one-time COVID-relief federal funding, the district said it aims for a solution that \u201cmaintains its fiscal health and provides for the needs of our students.\u201d\n\nPart of that solution means reducing staff positions across the board. When Kerry Kehrley, the principal of 32nd Street School/USC Magnet, learned his numbers would be reduced, he said it was a sign that the state\u2019s problem was not one that would be going away anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate time, and we\u2019re going to have to do some belt-tightening,\u201d said Kehrley.\n\nFor a K-12 school, that means the loss of counselors, campus aides and teacher assistants.\n\n\u201cIt will have an impact on our school as a whole,\u201d said Kehrley. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a little bit less on the plate, people tend to lose their table manners. Now there\u2019s going to be, in terms of the district as a whole, the challenge of who receives funding \u2014 and in what amount.\u201d\n\nStill, Kehrley said he and the district are working to keep these cuts as far away from the classroom as possible. He pointed to Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s \u201crainy day fund\u201d in state reserves as a promising solution to the loss in funding.\n\nMuch of that fund will go to cover the below-minimum spending that Proposition 98 was supposed to guarantee. Proposition 98 is an almost 40-year-old formula. It guarantees that a portion of California\u2019s revenue goes towards schools and community colleges, typically about 40%, according to EdSource. Since the 2021-22 school year, funding for Proposition 98 has suffered about $12.2 billion in cuts.\n\nNow, Newsom seeks to protect the schools caught in that loss by withdrawing about $7 billion from his rainy day fund to meet the minimum obligation California has to its public schools.\n\nBoth Kehrley and Cass said in the midst of re-budgeting and working on deficits, the focus of their work is clear: their students.\n\n\u201cThe priority is to make sure schools are safe,\u201d said Cass. Beyond that, she said she hopes this inspires community members to stay involved in local education workings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in everybody\u2019s best interest to just be informed. Attend your school meetings, attend any meetings about the state budget, on a local or state level and get involved so that you know what\u2019s going on and therefore can advocate for what\u2019s best for our kids,\u201d said Cass.\n\nNewsom will release updated projections of the next year\u2019s financing in May. The California Legislature must vote to pass that budget bill by June 15.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/07/the-stakes-are-high-state-of-the-union-address-to-set-tone-for-general-election/", "response": "```\nPresident Joe Biden is set to deliver his fourth State of the Union address this evening in the House of Representatives chamber of the United States Capitol. While the event is held annually, this year\u2019s speech is considered more significant because the themes covered will likely be similar to those he will tout leading into the November election. From the list of guests invited to join First Lady Jill Biden, it is speculated that the address will center immigration, abortion and freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cWho the president invites to be in the room says a lot about the values, the vision and the strategy for the election,\u201d said Kamy Akhavan, executive director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future. \u201cThe basic idea is that, for many people, reproductive rights are at stake in this next election. Reproductive rights is a motivating issue for people in battleground states.\u201d\n\nMothers unable to obtain abortions in their respective states, the first person born via in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in the United States and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson are among the guests of the president and first lady, according to reports by USA Today.\n\nWith the guest list in order, Biden\u2019s campaign for the upcoming election is also predicted to touch on abortion rights and NATO alliances, and since the president has done very few speaking engagements and little campaigning thus far, some politics experts speculate that tonight may be the biggest of his presidency.\n\n\u201cHe has been putting his eggs into the State of the Union speech so he can carefully construct and craft his message, and how that message is perceived,\u201d Akhavan said. \u201cHe\u2019s really, really motivated to do an exceptional job with tonight\u2019s talks. For him, the stakes are high.\u201d\n\nDaniel Schnur, a professor in political communications, agrees with Akhavan\u2019s sentiment, stating that the success of this speech is of paramount importance. \u201cRight now, he is behind Donald Trump in public opinion polls. Tonight\u2019s speech will allow him to reach a larger audience until he accepts his party\u2019s nomination,\u201d Schnur said. \u201cHe will be laying out his agenda, trying to unite his party, trying to draw contrast between the Republicans. It\u2019s a lot to do in one speech.\u201d\n\nOn the Republican side of things, House Speaker Mike Johnson invited the parents of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who remains detained in Russia on espionage charges. And while Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, declined Biden\u2019s invitation, it\u2019s clear Russia will be top of everyone\u2019s minds at the event.\n\nWhile some may consider the event to be political theater, the topics discussed will more than likely set the stage for Biden\u2019s talking points heading into the November election. \u201cIt is essentially the president\u2019s road map. This particular State of the Union is of even more importance because you\u2019ll hear Biden say \u2018This is what I\u2019ll do over the next four years if you give me another chance,\u2019\u201d Schnur said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to talk about Donald Trump. It\u2019s a presidential address, not a campaign talk.\u201d\n\nWhile the current president won\u2019t be talking about former President Trump, the same can\u2019t be said for the latter. Ahead of the speech, Trump said he would be \u201ctruth checking\u201d the president on Truth Social, with Tucker Carlson announcing he would be doing the same.\n\nThe State of the Union address will be live-streamed Thursday at 6 p.m. PST on the official White House website. Following the speech, Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) will deliver the Republican rebuttal.\n```"}

(Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy Delaney Polocheck and Roman Marchetti\nMarch 07, 2024 at 4:42 pm PST\n\nThe iconic catchphrase \u2018Viva Las Vegas\u2019, crooned by Elvis Presley throughout his record-breaking Vegas residency, was recently co-opted by Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce after his team\u2019s Super Bowl victory. Vegas viewers now wonder if it\u2019s a sign that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town: the sports industry.\n\nThe game was the first in Super Bowl history to ever be played in Las Vegas, which is quickly becoming a major US sports capital and shaking up its world-famous gaming, or gambling, industry. University of Nevada, Las Vegas Economics Professor Bill Robinson says the transition has been a long time coming.\n\nBILL ROBINSON: Every 20 years or so, since the end of World War II, Vegas has reinvented itself. It\u2019s changed fundamentally what it is. It has to do with gaming, because for years, none of the sports leagues would talk to us. But as gaming has spread around the country, and then as the Supreme Court decided that sports betting is a thing that states can decide if they want to do or not, the NFL and the NBA all jumped into that world. And now all of a sudden, and the NCAA, we\u2019re not an evil place - we\u2019re a happening place.\n\nIn just the last seven years, Las Vegas has become home to three different professional sports teams, and is about to add a fourth. There\u2019s the Las Vegas Raiders of football, the Golden Knights of hockey and women\u2019s basketball Las Vegas Aces. The Oakland Athletics will bring major league baseball to Vegas in 2025.\n\nTo house these teams\u2019 games, the city has added two new venues in the past decade: T-Mobile Arena for the Golden Knights and Allegiant Stadium for the Raiders. And just this week, Vegas released drawings of the new baseball stadium they plan to build for the Athletics.\n\nTogether with @BIG_Architects and @HNTBCorp, we have unveiled the design for our new ballpark project in Las Vegas on the Tropicana site. BIG will serve as the design lead and HNTB as the sports/hospitality designer and architect of record. Images by Negativ pic.twitter.com/mvpiCBXD54 \u2014 Oakland A's (@Athletics) March 5, 2024\n\nAll are located in close proximity to the city\u2019s famous strip, which Robinson says will be getting a family-friendly brand makeover, which should bring millions more to this once forlorn desert city.\n\nROBINSON: I think the biggest benefit we have from this now is gazillions of dollars in free advertising. So every time they play, the announcers are in Vegas, and they\u2019re showing Vegas, and they\u2019re talking about everything that\u2019s going on. And we don\u2019t need to convince Middle America that Vegas is a good place, a fun place, the place that they can go, or they even take their kids. That\u2019s hours and hours and hours and hours of free advertising. So, it starts to convince people that it\u2019s not just you know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But there\u2019s other things to do. So, it\u2019s expanding our market dramatically.\n\nHaving hosted prestigious events like the Las Vegas F1 Grand Prix, which will run annually for the next ten years, the city is also now catering to an ever-expanding high-class crowd. With Las Vegas set to host the Pac-12 men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournament this month, and a USC versus LSU preseason football game in the fall, Trojans will have a special chance to experience the new spin on Sin City.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it\u2019s a fair bet to say that for Vegas, the house always wins.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Delaney Polocheck.\n```"}

Here\u2019s why\u2014plus other implications to consider.\n\nDakota Johnson, left, and Sydney Sweeney arrive at the premiere of \"Madame Web\" on Monday, Feb. 12 at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles. (Photo courtesy of Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Tiffany Damon\nMarch 07, 2024 at 4:16 pm PST\n\n\u201cMadame Web\u2019s\u201d performance at the box office couldn\u2019t have been a bigger disappointment. Not even Sydney Sweeney, one of the film\u2019s lead supporting characters, could persuade a larger audience to view the film\u2014Dakota Johnson joked on SNL that \u201cMadame Web\u201d was \u201clike if AI had made your boyfriend\u2019s favorite movie,\u201d nodding to the film\u2019s notable cast. Unfortunately, movie-goers and critics alike were indifferent. Earning only $17.6 million for its domestic box office opening weekend, \u201cMadame Web\u201d is officially the worst-performing \u201cSpider-Man\u201d related film in history with its exceptionally meager debut. Scoring only 13% on Rotten Tomatoes, \u201cMadame Web\u201d has received the lowest critic score of any major superhero film in nearly a decade. These are not the records the film set out to break.\n\nReleased by Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio was hopeful of creating a larger, Spidey-centric superhero universe to compete with its studio contemporaries: Disney\u2019s Marvel Cinematic Universe and Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s DC Comic Universe. Instead, the IP bank of 900 Spider-Man-related characters that Sony planned to launch an entire franchise with will have to remain on the shelf while the studio reels from this major flop.\n\nThe travesty of \u201cMadame Web\u201d hasn\u2019t been the only letdown we\u2019ve witnessed lately for our superhero universes. \u201cThe Marvels,\u201d which debuted in 2023, had the lowest opening weekend box office in MCU history, grossing only $47 million. This seems to be a common theme with other female-led superhero movies. Just look at DC\u2019s \u201cCatwoman\u201d (released in 2004 to an opening weekend of a mere $16.72 million) and Marvel\u2019s \u201cElektra\u201d (opening weekend box office of $12.8 million in 2005).\n\nThis long slew of flops begs the question: why aren\u2019t female-led superhero movies as successful as other superhero films? Is it because girl superheroes really aren\u2019t as cool as boy superheroes? I\u2019ll give you a hint: No. \u201cWonder Woman\u201d dominated its 2017 opening domestic box office weekend with $103.1 million in ticket sales. \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d crossed the billion-dollar global box office mark, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film out of the MCU with a $153 million domestic opening weekend in 2019. \u201cBlack Widow\u201d crushed pandemic-era box office records, raking in $80 million in its opening weekend and an additional $60 million in streaming profits from its simultaneous release on the Disney+ platform. Needless to say, lady superheroes can kick a**.\n\nSo then, are the flops of \u201cMadame Web\u201d and \u201cThe Marvels\u201d simply unassuming carcasses of the ever-growing, soul-sucking, head-spinning \u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d we\u2019ve all griped about at least once\u2014no, a thousand times? Maybe. 2023\u2032s \u201cBlue Beetle,\u201d starring Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, also suffered a dismal fate, historically becoming the lowest-grossing DC Extended Universe film of all time, earning only $25 million in its opening weekend. \u201cShazam 2\u2032\u2032 was also underwhelmed at the box office, scraping together a $30.1 million domestic box office in 2023.\n\nBox office plights aren\u2019t a stranger to male superheroes. Frankly, the issue here is that mass audiences just aren\u2019t interested in shelling out for lesser-known characters. The folks running the MCU and the DCEU believed that their treasure troves of IP, consisting of hundreds of characters, would supply them with an endless stream of movie ideas and ticket sales. Unfortunately, there is a slim margin of avid comic book fans who know of\u2014let alone care\u2014about the side characters these universes are growing to depend on.\n\nConsidering that most female characters in comic universes are written as side characters or as love interests of the more common male superhero, this could inadvertently pose an issue to the longevity of female representation in the superhero space. For one, there are fewer female characters than male characters. Statistically, females make up only 29.3 percent of the DC character list and 24.7 percent of the Marvel roster, according to Walt Hickey of ABCNews\u2019 FiveThirtyEight; however, this imbalance in gender representation makes sense. Being a superhero was (is) the dream of a lot of young boys and men, so it\u2019s only natural that these worlds were created by men for men and that they\u2019d hold most of the representation within these comic universes.\n\nIn effect, the MCU and DCEU films\u2019 on-screen representation mirrors the comic book IP they\u2019re based on. Back in the day, the most popular comic book characters were Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. The one thing in common with them all: the word \u201cman.\u201d Each of these characters has multiple iterations under its belt; Batman alone appears in 13 live-action films\u2014not counting the animation works that also borrow his name. Superman has had 11 different actors portray the superhero. Spider-Man, with over a dozen films in its universe, has 10 films led by the superhero himself. In contrast, we recall only one Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), one Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and were there at one point talks of a Braveheart? If the most popular comic book characters that continue to proliferate in our media are mainly men, will we recognize them as the main individuals capable of strength and overcoming adversity? And if the only kind of representation women can expect to receive is rooted in IP that casts them as side characters\u2014who aren\u2019t taken as seriously by audiences regardless of whether the hero is a man or a woman\u2014what hope do female superheroes have of breaking through the noise?\n\nThe studios in charge of our superhero universes have a large pressure to fulfill in advocating for representation, but I would expect them to know that already. We all do. Not a single one of us doesn\u2019t know that \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d Unfortunately, we also know the now infamous \u201cMadame Web\u201d line, \u201che was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died.\u201d\n```"}

In a lively conversation at the USC Norris Cinema Theatre on Tuesday night, Winkler spared no ounce of vulnerability, despite the packed audience. He detailed his struggle with Dyslexia, his parents\u2019 disapproval of his decision to pursue acting and how staying laser-focused on his dream helped him persevere.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be an actor from the moment that I was able to imagine what I wanted to do,\u201d Winkler said. The actor, director, producer and author was honored with the distinguished Oakie Award during the Jack Oakie & Victoria Horne Oakie Masters of Comedy Lecture Series, presented by the USC Comedy program within the School of Cinematic Arts. The award recognizes exceptional achievement in film and television comedy.\n\nWinkler spent most of the evening encouraging students to envision what they wanted for themselves, and then to stop at nothing to achieve it. \u201cYou have to know what you want, without ambivalence, and go for it,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of it was that I loved it, part of it was that I was going to beat everyone who told me I would never achieve...People will say no, [but] somebody will say yes, but they won\u2019t say yes if you are not tenacious.\u201d\n\nIn the wide-ranging conversation about Winkler\u2019s life and career, he spoke candidly about how important tenacity has been for him, especially concerning his Dyslexia. He struggled in school as a child, which impacted his self-esteem. Beyond his struggles in school, Winkler also had difficulties reading scripts, forcing him to review his lines dozens of times. He said that during their weekly table reads for \u201cHappy Days,\u201d he would often ad-lib and improvise.\n\n\u201cThere is no right, there is no wrong. There is your imagination,\u201d Winkler said of getting creative with his scripts. \u201cThese people would say to me, \u2018Excuse me, that is not what we wrote.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m giving you the essence of it.\u2019 And it worked. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nPerseverance was a common thread in Winkler\u2019s conversation with moderator Wayne Federman, an SDA professor and stand-up comedian. Winkler was also sure to sprinkle in advice for the audience that he wove into every story he shared, many of which involved him standing up and performing animated reenactments of his experiences.\n\nFederman made a point of asking Winkler about a previous conversation where he said the chance to speak to students was what made receiving the award meaningful to him. He was eager to interact with attendees because he said he wished someone could have answered his questions when he was younger. Once the Q&A portion of the evening began, Winkler paced the long stage to directly approach each student who asked a question. He even asked one student, \u201cWhat is your dream? What do you hope to be?\u201d\n\nMany of the questions from the audience were about Winkler\u2019s fan-favorite performances, notably his role in \u201cArrested Development.\u201d Winkler shared that he was only hired to be on the Netflix sitcom for one or two episodes, but ended up staying on for five years. \u201cThere are no small roles, only small brains,\u201d he added.\n\nThe spirited evening finished off with a raucous standing ovation for Winkler. Afterward, he took time to take selfies and speak with the many students and attendees who waited in line to meet the legend. One of them was sophomore theater student Sophie Lee, who said Winkler\u2019s words resonated deeply with her.\n\n\u201cI love how he took the time to get to know people, walk towards them and really engage with their questions, \" Lee said. \u201cHe\u2019s iconic. He\u2019s just so funny without even trying.\u201d\n\nBeyond the jokes he cracked and the advice he offered, many attendees reflected on Winkler\u2019s kindness and generosity with his time. \u201cBesides incredibly talented people, we\u2019ve chosen really warm people, and it seems like the student body brings out the best in them,\u201d Barnet Kellman, one of the co-founders of the USC Comedy program, said of the Oakie Award recipients. \u201cHenry was almost the apotheosis of it in terms of his desire to share and to give and be very generous. He\u2019s not alone in that, but Henry was exceptional.\u201d\n\nKellman is correct in noting the impressive lineup of past honorees. Winkler joins a distinguished group that includes his \u201cBarry\u201d co-star Bill Hader and comedic icons Catherine O\u2019Hara, Nancy Meyers, Kenya Barris, Steve Carell, Judd Apatow and more.\n\n\u201cI always enjoyed a lot of the stuff he was in,\u201d said David Isaacs, another co-founder of the USC Comedy program. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a fan of his \u2013 you just give him something to do, and he\u2019s going to do a great job for you. And he\u2019s just the nicest guy in the world.\u201d\n\nAfter celebrating 50 years in the entertainment industry, Winkler said the key to his success is simple: \u201cGratitude and tenacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is easy to say, not so easy to live,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will absolutely propel you into the center of your dream.\u201d\n```"}

Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing\u201d by psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry and Oprah Winfrey\n\nThe book, \"What Happened To You? Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing\" that was used for the discussion (Photo courtesy of USC Campus Health).\n\nBy Maria Vittoria Borghi March 07, 2024 at 12:43 pm PST\n\n\u201cTrauma is very common. Trauma is very prevalent. Knowing that, giving everyone the grace of understanding that their reactions may be based on something we can\u2019t see is important for our health outcomes.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, USC Campus Health hosted an online event to discuss preventive and mitigation measures on the health impact of trauma using the 2021 book \u201c What Happened To You? Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing \u201d by psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nCaused by severe, prolonged and repetitive stress, trauma makes our brain more vulnerable to fear, disrupting our emotional regulation and our capacity to retain information. This public health issue has affected 70% of adults in America at least once in their lifetime, including students.\n\nDr. Deirdre Logan, the chair of the trauma-informed care committee of USC Student Health, and Dr. Michelle Dexter, Counseling and Mental Health Services clinician and instructor of \u201cThe Science and Practice of Building Resilience\u201d undergraduate course at USC, started the webinar by illustrating the negative effects of trauma, specifically adverse childhood events (ACEs), on community health.\n\nOriginally ACEs were defined as incidents that cause distress to an individual before the age of 18. The acronym now extends to the categories of community adverse events, such as social inequality, and climate adverse events like tornadoes and floods.\n\nDr. Logan presented research showing that an individual with an ACEs score higher than four correlates with an increased risk of different health outcomes, including smoking (twice as likely), substance abuse (seven times as likely), and suicide (1200% increase): this is the case for 16% to 17% of people in America.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning more every day about how adverse events in early childhood can have lasting impacts on health, Dr. Logan said. \u201dBecause ACEs are very common, we\u2019re focused on how individuals can become more trauma-aware, and how institutions can become more trauma-informed in their practices.\u201d\n\nThis is why it\u2019s important to be trauma-informed: being able to understand, recognize and respond to effects of trauma on both well-being and behavior, according to Dr. Dexter.\n\nBy fostering connection, accountability, safety, respect, cultural sensitivity, compassion and support, \u201cwe can all take an active role in healing ourselves and others,\u201d she said in the session.\n\nDr. Dexter also uses a trauma-informed approach in her teaching by encouraging connections with professors, providing opportunities for students to work together and build a community, promoting a growth mindset, and asking for regular feedback.\n\nUSC is a critical venue for trauma education. In 2022, a pilot study with 120 USC students found that more than 62% of the sample had an ACEs score of four or higher.\n\nMoreover, as noted by Dr. Dexter, traumatized college students typically have a harder time adjusting to campus life, higher rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, suicidal ideation and substance abuse.\n\nThis emphasizes how crucial it is for USC to continue building environments that foster resilience.\n\nContrary to popular belief, resilience is not the ability to cope with adversities like discrimination, harassment, and abuse. As explained during the webinar, resilient individuals look for support to mitigate rollercoaster emotions, for instance, through relationships, mindfulness practices, mental health care, quality sleep, healthy nutrition, and physical activity; by contrast, people who lack resilience are more prone to soothe their anxieties with harmful habits.\n\nThe webinar shows that knowing the subtle difference between surviving and thriving can help manage real health outcomes, as well as prevent them.\n\nThe event was open to professional and laypeople, and participants expressed wide support for ACEs screening.\n\nIn the state of California, 35,000 providers have received ACEs-aware screening or training, and over 2 million people have been screened for ACEs.\n\nIn the future, Dr. Logan and Dr. Dexter aim to do ACEs screening with an expanded questionnaire at USC; in the meantime, Dr. Logan pointed to the digital Safe Spaces training, which helps certified adults to understand the signs of a person who potentially has an experience of trauma.\n\n\u201cHaving a community-wide discussion is just one of the steps Campus Health is taking in bringing a light onto understanding toxic stress, and how it may impact the educational experience for students,\u201d she said.\n\nAnyone interested in the discussion can refer to the recording of the webinar, as well as the event\u2019s resources and references page, which are publicly available.\n```"}

Plus, looking at trades around the league.\n\nVegas Golden Knights head coach Bruce Cassidy, top right, shouts from behind the bench in the second period of an NHL hockey game against the Boston Bruins, Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024, in Boston. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner March 07, 2024 at 12:35 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League.\n\nFrom reigning Cup champion to wild-card team The Vegas Golden Knights are one of the most talented teams in the NHL, if not the most. But less than a year after hoisting their first Stanley Cup in franchise history, a punishing injury bug has flooded the roster. Center Jack Eichel might\u2019ve made his return to the ice for the first time in almost two months, but Vegas is still dealing with injuries to captain Mark Stone, William Carrier and Brett Howden, among others.\n\nThe Golden Knights\u2019 2-7-1 record in their last 10 games has severely set them back after contending with the Canucks for the top spot in the Pacific Division for quite some time. This stretch includes losses to the mediocre Wild, the Atlantic-worst Senators, the underperforming Sabres and the Metropolitan-worst Blue Jackets. As a result, Vegas has slipped out of the Pacific\u2019s top three and is now even with both the Kings and Predators \u2014 at 73 points \u2014 and on the brink of not being in a playoff position altogether.\n\nDon\u2019t get it twisted \u2014 the Golden Knights are no strangers to adversity. After missing the playoffs in 2022 for the first time ever, the team completely rebounded the following season and reached ultimate heights. But this year is different, as the division has seen unprecedented success from Vancouver, who is running away with the Pacific crown. Along with the Golden Knights and Canucks \u2014 the red-hot Oilers, the promising Kings and even the inconsistent Kraken are all Pacific teams pushing for the playoffs.\n\nThe recent slump has highlighted some of the Knights\u2019 main areas for improvement. Last year, their stout defense that protected surging netminder Adin Hill was the main contributor to their Cup-hoisting run. While Vegas\u2019 defense hasn\u2019t been bad this year, it has been rather inconsistent. In six of his past seven games, Hill\u2019s save percentage has dipped under .900, and he\u2019s allowed a flurry of goals, most recently a staggering six against Columbus. Blueliners Alex Pietrangelo and Alec Martinez are aging, which doesn\u2019t help a team in dire need of quick-footed defensemen to keep Hill and Logan Thompson safe.\n\nWith the trade deadline approaching on Friday, the Golden Knights have diligently made some moves to hopefully address recent struggles. On Tuesday, Vegas acquired forward Anthony Mantha from the Capitals in exchange for a pair of late-round picks in 2024 and 2026. Mantha has the capability to be a game changer, standing tall at 6-foot-4 and weighing 234 pounds. He\u2019s bound to have the best scoring season of his career, with 20 goals on the year already. He may not be the same player he was with the Red Wings, but he\u2019ll be a good fit on Vegas\u2019 middle lines to generate points while also adding much-needed defense. Washington will also retain 50% of his salary, giving the Golden Knights some more breathing room to work with before the deadline.\n\nVegas didn\u2019t have to part ways with any valuable assets and picked up a proven scorer, which will undoubtedly bolster its depth. On Wednesday, though, the Knights acquired a player that might solve their defensive problems. Vegas landed former Flames blueliner Noah Hanifin in a three-team trade with Calgary and Philadelphia, with 75% of his contract retained. Unlike some of the Golden Knights\u2019 other defensemen, Hanifin is younger and more nimble. At 27 years old, he\u2019s posted a career-high 11 goals this season and has been a skilled passer and a two-way force. His ability to transition the puck out of the defensive end is desperately needed by Vegas, as it has often struggled with combating the forecheck this season. Put him in either the top pairing or the second, and he\u2019ll help wash out some of the Knights\u2019 recent defensive inconsistencies.\n\nMake it goals on the year for Hanny! \n\nVegas parted ways with its first-round pick in this year\u2019s draft, as well as some other draft capital. Considering the Golden Knights are seemingly always in win-now mode, trading picks makes sense for them. They also shipped off defenseman Daniil Miromanov, who had only appeared in four games this season.\n\nMost great teams go through rough patches; just ask the Knights themselves, who were able to take a sip from the Stanley Cup last season following a down year. The Pacific Division is elite, and won\u2019t be easy to get through, but if any team can do it, it\u2019s Vegas. The Golden Knights will host the Canucks in a highly anticipated divisional game on Thursday at 7 p.m.\n\nTrade deadline turmoil\n\nThe deadline to exchange players and draft picks is Friday at noon, and, in addition to the Golden Knights, other teams have swapped assets, and will continue to, up until the last second. Let\u2019s look at some of the biggest trades around the league thus far.\n\nTanev heads to Dallas\n\nA veteran defenseman, Chris Tanev provides defensive depth on a Stars team with  Stanley Cup aspirations . With an efficient plus-17 rating, Tanev is an opportunity creator with a major defensive upside. Dallas parted ways with draft stock to acquire him, and half of his salary will be retained by the Flames. Along with Thomas Harley and Miro Heiskanen, Tanev will strengthen the Stars\u2019 defensive core.\n\nFlorida trades for Tarasenko\n\nRight now, it looks like the Panthers might win the Presidents\u2019 Trophy. Leading a talented  Atlantic Division , Florida acquired a depth asset in winger Vladimir Tarasenko, formerly an Ottawa Senator. The Panthers are gambling on Tarasenko to get back on track in the latter half of the season, and they surrendered a pair of middle-round picks to bring him in. He\u2019ll have 50% of his contract covered by Ottawa, and will hope to be a part of Florida\u2019s top-six, which is already very strong. The 32-year-old has 41 points in 57 games this season.\n\nColorado lands breakout blueliner\n\nThe Avs picked up touted defenseman Sean Walker, whose plus-nine rating speaks to his defensive efficiency and ability to create offensive plays. With the Flyers this season, Walker posted 22 points, two shy of his career-high 24-point campaign in 2019-20. Colorado shipped off inconsistent forward Ryan Johansen and a 2025 top-10 protected first-round selection, while also gaining a 2026 fifth-round pick.\n\nAvalanche and Sabres swap former top-10 picks\n\nColorado landed forward Casey Mittelstadt in exchange for defenseman Bowen Byram on Wednesday. For Buffalo, Byram is a promising player when healthy, and he\u2019ll have a chance to impress on a younger Sabres blue line, joining Owen Power and Rasmus Dahlin. A fast skater, Byram has racked up 20 points this season and will hope for a positive change of scenery on an up-and-coming team. The Avalanche acquired a point-producing second-line center in Mittelstadt. The 25-year-old is having one of his better seasons and should make an impact in the top-six. With 14 goals, he places top five in scoring on a star-studded Avs team. Mittelstadt will also be an upgrade over the traded Johansen.\n\nRangers acquire Wennberg\n\nNew York brought in a potential third-line center piece in Alex Wennberg. He\u2019s a solid defender with opportunistic qualities; he has nine goals and 16 helpers on the year and will aim to give the Blueshirts extra depth to make a run in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Rangers sent two draft picks to Seattle in the trade, who will retain half of Wennberg\u2019s salary.\n\nOilers pick up forwards Henrique and Carrick\n\nTo read an in-depth report on this trade, click  here .\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

On most days, he works as a news production assistant at KNX, but when he isn\u2019t doing that, he\u2019s doing this: He sits in his gray Honda Civic in a grimy underground parking garage in Studio City. The makeshift \u201cstudio\u201d is his place of preparation. Rubber ducks sit on the dashboard, while a cross hangs off his mirror next to an anime plushie and a picture of Uma Thurman in \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d Martinez flips through his scripts and practices before he heads to the studio upstairs.\n\nJust a few months ago, Martinez decided to take the first step into pursuing a dream of his: voice acting. Anthony Martinez: Voice acting has always been something that I had been interested in, growing up watching cartoons, animation, you know, all those things. But as I got older, video games were also a really big part of my upbringing.\n\nMartinez hopes to be the kind of actor who can transform his voice to fit the role, and hopes that his heritage can be a part in defining his vocal identity. Martinez: I do find myself chasing different ways of crafting voices or just different personalities... My ethnicity is Mexican American. I\u2019m Latino myself, and being able to bring that side of myself into a more modern approach where it\u2019s not just that stereotypical Mexican character and anything like that.\n\nBut Martinez is also uneasy, as a new shift in the industry looms right as he is getting his foot in the door. Did you catch that? That\u2019s Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden playing \u201cFortnite\u201d together. Or is it? Those voices are AI-generated, and videos like these circled the internet as nothing more than memes. But to voice actors, the rise of AI imitation is a very real fear.\n\nAI is cheaper than hiring an actor. Just shortly after the end of the SAG-AFTRA strikes, the union made a deal with Replica Studios, an AI voice company. The deal allows for the use of AI voice technology to be used in interactive media like video games. And while there are protections like compensation and consent, Martinez is anxious. Martinez: When I saw the news, I was, if I had to describe it in one word, it would just be disappointing. Just because it kind of felt like... What was the whole point of the strike, if that was going to be the ultimate outcome?\n\nAnd he\u2019s not alone. Several professional voice actors have gone to social media to express their worries about its use. After all, the deal just opens the door for AI to be used even more in place of real actors. Christopher Randolph, a voice actor best known for his role as Otacon in the Metal Gear Solid video game series, is among those with reservations. Last October, at the tail end of the SAG-AFTRA strikes, he was already seeing issues involving the use of his iconic voice.\n\nChristopher Randolph: I know that for voice acting for computer games, AI is already here. They can, and I\u2019m starting to learn that actually, there are some websites that actually do imitate my voice... What is more sort of individual and personally owned than our voices and our bodies?\n\nTo Randolph, the encroachment of AI into the voice acting space will not only take away from its artistry, but impact those working within the industry. Randolph: There\u2019s a sort of soullessness to what is created... The very nature of what entertainment is is becoming less and less an actual reflection of what our human condition is, and I think that that\u2019s actually dangerous.\n\nTo people like Martinez and Randolph, AI still falls short from the real deal, but its improvement in the long term raises concerns. John De Mita is a voice actor, voice director and a professor at USC. He thinks the use of AI in voice acting is as inevitable as CGI was for movies. John De Mita: I think that\u2019s the biggest thing that people are afraid of because it involves the absolute elimination of a human being in the process... My opinion is it\u2019s going to become part of what is the business of show business. It isn\u2019t there yet.\n\nStill, De Mita encourages newcomers to push forward, because AI will actually have the least amount of impact on them. De Mita: The goal of these first pioneers of AI... Their goal is not to ostracize the novice because just completely honestly, they\u2019re the least expensive person in the conversation.\n\nFor now, Martinez presses on, putting together his portfolio in hopes of beating the AI wave and achieving his dream to work in a survival horror video game. Martinez: It\u2019s really just sort of really trying to convince myself that I\u2019m not really necessarily an aspiring voice actor, rather than just telling myself I\u2019m a voice actor.\n\nAI is only getting bigger, and voice actors now have to become more creative to compete in an increasingly automated industry. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Ethan Huang.\n```"}

He gained popularity in the United States for his stand-up comedy, which often touches on his experiences as an immigrant and his observations of American culture. Wong has made appearances on several TV shows, including \u201cThe Late Show with David Letterman,\u201d \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d and he was the headliner for the Radio and Television Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in 2010. Currently, Wong is captivating audiences in Los Angeles, New York, and Toronto with his comedy special \u201cThis Asian Hates Asian Hate,\u201d alongside another tour titled \u201cOut of Place Chinese (\u6c34\u571f\u4e0d\u670d).\u201d\n\nHow comedy links to anti-Asian hate\n\nWong believes in the importance of his work in bringing attention to Asian American issues, history, and experiences. He notes the scarcity of stand-up comedy shows, TV shows, or movies that delve into Asian American history and the value of contributing to this underrepresented narrative. Wong shared, \u201cI\u2019ve been developing \u2018This Asian Hates Asian Hate\u2019 for the past couple of years. It\u2019s a comedy hour special that touches on issues very close to my heart.\u201d\n\nDespite the relevance of his work, Wong revealed the challenges he faced in getting his special recognized by streaming platforms. \u201cBy the time I got the special ready and taped, the platforms I approached felt the topic wasn\u2019t \u2018on the news anymore,\u2019\u201d Wong explained, highlighting the transient nature of media attention to social issues. That said, the comedian\u2019s resolve remains strong despite these setbacks. \u201cIt\u2019s something worth doing, even though the online platform may not accept it right now,\u201d Wong stated, emphasizing the importance of Asian American representation in media.\n\nWong\u2019s comedy has received varied responses across the U.S., with cities like New York and Boston showing greater acceptance. However, he was pleasantly surprised by the reception in Houston, Texas. \u201cI got the best audience response from Houston. Every punchline worked,\u201d he said, challenging the preconceived notions about the region being more \u201cconservative.\u201d\n\nWong explains that he uses comedy as a platform to address the issue of anti-Asian hate because he believes in the unique power of humor to engage audiences on serious topics, despite the challenges inherent in this approach. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, you know, because if you write a book about Asian hate, most of the time it\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201dBut if you do it in comedy, there\u2019s a lot of pushback.\u201d Wong acknowledges the controversy that can arise when tackling sensitive issues through comedy but insists on its importance, stating, \u201cI am a comedian, and it\u2019s even harder for me to bring this topic on because I know how hard it is for comedians to come up with their material and gradually find some success in the comedy world.\u201d\n\nThrough his comedic work, Wong aims to raise awareness and provoke thought on anti-Asian hate, leveraging the accessible and engaging nature of humor to challenge stereotypes and encourage dialogue. \u201cI know how unpopular it is for any Asians, especially Asian men, to bring up the subject of racism or discrimination against Asians,\u201d he confessed. This acknowledgment reflects the broader issue of racism\u2019s deep-rooted presence in society and the difficulty in confronting it, even through humor.\n\nJoe Wong\u2019s journey as an Asian American comedian\n\nWong\u2019s journey as an Asian American comedian has been marked by his determination to break stereotypes and pursue his passion for comedy, despite the initial lack of promotion in his previous career as a chemical engineer. Reflecting on his transition to comedy, Wong shared, \u201cI just went to a stand-up comedy class and learned the basics of telling a joke, where to look for open mics to practice, and that\u2019s how it got started.\u201d Initially, comedy was merely a hobby for Wong, but it gradually evolved into a serious pursuit. He further elaborated on his motivation, stating, \u201cI was always interested in humor and comedy. When I was in college, I published some papers on the campus newspaper... and people were like, \u2018Oh wow, that was really funny.\u2019\u201d\n\nWong\u2019s journey underscores his commitment to leveraging comedy not only as a means of personal expression but also as a platform to address significant social issues, particularly anti-Asian hate, through humor.\n\nPushing back against Asian hate\n\nIn the fight against anti-Asian hate, comedian Joe Wong is using his platform to advocate for increased awareness and proactive measures. Wong, known for his insightful humor that often touches on his experiences as a Chinese-American, is calling on individuals both within and outside the Asian community to take a stand against racism and discrimination. For those within the Asian community, Wong stresses the importance of speaking out and supporting one another. \u201cWe just have to mention it more,\u201d he said, highlighting the necessity of bringing anti-Asian sentiments to the forefront of conversations. Wong believes in the power of vocalizing experiences and concerns related to racism, encouraging individuals to \u201cair our own opinion, even though it\u2019s unpopular, just say something, to let people know that this thing makes Asians uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nWhile Wong\u2019s recommendations for allies outside the Asian community, the essence of his advocacy points toward the need for solidarity and active engagement from all societal sectors. This includes educating oneself about the rich history and contributions of Asian Americans, standing against racism in all its forms, and fostering environments where open and constructive dialogues about race and discrimination can flourish. Wong\u2019s approach underscores a collective responsibility to address and dismantle anti-Asian hate. By encouraging open communication, education, and allyship, Wong aims to bridge gaps and build a more inclusive and understanding society. His call to action serves as a reminder that combating racism requires a united front, with every individual playing a crucial role in affecting positive change. Through humor and advocacy, Wong is not only entertaining audiences but also challenging them to reflect on critical social issues and contribute to a more equitable society.\n```"}

Chu will be the 2024 commencement speaker. (Photo courtesy of Art Streiber)\n\nBy Laya Albert March 07, 2024 at 12:01 am PST\n\nJon M. Chu, the producer, writer and director, fresh off the set of \u201cWicked,\u201d will be USC\u2019s 2024 commencement speaker. \u201cJon has brought joy to millions around the world, including me, through the dazzling worlds he creates as a filmmaker storyteller,\u201d USC President Carol Folt said in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cHe is deeply invested in ensuring diverse communities are represented. It will be special for our students to hear from someone whose dreams and determination contribute so much to cinema and creative arts.\u201d\n\nChu graduated in 2003 from the USC School of Cinematic Arts with a BFA in film & television production and said he is humbled to come back to his alma mater to speak at this year\u2019s university-wide commencement. The ceremony will begin at 8:30 a.m. at Alumni Park and seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n\u201cI remember dreaming in my dorm room,\u201d Chu said in an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cI remember walking along those halls and making my student films.\u201d\n\nThe 44-year-old filmmaker directed the acclaimed romantic comedy \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d in 2018 and the musical drama \u201cIn The Heights\u201d in 2021. His films are known for their lively music, lavish sets and elaborate dance scenes. He also directed the new musical, \u201cWicked,\u201d which is scheduled to be released this November, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\n\nChu is the son of immigrants. His mother was born in Taiwan, and his father was born in Sichuan, a province of China. They emigrated from Hong Kong to San Francisco in the mid-1960s. He said he uses his films as an outlet to talk about his cultural identity, which is especially evident in the vibrant, Oscar-nominated \u201cCrazy Rich Asians.\u201d\n\n\u201cA movie is a small gesture. It doesn\u2019t change the world, but maybe it can plant a seed,\u201d Chu said. \u201cNever underestimate the power of planting a seed.\u201d\n\nChu attributes his success to the stories his parents shared with him. He shared how his parents instilled in him the belief that he could achieve anything in America. Chu drew upon this positive energy in his work, despite his screenwriting professor\u2019s doubts in musicals, he believed anything was possible.\n\n\u201cEveryone living right now has the opportunity to make a difference,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also spoke on the benefit of being a member of the Trojan community, as Steven Spielberg noticed him for his short film from when he was a student. He said he still appreciates his professors, specifically shouting out Brenda Goodman, who still teaches film production classes, and Everett Lewis, who still teaches animation courses, at USC today.\n\nBeyond SCA, Chu said he is grateful for the opportunity he had to get to know such a diverse crowd at USC, from his roommate, who was part of ROTC, to athletes, to members of the marching band and classmates from his dance electives. Chu continued this legacy of helping Trojans \u2014 as his newest assistant is a senior from USC. He also funds an endowment, the Jon M. Chu APAA Cinematic Arts Scholarship, which helps several students complete their USC education.\n\nGrowing up Asian American, Chu says he avoided confronting ideas of diversity and acceptance because he wanted to blend in with everyone around him. It wasn\u2019t until he made \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d that he said he finally confronted his cultural identity crisis and made what he wanted.\n\nWhile at USC, Chu won the Princess Grace Award and also the Dore Schary Award award from the Anti-Defamation League: An international non-governmental organization specializing in civil rights laws to combat extremism and antisemitism.\n\n\u201cI feel like the whole world is going through that same cultural identity crisis,\u201d he said, speaking on the current campus climate. \u201cThe internet has brought us all together even more so than ever before. We are all roommates, and roommates fight.\u201d\n\nHe believes these issues will only be resolved through talking, communication, forgiveness, learning and listening.\n\n\u201cI feel so excited to share my journey,\u201d Chu said.\n\nHe\u2019ll join the impressive list of USC\u2019s previous commencement speakers, including Marvel President Kevin Feige in 2023, athlete Allyson Felix in 2022, then-Rep. Karen Bass, now LA\u2019s mayor, in 2019, actor and comedian Will Ferrell in 2017, journalist Christiane Amanpour in 2012 and astronaut Neil Armstrong in 2005.\n\n\u201cI feel very privileged actually, to be able to speak to these young people who are going to be changing the world in the future,\u201d Chu said.\n```"}

(Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nBy Sophie Sullivan and Shane Dimapanat\nMarch 06, 2024 at 7:25 pm PST\n\nThe chop of helicopters, the buzz of sheriff cruisers and the unsealing of thousands of ballots echo throughout a 144,000-square-foot warehouse, which used to be a Fry\u2019s Electronics. This \u2014 with hundreds of employees \u2014 is what gets your ballot counted on the night of Super Tuesday.\n\nFor the first time in county history, the Los Angeles Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (RR/CC) department has centralized all of its ballot processing operations under one roof. The ten million dollar center, located just a 20-minute drive from downtown, oversees every ballot as it leaves a voter\u2019s hands and enters the counter\u2019s.\n\nThe move is unprecedented for a registrar whose operations were formerly spread across the county. The RR/CC counted votes at three different sites prior to 2024, some of which they shared with completely separate departments, according to Mike Sanchez, a senior public information specialist for the county.\n\n\u201cWhile it was secure, it did require us to have to transport those ballots from point A to point B. Now, being under one facility under one roof helps with the efficiency and helps with some of the security as well,\u201d said Sanchez.\n\nThe ballot processing center, which spans over 144,000 square feet, before shipments of ballots began to file into the center around 9:45 p.m. on March 5, 2024. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nHe said the process was long, but easing voters\u2019 fears of fraud or miscounting was at the forefront of operations. According to him, this is all in an effort to increase civic participation and trust in local government.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to reinforce as a department is that this is a process for voters. They have a say on what happens locally in their neighborhoods, in the statewide measures but also who represents them \u2014 not just at the federal level, but also here locally,\u201d said Sanchez.\n\nSanchez said transparency matters especially for young voters casting a ballot for the first time this year, and even more so for those who are in the dark about how to vote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraging folks that if they are eligible to make their voices heard and can cast their ballot, there\u2019s several different ways that someone can vote. We ensure and provide opportunities and access for people to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter voters cast their ballots, that vote is double- and triple-checked for insurance. Ballots are opened at an \u2018extraction\u2019 area, checked for signatures at a \u2018verification\u2019 station and finally tabulated at the glass-encased \u2018tally operations\u2019 center. Every door, gate and entryway requires keycard access.\n\nTransparency is the buzzword here. Almost every operation is visible from anywhere in the building; whatever centers are walled off, like operations or cybersecurity, have large glass windows for observation. Public visitors are welcomed to roped areas for viewing the process.\n\nA livestream is available 24/7 online for anyone to witness ballots\u2019 tallying, canvassing and verification. Dozens of L.A. County sheriff deputies patrol the facility, most of whom stayed on-site until at least 3 a.m. to ensure votes were received safely.\n\nAn L.A county sheriff arrives to drop off ballots at the processing center on the night of March 5, 2024. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nThe RR/CC has long held a relationship with the sheriff\u2019s department in ensuring a secure vote process. This year\u2019s operation only bolstered that. Sheriffs stationed at the tallying area said their jobs for all of the 12-hour shift were to make sure no one without proper credentials walked through the door.\n\nOthers patrolled back and forth to ensure media and observers remained inside boundaries. The majority arrived closer to 10 p.m. in sheriff cruisers and county helicopters with hundreds of ballots in the backseat.\n\nCounty organizers factored security into every step of the process. The site is cybersecure, with an on-site IT team \u2014 the tallying center allows no phones or wi-fi connections to prevent hackers from accessing vote results before they are released.\n\nOver 200 security cameras cover the square footage. Canine dogs sniff every ballot to check for laced drugs, a move organizers said was in reaction to incidents across the country.\n\nAn office worker at the facility stands over a desk, one of the hundreds of workers at the center on March 5, 2024. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nThis way, the ballots of the 5.6 million Angelenos registered to vote can be counted with confidence. Over 600,000 mail-in votes had been received by March 5, which workers began counting over two weeks ago.\n\nOn Election Day evening, votes from more than 400 ballot drop boxes and over 600 vote centers entered the processing center just hours after polling places closed.\n\nThe opening also attracted international attention. Observers from Brazil and Argentina came to see the historic moment.\n\n\u201cIn Latin America, we don\u2019t have election authorities that are so active in taking input from communities, from NGOs, from academics,\u201d said Eduardo Repilloza Fern\u00e1ndez, Director General of Transparencia Electoral.\n\n\u201cThat was something that caught our attention, the fact that it was designed with input from so many eyes.\u201d\n\nThis was the second time that Transparencia Electoral, a non-governmental organization aiming to improve electoral processes, has visited Los Angeles since the midterm elections.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez pointed out two factors that drew them to the city: the size and the system. With nearly 10 million residents, the county is bigger than 40 states. That requires meticulous protocol to ensure citizens\u2019 votes are fairly counted.\n\nThe county uses a unique voting instrument to do this. The ballot marking device allows in-person voters to personalize and improve the accessibility of their voting experience.\n\nAfter inserting ballots, voters can translate information into any of 19 languages, increase the text size and listen to candidate platforms with an audio headset. It also leaves a paper trail of documentation for the registrar.\n\nOffice personnel stand inside the ballot center\u2019s customer service hotline section before the first sheriff cruisers arrive with shipments of ballots cast in-person. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nMany working the center tonight were young residents who volunteered out of sheer interest in the process. Leilani Filimaua, a Gen Z\u2019er and a county vote reporter for Edison Research, shared her enthusiasm for the night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a great opportunity to be a part of a democratic election,\u201d said Filimaua.\n\nAs a county vote reporter, she feeds news organizations like ABC, CNN, and NBC ballot counts throughout the night for the election coverage.\n\n\u201cI care a lot about democratic processes, and I\u2019m really actively participating in creating change for my generation and generations to come,\u201d said Filimaua.\n\nThe work for ballot counters is just picking up now. Over the next three weeks, the registrar will post a dozen count updates, an increase from past election years.\n\nThe RR/CC will tentatively certify final election results on March 29.

The new test has been reduced to two hours, with a shorter reading section. Students can complete the SAT on their own devices, and the new format will also offer tools including a graphing calculator and the ability to bookmark questions.\n\nThe changes were met with mixed emotions from USC students who took the test on paper. Liam Casey, a sophomore studying public relations, shared concerns regarding the shift. \u201cI think it\u2019s like putting a Band-Aid on a compound fracture,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI think society is realizing that standardized testing isn\u2019t the best way of demonstrating knowledge and it\u2019s very skewed towards people who can afford... tutoring.\u201d\n\nCasey, who did not take the SAT or ACT, said that there are parts of college applications that showcase a student\u2019s ability and go beyond test scores. \u201cI\u2019m not a great standardized test taker and I realized that I have a lot of strengths and like my application, my portfolio, but doing standardized tests just wasn\u2019t going to be one of them,\u201d Casey said. \u201cSATs are like something you pay your way into a lot of people who do the best on their SATs are the people who pay for like thousands of dollars a week in tutoring.\u201d\n\nBut students like Ty Kawamura, a junior studying economics, wondered how the new test could be secure while online. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to bring about a lot of opportunities to cheat [or try] to fake the score a little more,\u201d said Kawamura.\n\nWith the test moving online, it will be easier for the tests to be administered and grades will be received faster. The change to online comes as part of an effort to keep standardized testing relevant in an increasingly digital classroom environment.\n\nSteven Mangandid, a freshman studying economics/mathematics, said he agrees with the decision to move online. \u201cI feel like moving forward, it would be the best decision to just put the test online because nowadays, almost all other forms of school media are being tested online,\u201d Manganbid said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t really make sense for the SAT to be a test on paper when you\u2019re almost never willing to take the test on paper.\u201d\n\nThe online format may yield an even more significant transition for students who require accommodations, according to a statement by Madison Shaw, assistant director of Policy, Programming and Evaluation at the Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS). \u201cThe online format could be beneficial or detrimental to students depending on the nature of their disability,\u201d Shaw said in a statement sent to Annenberg Media. \u201cStudents who have a condition that is exacerbated by blue light or screen time might have challenges taking an exam digitally. The digital exam format would also need to be accessible for those who have a visual impairment and need to use a screen reader.\u201d\n\nFor online exams, the College Board will allow students to request accommodations for an extended time, human readers and technology assets \u2014 including an electronic magnifying machine, screen reader, speech-to-text and electronic calculators. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that they\u2019re evening the playing field for everyone,\u201d Kawamura said. \u201cIf someone has a disability or they need extra assistance, it\u2019s really good that they\u2019re branching out and trying to make things even for them.\u201d\n\nGwendolyn Smith, international relations major, says the change could help some students who receive accommodations, \u201cfor me, it would probably aid because I guess for context, I have like writing accommodations where I struggle to like, use a pencil so then it\u2019s easier for me personally, to be able to click online.\u201d She adds, \u201cI think it could benefit potentially for reading because I have difficulty reading as well. So I feel like if you\u2019re able to change the text, potentially, like text size or something on the screen, and that can be beneficial.\u201d\n\nDespite updating accessibility and the exams themselves, standardized tests are a hot topic of debate. Kawamura said he doubts their effectiveness as a metric of intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s meaningless and pointless,\u201d Kawamura said. \u201cA lot of it is based on how much you can pay for a tutor. It\u2019s not a test on how smart you are, it\u2019s how much you know the test.\u201d Kawamura chose to take the ACT over the SAT. Even though he performed well, he said his experience was painful because of the months he spent studying and taking the test multiple times for a superscore.\n```"}

The code states that \u201cno person shall obstruct a street, sidewalk, or public right-of-way.\u201d The LA Action Network claims that the rule has been abused by LAPD to target and displace the unhoused.\n\nAction Network organizer Adam Smith believes that the rule fails to solve LA\u2019s rampant homeless issue and instead causes immense distress for those being constantly displaced. Smith: As much as they tried to talk about it being necessary to solve encampments. Yeah, we\u2019ve seen that. It\u2019s just about disappearing, tense, moving people from block to block moving people out of sight from people that don\u2019t want to see them.

The City of Miami Beach posted a YouTube video called \u201cMiami Beach Is Breaking Up With Spring Break\u201d letting tourists know that they don\u2019t plan to tolerate chaos this March. And this time, it\u2019s serious. According to the video, those headed to South Beach can expect curfews, bag checks, restricted beach access, DUI checkpoints, one hundred dollar parking, and strong police enforcement for drug possession and violence. Gov. DeSantis has also said he will deploy 140 state troopers across Florida. 45 of them will be in Miami beach.\n\nDanny Saravia-Varela is a Miami resident studying film production at the University of Southern California, and said spring break has been taking a toll on the locals. Saravia-Varela: I know that during spring break, I\u2019m not going to Miami Beach. You know what I mean? Like Miami Beach is a very, it\u2019s known to be a pretty dangerous place during spring break. Last year, two fatal shootings occurred at South Beach, and the year before, there was a nonfatal shooting in a crowd of spring breakers. Curfews were set in place after that, but Saravia-Varela didn\u2019t think they helped much. In fact, they often times end up making life harder for the locals.\n\nSaravia-Varela: The city is never very good at handling these kinds of situations. They\u2019re raising parking prices and parking is already unbearable, like as a local, you can\u2019t go anywhere in Miami and enjoy it, you know what I mean? And it\u2019s like they\u2019re doing all these things that in order to deter like these tourists that are not respecting the place, but it\u2019s also worsening the experience of living in Miami for locals that are home.\n\nSaravia-Varela said that though too many tourists come in thinking Miami is lawless, a lot of the blame falls on the city itself. Saravia-Varela: During spring break, it\u2019s just like the most exaggerated version of the problem that happens year round that tourism is getting in the way of locals live.\n\nSaravia-Varela was hopeful that measures such as DUI checkpoints might help to curb crime. But, he said those who can afford the penalties will pay them. Saravia-Varela: Spring break always happens, you know, because the industry is there for and it\u2019s always gonna, it\u2019s always gonna want tourists even though the city says that they don\u2019t.\n\nFor those of you planning to go to Miami for your break, be safe and respectful.\n```"}

The total cost of attendance will increase to $95,225, with the $69,904 tuition price tag making up the biggest chunk of that total cost.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t even see $95,000 to $100,000 in a full year of working a full-time job,\u201d said Justin Childress, a senior majoring in business administration. \u201cHow the school expects that type of money each year is wild.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s tuition increase is similar to other private schools across the country like Duke University, Stanford, and Georgetown, which are all facing a hike of four to five percent from 2023-24 to 2024-25.\n\nChildress is one of many students graduating this May and looking forward to his tuition not being increased next year. \u201cAll I can do is say good luck to the students for next year and the years after,\u201d Childress said. \u201cI hope they realize how this affects every student regardless of their financial situation.\u201d\n\nUSC released a statement on Tuesday and said that \u201cUSC\u2019s undergraduate financial aid pool increases at the same rate as the tuition rate increase.\u201d But some students covered by scholarships are worried and still unsure of what to think.\n\n\u201cI would need to see how my scholarship is affected by this increase to give a good reaction,\u201d said Willie Duckworth III, a junior majoring in biotechnology who is on the Gates Millenium Scholarship \u2014 a scholarship provided to 20,000 students of color wanting to attend college. \u201cBut for the people that are only covered a little by scholarships who will be affected, I feel for them.\u201d\n\nStudents without scholarships who are paying out of pocket also have questions about next year\u2019s increase. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of an increase in tuition? It seems like the cost here goes up and no one explains why,\u201d said Kai Hines, a sophomore majoring in international relations and global business who\u2019s paying the full price of tuition. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy paying out of pocket to attend USC.\u201d\n\nNo further information was available on what specifically has inflated tuition costs, but the transportation fee on USC bills increased by $48 from $186 in 2023-24 to $234 in 2024-25, according to USC Public Relations.\n\nBut some students don\u2019t want to hear about the small decreases in total cost. They said they would rather hear about what is being increased in their bills and why. \u201cMy parents already pay an arm and a leg for me to go here so an increase doesn\u2019t really make it easier,\u201d said Hines.\n\nRising seniors who are on their way out of USC wonder how the rising costs could affect their last year. \u201cAll four of my years at USC have been a slow increase in fees at the school and I always wonder why,\u201d said Justice Crawford, a senior studying business administration and entrepreneurship and innovation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to worry about whether or not this affects me getting my degree after doing three years worth of work.\u201d\n\nAs a racial minority at USC, Crawford said he also wonders how this will affect other minorities and their chances of affording to come here. \u201cAs a Black student who is paying mostly out of pocket, I am one of few. There are a lot of Black students out there that cannot afford to pay the tuition even with the help of scholarships,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cI hope that USC takes this into consideration.\u201d\n\nFamilies and friends of students have also been affected by the increase, questioning if the education is worth the cost. \u201cMy little brother is a senior in high school and didn\u2019t want to apply here because of the worry of how expensive it\u2019d be to have two kids here,\u201d Hines said.\n\nChildress even offered that nothing is guaranteed from this investment students and families make by attending school. \u201cUSC is a great school, but there is no guaranteed job right out of college that will give you a return on this investment,\u201d Childress said. \u201cUSC does a good job with trying to help with those connections, but nothing is guaranteed.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Will Simonds March 06, 2024 at 5:02 pm PST\n\nThe regular season for USC women\u2019s basketball went as well as anyone could have expected \u2014 if not better. Freshman guard JuJu Watkins, the nation\u2019s top recruit, instantly solidified herself as one of the sport\u2019s elite players and currently stands as the No. 2 scorer in the nation. USC\u2019s trio of Ivy League graduate transfers has been a legitimate supporting cast that complements Watkins seamlessly. In just her third year of a rebuild effectively from scratch, head coach Lindsay Gottlieb has already established not only a contender in the country\u2019s deepest conference, but also a threat to make noise on the national stage of the NCAA tournament.\n\nStarting the season ranked No. 21 in the AP poll and picked to finish sixth in the Pac-12 in both the coaches and media polls, the Trojans finished the regular season with a 23-5 record, a second-place finish in the conference and No. 5 spot in the AP Top 25. Not only have outside expectations changed for what USC can do in March, but goals within the walls of Galen Center have gradually ascended as this squad keeps winning games. Even Gottlieb admits that she might have underestimated her team\u2019s potential when the season started.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown throughout the year that we can beat anyone,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cGoing as far as we can until someone else stops us maybe is a little further than what we knew it could be.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s resume backs up Gottlieb\u2019s point. Granted, undefeated South Carolina has had another ridiculous season, but the Trojans have wins over what now stand as the other three No. 1 seeds in many bracket projections \u2014 Ohio State, UCLA and Stanford. Gottlieb also noted the benefit of playing in a rigorous conference to prepare her team for this phase of the year. USC faced the sixth-toughest strength of schedule according to NET rankings and compiled a 10-4 record against Quadrant 1 opponents, a mark that rivals any team that isn\u2019t those aforementioned Gamecocks.\n\nLooking ahead at what awaits the Trojans in the Pac-12 tournament this week, that slate of opponents isn\u2019t getting any more forgiving in March. A first-round bye certainly doesn\u2019t hurt, and a No. 2 seed helps to avoid one of the conference\u2019s five other ranked squads in Thursday\u2019s quarterfinals. Even then, the Trojans will still be tasked with defeating an underrated opponent that has already given them issues this season. With its feisty defense, No. 10 seed Washington beat USC in Los Angeles in late January; they\u2019ve also held two ranked teams, Oregon State and Utah, to 51 and 47 points respectively in the last two weeks. On the other side, the Huskies\u2019 first-round opponent \u2014 No. 7 seed Arizona \u2014 just took USC to double overtime last weekend. There simply isn\u2019t anywhere for anyone to hide in the Pac-12 gauntlet.\n\nIf the Trojans can avoid a trap spot on Thursday, they will likely play the winner of No. 6 Utah and No. 3 UCLA. The Utes have probably given USC the most trouble out of any opponent this season, claiming both head-to-head matchups so far. So, perhaps the Bruins would be more desirable from a matchup standpoint, as the Trojans at least split their regular-season contests with their crosstown rivals. And from a storyline perspective, who wouldn\u2019t want to see a deciding third game for all the bragging rights? A win in the semifinals would put USC in Sunday\u2019s championship game after a day off. Top-seeded Stanford is the team most likely to come out of the upper half of the bracket, but No. 4 seed Oregon State and No. 5 seed Colorado are both legitimate threats to upend the Cardinal. You can\u2019t even overlook ninth-seeded Washington State, who won last year\u2019s tournament as a No. 7 seed, as a potential spoiler. Still, Stanford \u2014 led by newly crowned Pac-12 Player and Defensive Player of the Year Cameron Brink \u2014 won the conference regular season title for a reason. USC needed every bit of Watkins\u2019 51-point masterclass to beat the Cardinal in Palo Alto, and Stanford has just one other loss this season in games Brink has finished. It\u2019s hard to believe that the winningest coach in college basketball history wouldn\u2019t have a more stout gameplan to limit Watkins if a Stanford-USC rematch were to occur in the title game.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trojans still have to get there in the first place. After bowing out in the first rounds of both the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments last season, Gottlieb is getting her squad ready for the most exciting month in perhaps all of sports.\n\n\u201cThis time of year, the sort of secret sauce is feeling the joy of March basketball, feeling the joy of coming to be with each other every day, playing loose, and, at the same time, understanding it\u2019s one and done,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cYou have to have an urgency, but not having the urgency stress you out \u2014 it\u2019s a little bit of both.\u201d\n\nMarch is arriving at a good time for a Trojan team that has won nine of its last 10 games. Watkins obviously grabs headlines \u2014 as you\u2019d expect for someone averaging nearly 28 points per game \u2014 but USC is proving that it\u2019s more than just its star freshman. That Ivy League grad transfer trio has been able to carry the load at times; look no further than Saturday\u2019s double overtime win at Arizona after Watkins fouled out with under two minutes to go in the fourth quarter. Guard Kayla Padilla hit the game-tying three at the end of regulation, then nailed a go-ahead three in overtime, then drilled another triple to take the lead in the second extra period. Forward Kaitlyn Davis grabbed a pair of pivotal offensive boards that set up Padilla\u2019s triple in the final seconds of the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her impact in that contest.\n\nKD\u2019s gonna stuff the stat sheet every time 16 points, 9 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 assists for 2\ufe0f\u20e34\ufe0f\u20e3 vs the Wildcats yesterday\n\nGuard McKenzie Forbes is a reliable creator \u2014 both for herself and her teammates \u2014 when Watkins isn\u2019t on the floor. She put that on display with assists on three consecutive possessions in response to Watkins fouling out.\n\n\u201cI think all of us, but Kaitlyn and Kayla especially, have done a great job of adapting to what their role may be in a given game,\u201d Forbes said, pointing out that their roles have changed since being more primary scoring threats at their previous schools. Both Davis and Padilla are taking a fraction of the shots they had in past years, but, as a result, their scoring efficiencies have risen. Not only that, they\u2019ve been more impactful in other areas, such as offensive rebounding for Davis and defensive intensity for Padilla.\n\nThe last, but not least, member of the USC starting five is junior forward Rayah Marshall, who might be hitting her stride at the right time to be an X-factor in Las Vegas. Marshall was inconsistent offensively at the start of Pac-12 play, but she closed the regular season in great form. She\u2019s been as efficient as ever over the past month, highlighted by 41 points over the two-game Arizona trip. The key? Bringing that dawg out, of course.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t being as consistent for my team ... when I do well, our team does well,\u201d Marshall said, adding that a conversation with an assistant coach helped fuel her big weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve been rebounding better \u2014 so it\u2019s just like, what can I bring to the table?\u201d\n\nMarshall\u2019s offensive resurgence, paired with her steady defensive presence in the paint, gives USC a really complete lineup on both ends of the floor. The Trojans will need that in order to run the table in Vegas this week.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 first Pac-12 tournament matchup will be on Thursday at 6 p.m. from the MGM Grand Garden Arena against the winner of Washington and Arizona in the opening round.\n```"}

(AP/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nMarch 06, 2024 at 4:33 pm PST\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 The struggling Anaheim Ducks (22-36-3) parted ways with their second-leading goal scorer Adam Henrique and veteran center Sam Carrick in a three-team trade with the Edmonton Oilers (38-20-2) and Tampa Bay Lightning (33-24-6) on Wednesday. With this trade, the Oilers, aiming to make a deep playoff run, successfully bolstered their forward depth. Edmonton is now second in the Pacific Division, only trailing the Vancouver Canucks by nine points.\n\nThe Ducks will retain 50% of the salaries of both Henrique and Carrick, who are set to become unrestricted free agents this offseason. Edmonton will also gain the Lightning\u2019s seventh-round pick this year and goalie prospect Ty Taylor, with Tampa Bay receiving a 2025 conditional fourth-round pick in exchange.\n\nGiven the Ducks\u2019 recent draft success, receiving the Oilers\u2019 2024 first-round pick is huge. General manager Pat Verbeek will now have a late first-round selection to play with in addition to a likely top-five pick, pending lottery results. Anaheim also receives a conditional fifth-round pick in the 2025 draft.\n\nHenrique was a catalyst for the Ducks this year, spending time on the top lines and tallying 42 points, while also generating a positive plus-minus for the first time since 2017-18. But in his 15th season, Henrique makes a lot more sense for a playoff team than he does on a squad toward the bottom of the standings. The change of scenery will allow him to compete for a Cup again, as he was a member of the New Jersey Devils\u2019 2012 runner-up cast.\n\nCarrick, while less of a force, will also look to give the Oilers extra offensive production, likely on the fourth line. He totaled 11 points in 61 games, averaging roughly 12 and half minutes of ice time per game.\n\nFor the Ducks, shipping off Henrique and Carrick removes two expiring contracts from their books and replaces them with draft picks to further strengthen their deep prospect pool. If the season were to end today, the Oilers\u2019 first-round pick would be the No. 26 overall selection.\n\nThe team also recalled Pavol Regenda and Glenn Gawdin from the San Diego Gulls following the trade to fill Henrique and Carrick\u2019s spots. With touted names like Trevor Zegras and Frank Vatrano still on the roster, the Ducks might still have tough decisions ahead of them before Friday\u2019s noon trade deadline.\n```"}

USC\u2019s wins came against the Towson Tigers in Maryland and Virginia Commonwealth University. However, a loss against lacrosse powerhouse No. 15 Johns Hopkins split the two victories, giving the Trojans a 1-2 record against ranked opponents heading into a three-game homestand.\n\nThe trip began on Friday against Towson, where USC suffered from a slow start in the first quarter, going down 2-1 at the break. But a 5-2 run in the second quarter gave the Trojans a 6-4 halftime lead that they never relinquished, putting five more past the Tigers in the second half while senior goalie Kait Devir only allowed one more Towson goal.\n\nUSC had the opposite issue against the Blue Jays, starting the match on a 4-0 run before falling apart in the second quarter. After the Trojans tallied their first four in the opening 10 minutes, Hopkins scored four unanswered goals to erase USC\u2019s lead, and the Blue Jays extended that to an 8-6 advantage in the second half. The Trojans could only muster four second-half goals to Hopkins\u2019 five, dropping the second game of the trip in Baltimore.\n\nThe final match against VCU was the trip\u2019s highest-scoring, with the two teams combining for over 30 goals. On the back of a five-goal first half from senior attacker Maggie Brown, plus two apiece from senior attacker Shelby Tilton and junior attacker Maddie Dora, the Trojans raced out to a 13-7 halftime lead.\n\nThe Rams didn\u2019t make USC\u2019s life easy in the second half, however. Having scored the final three goals of the second quarter and another two late in the third quarter, VCU had gone on a 5-2 run that forced USC head coach Lindsey Munday to take a timeout to help the team reset, with the Trojans holding a 15-9 advantage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s playing to our standard,\u201d Munday said about her message to the team in that moment. \u201cWe just lacked discipline, our skill in terms of clearing the ball and not turning it over. I think we got lazy. We need to hold the standard no matter what the score is and take pride in what we do.\u201d\n\nAnd while VCU continued to rally with a four-goal final quarter, crucial USC goals from junior midfielder Christina Gagnon and redshirt sophomore attacker Callie Cirilli gave USC its 16th and 17th scores, putting the game out of VCU\u2019s reach. Both Gagnon and Cirilli\u2019s goals were their first of the season.\n\nWhile going to the East Coast and returning with a winning record is undoubtedly a successful trip, a win against a ranked opponent in Johns Hopkins would\u2019ve made a huge difference on the Trojans\u2019 resume, considering USC doesn\u2019t currently have any more ranked opponents on its schedule. Presumably as a result of the Hopkins loss, USC fell one spot from No. 16 to No. 17 in the Inside Lacrosse top 25 ranking.\n\n\u201cI think we learned lessons,\u201d Munday said about the road trip. \u201cI think some lessons were frustrating, some were beneficial... At this point in the season, that\u2019s what you need to do. You need to assess after every game and continue to get better. We just want to not have to learn the same lessons multiple times.\u201d\n\nCrucially, though, the Trojans recovered from a low-scoring 9-3 loss to the Michigan Wolverines and their primary goal-scorers stayed in form across the road trip. Brown, Tilton and Dora all scored in each of the three games, with Brown totalling 10, Tilton six and Dora five. Senior midfielder Claudia Shevitz also posted an explosive, four-goal performance against Towson.\n\nThe team will return to action against Temple at 1 p.m. Friday at Dignity Health Sports Park, the team\u2019s temporary home while the university constructs Rawlinson Stadium, the team\u2019s future home.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is playing together and having connection,\u201d Munday said. \u201cAt moments, we lost that today [against VCU]. So, again, using every single player on this team and really playing together and having a great connection on the field ... it\u2019s going to have to be a team effort.\u201d```"}

We\u2019re talking about how the LA Metro is offering free rides to help voters cast their ballots, ensuring transportation isn\u2019t a hurdle on this crucial day of civic engagement.\n\nBy Sethan Perez, Aidan Williams, and Makena Arteaga\nMarch 06, 2024 at 12:58 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s Super Tuesday, a pivotal moment for voters across the country and Los Angeles. And thanks to LA Metro, getting to the polls has never been easier- or more affordable. In an effort to ensure every voice is heard, the LA Metro is offering free rides on its entire network: buses, trains, bikes, and even the on-demand rideshare service, Metro Micro. This initiative breaks down one of the most significant barriers to voting: transportation.\n\nRick Jagger, a media representative for the LA Metro, shed light on the motivation behind the LA Metro\u2019s move to offer these free services. Jagger: Our board back in 2019, voted to permanently offer free rides on all federal and statewide election days. They did this to kind of make it easier for voters to get to the polls via public transit. They felt that transportation or the lack of transportation should not be a burden for people who want to get out and vote.\n\nCurious about how to utilize the metro\u2019s complimentary services, today? Jagger shared all the details. Jagger: If you\u2019re using the Metro bus or metro train, the buses will have their farebox over tap covered offer saying that it\u2019s free rides today. For the train stations, the turnstiles and app validators will be cleared, so that you can enter the station without having to tap your card. Not a fan of public transit? You can try their metrobikes or rideshare options. Jagger: We\u2019re also offering free rides on our metro bike share program, or we\u2019re providing 30 minute rides if they use the promo code 030524. And in addition, we\u2019re also offering free rides on metros on demand rideshare service called Metro micro.\n\nRakon Branch, a petitioner out at USC, praised the LA Metro\u2019s efforts to increase accessibility for voters. Branch: I think it\u2019s pretty cool is making it accessible for more people. Now, people don\u2019t really have an excuse not to vote. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I was a person who thought it was, you know, it didn\u2019t really matter. But as I learned more about it and got more information, it does. And I think it\u2019s cool that they\u2019re making it accessible for everybody.\n\nEva Kaleigh, a senior studying psychology at USC, feels that the Metro\u2019s initiatives are particularly beneficial for students without personal transportation. Kaleigh: I think it is a great way to promote people to vote. I feel like especially in LA. It\u2019s like a big barrier in terms of travel. I know a lot of who don\u2019t trust pt. And people, especially like college students, they don\u2019t have cars and stuff like that. So I feel like putting taking away as many barriers as possible to get to a polling station is always a good thing.\n\nKaleigh also emphasized the importance of voting in the primary elections. Kaleigh: I think it\u2019s important people vote in the primary because I think it\u2019s a good practice. This is like the first election that I\u2019ve been old enough to vote in. So I was like, you know, I want to flex that muscle. So that way want to really, really matters. I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m comfortable with the process.\n\nJoanna Lu, a business major at USC, underscored the significance of eliminating transportation as a barrier to voting. Lu: I think getting to voting center itself is a huge part of that voting process in general. I think it\u2019s great. It\u2019s getting people out to vote at a low cost. And it\u2019s just encouraging voting all around and making it easy for them to get access to it. So I think it\u2019s great.\n\nPerspectives like these make it clear that the community sees value in the LA Metro\u2019s effort, recognizing it not just as a convenience but as a crucial step towards inclusive voting. As we move through the day, the LA Metro stands as a beacon of Los Angeles\u2019 commitment to democracy, offering not just a ride, but a bridge over one of the many obstacles on the path to the polling station.\n```"}

Stepping into the polling booths for the first time with the power to vote and make real change is a rite of passage for many Americans. Today we spoke to three first-time voters at the USC Village polling location Expand ARN's 2024 Super Tuesday special: From Where We Vote. (Graphic by Sam Bitman) By Kate Stuzin March 06, 2024 at 12:51 pm PST\n\nA mix of responsibility and anticipation filled the polls as many USC students cast their ballots for the first time on Super Tuesday. Before she was of voting age, civic engagement felt \u201csuperficial\u201d to Bethany Klause, a freshman business administration major. Klause: It\u2019s my first time voting and my first time qualified to vote. I always thought it was would be cool to get an \u2018I Voted sticker\u2019 and I\u2019ve always looked forward to it. Now feeling like I\u2019m actually contributing to society and the government and that my vote actually matters somewhere\u2019s cool. Klause prioritized registering to vote and making her voice heard at the polls. However, this isn\u2019t the case for a lot of young people aged 18 to 24. According to a 2022 Tufts study, national youth voter turnout is declining in the primary elections . In 2018, 28% percent of youth went to the polls. But in 2022, it dropped to 23%. Low youth voter turnout doesn\u2019t come from a lack of young people\u2019s understanding or care for current political issues, but rather because they aren\u2019t well informed on the political process. Freshman Jason Che is an international student from Japan. He had to jump over a few hurdles before successfully voting for the first time today. Che: I\u2019m an international student, but I\u2019m an American citizen. I got the mailing ballot for the first time. I was always curious about what voting would be like. I didn\u2019t even know that they didn\u2019t like mail ballots. I always thought everybody had to go to booth like they had to go somewhere to vote. Institutional barriers to voter registration and confusing absentee ballot applications deter many young people from heading to the polls. California allows for same-day voter registration, but many states require registration well in advance. But Klause says she didn\u2019t have any problems registering. Klause: I think USC made it a little easier, because there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to vote here and a lot of advertisements to be able to do that. VoteSC works to educate students on voting timelines and answer questions on registration processes, but resources like that aren\u2019t as accessible for youth outside the USC bubble. Sophomore business administration major John Recendez registered to vote a few weeks ago at a VoteSC tabling event. He says he voted today because he owed someone a favor. Recendez: One of the acts was like, funding for like, the mental health stuff. I didn\u2019t know that was gonna be on there. So I just said, yeah. I feel like it\u2019s a big problem in California. Recendez is referring to Proposition 1, which would provide a $6.4 billion bond to revamp California\u2019s mental health services and facilities. Whatever gets you out to vote, whether it be social issues or a specific candidate, the polls are open till 8 p.m. PST tonight.\n```"}

It deals with funding for housing and mental health services, but what exactly are the issues at hand?\n\nProp 1 promises to revamp California\u2019s mental healthcare system and help solve the unhoused and drug crises in the state. It\u2019s a tall order, one that plenty of people find suspect. Supporters of the proposition say that it will provide restructured care for unhoused people, the mentally ill, veterans and addicts. Opponents say that the proposed legislation is inefficient and impractical.\n\nJames Espinoza, president and CEO of the Veterans Mentor Project, said that he considers Prop 1 a necessary update to existing state healthcare systems. Espinoza, a law enforcement and Army veteran, publicly supported Prop 1 because he feels it addresses long-standing problems in California.\n\nEspinoza: Taking a look at more services mandated for people who are deemed to need them, and also taking into account the number of people we have facing homelessness, likely due to mental health issues currently, I think it\u2019s really necessary at this point. I\u2019ve seen the problem not only get worse in my career, not only in terms of recidivism of people in and out of behavioral health that I believe that \u2013 I believe that something needs to change, so I choose to support this.\n\nBut Prop 1 has its critics as well. Assembly member Diane Dixon, who represents the 72nd Assembly District, has been vocally against Prop 1.\n\nDiane Dixon: I do not believe that the state has the wherewithal to efficiently manage this bond measure to provide mental health and homeless housing services to the people of California. I do believe, though, services are important for a level of government to provide and the level of government should be counties, so this is my fundamental point of difference.\n\nFunding for the bill would have to come from California taxpayers, much of it being diverted from existing healthcare programs. Dixon made it clear that while she supports finding solutions for homelessness and mental health care on the county level, she finds this statewide proposition impractical.\n\nDixon: I\u2019m sorry to say this, they will not be able to deliver on these promises. They will create expectations and who knows the accountability of where all this money will be spent? And how will it be spent? I support help and rehabilitation for mental illness and the drug addictions that go along with, that contribute to mental illness. I just think this system that they\u2019ve laid out is not efficient and, and will bring poor results.\n\nThe practical limitations of Prop 1 are not lost on Espinoza. But he has a vision for a California where Prop 1 succeeds, as far-fetched as they may be.\n\nEspinoza: You\u2019re free to walk the streets, because it\u2019s not cluttered with a bunch of unhoused folks, people that might be dealing with drug issues or mental health issues. And then they\u2019re free to live their lives again because now they\u2019re back in treatment, hopefully in housing, healthy, with services. That\u2019s \u2013 maybe that\u2019s a little rose-colored lenses way to look at the bill, but something needs to change.\n\nStill, Prop 1\u2032s opponents raise important points about the feasibility of the legislation and the expense to taxpayers. Tonight, Californians will make the choice and, one way or another, shape the path of behavioral healthcare in the state.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Marie Louise Leone.\n```"}

(Graphic by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Shane Dimapanat and Makena Arteaga\nMarch 06, 2024 at 12:41 pm PST\n\nWhat\u2019s Super Tuesday? Well, it might be the most important election for Americans have before Election Day in November. Today, voters in sixteen states and the territory of Samoa, will be heading to the polls- resulting in the biggest primary election, including caucuses, before November. Today\u2019s voters can be the definitive voice in deciding the primaries.\n\nGregg Johnson: If a candidate doesn\u2019t do well, on Super Tuesday, they have essentially zero chance of becoming the nominee. That was Gregg Johnson, a political scientist at Valparaiso University in Indiana. As he tells us, Super Tuesday is usually the clearest indication for each party\u2019s presidential nomination. But he also tells us a bit more about why 2024\u2032s Super Tuesday is not as super as previous years.\n\nJohnson: Super Tuesday is perhaps not quite so super simply because there is an incumbent Democratic president and the past president of the Republican Party, or past president who led the Republican Party is running for reelection and basically has very little opposition. So barring something extremely unusual, as in a meteor hits the earth, Donald Trump and and Joe Biden will sweep the states today.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Biden and Trump are the frontrunners for their parties. In fact, they\u2019re already leading their respective races. Over one-third of delegates for both Republicans and Democrats are up for grabs. The Republican presidential nominee needs to get 1215 delegates today. The Democrat presidential nominee needs 1968. Both Trump and President Biden are expected to cinch the nominations of their respective parties. They face no serious opposition in their races. Nikki Haley is still holding on in the Republican primaries, but she\u2019s barely trailing Trump, with a little over 40 delegates today. Biden on the other hand faces a wave of \u201cuncommitted\u201d voters protesting the war in Gaza- he has not commented on the matter.\n\nTrump could get the Republican Party\u2019s nomination as soon as March 12 and Biden could get the Democrat\u2019s nomination by March 19th.\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/03/06/lakers-nuggets-thunder-recap/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 For better and for worse, the Los Angeles Lakers are a second-half team. The Lakers kicked off March facing two of the top three teams in the Western Conference. The No. 3 ranked and defending NBA Champion Denver Nuggets visited  Crypto.com  Arena in a 124-114 comeback win. Two days later on March 4, the Lakers bounced back with a 116-104 win over the 2 ranked Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nOne of the high points in the Nuggets matchup came at the 10:41 mark in the second quarter, when Lakers forward LeBron James became the first and only NBA player to reach 40,000 career points. \u201cHate that it had to happen in a defeat,\u201d James said to the media postgame. \u201cBittersweet, but enjoyed every moment tonight out on the floor.\u201d\n\nThe night started off sweet as the Lakers took their first lead early in the first quarter and didn\u2019t let it go until late in the third. The Lakers absolutely controled the first half with their largest lead being 11 points. On paper, the first half was matched pretty evenly. The Lakers shot 57% from the field compared to Denver\u2019s 54%. The story was the same beyond the arc, as well. The Lakers shot 40% from three and Denver was close behind with 35%. What put the Lakers in the driver\u2019s seat was the effort and execution. While the Nuggets finished the first half with 25 rebounds compared to the Lakers\u2019s 18, seven Denver turnovers allowed the Lakers to capitalize off of the reigning champions\u2019 mistakes. Hustle plays paired with a team 75% free throw percentage off of six Denver fouls led the Lakers to a 66-58 lead over Denver at halftime.\n\nMuch of the third quarter was marked by the same Laker lead. The Nuggets would tie the score 75-75 at the 6:30 mark before eventually regaining the lead for the first time since early in the first. The Lakers battled back valiantly; they kept Denver\u2019s lead under five points into the beginning of the fourth and even got back out in front. When they missed shots, they recovered with rebounds and blocks. But Denver\u2019s shooting slump was over right when the Lakers\u2019 began. The Nuggets finished the second half shooting 64% from the field, while the Lakers slumped to 48%. And whenever their shooters missed, Nuggets center Nikola Jokic or forward Aaron Gordon were there swiftly with the putback. With under four minutes left in the game, the Nuggets went on a 16-4 run. Jokic led his team with 35 points, 10 reboounds and seven assists. Forward Michael Porter Jr. was behind Jokic with 25 points while going 5 for 5 from three. On his historic night, James scored 26 points and 9 assists. Lakers forward Rui Hachimura contributed 23 points on 66% shooting and center Anthony Davis led the defensive effort with 11 rebounds and 3 blocks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always kind of the fourth quarter, the last six minutes or the last few minutes of the game,\u201d James said. \u201cThey make plays, we don\u2019t make plays, and that can be frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets\u2019 third win against the Lakers this season meant that the Nuggets swept the Lakers in the regular season. The Lakers only had one day to recover from the loss. Next, the purple and gold faced the young and dominating Oklahoma City Thunder who they had a 2-1 record against in the regular season. The Thunder came out strong in the first quarter with a consistent lead that fluctuated around 10 points. But at the 10:04 mark in the second quarter, the curtains rose and the Lake Show began. Lakers center-forward Jaxson Hayes kicked things off with an alley-oop from James. Hayes would play nearly 18 minutes in comparison to his season average of 11 minutes per game. The entire Lakers bench, including L.A.\u2019s newest acquisition Harry Giles III, received some playing time.\n\nThe Thunder ended the first half shooting just 31% from the field compared to the Lakers\u2019 51%. Despite 12 turnovers, the Lakers had a 52-43 lead at halftime. The Lakers improved from behind the arc in the second half, shooting 11 for 22. They finished the game shooting 47% from three. Lakers guard D\u2019Angelo Russell shot 5 for 11 from three and was the Lakers\u2019 top scorer, finishing with 26 points. Lakers guard Austin Reaves had a nice shooting night as well, going 4 for 5 from behind the arc and scoring a total of 16 0n the night.\n\n\u201cA lot of stuff can be a distraction,\u201d Russell said to media postgame. \u201cDistract you from the main goal, which is put the ball in the hoop. I\u2019ve seen [Reaves] over time just change his approach and stay locked in the moment.\u201d\n\nAn impressive shooting performance from the pair of Lakers guards was anchored by a standout defensive showing from the team. The Lakers ended the night with 55 rebounds in comparison to the Thunder\u2019s 35. The Lakers had 7 blocks for the night, matching the Thunder who lead the league with 6.8 blocks per game. Lakers Head Coach Darvin Ham told the media during his postgame press conference he was pleased with his team\u2019s ability to weather the early first-quarter storm that included plenty of Lakers turnovers. He told the team it was their best defensive half all season.\n\n\u201cIt was contagious,\u201d Ham said. \u201cAll of our guys were like-minded in terms of, again, having a defensive mentality and individual pride on the ball.\u201d\n\nA win and a loss means the Lakers currently have a 34-29 record and don\u2019t move from the No. 9 spot in the Western Conference standings.\n```"}

Now, student-athletes are joining the mix, after Dartmouth\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team voted 13-2 to unionize this afternoon, meaning the players are officially recognized as employees of the university. All players on the team\u2019s roster voted in the election, which was conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, in the school\u2019s human resources office.\n\nDaniel Turbin, a professor of rhetoric and sports at USC, said that the decision could lead to change at higher-profile athletic programs across the country.\n\nTURBIN: It\u2019s not that they\u2019re trying to to get individual rights or benefits for the actual players on the Dartmouth team. They are there to set a precedent, right and move the protection of athletes forward or at least move the power of athletes in their in their own work environment.\n\nWhile the unionization poses a threat to the NCAA\u2019s business model, Turbin said there\u2019s no reason for them to panic.\n\nTURBIN: I don\u2019t think the unionization is something to really be frightened of, although the NCAA, you know, they\u2019re, they love their power so much. They\u2019re frightened of anything. And so it\u2019s, you know, they\u2019re gonna fight it, I presume. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be frightened of.\n\nFor the longest time, college athletic programs have had complete control over their athlete\u2019s publicity rights and have abused that power for the benefit of coaches and schools. Over recent years, however, various court decisions have begun to tear down that control, and athletes now possess the rights to their name, image, and likeness, better known as NIL.\n\nToday\u2019s vote to unionize is yet another addition to that trend.\n\nThomas Johnson, USC Annenberg Media\u2019s Sports Web Editor and a junior studying journalism, said that today\u2019s vote may not have any immediate effect.\n\nJOHNSON: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see any actionable things take place for a couple years down the line, when I\u2019m well out of college. So it could be seen in athletic departments. Five years down the line, but I don\u2019t think anything in the near future.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or not the NCAA will fight the unionization, but the vote throws more fuel into the already raging fire surrounding college athletes\u2019 rights.\n```"}

Today is Super Tuesday, and what that means is that today is when the largest number of states will be holding presidential primaries or caucuses.\n\nIn California, our voters are going to be deciding on a variety of key issues that will come into play within the next few months, and especially during the Presidential elections in November. Today\u2019s election includes contests between both Democratic and Republican nominees for November\u2019s election for the next President of the United States.\n\nBoth Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican front-runner Donald Trump are hanging in the balance of these primaries, hoping to successfully advance to the presidential election where they are generally expected to have a rematch of their face-off in 2020.\n\nIn addition, today\u2019s primary will reveal the successor of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who passed away last fall. Today, there are a total of 27 candidates reaching to replace Senator Feinstein, however, the race appears to be leaning towards a victory from one of the four front runners; US Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff \u2014 and also Republican and former Los Angeles Dodger Steve Garvey.\n\nOutside of these pivotal issues, LA voters will also be deciding on Proposition 1, which Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has posed as a means of transforming our outdated mental health system and addressing the growing homelessness crisis.\n\nIncluded on the ballot is also the eleven candidates in competition to replace current LA County District Attorney, George Gascon, as well as the race to replace Incumbent county Supervisor Janice Hahn on the LA County Board of Supervisors.\n\nLastly, voters will contest over a myriad of House races, and if you live in the City of Los Angeles, you\u2019ll also vote on Measure HLA, which would compel LA into redesigning the its streets to make them safer for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nFor more information and election results, head over to our website, uscannenbergmedia.com and to cast a last minute vote, rush over to your closest voting center and get your vote in before 8pm today!\n```"}

However, despite the power of political speeches around election cycles, there is a common problem many people experience when listening in: what do all these political buzzwords mean?\n\nWhile there are many buzzwords being thrown around right now, the most common word in California Politics right now is the term \u201cproposition\u201d. A Proposition is a proposed change to a providence\u2019s constitution or laws that is handed to voters to decide upon. The term proposition is interchangeable with the phrase \u201cstate measure\u201d when used in the context of state law and can be found on California ballots under the latter name.\n\nNow for a term as inconspicuous as the subject it covers: the down-ballot vote. Down-ballot votes are political contests that are relatively low-profile compared to larger contests such as presidential, congressional, gubernatorial and mayoral elections, but often still hold vast significance. For example, in Los Angeles, we are holding a highly contentious LA county district attorney race. While this race is not as exciting as deciding the leader of the free world, the LA attorney general plays a key role in determining how the city approaches criminal prosecution, a major responsibility that could affect hundreds of people each day cycling through LA criminal courts. Certainly, a race worth voting with care on.\n\nNBC Local News Political Editor Mark Maxwell describing a Republican caucus event that happened in rural Missouri a few days ago. Speaking of caucuses, there will be five caucuses taking place today and ten primaries. What does that actually mean though? Well, caucuses involve party-run gatherings, like the local gymnasium event from the NBC feature, on the county, precinct or local where political party insiders vote for which delegates they want to send to the national convention ahead of the Presidential Election. Each delegate supports one presidential candidate or the other and will vote for them to be the presidential nominee during the national convention.\n\nPrimaries, on the other hand, are run by state governments and allow all eligible voters to vote on which delegates they want to attend the party national convention. So, let's say you vote for Biden today in our California State Primary. Who you are really voting for is a Biden-linked delegate from your county or providence that will attend the Democratic National Convention and throw their support behind Biden for the party\u2019s presidential candidate. The main takeaways are that Primaries are much more open than caucuses are as far as who can vote, and because of this are considered more democratic. Primaries are also run by the government, compared to caucuses which are run by state parties.\n```"}

But this year, I feel like many of the candidates have stepped down, because Trump has been in a position of power. And I feel this year, maybe Trump might be in power. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not sure of the reasons ... as to why would that happen, but I feel like Trump has pretty good chances to be elected this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe leadership difference between Joe Biden and Trump has been ... earth and sky. I can\u2019t even start where the differences come true. But Joe Biden has been inclusive of all the viewpoints in his presidency. And whereas Trump is more \u2014 really more aggressive toward the business side within something. Anything that is profitable for him is something that he goes to invest in. So I feel like Joe Biden should get re-elected, but I am not sure if he\u2019s gonna get it.\u201d\n\nBelle Tatsing - sophomore political science major\n\u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t expecting it.

(AP/Lindsey Wasson)\n\nBy Matt Kim March 05, 2024 at 9:22 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 With a few spring training games in the books, the Angels have the third-best record in the Cactus League (6-3), tied with the Texas Rangers, the reigning World Series champs. Although the actual wins and losses of spring training don\u2019t mean much, they\u2019re a useful indicator for the upcoming regular season as it shows what the talent on hand can do.\n\nIn a small sample size, some Angels players have taken advantage of their limited at-bats, while others have struggled out of the gate. Aaron Hicks, who\u2019s battling for the last outfield spot next alongside Mike Trout and Taylor Ward, has mashed opposing pitching to the tune of a .455/.571/.1000 slashline. He\u2019s surprised many, including myself as this seems like a potential career revival. He\u2019s recorded as many total bases as at-bats (11) and seems like a shoe-in for the Opening Day lineup on March 28 against the Orioles.\n\nAt the other end, Jo Adell and Mickey Moniak have struggled mightily so far, combining for only six hits in 27 at-bats and only one home run. They still have over three weeks left of Cactus League play to fine-tune their approaches, but if Hicks continues to impress, they\u2019ll be left on the bench or start the season at Triple-A.\n\nAnother Halo who\u2019s been hitting the cover off the baseball is Zach Neto. The projected Opening Day shortstop for the Angels has posted an OPS just over 1.000 while only striking out twice in 14 at bats. He\u2019s only walked once, which is a bit concerning, but if Neto maintains an approach balanced between contact and power, he\u2019ll be in for a monster sophomore season.\n\nWhile there are plenty of rookies and veterans looking to crack the Opening Day roster, the most important piece of this team is Mike Trout, of course. Trout has limped to an ugly .154 batting average with only one extra-base-hit, but the most important thing for the Angels\u2019 star center-fielder is health. If Trout can remain healthy throughout the spring and into the regular season, the production will almost certainly follow. I\u2019m certain he\u2019ll find his groove soon and give a glimpse into the future of what a healthy Mike Trout can still do.\n\nI\u2019ve previously mentioned how this team needs sophomore first baseman Nolan Schanuel to increase his power numbers from his rookie season, but so far this spring, that hasn\u2019t happened. All five of his hits have been singles and a high batting average is nice, but the Angels need him to trade some of that contact for power. That will increase his value on offense, especially in a traditional power position at first base.\n\nOn the pitching side, most of the rotation hasn\u2019t been stretched out yet, as Griffin Canning leads the team with only five innings pitched. Speaking of Canning, he hasn\u2019t allowed a run in those five innings, but he\u2019s also allowed seven hits while only striking out four batters. In a previous article, I mentioned that Canning needed to reduce the amount of hits allowed, especially home runs. Hitters haven\u2019t put the ball over the fence against him yet which is a good sign, but the seven hits is not ideal.\n\nIn an under-the-radar move from this past offseason, the Angels acquired RHP Guillermo Zuniga from the Cardinals and he\u2019s impressed so far with his triple-digit heater. In three innings, he\u2019s struck out five and hasn\u2019t issued a walk, showing how he might earn a higher leverage spot in Ron Washington\u2019s bullpen. The Angels went out and signed multiple free agents this offseason, including Robert Stephenson, Matt Moore, Hunter Strickland and Drew Pomeranz, but if Zuniga continues to rack up the strikeouts, he\u2019ll be an intriguing late inning option.\n\nThere\u2019s been speculation of whether the Angels will utilize a six-man rotation or a more traditional five-man rotation. When manager Ron Washington was asked about this, he told reporters, \u201cright off the bat I\u2019ll say five\u201d per Washington, per the OC Register. He did leave the door open for a six-man rotation, as the Angels will experiment with reliever Jose Soriano in the rotation. The Angels rotation struggled in 2023, compared to the season prior where they were sixth in starting rotation ERA. Soriano has great strikeout stuff, featuring an upper-90s fastball and mid-80s curveball, but has struggled with command in the past. He\u2019ll be a potential depth option for the rotation, especially if other depth pieces like Jose Suarez and Davis Daniel struggle in spring training.\n\nIf the Angels continue to roll while veterans Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon slowly heat up, they might turn some heads as the regular season approaches.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of LAUSD)\n\nBy Quinten Seghers March 05, 2024 at 6:25 pm PST\n\nSome USC students who voted in the California primary elections for LAUSD school board seats said they weren\u2019t familiar with who they were voting for \u2014 they did, however, know the issues they cared about. They cited greater access to mental health services, showcasing LGBTQ+ voices and financially supporting communities of color as steps that LAUSD should take.\n\nUSC is located inside LAUSD School Board District 1 which also includes the Mid-City, Crenshaw, Arlington Heights and Westmont neighborhoods. LAUSD is the second largest public school district in the country, with over half a million students in its schools. The school board has seven seats and four of them are up for election this year.\n\nThere are seven candidates vying for the District 1 school board seat \u2014 the most out of any district this election. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get through and there\u2019s so many things to vote on,\u201d said Jack O\u2019Neil, a freshman majoring in political science. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be really well informed about them all.\u201d\n\nCandidate Kahllid Al-Alim has recently come under fire for his past social media activity in which he liked a post promoting teaching children anti-semitic content. Teachers\u2019 unions have spent thousands of dollars on his campaign, but United Teachers Los Angeles decided to revoke their endorsement during an emergency meeting Monday night, according to the LA Times.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bad,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t vote for him.\u201d O\u2019Neil voted for DeWayne Davis, who was a teacher for 29 years before becoming a principal and then an educational strategist. He aims to create a \u201cquality education program\u201d that ensures students can adapt to life after school.\n\n\u201cJust when I looked up all the candidates, he just won,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cHe seemed genuine.\u201d\n\nThe school board is responsible for hiring and firing the superintendent, overseeing the budget, resolving any disputes and voting on any charter school that wishes to open in LA.\n\nHayley Block, a sophomore majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change, supports adding more charter schools to LAUSD. While she couldn\u2019t recall who she voted for, she knows what issues she\u2019d like to see addressed by the school board \u2014 financial reallocation.\n\nBlock said more funding should be allocated to communities of color and that having more charter schools will result in LAUSD being able to devote more resources to lower-income families. Block also said that schools in more affluent areas get better funding and more resources, which she feels is unnecessary because those schools already receive \u201ccommunity resources.\u201d\n\nJacy DeVault, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, said she decides who to vote for based on information she\u2019s found online and through the opinions of her friends. DeVault said that LAUSD should be initiating conversations with students surrounding mental health and the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the issues that Republicans kinda talk about is they want to weaponize a lack of knowledge,\u201d DeVault said. \u201cI think the more you learn about different things then the more you can sympathize with other people and so I think that ... learning about LGBTQ rights or mental health rights is good.\u201d```"}

Climate change has only made the wildfire problem worse, as research done by the Texas State Center for Water and the Environment says that Texas\u2019s warming will increase the likelihood and severity of wildfires.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced that he would be sending in a California National Guard unit especially equipped to fight fires. \u201cIn times of crisis, Americans stand together,\u201d Newsom said in a statement made earlier today. \u201cCalifornia has built a nation-leading firefighting fleet and we\u2019re proud to lend a helping hand to Texas as the Lone Star State battles the largest wildfire in its history.\u201d\n\nChristophe Merriam, a sophomore studying the business of cinematic arts from Houston, said these fires are another example of Texas being ill-prepared for natural disasters. \u201cIt\u2019s the same story over and over for Texas,\u201d Merriam said. \u201cTexas doesn\u2019t honestly do all that it should take care of the people in that state. That\u2019s why states like California are rushing to help give us aid; states that actually have the resources to do it because Texas refuses to stay up to the environmental codes there.\u201d\n\nMerriam said that this alleged lack of preparedness worries him for the future and was one of the reasons he moved out of state to attend college in California. \u201cI had been through Hurricane Harvey and I was in an area that was a part of the 95% destruction,\u201d Merriam said. \u201cOut of all the buildings in my neighborhood, over 95% of them were destroyed during Hurricane Harvey. It is cheaper [to live in Texas], but it\u2019s at a cost. I feel like that\u2019s the thing that skipped over a lot.\u201d\n\nThe biggest fire Texas firefighters are currently fighting is the Smokehouse Creek Fire, located in Hutchinson County in northern Texas. According to the Texas A&M Forest Service, the fire has burned more than one million acres of land and is only 37% contained. The blaze burned as much of Texas\u2019s land as the August Complex Fire in 2020 did in California, the largest fire in the Golden State\u2019s history according to Cal Fire.\n\nVatche Babikian, a junior studying biological sciences and a Los Angeles resident, recalled his experience with the state\u2019s wildfires. \u201cI remember in high school, there was a really big wildfire that happened here in L.A. and pretty much all the schools and everything got shut down for about a week or so,\u201d Babikian said. \u201cI feel like a lot of these wildfires that occur happened because of poor decisions by people, for example, like getting a cigarette and just throwing getting somewhere very dry.\u201d\n\nAnother Los Angeles resident, Lachlan Bailey, a sophomore studying neuroscience, remembered how his family was affected. \u201cI did have some family living in the Santa Monica area,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThere were some bad fires and definitely like, over the years where there [have] been times where the smoke has been really bad air quality, not great at all.\u201d\n\nKevin Vartani, a senior studying business administration, advocated that by funding wildfire protection programs, California could lessen the impact of wildfires. \u201c[We can improve them] by probably putting more funds into the forest areas, because I know now they\u2019re heavily looked over,\u201d Vartani said. \u201cWe definitely need to invest more money because climate change is a real thing and it\u2019s affecting us to this day.\u201d\n\nMerriam said that Texas\u2019s wildfires are an ongoing issue they have to manage, especially with the increase in natural disasters as a result of climate change. Research from the United States Geological Survey says that with increased global surface temperatures, there is a possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms. \u201cTexas gets like almost every natural disaster except for earthquakes,\u201d Merriam said. \u201cWe get hurricanes. We get, in recent years due to global climate change, freezes and stuff which destroys our power grid. We get tornadoes, we get all different types of things. It\u2019s a severe issue and, sadly, it\u2019s something that\u2019s more highly contested in Texas.\u201d\n```"}

While prospective overnight multi-millionaires try their luck, others know they have a greater chance of becoming president than hitting the jackpot. Phil Wong, a property manager from South Pasadena, says his biggest cashout from a lottery ticket was $183. He bought a Powerball ticket earlier this week. \u201c[I will] stop here because we\u2019re going to win it,\u201d Wong said. Powerball currently holds an estimated jackpot of $485 million. According to the California Lottery website, the cash amount after taxes would reach about $232 million, under half of the estimated jackpot. Mega Millions is holding a grand prize estimate of about $650 million, which is valued at over $308 million in estimated cash. According to the Multi-State Lottery Association, the odds of matching all five numbers and the golden number for a Powerball ticket are 1 in 292 million. The odds of winning any prize (at least four dollars) are one in 25. It is marginally harder to win the jackpot prize for Mega Millions, as the odds of winning are one in 302 million. Here are some more likely circumstances than winning the grand prize, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal: Hitting a hole-in-one in golf as a professional golfer, with odds at 1 in 2500. Winning an Olympic gold medal, with odds at 1 in 662,000. Becoming president of the United States, with odds at 1 in 32.6 million. Some Los Angeles residents like Ramiro Caldera have little faith in the lottery. He last bought a ticket 15 years ago, joking with his friend that they were going to win big, but now doesn\u2019t play. \u201cWhen people are trying to survive, I think it\u2019s [more] important to use our money to help a homeless person,\u201d Caldera said. Isaiah Alwin, a sophomore studying journalism at USC, said he enjoys occasional scratch-offs and sports betting but isn\u2019t buying a ticket due to the extraordinarily low odds. \u201cI think a lot of people have a very unhealthy relationship with gambling, whether it\u2019s scratch-offs, playing the lottery, or sports gambling, which is getting really popular,\u201d Alwin said. \u201cI think everything in moderation can be fun. But when you\u2019re like relying on gambling to sustain your life, then it\u2019s not good.\u201d Alwin had success with scratch-offs and described his personal experience in gambling as mostly positive, but he said gambling generally has negative consequences for the general public. Billboards across the country boast the jackpot sums in glowing letters. Freeways, gas station windows, and even online banners beckon Americans looking to get lucky. Caldera says these advertisements catch his eye, but couldn\u2019t convince him to buy one. Millions of other Americans think otherwise as people scramble to score their lucky numbers. Powerball and Mega Millions follow a similar model for prize redemption. Both corporations\u2019 lottery tickets are priced at $2 each. For Powerball, a buyer selects five numbers between one and 69 and a Power Number between one and 26. Ticket buyers are also allowed to use the Powerball Quick Pick, which generates random number selections on the ticket. Mega Millions allows players to select the first five numbers between one and 70 and a gold ball number between one and 25. Mega Millions also allows for quick, generated number selections. If all numbers match from the ticket to the draw, that ticket wins. Powerball will continue to draw numbers three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Mega Millions hosts draws every Tuesday and Friday at 11 p.m. ET. The Powerball lottery has gone 27 straight weeks without a grand prize ticket being sold. The last jackpot winner of Mega Millions cashed $394 million in Encino on Dec. 8.\n```"}

Following a home win over the Wizards, the Clippers are in the midst of a three-game road stint and Los Angeles\u2019 first two games of that trip have been rather underwhelming.\n\nThe trip started in Minnesota where the Clippers found themselves in a defensive battle against the top team in the west. Even though the Clippers escaped with an 89-88 victory, a majority of Los Angeles\u2019 stars underperformed and left a bad taste in fans\u2019 mouths. The Clips found buckets hard to come by in this game and only managed to score 18 points in the first quarter, trailing the Timberwolves 30-18 at the first break. However, Los Angeles managed to settle in and after getting a few stops on the defensive end, a Paul George triple with 8:59 remaining in the second quarter gave the Clippers their first lead.\n\nThe scoring did not pick up much for both sides as Los Angeles entered halftime with a narrow three-point lead. The Clippers and Timberwolves continued their back-and-forth, low-scoring affair into the fourth quarter as Norman Powell, who finished the game with 24 points, hit a three pointer on the run to beat the buzzer at the end of the third quarter, bring the Clippers back to a 68-67 deficit. But things began to pick up in the game\u2019s final minutes as Kawhi Leonard converted a traditional three point play opportunity to give Los Angeles an 87-84 lead with 2:01 remaining in the fourth. With time running out, the Clippers allowed the Timberwolves to score an easy dunk and keep their lead at one, forcing Minnesota to play the foul game. After poor execution from the Timberwolves, the Clippers held on until the final buzzer and escaped with the one point victory.\n\nKawhi Leonard led the way with 32 points, followed by Powell\u2019s 24 points, but James Harden struggled mightily all night long as he went 0-10 from the field and finished with just four points. Sunday was the seventh time in Harden\u2019s career where he played a game without scoring a field goal. Paul George also struggled finishing with just 15 points on 5-16 shooting from the field. The Clippers were also without Russell Westbrook, who Los Angeles hopes will be back by the time the playoffs start after a procedure on his fractured left hand. Los Angeles\u2019 89 points were the fewest scored in any of the Clippers\u2019 wins this season.\n\nAfter a tight defensive battle in Minnesota, the Clippers\u2019 road trip continued into Milwaukee for a matchup against the red-hot Bucks, who came into the game as winners of five straight. In what was supposed to be a matchup featuring star power on both sides, the Clippers found out shortly before the game that they would be playing a Bucks team without Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Bucks superstar sat out Monday night with achilles tendonitis. Since it was already announced that Milwaukee\u2019s three-time All-Star Khris Middleton would also not play as he continues to recover from a sprained ankle, it seemed like the Clippers would catch a major break on the second night of a back-to-back on the road. That was not the case.\n\nAfter the first quarter, the Clippers found themselves up on Milwaukee 35-25. However, the Clippers failed to build on that lead as the Bucks cut it to seven entering halftime on the back of a 19-point first half from Damian Lillard. Los Angeles came out strong to start the third quarter and built up a 14-point lead as the Clippers with 8:23 left in the third quarter. But despite Milwaukee missing so much firepower on offense, the Clippers could not put them away for good, as the Bucks trailed by just eight entering the fourth quarter. With Kawhi Leonard and Paul George having relatively quiet nights, it was up to James Harden to bounce back from his poor performance on Sunday. In the fourth quarter, Harden scored multiple baskets that helped keep the Clippers in front and finished with 29 points and eight assists. Except, the Bucks rallied hard in the fourth, ruling Harden\u2019s efforts irrelevant. Milwaukee closed the game on a 23-10 run and received a big fourth quarter from Bobby Portis, as he scored 14 of his 28 total points in the final period, sealing one of the Clippers\u2019 more disappointing losses of the season.\n\nChampionship-caliber teams usually hit their stride after the All-Star break and with the Clippers sitting at 5-5 in their last 10 games, a strong finish to the regular season will be vital to keep pace with the West\u2019s top teams in a volatile race for the top seed.\n```"}

By Jason Goode, Aditya Thiyag, Bryce Dechert, Corinne Smith, Kendall Arjoon, Shane Dimapanat and Nova Blanco-Rico March 05, 2024 at 5:08 pm PST\n\nFrom Maine and Alaska to sunny Southern California, 16 states and one U.S. territory are set to vote ahead of Super Tuesday. In the presidential race, 854 Republican delegates will be awarded out of the 2,429 total, and 1,420 Democratic delegates will be awarded out of the 3,934 total. Over a third of the U.S. delegates for president will be decided, not allowing any one candidate outright victory per se, but through the night propelling certain candidates closer to securing the nomination.\n\nThe presidential race isn\u2019t the only election occurring. The Official Voter Information Guide put forward by the Secretary of State has information on the propositions, candidates, a quick reference guide and voter information ahead of California\u2019s final day of voting, today, March 5, 2024. The primary election will influence who is running for president, county board of supervisors, California\u2019s 52 House of Representatives seats, the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s US Senate seat, L.A. County District Attorney, city council seats and the board of education. Annenberg Media created this voting guide to make each election and choice a bit simpler to understand.\n\nThere are a few propositions put forward by the legislature: Statewide there is a single proposition on the ballot. Proposition 1 entails the \u201c[Authorization of] $6.38 billion in bonds to build mental health treatment facilities for those with mental health and substance use challenges [and] provides housing for the homeless,\u201d according to the official voter guide. The funding of this bill would reallocate $140 million of preexisting taxes to benefit mental health, drug and alcohol treatment. It would transfer and cut funds from existing county programs for the state to \u201cexpand mental health and addiction services, build permanent supportive housing and help homeless veterans.\u201d Additionally, there is a citizen ballot for the city of L.A.\u2019s Measure HLA, which when proposed in 2015 sought to implement bike lanes, the widening of sidewalks, adding bus lanes and other forms of pedestrian transportation. This proposition would mandate that effect and spur on this infrastructure focus when certain lengths of roads (1/8 mile) are repaved.\n\nPhotographers from Annenberg Media are positioned around L.A. at voting and polling centers and multiple watch parties: places where different groups watch the election coverage live. A watch party and potluck at the CAGOP Trump Headquarters, a ballot processing center in the city of Industry, a USC Annenberg watch party jointly hosted with the USC Center for Political Future, Rep.

Some students voted yes on Measure HLA Tuesday in California\u2019s primary election to spread similar safety features across the city of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI bike everywhere, and it\u2019s very dangerous, so I end up biking on the [sidewalk], which is a nightmare for me,\u201d said Juno Wolfe, a junior double majoring in narrative studies and history. \u201cI\u2019ll bike on Figueroa, even though it\u2019s theoretically a bigger thoroughfare and more dangerous. I actually feel like I\u2019m not going to just randomly get hit by a car.\u201d\n\nMeasure HLA (also known as Healthy Streets LA) is a ballot measure that aims to speed up the implementation of L.A.\u2019s mobility plan \u2014 a collection of changes to improve traffic safety including street modifications and an open data portal to monitor projects. Although the L.A. city council adopted the plan in 2016, less than 5% of the plan is implemented. By passing HLA, voters would push the city to fully implement the already-written plan.\n\nFor voters like Megan Steron, a graduate student at USC studying social work, the issue is personal; Steron lost someone to a traffic collision.\n\n\u201cIn a city with so many people and taking different modes of transportation \u2014 bikes, pedestrians and cars \u2014 we need to be carefully evaluating how those bike lanes and how those systems are working,\u201d Steron said.\n\nAlthough advocates of HLA say the initiative is a much-needed improvement to L.A.\u2019s mobility strategy, opponents argue the measure could increase traffic, carbon emissions and emergency response times. Organizations like KeepLAMoving, an initiative for \u201csafer, saner streets,\u201d argue that HLA will do the opposite of what it claims.\n\n\u201cMobility plan 2035 imposes \u2018unavoidable significant adverse impacts\u2019 on traffic,\u201d reads a dedicated \u201cStop HLA!\u201d page on the KeepLAMoving website. Over 1/3 of L.A. intersections would gridlock during rush hour, twice the current number.\u201d\n\nDespite pushback, the measure has numerous influential supporters, including former LAUSD superintendent and deputy mayor Adam Beutner, MoveLA and the Coalition for Clean Air.\n```"}

It\u2019s the first time there\u2019s not an incumbent on the U.S. Senate ballot for California since 2016.\n\nAccording to California law, since 2022, the state has been required to hold a special election on the same day as the regular primary if a senator vacates their seat more than 148 days before the next primary election. Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler to fill the vacant seat until this special election could be held. Butler announced she had no intention to run for a full Senate term a few days after Newsom appointed her.\n\nThat\u2019s why California residents are also voting on who should replace Butler for the last six weeks of the term that ends in January.

A \u201cyes\u201d vote for Proposition 1 authorizes $6.38 billion in bonds to build treatment facilities for those struggling with mental health and substance use problems. It also reallocates some county funding for statewide care that is taken from the 1% tax on income over $1 million. A \u201cno\u201d vote opposes changing the Mental Health Services Act and issuing the bonds to homeless individuals and veterans.\n\nHere is what some USC students thought about Prop. 1:\n\n\u201cThe mental health resources we have at the state or the county level are not good,\u201d said Sara Steinecker, a 20-year-old political science major who voted yes on Prop. 1. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough beds for in-patient treatment and things like that. It\u2019s really important to build up that infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cProp 1 helps fund education for care providers to have a more holistic approach to care, which I think is really important because you can\u2019t just institutionalize people,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo it\u2019s very important to have compassionate care with dignity. And I think that the bond will help fund training people to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super important, especially in a city like L.A. where there\u2019s so much mental health issues and people on the street that need help,\u201d said Elizabeth Becker, a senior studying popular music performance.\n\n\u201cI felt like it\u2019s kind of a pet project of the governor\u2019s,\u201d said River Muench, a junior from Pasadena who voted yes on Prop. 1. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand why he is so big about it specifically, but I guess it helps mental health. It\u2019s not going to hurt, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s really gonna do that much to help.\u201d\n\nOpponents of Prop 1 \u2014 including Mental Health America of California, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and CalVoices \u2014 believe that the program will be expensive and destructive according to the California Voter Information Guide. According to the guide, Prop. 1 challengers believe that now is a bad time for new bonds and debt of this amount and that this isn\u2019t a solution to homelessness. Additionally, they cite worries that the proposition will take away funding from programs that are already working.\n```"}

(Photo by Marcus Heatherly)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nMarch 05, 2024 at 2:23 pm PST\n\nThe Pac-12 made the choice everyone knew was coming. Freshman guard JuJu Watkins \u2014 after winning 14 out of 17 Pac-12 Freshman of the Week awards \u2014 was officially announced as the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, the sixth USC women\u2019s basketball player to win the award. USC\u2019s phenom closed out the regular season averaging 27.8 points per game, nearly 15 points more than her closest teammate. She seemed to play even better in Pac-12 play \u2014 a conference with six teams in the AP Top 25 \u2014 totaling 28.3 points per game against conference foes.\n\nWatkins set multiple USC records this season as a freshman, setting the single-game scoring record with her 51-point performance at Stanford and recording 12 30-point performances to break Cheryl Miller\u2019s single-season record. The L.A. native also helped the Trojans reach the No. 5 spot in the AP poll to close out the regular season, their highest close to a season since 1994.\n\nDespite her impressive season, Watkins did not win Pac-12 Player of the Year. Stanford\u2019s senior forward Cameron Brink claimed that honor instead; she also won her third Defensive Player of the Year award. While it was Watkins who dominated the freshman weekly awards, Brink secured five Pac-12 Player of the Week awards this season, more than any other player. Watkins made waves at that level as well, securing three weekly recognitions.\n\nOn top of racking up the freshman awards, Watkins was also one of 15 named to the All-Pac-12 team, along with her teammate, graduate guard McKenzie Forbes. Forbes was the Trojans\u2019 second-leading scorer, putting up 13.1 points per game. She nearly notched a 2-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, recording a team-high 95 assists to 55 giveaways. Even though Watkins averaged more minutes, Forbes totaled the most time on the court by playing in all of USC\u2019s 28 regular-season games. When Watkins has fouled out \u2014 which she only did twice this season \u2014 or had an off-shooting night, the Trojans have turned to Forbes to pick up the slack.\n\nAlong with Forbes, USC relied heavily on junior center Rayah Marshall, who earned All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention, meaning she received at least one vote to be named to the all-conference team. Both Watkins and Marshall were listed as honorable mentions for the conference All-Defensive team as well. Despite a slight statistical regression from last season, Marshall still ended up averaging a double-double with her 10.2 points and 10.0 rebounds per game. Marshall had a strong end to the season, putting up 41 points and bringing down 26 rebounds across her last two games. The center had 10 double-doubles on the season, with half of them coming in the last eight games of the season.\n\nThe job\u2019s not finished for the award-winning Trojans, though. Watkins, Forbes and Marshall travel to Las Vegas this week for the Pac-12 tournament, where they come in as the No. 2 seed behind Stanford. USC\u2019s first game of the tournament will come against the winner of Arizona \u2014 a team that took the Trojans to double overtime this past weekend \u2014 and Washington \u2014 a team that handed USC one of its five losses earlier this season. Whoever the Trojans face off against, tipoff will take place at 6 p.m. at MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n```"}

This cost includes other student fees, meal plan, housing and supplies. The tuition cost is $69,904, compared to this year\u2019s $66,640. However, the estimated transportation costs have been reduced by $23, while the mandatory transportation fee has been increased by $24, according to the Financial Aid Office.\n\nThe total cost of attendance for the 2023-24 academic year stood at $90,921. Since 2022, the university has increased tuition by around 5% each year.\n\n\u201cOnce financial aid comes in I\u2019ll see if I need to be worried. Otherwise, I feel bad for international students who do not qualify for aid,\u201d Gwendolyn Smith, a junior studying international relations, said.\n\nThis new tuition cost for the upcoming academic year was updated on the financial aid site Tuesday but has not yet been announced formally to students.\n\n\u201cUSC\u2019s undergraduate financial aid pool increases at the same rate as the tuition rate increase,\u201d reads a university statement sent to Annenberg Media. \u201cThe university expects to award more than a half-billion dollars in institutional aid to undergraduate students in the coming academic year.\u201d\n\nThe statement also emphasized that USC President Carol Folt\u2019s affordability initiative \u2014 which makes the university tuition-free for families making less than $80,000 per year \u2014 is entering its fifth year.\n\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from the university and the Financial Aid Office.\n```"}

My second favorite month of the year has finally arrived. While July is pretty great as it has fireworks, beach days and most importantly, my birthday, Madness is in the air for the next 27 days. Filled with drama, intrigue and emotion, March brings the best and worst out of sports fans across the country. Much of that drama comes from teams who come out of nowhere to make a deep run into the NCAA tournament. These teams will be sure to cause chaos in a few weeks time.\n\nMcNeese State: 26-3, 15-1 Southland Conference\nI\u2019ll start off with a team you have probably never heard of: the Cowboys of McNeese State. The Cowboys are led by former LSU head coach Will Wade, who left Baton Rouge after multiple recruiting violations from the NCAA. Violations aside, Wade has tournament experience and has been a steady hand as commander in chief of the men from Lake Charles, Louisiana. McNeese State has won 20 of its last 21 games, including a win at Michigan. The Wolverines may not be their usual dominant selves, but winning at a Power Six school as a low-level Division 1 team is always an accomplishment. The Cowboys have four double-digit scorers, but are led by graduate guard Shahada Wells. The graduate transfer from TCU averages around 17 a game and is McNeese\u2019s primary ball handler.Wells will be the one the Cowboys look to when they need a bucket. Currently McNeese State is a  projected 12 seed  in Joe Lunardi\u2019s bracketology, and I could easily see them making a deep run in the NCAA tournament.\n\nNevada: 24-6, 11-5 Mountain West Conference\nFrequent readers of this column know  that the Mountain West has sneakily become one of the best conferences in college basketball, and the Wolfpack may be the biggest sleeper of them all. With wins over three Power Six teams \u2014 Washington, TCU and Georgia Tech \u2014 as well as a win at home against No. 21 San Diego State, Nevada has shown they can duke it out with real teams. Nevada is tied for the second-best record in all of the Mountain West, and the Wolfpack has the longest win streak of any team currently in the conference at five straight victories. Graduate guard Jarod Lucas \u2014 a March Madness legend for the Oregon State Beavers \u2014 leads the Wolfpack. Lucas has become one of the best 3-point shooters in the country, shooting around 41% on six shots a game from beyond the arc; this team puts points up in a hurry. If Nevada wins out in the loaded Mountain West, it will likely become a top six seed, and will be destined for a deep run in the Big Dance.\n\nFlorida Atlantic: 22-7, 12-4 American Athletic Conference\nPeople have forgotten very quickly that Florida Atlantic returned practically its entire lineup from a Final Four run last season, as many seem to have tossed the Owls aside like chunky milk. FAU has had some bad, bad losses, but the Owls moved to a stronger conference, the American Athletic Conference, and have played a much harder schedule than last season. The Owls have beaten four Power Six teams with wins over Butler, Texas A&M, Virginia Tech and (the crown of them all) top-10 ranked Arizona. Florida Atlantic still could very easily win its conference tournament, meaning the Owls would likely have beaten a South Florida team currently on a 14-game winning streak. With loads of experience in both coaches and player personnel, the Owls are not a team to count out when it comes to making a deep run in March.\n\nWith only 13 days until Selection Sunday, these teams need to keep grinding out wins to solidify themselves in the tournament. However, once they get into the Big Dance, McNeese State, Nevada and Florida Atlantic could be dangerous. \u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of WWE)\n\nBy Maddy Myer\nMarch 05, 2024 at 12:04 pm PST\n\nA few weeks after Monday Night Raw was in Anaheim, WWE returned to the Southern California region for one of its live shows. The company hosted a Road to WrestleMania live event in Palm Springs at the Acrisure Arena on Saturday, March 2. Yes, I drove the two hours to attend, and, yes, it was worth it. The night was full of fun, entertaining matches and a chance for me to get my Cody Rhodes belt signed.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the best matches from the live event.\n\nLA Knight vs. Solo Sikoa (WWE Road to WrestleMania, March 2)\nLA Knight opening the show was the perfect pop the crowd needed to get the night started. The megastar faced Solo Sikoa in a good match that had a lot of buildup. There were moments when Knight was unable to lift Sikoa due to fatigue and the size difference, but once he finally did, the crowd went wild. Jimmy Uso, Sikoa\u2019s Bloodline cousin, was out at ringside and often interfered in the match, which led to the ref ejecting him. Thankfully, once Jimmy was gone, Knight could really shine and end the match with his BFT finisher. After his victory, he cut a promo and had the whole arena saying, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nLA Knight stands on the ropes during his match. (Photo by Maddy Myer)\n\nJey Uso vs. Gunther (WWE Road to WrestleMania, March 2)\nWhile this match was a repeat of their matchup on Monday Night Raw in Anaheim a few weeks ago, it was still a great match to watch live. Jey Uso and Gunther have great chemistry and bring out the best in each other every time they face off. While Gunther won, just as he did at Monday Night Raw, there was no Bloodline interference this time around. The best part of these matches is how Jey sells the chest chops Gunther delivers \u2014 they look as brutal as they sound. It\u2019s cool to see him take that punishment, then eventually reverse and come back with his own offense. At one point, Jey jumped off the top rope and landed on his feet to avoid Gunther, but Gunther was ready with a running kick that resembled Drew McIntyre\u2019s Claymore. Jey even hit some spears, but they weren\u2019t enough to put away Gunther, who got the victory with a huge slam.\n\nCody Rhodes vs. Drew McIntyre (WWE Road to WrestleMania, March 2)\nThe show ended with Cody Rhodes vs Drew McIntyre in a street fight. These two have been going at it the past few weeks and also have built great chemistry with each other. With this being a street fight, the wrestlers used kendo sticks, chairs and tables. The tables were not cooperating that much and didn\u2019t break like they usually do, so multiple tables had to be used. That\u2019s the great thing about wrestlers \u2014 they\u2019re always ready to improvise, whether on the mic or in the ring. Rhodes suplexed McIntyre into a table, which didn\u2019t break; then followed it up with a dive off the top rope on top of McIntyre. That finally broke the table and won Rhodes the match. He gave a promo after the match and thanked everyone for attending.\n\nA solid night ended on an even higher note when Rhodes began giving out pieces of the broken tables from the Street Fight match. Then, he stayed 30 minutes after the match ended to sign autographs and take pictures. I was fortunate enough to get my white Cody Rhodes belt signed and a picture with the superstar. It was truly a surreal moment, as I hadn\u2019t met him before. There was still no Seth Rollins or Liv Morgan (two of my other favorites), but meeting Rhodes made my night.\n\nReporter Maddy Myer snapped a quick selfie with Cody Rhodes after the match.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of PA via AP/Mike Egerton)\n\nBy Marco Haynes\nMarch 05, 2024 at 10:02 am PST\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s three most consequential results.\n\nFoden\u2019s heroic brace gives the blue side bragging rights\nManchester City\u2019s title push retained the pressure on Liverpool by defeating their neighbors, Manchester United, at Etihad Stadium in a 3-1 victory. The 192nd Manchester derby opened in surprising fashion, with United captain Bruno Fernandes laying off a pass 25 yards out to winger Marcus Rashford to strike a thunderbolt, crashing underneath the crossbar for 1-0 inside of 10 minutes.\n\nMinutes before the half-time whistle, striker Erling Haaland was unmarked inside the 6-yard box, receiving Phil Foden\u2019s headed pass only to miss a wide-open goal. The Citizens earned their breakthrough with Foden\u2019s stunning edge-of-the-box, top-left corner strike to equalize 1-1.\n\nCity continued to pile on the pressure, taking the lead through Foden again in the 80th minute when he played a one-two with forward Julian Alvarez, then hit a low shot at the far post for 2-1. In added time, Haaland found the scoresheet after an error from midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, as the Norwegian made his way inside the box to wrap up the derby win and score his 18th of the season.\n\nThe surprising opener didn\u2019t stop Man City from taking the three points, moving one point behind league leaders Liverpool and for the team\u2019s third win in a row. This was the sixth time the Citizens have done the double over their rivals in the Premier League \u2014 half of them have been under manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nMan-of-the-match Foden now has 18 goals in all competitions, his career high for a campaign \u2014 and it\u2019s still early March. His teammate Haaland leads the Premier League Golden Boot race, ahead of Aston Villa\u2019s Ollie Watkins by two goals.\n\nMan City\u2019s next action comes against F.C. K\u00f8benhavn on Wednesday in the Champions League, before facing Liverpool at Anfield over the weekend, which will likely help decide the title.\n\nManchester United succumbed to its first defeat when ahead at the break in a league game since Leicester City beat them 5-3 on September 21, 2014, breaking a 143-game streak of such games. Having lost back-to-back league games, the Red Devils remain sixth in the table, six points off fifth-placed Tottenham.\n\nDuring the game, Man United only managed three shots which is concerning for the under-pressure manager Erik Ten Hag, who was without injured forward Rasmus H\u00f8jlund in this high-stakes game. Manchester United will be aiming to turn around their recent form against Everton at Old Trafford on Saturday.\n\nCaptain Son completes late victory for top-four chasing Spurs\nIn a London derby, Spurs came out on top late, winning 3-1 over a resilient Crystal Palace at home. Spurs struggled in the first half to find the opener, wasting opportunities and feeling that they should\u2019ve had a penalty for Daniel Munoz clipping Timo Werner\u2019s heels.\n\nHowever, VAR overturned the initial call and awarded a corner-kick instead. In the second half, the Eagles stunned the Lilywhites when playmaking midfielder Eberechi Eze scored a free kick from 20 yards out on the left side, firing the ball into the right-side netting, after winning the free kick himself.\n\nSpurs found a leveler in the 77th minute, though. Winger Brennan Johnson dribbled into the right side of the penalty box and picked out Werner\u2019s far post run, with the German striking the ball to center of the net for his first Tottenham goal.\n\nThe momentum continued for the hosts. In the 80th minute, midfielder James Maddison lobbed a cross into the center of the box to find the head of defender Cristian Romero, bouncing the ball toward the far post to go up 2-1.\n\nMoments before added time, a through ball from Johnson found the feet of forward Son Heung-Min dribbling 30 yards towards the goal to bury the shot bottom right and get all three points for Tottenham.\n\nTottenham stays in fifth place, five points from a Champions League position, and return to winning ways after its 2-1 home loss to Wolves on February 17. In the Spurs\u2019 last five league matches, they have won three, and drawn and lost one each.\n\nIn their last 11 Premier League home matchups against Crystal Palace, Spurs have won nine and drawn two, winning their last eight games against the Eagles by an aggregate scoreline of 17-1.\n\nThe captain Son has been involved in 19 goals in his last 20 appearances, scoring 13 and assisting six \u2014 a ridiculously strong record. Werner\u2019s opener was his first Premier League goal since April 20, 2022, when he still played for Chelsea.\n\nTottenham travels to Villa Park in a prominent top-four decider against Aston Villa on Sunday. Crystal Palace \u2014 who defended for much of the game, failing to create many chances \u2014 now find themselves eight points away from the relegation zone in 14th.\n\nNew manager Oliver Glasner has now won one and lost one in his first two games in charge and has a lot of work to do, as Palace has failed to win away from home since early November. Additionally, the Eagles have won only once in their last 18 London derbies on the road.\n\nEze\u2019s superb freekick was his sixth goal in his 17 games this season. Crystal Palace returns to Selhurst Park facing relegation contenders Luton Town on Saturday.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s dramatic last-minute winner saves Liverpool\nLeague leaders Liverpool scraped a last-gasp victory after controversially winning in injury time 1-0 against Nottingham Forest at City Ground.\n\nIn the first half, the home team frustrated the EFL Cup champions, but neither side could find a breakthrough, with the best chance falling to the hosts. Divock Origi played a through ball from the center circle to winger Anthony Elanga, creating a one-on-one for the Swede that required a save by the out-stretched foot of goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.\n\nThe game remained scoreless until added time, despite Liverpool racking up 2.07 expected goals and 22 shots total. But in the 99th minute, forward Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez became the Reds\u2019 savior, heading in a shot at the far post to the bottom-right corner from Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s cross.\n\nThe away fans and players went wild after securing a last-minute victory, while the Forest players complained to the referee for allowing more than the scheduled eight minutes of stoppage time, arguing that the final whistle should\u2019ve blown.\n\nBut Liverpool just seems to be ticking along in their push to win the league in manager Jurgen Klopp\u2019s final season at the club. Liverpool remains at the top of the table, one point ahead of Manchester City on the back of its fourth consecutive win.\n\nMaking his first appearance after suffering a foot injury, N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s goal, which occurred at 98 minutes and 35 seconds, is the latest goal ever scored by a Liverpool player and the 10th-latest in Premier League history.\n\nThe Uruguayan also scored his 10th of the season, with three in his last three appearances. Star forward Mohamed Salah has missed four games from a muscle injury and left back Andrew Robertson was left out against Forest with an illness.\n\nLiverpool returns to Anfield for two home clashes during the week, first against Sparta Prague in the Europa League and then it hosts Manchester City in a huge top-of-the-table clash on Sunday.\n\nQuestions will be raised about the added time in Forest\u2019s defeat, which left them 17th, four points away from the relegation zone as they also await a decision on their financial breach case. This was the home side\u2019s second consecutive defeat and the first time in 10 league games under manager Nuno Espirito Santos that the team failed to score.\n\nTo make matters worse, first-team coach Steven Reid was shown a red card for dissent toward the referee after the game. Forest will make a trip to American Express Stadium against Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday for their next match.\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

In 50 top-level games so far, he\u2019s posted a respectable 24 points on three goals and 21 assists.\n\nWhile the Moscow native has dealt with some adversity in the big leagues, his overall development has been encouraging. A shoulder injury in mid-January sidelined him for a month, but he\u2019s consistently been a top-four defenseman for the Ducks ever since and has posted some highlight plays.\n\nMintyukov\u2019s first month in the NHL looked Calder-worthy, as he tallied eight points in his first 11 games amid a rare winning stretch for Anaheim. His production has dwindled quite a bit since this strong start, but that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t worthy of an everyday role. The team\u2019s constant struggles and inability to fully gel has hindered many players\u2019 offensive abilities; Anaheim is 29th in the NHL in goals scored per game.\n\nMintyukov had previously spent time in the OHL with the Saginaw Spirit and Ottawa 67\u2032s. Last season, with time spent on both teams, he notched 88 points, the most for any blueliner in the OHL and the entire Canadian Hockey League, which awarded him the Max Kaminsky trophy.\n\nMintyukov\u2019s awareness is one contributing factor to his strong development at such a young age. He\u2019s very creative and can generate scoring opportunities on the fly. When there\u2019s a loose puck, Mintyukov will rush it without hesitation and use his playmaking ability to shift momentum to the offensive zone. Most importantly, he\u2019s stout on the defensive end. Listed at 6-foot-1 and 195 pounds, his frame allows him to dominate smaller opponents. He\u2019s also fast and can stay focused on the rush.\n\nIn the Ducks\u2019 recent down years, the lack of defensive production has been a major issue. Last season, Anaheim allowed 39 shots per game, a record-high in the salary cap era. While allowing 33 this season isn\u2019t great, it\u2019s still an improvement. Mintyukov will look to continue to lock down opponents in the defensive zone to prevent shots.\n\n32-year-old Cam Fowler leads Ducks defensemen with 28 points, with Mintyukov trailing not far behind, despite playing in 10 fewer games. Calling Mintyukov Anaheim\u2019s best defenseman isn\u2019t a wild take, but if he can head into next season as a consistent point-producer and a wall in the defensive zone, he\u2019ll likely be the Ducks\u2019 most reliable blueliner sooner rather than later.\n\nMintyukov\u2019s defensive ability and playmaking skills have not only given him time in the top defensive pair, but also earned him occasional minutes as part of Anaheim\u2019s top power play. He\u2019s notched seven assists on the power play this season, tied for third-most among all Ducks skaters.\n\nOn offense, Mintyukov\u2019s passing ability absolutely shines. On Feb. 21, in a home bout with the Blue Jackets, the 20-year-old posted three assists, the first three-point performance of his young NHL career. The most impressive part of his performance was the fact that all three came in a span of just three and a half minutes and helped Anaheim erase a 4-1 deficit.\n\nWith the recent call-up of Olen Zellweger and young prospects such as Rodwin Dionicio thriving at the amateur level, general manager Pat Verbeek has seemingly secured Anaheim\u2019s future defensive greatness. With a little over 20 games left in the season, the Ducks\u2019 campaign is practically unsalvageable, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the games are worthless. Mintyukov and other young players will still be able to showcase their talent in a low-stakes setting.\n```"}

The makeup brand is the first female-founded brand and the first beauty company to sponsor F1 ACADEMY. This partnership is the company\u2019s first global sports sponsorship.\n\n\u201cEmpowering everyone, everywhere to unlock the magic of confidence has always been my passion,\u201d Charlotte Tilbury said in their announcement. \u201cThis partnership celebrates the strength, determination and the undeniable power of female excellence.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Tilbury products are sold in popular stores like Nordstrom and Sephora. Additionally, the cosmetic brand has garnered attention through influencers posting TikToks with reviews and product hauls.\n\nF1 racing is a typically male-dominated sport with only five female drivers having attempted to compete in a Grand Prix, with the last attempt coming in 1992. Lella Lombardi was the last to qualify for a race in 1976 and is the only woman to score points in F1.\n\nWith that in mind, the series launched the F1 ACADEMY in 2023 with the hope of gaining participation among women and helping girls get involved earlier.\n\n\u201cWe want young women and girls to feel confident to chase their dreams, no matter the odds,\u201d managing director of F1 ACADEMY Susie Wolff MBE said in a press release. \u201cWe are on a mission to transform access to our sport, celebrate trailblazing female pioneers in our industry and inspire a new generation of young women to pursue a career in motorsport.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d a documentary chronicling the F1 World Championship, the sport saw a dramatic increase in female fans. Women now make up 50% of the clients for Grand Prix Grand Tours, an F1 travel company.\n\nUSC sophomore Advik Unni and F1 fan believes the spike in female viewers will also be furthered by the sponsorship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a domino effect. If one starts rolling, the other ones will fall eventually,\u201d Unni said. \u201c[The] uptick in the number of women participating in karting events will definitely cascade [...] and more people will look at F1 ACADEMY as something they can look up to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll definitely bring in a larger, more diverse fan base. I think this is gonna bring a really new crowd,\u201d San Diego State mechanical engineering major and F1 fan David Klunder said.\n\nCharlotte Tilbury, a brand geared towards women, has now set a precedent for other women-associated companies to partner with industries targeting a mostly male audience, according to freshman business administration major Riya Daga.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty tactical in the PR realm,\u201d Daga said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see brands like energy drinks that were female-founded, not just stereotypically feminine products, entering the market and sponsoring.\u201d\n\nDespite the large role sports play in current culture according to Statista, 44% of the men surveyed were avid sports fans while only 15% of women were, as of 2023. The combination of F1 \u2014 a male-associated sport with 32% of men considering themselves a casual fan in contrast with only 14% of women saying the same \u2014 and Charlotte Tilbury \u2014 a women-associated brand \u2014 is promising. It hints at an even greater progression, beyond women\u2019s sports, in the sports industry.\n\nNow, a larger, diversified audience is paying attention.\n\nThe #3 car will be raced by Lola Lovinfosse, 18, of Rouen, France. She has been racing since 2018 and finished tenth in the inaugural F1 ACADEMY season. This season, Lovinfosse will be racing for Rodin Motorsport.\n\nThe partnership between the two is an essential step toward introducing and encouraging women\u2019s participation in predominantly male-dominated industries, whether in sports or engineering. It\u2019s an encouraging step towards a more inclusive future where both women and men are emboldened and where there, perhaps, is no distinctive occupational and worldly divide between the genders.\n\n\u201cOur message to [young women] is simple: dare to dream,\u201d Wolff said.\n```"}

According to new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, those who test positive only need to stay home until their symptoms have been improving and are fever-free for 24-hours.\n\nOn March 11, it will be four years since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The new guidelines were enacted because of the sharp decline in hospitalizations due to COVID-19, with weekly hospital admission having decreased by 75% since January 2022. COVID-related deaths have decreased by more than 90% in the same time period. The CDC says this has allowed them to reduce quarantine guidelines.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 remains an important public health threat, but it is no longer the emergency that it once was ...This reality enables CDC to provide updated guidance proportionate to the current level of risk COVID-19 poses while balancing other critical health and societal needs,\u201d the CDC said in an announcement on Friday.\n\nThe CDC did not mention any precautionary recommendations following their announcement. Instead, the agency claimed that these new guidelines offer a \u201cunified approach to addressing risk from a range of common respiratory viral illnesses.\u201d Updating these guidelines puts COVID-19 in line with other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\n\nDespite the gradual decline in hospitalizations, USC students are set to receive COVID-19 tracking alerts daily. These emails have become a norm for some students, but some students still dislike them.\n\n\u201cI know that COVID isn\u2019t as prevalent as it was before. But I still think it\u2019s a risk, especially on campus, and I think this set of guidelines should still be in place,\u201d Alexis Villachica, a student majoring in quantitative biology, told Annenberg Media.\n\nRita Burke, an associate professor of Clinical Population and Public Health Sciences and Pediatrics, said the CDC\u2019s move creates \u201chectic timing\u201d with spring break next week. According to The Los Angeles Times, data from last year\u2019s spring break showed an average of 960 cases daily nationwide.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s to show advancement, but at the same time, I think it\u2019s still irresponsible,\u201d said Marissa Avila, a psychology major.\n\n\u201cWhile changes to isolation guidelines may reflect a shift in strategy, it is essential for individuals to continue following recommended preventive measures such as vaccination and hand hygiene to reduce the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Mimmiaga, a Vice Chair of Epidemiology at UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.\n\nBurke added that she hopes people will do what they need to to protect themselves and others. \u201cThe hope is that people will be responsible and will be mindful of those around them and take the necessary precautions as they would for any other respiratory virus, whether it was RSV or the flu,\u201d Dr. Burke said.\n```"}

(Graphic by Mateo Gutierrez)\n\nBy Audrey Serrano, Aditya Thiyag and Kailee Bryant\nMarch 04, 2024 at 6:03 pm PST\n\nUSC kicked off Women\u2019s History Month on Friday with the 16th annual Women\u2019s Conference, celebrating influential women of Troy including President Carol Folt. Celebrations continued on Monday with a Women\u2019s History Poster Making Gala hosted by the LGBTQ+ Student Center and a Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and a two Spirit Panel hosted by the Native American and Pasifika Lounge.\n\nThe celebration of women\u2019s accomplishments originated as Women\u2019s History Week in 1982. In 1987, Congress officially declared the month of March as Women\u2019s History Month. Since then, Women\u2019s History Month has become an important step in honoring women\u2019s contributions to history that have often been overlooked in general education for years.\n\nSheridan Spain, a senior studying psychology, said that Women\u2019s History Month has been an important step in the fight for women\u2019s rights and in boosting feminist voices internationally. \u201cThis month is a time where discussions around striving for equality and feminist ideals should continue to be talked about,\u201d Spain said. \u201cHere at USC, students can generally be more privileged and it\u2019s important to recognize that other women in the world are facing extreme oppression. This is the time that we need to advocate for them because we have the privilege to do so.\u201d\n\nThe celebration of Women\u2019s History Month has also prompted introspection by students. Mavi Eyuboglu, a senior studying human biology, said that the discussion around Women\u2019s History Month gave her a deeper appreciation for the women in her family, and it also gave her a chance to consciously appreciate her femininity. \u201cEspecially in college, I have been embracing my transition into womanhood and recognizing just how different it is from girlhood,\u201d Eyuboglu said. \u201cBecause of that, I now just have a much deeper appreciation for the women around me. All of the small cultural things that I do will remind me of my mom and my grandma, and I\u2019m so proud to be raised by and share a community with people like them.\u201d\n\nHere are the list of USC events celebrating this year\u2019s Women\u2019s History Month:\n\nWomen\u2019s History Month Kickoff - Friday, March 8\nWomen\u2019s History Month begins with a special celebration of International Women\u2019s Day hosted by President Carol Folt. This event will be open to all faculty, staff, students and alumni on a virtual streaming platform. It will explore the theme \u201cWomen Who Advocate for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\u201d\n\nNegotiating Salary - Tuesday, March 19\nWhether you\u2019re currently looking for a job or wondering what the next steps are after receiving a job offer, the USC Gender and Equity Programs and Career Center has got you covered.

Enjoy food from Annie\u2019s Soul Delicious and sip on some drinks while celebrating and uplifting the voices of women\u2019s narratives. This event will take place in Student Union 410 at 4 p.m. and is open to all USC students.\n\n\u201cI think these activities are really important, especially at a college campus where, a lot of times, women can generally feel unsupported,\u201d Spain said. \u201cSo I feel like any opportunity for people to bond with people like that is great.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s Night - Wednesday, March 20\nAre you interested in fitness and nutrition? Are you yearning for tips on weight training techniques? Lyon Center is hosting a free women-only fitness program from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, March 20.

It can\u2019t get here fast enough for Trojans. Spring break at USC means that from March 10 to 17, Trojan Instagram feeds are flooded with images of tropical paradises, ski vacations, and reunions back home with high school friends. However, some students often feel overwhelmed and stressed during this part of the semester.\n\n\u201cI usually have something related to school that I need to do over breaks. Unless it was like winter break when the semester was over and I didn\u2019t have work,\u201d said Uso Atuegbu, a first-year student studying neuroscience.\n\nFor many, the anticipation of the impending break is muddled by the anxiety-ridden environment of the midterm season on campus. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any single break where I haven\u2019t had to do some type of work... I would rather get everything done and then have the week free instead of having lingering assignments that I need to do over the break or when I return,\u201d Atuegbu said.\n\nSpring break helps students get out of a constant routine of classes, jobs and any extracurricular activities. The monotonous cycle of weekly exams and projects leads to drained, burnt-out students.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s honestly just every week, it\u2019s either a quiz or an exam. And I\u2019m just trying to keep up with all my STEM classes... trying to balance it out with all these STEM-related clubs and then other orgs that I\u2019m part of,\u201d said Chad Crisostomo, a freshman majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies who plans to stay in LA and travel to San Diego during the break.\n\nSome Trojans wish that the break was longer but still appreciate the limited time off. \u201cI think a week is too short to fully reset and rest but it provides a sort of seminal relaunch,\u201d said Kapil Kanagasabai, a sophomore studying acting. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if it was like two weeks.\u201d\n\nKal\u0101lapa Winter, also a sophomore studying acting, thinks spring break is \u201cwhat\u2019s needed to reset,\u201d but her spring break will be busy as she models in Hawaii over the short recess.\n\n\u201cI model back home and... I make a lot of money during spring break, which is the only reason I\u2019m able to afford to go back [home],\u201d Winter said.\n\nOther than the staple spring break destinations of Cabo San Lucas and Hawaii, some Trojans are traveling halfway across the world. Hawa Yusuf, a junior majoring in communications, is traveling to Dubai with her family for the break.\n\n\u201cIn the past, honestly, I haven\u2019t done much for spring break,\u201d Yusuf said. \u201cMy only grievance with [the timing of spring break] would be like all of the midterms leading up to spring break. So you just can\u2019t really focus on getting ready for spring break.\u201d\n\nFor those who do not have a midterm on March 18, spring break will hopefully be a restful, fun and work-free occasion.\n```"}

What are those driverless cars roaming around campus? \n\nBy Ari Rose-Marquez and Aditya Thiyag March 04, 2024 at 5:54 pm PST\n\nAt first glance, you might think you\u2019re looking at a Google Maps car. But these self-driving vehicles actually belong to Waymo, an autonomous rideshare company founded here in California. Waymo, formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, operates as a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet Inc. As of December, Waymo vehicles had driven 7.1 million miles between the cities of Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.\n\nWaymo held a pop-up session outside of the Shrine Auditorium this afternoon where they offered students a free weeklong trial of the driverless rideshare alternative. Visitors got a chance to see the vehicle up close and got free Waymo themed tote bags and t-shirts. The pop-up today is part of Waymo\u2019s strategy to expand their market and visibility here in L.A., and they seem to have won some customers in the form of USC students.\n\nMiguel Silva, one of the attendees, is a senior studying business, and talked about how he actually prefers Waymo to contemporaries like Uber.\n\nMiguel Silva: Right now, especially because all of the drives are subsidized, it\u2019s a lot cheaper just to use these vehicles over like an Uber. But once it kind of gets to a bigger scale, I feel like it\u2019d be a bit more competitive in prices but right now Waymo definitely seems like a better alternative.\n\nJunior Max Holeschneider also enjoys the Waymo experience because of the solitude it provides.\n\nMax Holeschneider: I\u2019m a fan. I gotta say like, I\u2019ve ridden it once or twice and I really enjoy the just sort of being in your own car. I think they were really clean and, you know, there\u2019s obviously broader implications with something like a Waymo but I think for an individual I quite enjoy it.\n\nJunior Justin Zandi is an aerospace engineering major and also one of the first USC students to use the rideshare. He discussed his initial trepidation when using the service and how he warmed up to it after his first drive.\n\nJustin Zandi: Getting into it, I was pretty nervous because it was a new experience. But once it started driving, the nerves kind of went away because it was very good at driving. It was better than I expected. I thought it was going to be very jerky and indecisive about certain things. But, I mean, it drove better than most Uber drivers I\u2019ve been with.\n\nSo far, most responses have been positive and the future of Waymo looks bright. Hopefully, with enough visibility and practical testing, the days of worrying about being harmed by rideshare drivers can be eliminated by the introduction of this self-driving miracle.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Aditya Thiyag.\n```"}

However, general consensus on the nominees is divisive, and \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 is at the top of everyone\u2019s mind.\n\nThe Oscars roll into town Sunday, taking place at the Dolby Theatre. Hollywood\u2019s biggest awards show got its fair share of controversy this year over its nominations and students have thoughts. Gillian Maltz, a grad student studying writing for screen and TV, said \u201cBarbie\u201d director Greta Gerwig deserved a nomination for best directing.\n\nMALTZ: \u201cI would say she definitely deserved to be nominated and she was totally snubbed.\u201d\n\nAlice Chiang, a junior majoring in communication, took issue with Barbie herself not getting nominated for best lead actress.\n\nCHIANG: \u201cI think Margot Robbie should be nominated. I feel like she deserved it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig were not nominated for their individual categories, \u201cBarbie\u201d received a nomination for best adapted screenplay. Maltz thinks it\u2019s an easy win.\n\nMALTZ: \u201cThey\u2019ll probably give Barbie the screenwriting award because Greta got snubbed for directing.\u201d\n\nAlso in the category for best adapted screenplay are \u201cAmerican Fiction,\u201d which Maltz is excited for, and \u201cPoor Things.\u201d Jacob Graber, a junior majoring in business administration, found \u201cPoor Things\u201d to be unexpectedly good.\n\nGRABER: \u201cI liked \u2018Poor Things\u2019 quite a bit. I was surprised I liked it. I thought it was gonna be weird. And it was weird, but weird in a cool, enjoyable way.\u201d\n\nThe big winner of this awards season, however, is expected to be \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d Its 13 nominations are on track to sweep most categories, according to Maltz.\n\nMALTZ: \u201cI think Oppenheimer is gonna win everything because it\u2019s been winning everything else. It\u2019s just totally what voters really want to see and what they love.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other students were left in the dark on the Academy Awards altogether, like Swami Hariharan, a grad student studying molecular microbiology and immunology.\n\nHARIHARAN: \u201cI actually haven\u2019t heard anything about it. I think it\u2019s actually good to know about it, but I just haven\u2019t had the interest doing it.\u201d\n\nGraber agreed that the interest for this year\u2019s Oscars cycle was down, citing social media as a contributing factor.\n\nGRABER: \u201cI think it\u2019s getting just harder and harder to keep up with all the pop culture things.

A recent local report says while coverage around the subject has increased in frequency, the amount of graffiti actually being done has stayed the same.\n\nAn unfinished high-rise development in the downtown entertainment district that has become the target of graffiti taggers who have struck dozens of floors is seen in Los Angeles on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Janette Fu and Drake Lee March 04, 2024 at 5:49 pm PST\n\nGraffiti has been a hot topic in Downtown LA. However, are graffiti numbers really rising? Street art frequently appears in the news. Most recently, over a dozen artists took over the Oceanwide Plaza skyscraper development, according to multiple news outlets. However, a report by Jon Regardie, a researcher from Crosstown LA shows that graffiti is not on the rise. His study highlights that Boyle Heights is actually the city with most graffiti reports with about 28 thousand since the start of last year. Downtown comes at a close second with around 24 thousand.\n\nDespite not being the city with the highest graffiti reports, street art has made its mark on Downtown LA. Gabriel Khan, professor of professional practice and a founder of Crosstown, notes this unique characteristic of the city. Gabriel Khan: I think that anybody who spends any time downtown knows that there\u2019s quite a bit of graffiti. There\u2019s some historic public art slash graffiti that\u2019s been around for quite some time as well. So it\u2019s part of the landscape.\n\nAdditionally, Khan believes there\u2019s a much deeper issue underlying graffiti, especially when it comes to the Downtown skyscraper. Gabriel Khan: I think the real responsibility of the city is to hold accountable the project owners. I think that their issue is not really a graffiti problem, it\u2019s more of an abandoned property issue.\n\nAndrea Shin is a sophomore studying disease prevention. She says the takeover of the Downtown skyscraper is too extreme. Andrea Shin: \u201cI feel like the building in downtown, for example, I feel like they take that way too far. I feel like it\u2019s not art. I feel like that\u2019s just vandalism.\u201d\n\nCalifornia law defines graffiti as an act of vandalism and is punishable by heavy fines and jail time. Whether you think of graffiti as art or vandalism, the impact of street art on the community undeniable.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Drake Lee\n```"}

(Photo by Luis Perez)\n\nBy Zainab Malik, Daniel Park and YJ Si\nMarch 04, 2024 at 5:47 pm PST\n\nWaymo, a self-driving taxi service, arrived at the Shrine Auditorium for its last stop in its Southern California pop-up tour to advertise its services on Monday. Waymo, originally named Google Self Driving Car, is owned by Alphabet under Google. It has made strides in becoming a taxi service competitor against the likes of Uber and Lyft.\n\nCalifornia regulators gave Waymo the green light to drive on highways and continue operations in Los Angeles on Friday. The decision was protested by some local leaders in Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), saying that expansion is unjustifiable without more local oversight.\n\nPrahkar Bhatnagar, a first-year graduate student studying quantum information science who attended the pop-up event, said that it was exciting to see the company continue to make progress. \u201cFrom a technological perspective, there are a lot of challenges, but I\u2019m happy to see them tackle those,\u201d Bhatnagar said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get everything right the first time and no one expects them to.\u201d\n\nIn order to use Waymo, Los Angeles residents must join a waitlist, but the Shrine pop-up event provided attendees with a free week of access to fully autonomous rides around the Los Angeles area. The incentive pulled in nearby college students who were curious to test the service out.\n\nIn December, Waymo hosted a similar event at UCLA, targeting the college-age demographic. Waymo began offering autonomous rides through pop-ups in October, starting in Santa Monica and expanding to other parts of Los Angeles. Their vehicles are electric Jaguar SUVs lined with cameras along the sides with a large, spinning camera on the roof of the car.\n\n\u201cI just kept seeing their cars around the USC campus, but I didn\u2019t know much about it,\u201d said Mia McCoobery, a senior studying English. \u201cAnd then [my friend] told me that they were having a pop-up event, and I wanted a free week of rides.\u201d\n\nVisitors arrived at a white corner booth that housed a physical ticket printer for the free rides. They received free shirts and tote bags, and the event had an area with brochures for more information.\n\nSome people are concerned about safety in light of an accident that occurred in Phoenix, when two empty Waymo vehicles made contact with a pickup truck being towed. JD Charisma, a Waymo brand ambassador at the pop-up event Monday, said that he would attest to the service\u2019s reliability. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not gonna break any speed limit rules and make any human errors,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s one of the safest experiences that you could have in a vehicle.\u201d\n\nStudents who had heard about Waymo before saw the event as an opportunity to explore more of the service. \u201cI thought it was really cool,\u201d said Miguel Silva, a senior studying business. \u201cI looked into their events because I knew they were in LA and was trying to go to one of the pop-ups. Luckily, they were at the Shrine.\u201d\n\nVisitors who could not make it to the event can sign up for the waitlist online. Shruthi Narayanan contributed to this story.\n```"}

The energy in the room is calm, but hopeful, as multiple televisions are tuned to Fox News and supporters sit and wait for returns to come in. A few supporters have even voiced a twinge of concern for the way that their fellow Californians will vote Tuesday, as California is not as much of a lock for former President Donald Trump over presidential hopeful Nikki Haley as a few other states are. The supporters here tonight are a part of the Grassroots movement for Trump, meaning the group is a nearly fully self-funded organization that funds itself using money made from merchandise sales.

Business for AI is a joint degree between USC\u2019s Marshall School of Business and Viterbi School of Engineering, said the Viterbi School of Engineering. Students will graduate with a degree signed by the dean of both schools.\n\n\u201cThis is the first truly joint degree that we\u2019ve launched here at Viterbi in recent memory,\u201d said Yannis C. Yortsos, the school\u2019s dean. \u201cWe anticipate this convergence will create all kinds of different opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, as well as business and other disciplinary fields.\u201d\n\nThe new major has encouraged students to apply and commit to USC. \u201cWith other schools, if I just majored in business, I would probably be doing some kind of technology-related minor,\u201d said Chloe Ha, a USC freshman majoring in Business for AI. \u201cThis major perfectly incorporated both the business and analytical aspects I was looking for.\u201d\n\nThe creation of the major began a couple of years ago as AI started to increase in popularity among the average consumer, according to Kimon Drakopoulos, the academic director for the Business for AI degree. \u201cAI developments have been very focused on the engineering side, and phenomenal things have happened on the tools side,\u201d said Drakopoulos. \u201cBut then we identified that there is a big gap, a big disconnect between stakeholders that are non-technical and the implementation of these technologies.\u201d\n\nNenad Medvidovic, the chair of the Computer Science department at Viterbi, believes more than a simple understanding of how to use tools like Chat GPT and AI Image generators is needed to be successful in the AI and business industries. \u201cTo understand how those things work and be able to use them effectively, you have to understand the underlying principles that are used in those kinds of technologies,\u201d he said.\n\nAdministrators at USC Marshall and Viterbi hope this degree will make students more than just employable: It will make them future leaders. \u201cStudents will put themselves in a position where they can be thought leaders in these areas,\u201d Medvidovic said. \u201cSomeday, instead of just going out there and saying, \u2018hey, I think I could be employable in this world,\u2019 you\u2019re actually somebody who is setting the agenda in this world.\u201d\n\nThe academic goals of the program include making use of AI within organizations, developing a sophisticated understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI in a business context and making realistic assumptions for business ventures through AI innovation, according to the major\u2019s academic overview.\n\nThe major has only been active for a semester and a half. Currently, students are taking lower-level business and computer science courses. That said, the school\u2019s plans for upper-division Business for AI courses are already underway. \u201cThe first upper-division course focuses on state-of-the-art applied AI ideas, all the way from experimentation to reinforcement learning and deep learning,\u201d Drakopoulos said. \u201cAll the introductory stuff that the students have learned in different classes \u2013 from statistics to their CS courses \u2013 suddenly everything will come together.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of their junior year, students in the major will be connected with industry partners to complete an entire project from scoping to delivery, according to Drakopoulos. The major\u2019s curriculum encourages students to network with industry leaders and pursue individual projects. \u201cLast semester, we had a two-unit academy class just for our major. We had a lot of cool guest speakers who would talk about how AI is integrated within their companies,\u201d Ha said. \u201cFrom what we\u2019ve heard from our director, he\u2019s planning on encouraging us to work on our projects that are related to implementing the AI concepts and techniques we learn in our classes.\u201d\n\nThe directors of academic programming are seeking student feedback as the first cohort of students begins the major\u2019s curriculum. \u201cAnything that we want to implement, Director Drakopoulos very much considers and pitches to whoever needs to listen,\u201d Ha said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice since we\u2019re a lot more involved in the coursework than I thought we were going to be.\u201d\n\nProgramming directors and administrators at USC are hopeful that this major will help USC stay relevant and up-to-date with emerging technologies by creating a new archetype of students. \u201cIn transdisciplinary fields, like AI for business, you get students who are neither engineers nor business students, but they are students who have strong elements of engineering and strong elements of business,\u201d Yortsos said. \u201cThis creates a new prototype, and maybe the future will require their expertise.\u201d\n```"}

Do you feel like you missed out on the Lunar festivities, this year? Here is a recap of how some major gaming companies made the Lunar New Year extra special for the Year of the Wood Dragon. We are talking EA, Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Sims, and NBA2k all joining the Lunar New Year bash.\n\nLunar New Year in The Sims\n\nThe Sims has been increasing in popularity, especially since COVID-19, as virtual worlds have become commonplace, so it is no stranger to holiday events and content. During the Lunar New Year, players that stepped into The Sims\u2019 virtual realm were in for an enchanted treat by Electronic Arts (EA). Forget the usual downloadable content (DLC) price tags \u2013 this year, EA broke the mold by showering players with a treasure trove of freebies. You could deck out your Sims in new clothes, styling them with accessories, and furnish their virtual homes with New Year decorations. Also, Fresh recipes for in-game dinner parties elevated the festive atmosphere. In addition to celebrating the New Year in real life, players could meet and spend time online with friends through the Sims virtual world.\n\nEpic Games Store sale during Lunar New Year days\n\nEpic Games Store, which is known for its many sales and promotions, turned the Lunar New Year into a gaming extravaganza, aligning with the lunar calendar from January 21 to February 20. Starting on February 9th, many games on the virtual store were discounted. But, there was more - players that bought games during the sale got 10% back due to the Epic Rewards program. For Epic, it seems Lunar New Year was not just a time for sales. It was also a smart way to boost their player count during the festive season.\n\n2024 Lunar New Year event in Overwatch 2\n\nOverwatch, which is famous for celebrating various cultures as game content, also recognized this Lunar New Year as a big opportunity. Since 2016, Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s Overwatch has created seasonal events every year such as Halloween Terror, Winter Wonderland, Overwatch Anniversary, and more. Following the tradition of putting on grandiose virtual experiences, Overwatch threw a grand Lunar New Year experience, this year. The in-game maps got a makeover with Chinese decorations, players could snag exclusive skins and cosmetics by purchasing, but through in-game challenges for free. Tackling in-game challenges, and playing a certain number of games allowed to get voice lines or spray. Mischief and Magic is a limited-time New Year Event that was the star of this Overwatch event. Simply put, it was a hide and seek game mode in Overwatch. Through some challenges such as completing 24 games, and surviving for 300 seconds as a hider, players can spend their Lunar New Year with exciting gameplay and unique rewards.\n\nNBA2K24 2024 Lunar New Year\n\nIn the world of sports gaming, fans love to collect their favorite players. To cater to that, NBA 2k releases specific themed player cards to match with holidays and events. To celebrate the Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, NBA2K24 dropped the Lunar New Year Pack with an exclusive player card including Yao Ming who was one of the greatest basketball players in the NBA from China, and Yi Jianlian who led Chinese basketball team and played in the NBA. From a community perspective, the cultural representation of Asian players allows fans to see individuals from their own culture succeeding internationally, and this may be a deliverable target to Chinese people. On the business side, this can be a strategic decision due to the attraction of a larger audience and engaging Chinese fans.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThis year\u2019s lunar journey in the gaming universe taught us one thing: weaving in diverse cultures and traditions is not a random move from studios. It is a clever strategy to draw in players from all corners of the globe. Are these corporate \u201ccelebrations\u201d genuine expressions or clever marketing tactics? It should not just be about making a quick buck. It should be about creating genuine moments that players can truly celebrate. The mentioned games do present authentic qualities. The Sims provides a life simulation experience, allowing individuals to have control over characters and derive satisfaction from activities beyond real-life possibilities. Overwatch 2 and NBA2K enhance holiday enjoyment through time-limited content. Additionally, Epic Games has endeared itself to players by offering discounted games. Each of these games contributes in its own unique way to creating memorable experiences. The annual celebrations are also days of increased sales for game companies. Players want new content, and these specific days are a great opportunity to give them what they want. So, as you hit the power button on your gaming device, envision the vibrant tapestry of cultural experiences waiting for you online. Picture yourself sharing these moments with friends during special events like the Lunar New Year. It is not just gaming; it is a contribution to the ongoing story of how gaming connects with cultural diversity on a global scale. Will you be part of the narrative next year?\n```"}

Now, you\u2019ll have no excuse to not be caught up on every single Trojan sports squad! You can also find more condensed weekly recaps on the Annenberg Media Sports Instagram page @ANNMediaSports.\n\nWith March now upon us, it\u2019s only right to start out on the hardwood: Women\u2019s basketball No. 7 USC women\u2019s basketball storms back in 2OT to beat Arizona \u2013 by Nikki Thomas No. 7 USC women\u2019s basketball trounces Arizona State, clinches No. 2 seed in Pac-12 tournament \u2013 by Kasey Kazliner Women\u2019s hoops traveled to Arizona to close out its regular season this past weekend, picking up a pair of victories to secure a first-round bye in the Pac-12 tournament this coming week. But it wasn\u2019t exactly that simple. The Trojans needed a miraculous late comeback Thursday in Tucson just to force overtime, ultimately coming out on top 95-93 after a second overtime period. Things seemed dire when freshman guard JuJu Watkins fouled out near the end of regulation, but graduate guard Kayla Padilla hit a clutch third-chance 3-pointer to tie it with just seconds to spare. Padilla then hit another pivotal triple in each extra period to lift USC over Arizona. Saturday\u2019s 70-55 win in Tempe was much more straightforward. Junior center Rayah Marshall had her second double-double of the weekend, totaling 41 points, 26 rebounds and seven blocks over the road trip. USC held Arizona State under 33% shooting from the field and held a 54-34 rebounding advantage. The Trojans clinched a No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 tournament; they\u2019ll play the winner of Washington-Arizona on Thursday at 6 p.m. in Las Vegas.\n\nMen\u2019s basketball USC men\u2019s basketball drops leap day matchup against Washington State \u2013 by James Bao USC men\u2019s basketball wins at Washington in last road game of regular season \u2013 by Riley Sager Men\u2019s basketball traveled up north to Washington for the weekend. The Trojans\u2019 inconsistencies continued as they split their two matchups, despite playing well overall. Against a tough, ranked Washington State team, USC led for 38 minutes and by as much as 12. However \u2014 as has been the case much of this season \u2014 the Trojans couldn\u2019t close it out, falling 75-72. Freshman guard Isaiah Collier was a bright spot with 24 points on 9-for-17 shooting. Sunday\u2019s game at Washington appeared to be headed in the same direction, as USC\u2019s 15-point advantage with 6:11 remaining was cut down to three. However, Collier continued his best two-game stretch as a Trojan to save the day, tallying eight of his career-high 31 points in the final 2:25 to lift USC 82-75. USC, now just 12-17 overall, closes out its regular season at home against the Arizona schools this weekend.\n\nMen\u2019s volleyball USC men\u2019s volleyball drops first half of Crosstown Showdown series \u2013 by Will Simonds No. 11 men\u2019s volleyball had a tough weekend against the No. 4 Bruins, taking just one set across two matches in a home-and-home series. UCLA dominated the last two sets Thursday at Galen Center, taking them 25-10 and 25-14. After head coach Jeff Nygaard cited improper attitude and focus against the defending national champions, Saturday\u2019s effort over in Westwood was much improved. Though the Trojans still lost 3-1, they were dead even with the Bruins after two sets before running out of steam. Now losers of four straight, USC needs to get back on track this week at home against Penn State and Ohio State in the Pac-12/Big Ten Challenge.\n\nBaseball After an 8-5 loss to Michigan Tuesday, USC entered the Kubota College Baseball Series at just 2-6, desperately needing to turn things around. A weekend sweep in Texas didn\u2019t help. The Trojans dropped two games to No. 5 TCU, sandwiched around a loss to No. 7 Texas A&M. Friday\u2019s extra-inning defeat was the most heartbreaking; USC came back to tie and then take an 8-6 lead in the top of the ninth, before graduate pitcher Jared Feikes surrendered that advantage right back in the bottom of the frame. TCU went on to win 9-8 in the 11th inning. The Trojans\u2019 pitching gave up six runs in the final three innings to fall 9-3 against the Aggies on Saturday, then allowed nine runs for a third straight game in a 9-5 Sunday loss to the Horned Frogs. Despite his team\u2019s struggles, sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway continued to show out. Galloway went 5-for-12 in the series and added four RBIs; his OPS is over 1.000 through 11 games. He\u2019ll look to keep it going at Cal State Fullerton on Tuesday before Arizona visits for a weekend series to begin conference play.\n\nBeach volleyball The three-time defending national champions hosted the Battle for Los Angeles tournament on campus, winning all four of their matches with three 5-0 sweeps. Additionally, three of those victories for No. 3 USC came over other ranked opponents: No. 9 Long Beach State, No. 18 Cal Poly and No. 14 Grand Canyon. Now 8-2 through two early-season tournaments, the Trojans are set to head to Tempe for the Pac-12 South Invitational this weekend for four more duals.\n\nWomen\u2019s water polo Another perfect weekend for the Trojans came in the pool at the Convergence Tournament in Claremont. On Friday, No. 4 USC beat Villanova 21-7 and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 18-4. Saturday\u2019s wins came over Pomona-Pitzer 11-3 and Pacific 13-8. Redshirt senior attacker Alejandra Aznar scored 11 times over the weekend to lead the team, which next hosts St. Francis on Saturday.\n\nTennis Men\u2019s tennis swept Michigan 4-0 at home Tuesday, picking up a much-needed win to snap a five-game losing streak. No. 63-ranked junior Peter Makk grabbed an impressive singles win over the Wolverines\u2019 No. 18 Gavin Young in straight sets. Pepperdine visits on Thursday before USC heads to Stanford on Sunday to begin the Pac-12 season. Meanwhile, No. 8 women\u2019s tennis fell 5-2 at UCLA Friday, as three ranked players took losses in the singles competition. Conference play continues over the weekend as the Washington schools visit Marks Stadium on Friday and Saturday.\n\nLacrosse Through two contests of its current three-game East Coast trip, No. 16 women\u2019s lacrosse took down Towson 11-5 Friday before coming up short 13-10 to No. 15 Johns Hopkins on Sunday. After trailing early, senior midfielder Claudia Shevitz led USC\u2019s comeback over Towson with four goals. On Sunday, though, the Trojans blew an early 4-0 lead to the Blue Jays and were outscored 4-1 down the final stretch to take a tough road loss. Now with a 4-2 record, USC finishes its trip off at VCU Tuesday before coming home to play Temple on Friday.\n\nSwim and dive The No. 4-ranked women\u2019s swim and dive squad grabbed second place at the Pac-12 Championships in Washington. In total, USC picked up six individual titles and three relay wins in the event. Freshman Minna Abraham was an absolute superstar over the weekend, racking up two of the individual championships and anchoring all of USC\u2019s relay titles. Senior Kaitlyn Dobler won the 100y breaststroke championship for the fourth straight year, and, with a win in the 200y breaststroke, became the first Pac-12 swimmer to ever win seven total breaststroke championships. In the men\u2019s Pac-12 diving championships, sophomore Laurent Gosselin-Paradis won the platform competition for the second straight season. The men\u2019s swimming competition is set for later this week.\n\nFootball The NFL combine took place last week in Indianapolis.

The popular Los Angeles-based women\u2019s brand launched a new campaign titled, \u201cYou\u2019ve Got the Power,\u201d to encourage voting, with public figure and activist Monica Lewinsky as the face of the new campaign.\n\n\u201cFeaturing strong silhouettes, tasteful tailoring, and our signature sustainable fibers, our new collection is here to remind you that you\u2019ve got the power,\u201d the campaign page reads.\n\nLewinsky is pictured in Reformation\u2019s workwear clothing line, sporting a leather trench coat, a cherry red two-piece set and a strong, black A-line dress, to name a few. She looks like the picture of professional female power.\n\n\u201cVoting is using your voice to be heard, and it\u2019s the most defining aspect of our democracy. If you wanna complain for the next four years, you gotta go out and vote,\u201d Lewinsky said on the campaign page.\n\nHowever, Lewinsky was not always the face of female empowerment in the workplace. For decades, it was quite the opposite. Lewinsky gained infamy for her highly-publicized affair with then-President Bill Clinton from 1995-1997 when she was a 22-year-old intern at the White House. This affair led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment, only the second presidential impeachment at the time.\n\nReformation also collaborated with Vote.org to feature information on their website about how to vote for the upcoming general election on Nov. 5, 2024. According to the website, the company has also made a $25,000 donation to Vote.org, the largest nonpartisan voter resource in the country. An unspecified portion of the proceeds from their limited edition sweatshirt, with their \u201cYou\u2019ve Got the Power\u201d slogan, will also be donated to Vote.org, per their website.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Clinton scandal, Lewinsky faced decades of outward misogyny, death threats and bullying that led her to step away from the public eye until recent years. Now, Lewinsky is an outspoken activist and author, advocating for helping others who have been cyberbullied and publicly shamed.\n\nLewinsky returned to the public eye in 2014 with a Vanity Fair essay titled \u201cShame and Survival.\u201d \u201cI was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously,\u201d Lewinsky said in her 2015 Ted Talk, in regards to the newfound popularity of the Internet at the time. \u201cA marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity, and shame is an industry.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Lewinsky began her own production company, called \u201cAlt Ending Productions\u201d in 2021 and became a producer for the FX anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story: Impeachment,\u201d which dramatizes the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Alt Ending Productions and Lewinsky also signed a first-look producing deal with 20th Television during the same year. She also served as an executive producer on the 2021 Max documentary \u201c15 Minutes of Shame,\u201d which explores the public shaming epidemic, or \u201ccancel culture,\u201d on the Internet.\n\nLewinsky, in addition to being an outspoken public figure, author and producer is a strategic advisor to the organization Bystander Revolution, an online anti-bullying organization founded by Mackenzie Bezos.\n\nThe now 50-year-old Lewinsky\u2019s story is not about her relationship with Clinton, but her reach and resonance with women worldwide. She has become a champion of women whose lives have been ruined by men in power, publicly slut-shamed or belittled by rapacious Internet users, as well as to anyone who has experienced cyberbullying.\n\nSeeing Lewinsky reclaiming her power in an office space with a subtle nod to politics is not only a brilliant marketing strategy, but a powerful message to women worldwide that shame once carried is not the only possible future. In a space where Lewinsky was belittled, taken advantage of and subject to public humiliation, she is now standing proudly and encouraging other women to make their voices heard by getting to the polls in November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning to weather the storm,\u201d Lewinsky recently told the New York Times. \u201cI\u2019ve found that resilience is a muscle you build.\u201d```"}

Entertainment Inc.)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan\nMarch 04, 2024 at 11:29 am PST\n\nEven the great directors, the auteurs with many great films to their name, usually have one, maybe two films with which they become truly synonymous. For Martin Scorsese, it\u2019s \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d Quentin Tarantino has \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d (one could also argue for \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d given the ubiquity of the Uma Thurman poster). Stanley Kubrick has \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d And like his hero Kubrick, Denis Villenueve has produced the iconic film of his career in \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d\n\nThe sequel to 2021\u2032s \u201cDune,\u201d \u201cPart Two\u201d resumes the story basically minutes after Part One\u2019s conclusion, with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s Paul Atreides stranded in the remote deserts of the planet Arrakis alongside his mother Lady Jessica, played by Rebecca Ferguson. The pair seek refuge among the native Fremen tribes, who live in hiding from the authoritarian and violent reign of House Harkonnen. With the help of the Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and a young warrior named Chani (Zendaya), Paul and Jessica become embedded in Fremen society and begin an uprising against the Harkonnens to avenge Duke Leto Atreides\u2019 (Oscar Isaac) death.\n\nThe first film in Villenueve\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d series received 10 Oscar nominations, mostly in the below-the-line categories, a testament to the entire crew\u2019s superb craftsmanship. However, some viewers found it too slow-paced, lacking enough plot to justify its 155-minute runtime. \u201cPart Two\u201d assuages any concerns about tempo from the first film, while maintaining superb design and even receiving a level-up from the already commanding performances of Part One.\n\nThe director himself recently received flak for controversial comments he made about dialogue, saying that he doesn\u2019t \u201cremember movies because of a good line.\u201d When you remove the hyperbole from that statement, it\u2019s easy to see why Villenueve believes that and how it affects his filmmaking philosophy. Any discussion of Villenueve\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d adaptation must start with the cinematography and sound design, not the writing. \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d is a film that demands to be felt, not just seen and heard.\n\nJust as in the first film, Hans Zimmer\u2019s score sounds unlike anything before it and immediately transports the audience to Arrakis\u2019 mystical deserts or the brutal coliseum of the Harkonnen\u2019s homeworld Giedi Prime. In this film, cinematographer Greig Fraser continues his work as one of Hollywood\u2019s great blockbuster photographers, following \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u201d \u201cThe Batman\u201d and the first \u201cDune.\u201d Fraser and Villenueve create stunning, detailed images with massive scale that never even come close to CGI messes. Every element on the screen, from the geometry of a sand crawler to the way the sun sets over the desert, is immaculately designed, lit and placed within the frame. Nothing in \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d suffers from a lack of thought or care.\n\nVillenueve has long discussed directing these \u201cDune\u201d films, based on the classic Frank Herbert novel that the French-Canadian director loved as a child, as the opportunity of a lifetime. Fraser also makes an \u201cOppenheimer\u201d-esque camera choice in the way he shoots Giedi Prime that simply elevates the art of sci-fi filmmaking.\n\nBut audiences already expected excellence from the look and sound of the film, Villenueve\u2019s entire filmography shines in that regard. The challenge with \u201cPart Two\u201d was always going to be how the director portrayed the story\u2019s epic scale and deeply religious themes with a cast of characters that don\u2019t fall cleanly into hero or villain categories.\n\n\u201cPart Two\u201d provides Chalamet with the opportunity to give one of the performances of his career and the young star absolutely runs with it. He compellingly grapples with his character\u2019s relationship to power and prophecy, trying to escape his inevitable destiny while his mother Jessica pushes him toward it. Ferguson\u2019s performance leans into a sinister space that provides a new dimension to her character from the first film and forces her to carry much of the film\u2019s thematic weight, a burden Ferguson makes look easy.\n\nAnd while Villenueve and his co-writer Jon Spaihts take the material extremely seriously, the script still has levity, helped on by the performances of Zendaya and Bardem in particular. Bardem assumes Jason Momoa\u2019s role from Part One as a mentor to Paul who has well-timed moments of comic relief and brings a warm energy to an at times bleak story.\n\nThe sequel adds a handful of performers who have limited screen time, but still absolutely command the screen. Austin Butler plays Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the sociopathic, murderous nephew to Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s Vladimir Harkonnen who emerges as a foil to Paul. Butler makes a total physical transformation in this, becoming a hairless demon of a man who slits throats with soulless glee.\n\nWhile not quite on the same level as these performances, Butler\u2019s Feyd-Rautha is what you would get from putting the pure evil of Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker in a blender with the eerily-calm killing of Bardem\u2019s own Anton Chigurh from \u201cNo Country for Old Men.\u201d The young actor\u2019s decision to change his voice to play a certain rockstar has become a widespread meme, but his voice flexibility shines again in \u201cPart Two\u201d and makes sense for the character.\n\nThis film also sees the addition of Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam IV and Florence Pugh as his daughter, Princess Irulan. Walken, an 80-year-old legend of Hollywood at this point, brings an automatic regality in his role as emperor, even if he has limited screen time, while Pugh plays a more expository role that helps explain the political machinations behind the Fremen-Harkonnen war and what it means for her father.\n\nBesides her striking costume design, Pugh plays a somewhat thankless role, but likely signed on to the film with an eye towards an increased role in Villenueve\u2019s adaptation of the second book \u201cDune: Messiah,\u201d which would complete his trilogy.\n\nFor some viewers, \u201cDune: Part Two\u2019s\u201d pace may even go too quickly. If you haven\u2019t read the book, the religious and political movements and themes may get lost in the script\u2019s churning through plot and the breakneck pace continues to the film\u2019s very end. And if fans go in expecting Paul to emerge as a clear-cut hero, well... it\u2019s not that kind of movie.\n\nJust like his previous films \u201cPrisoners,\u201d \u201cSicario\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d Villenueve doesn\u2019t make uplifting movies. He\u2019s interested in power\u2019s ability to corrupt and the ways in which regular people become caught in the crosshairs of evil forces. His \u201cDune\u201d films, and \u201cPart Two\u201d in particular, simply give him an elevated and more personally meaningful stage on which to investigate those ideas.\n\nAnd with that license, Villenueve certainly succeeds. \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d immediately earns its place in the pantheon of great sequels and vaults the director into the top tier of both commercially and critically successful directors, if he wasn\u2019t there already.\n```"}

Is it somewhere tropical and sunny, like Puerto Rico or Jamaica? When I visualize this picture, I see the bluest water with palm trees everywhere and while lying in the sun I hear Bob Marley playing in the background. This reigns true on social media, if you go on TikTok and look up any Bob Marley song, you\u2019ll see something tropical.\n\nThis past Valentine\u2019s Day, \u201cBob Marley: One Love,\u201d a film depicting Bob Marley\u2019s rise to fame and the hardships he faced during the process, premiered. The film had mixed reviews with some moviegoers left confused and wanting more while others thoroughly enjoyed the film. Although I did enjoy the film, I understood people\u2019s complaints about wanting to see more of his story and origin, since he had such a dynamic life in just 36 years.\n\nHere are some more details about the musical icon\u2019s life and his legacy that the film didn\u2019t dive into.\n\nEarly Life\nMarley was born in St. Ann Parish, Jamaica on Feb. 6, 1945, to Cedella Malcolm, a native Jamaican woman, and Norval Marley, a white plantation supervisor from England. After his parents separated, his father wasn\u2019t present in his life and died when Marley was just 10. Marley began making music early but didn\u2019t gain traction until he partnered with his friends and created the Wailing Wailers. The groups consisted of Marley, Peter Tosh and Neville \u201cBunny\u201d Livingston with 17 more members to come in and out of the group over the years including Marley\u2019s wife, Rita Marley.\n\nThey released their first single \u201cSimmer Down,\u201d which topped the Jamaican charts in 1964. The group continued to gain more traction after releasing their albums \u201cCatch A Fire,\u201d \u201cBurnin\u201d and \u201cNatty Dread\u201d with popular songs \u201cStir it Up,\u201d \u201cGet Up, Stand Up\u201d and \u201cNo Woman No Cry.\u201d Marley\u2019s music was much deeper than just catchy tunes, as he often highlighted Rastafarian culture.\n\nHis Message\nRastafari is a religious and political movement that began in Jamaica in the 1930s and was adopted by many groups around the globe that combines Protestant Christianity, mysticism and a pan-African political consciousness. Marley implemented these beliefs into his music, continuously advocating for the unification of African people and those of African descent.\n\nIn 1976, tensions were rising between the two political parties in Jamaica, the People Nation\u2019s Party (PNP) and Jamaica\u2019s Labour Party (JLP). Marley planned to put on a free concert to unite the Jamaican people called \u201cSmile Jamaica.\u201d Two days before the event an unsuccessful assassination was attempted on his life, although Marley wasn\u2019t severely hurt, both Rita and Marley\u2019s manager had to undergo surgery. Despite this near-death experience, Marley decided to go through with the show, performing for 80,000 people.\n\nIn 1976, he also came out with \u201cRastaman Vibration,\u201d an album promoting positivity and hopefulness to Rastamen even through the injustices they face. \u201cExodus,\u201d a song on his later album of the same name encompasses the Rastafari message of returning home to the motherland. \u201cOpen your eyes and look within, Are you satisfied with the life you\u2019re living? We know where we\u2019re going, We know where we\u2019re from, We\u2019re leaving Babylon, y\u2019all! We\u2019re going to our Father\u2019s land, Exodus! Alright! Movement of Jah people!\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated one million people who identify under the Rastafari religion today, predominantly in Jamaica, Saint Lucia and Barbados. Whether they converted because of Bob Marley, we don\u2019t know, but we do know his impact was vast.\n\nAfter 14 months in London, Marley returned home after the release of \u201cKaya.\u201d He performed at the One Peace Love concert at the Kingston Stadium on April 22, 1978. Where he brought the leaders of opposing political parties on stage, urging them to shake hands, clasping his over theirs, raising them, and saying \u201cJAH Rastafari,\u201d loosely meaning God almighty.\n\nMarley continued to travel the world and spread his message until he discovered he had Melanoma, which he was diagnosed with after a football injury to his big toe. After the cancer spread all over his body, he passed away at 36 in 1981.\n\nLegacy\nDespite Marley\u2019s early death, his message and legacy didn\u2019t end with him. He had 12 children who continued to keep the Marley name alive. He and Rita had three children, Cedella Marley (1967), Ziggy Marley (1968) and Stephen Marley (1972). He also adopted Sharon Marley and Stephanie Marley, whom Rita had before she married Marley.\n\nMarley had numerous extramarital affairs during his marriage to Rita. In 1972, he had Rohan Marley with Janet Hunt and Robbie Marley with Pat Williams. The following year he had Karen Marley with Janet Bowen and in 1975, he had Julian Marley with Lucy Pounder. In 1976, Ky-Mani Marley was born to Anita Belnavis, and in 1978, Marley and Cindy Breakspeare had Damian Marley. His last child was Makeda Jahnesta who he had with Yvette Crichton in 1981.\n\nMany of Marley\u2019s children shared his gift for music. If you\u2019ve watched the 90s cartoon \u201cArthur,\u201d you may or may not know that Ziggy sang the theme song. His other children Damian and Stephen Marley have been making music together and rocking the world with their \u201cTraffic Jam\u201d tour. But the latest Marley to hit the music scene is his grandson, Joshua or YG Marley, born to Rohan Marley and Lauryn Hill. His song, \u201cPraise Jah In The Moonlight,\u201d blew up on Tiktok and was deemed the \u201csong of the summer.\u201d But like his grandfather, we see a deeper message being promoted in his music, \u201c(Give Jah all the thanks and praises) give Jah the thanks and praises. (Give Jah all the thanks and praises) I sing, give Jah the thanks and praises.\u201d\n\nDespite the decades that have passed, the Rastafari message continues to spread through his lineage.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Riley Sager March 02, 2024 at 9:39 pm PST\n\nFreshman guard Isaiah Collier\u2019s career-high 31 points at Washington on Saturday left the Huskies lead-deprived for nearly 37 minutes as the USC men\u2019s basketball finished its road trip with an 82-75 win. USC went out with a bang in its first matchup with Washington this season, pinning the Huskies scoreless for three minutes following tip-off. The powerful duo of freshman guard Isaiah Collier and graduate forward DJ Rodman combined for a total of 17 points in the first six minutes to carry the Trojans to a comfortable nine-point lead. Collier, who had made just 20 3-pointers the entire season, scored back-to-back threes early in the first half.\n\nThe Trojans maintained a lead for nearly 14 minutes, but a 9-0 Husky run with 5:49 left in the first half quickly had them trailing by four. The Trojans scrambled to recover and responded with their own 9-0 run just minutes before halftime. Fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis, who ended the night with 17 points, added variety to that 9-0 run with a floating jump shot, a 3-pointer and a dunk. Despite leading by 10 at one point, USC found itself too close for comfort at the half. Sophomore forward Vincent Iwuchukwu\u2019s personal foul on Washington graduate forward Keion Brooks Jr. just a second before the halftime buzzer resulted in the Huskies securing three free throws; that trimmed the USC lead to 39-38.\n\nThe Trojans remained relentless in the second half, storming out of the locker room with an immediate 10-1 run in the first 3:30. Despite zero attempts in the first half, USC\u2019s 12 made free throws in the second proved a valuable asset as the Trojans defended their lead. USC\u2019s unstoppable defensive front shut down Brooks \u2014 the Pac-12\u2032s leading scorer \u2014 from scoring in the first 12:43 of the second half. Even when the Huskies slightly reduced their deficit midway through the half, Enfield called a timeout that propelled the Trojans into a 6-0 run. USC\u2019s ability to capitalize on offensive plays allowed it to successfully maintain at least a three-point lead the entire second half. Collier\u2019s awareness and efficiency running the ball opened up the court for offensive possibilities, including the team\u2019s 12 total assists.\n\n\u201cI thought [Collier] did a terrific job of reading the defense and playing under control.\u201d Along with his career-high 31 points limiting the Huskies to just 1:50 minutes of leading, Collier finished them off with eight points in the final few minutes. \u201cHe was terrific in the last two and a half, three minutes,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe went to him on some middle ball screen action with roll and replace. We set a couple of other screens, and he was able to get angles to the guys and finish. He was impressive around the rim tonight.\u201d\n\nWhile Collier, Rodman and Ellis dominated the scoring, junior guard Kobe Johnson\u2019s value was reflected throughout the stat sheet. Johnson led the team in several categories, tallying nine rebounds, five assists, two blocks and four steals. \u201cThat\u2019s a typical game for him when he\u2019s playing at a high level,\u201d Enfield said of Johnson. \u201cI thought this was one of his best defensive games of the season.\u201d\n\nInjuries have certainly strained this team\u2019s potential this season, but the Trojans have proven their ability to keep their heads in the game when they are healthy. \u201cWe are playing very well,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe finally got healthy, and it\u2019s hard. ... When you lose your two leading scorers, who happen to be your two lead guards, and your leading shot-blocker in the Pac-12 all at the same time, it devastated our Pac-12 season because we were short-handed and didn\u2019t have enough offense to win some of those games.\u201d Three of the team\u2019s past four losses have come in overtime, double-overtime and a one-possession game. USC (12-17, 6-12 Pac-12) finishes out the regular season with this week\u2019s home games against Arizona State on Thursday at 8 p.m. and No. 6 Arizona on Saturday at 7 p.m.\n```"}

Let\u2019s take a look back at today\u2019s best and worst performances and what they mean for draft boards across the league.\n\nDAY 3 MVP: WR Xavier Worthy, Texas, 5-11 1/4, 165 lbs\nI asked Mark Gorscak if I could put my camera behind the 40 yard dash line for the second WR group, hoping that Xavier Worthy might do something historic. And then...Xavier Worthy did something historic. Here is my angle. \n\nAlthough Worthy did not participate in any field drills, his 40-yard dash alone made him the talk of Indianapolis on Day 3. Worthy\u2019s official time of 4.21 seconds made him the new fastest man in the history of the Combine, inching out John Ross\u2019 2017 record by one-hundredth of a second. Worthy also had the third-highest vertical (41 inches) and fifth-longest broad jump (10-foot-11) among receivers.\n\nThe fastest man in the draft drew attention on social media from a number of NFL stars, including Super Bowl LVIII MVP Patrick Mahomes, who responded to Worthy\u2019s unofficial times of 4.25 and 4.22 on Twitter.\n\nThe prospect of dropping Worthy in the Chiefs\u2019 system is downright scary, but it\u2019s hard to imagine Worthy lasting until the end of the first round after his record-breaking performance. Once Ohio State\u2019s Marvin Harrison Jr. and Washington\u2019s Rome Odunze are off the board, many would\u2019ve expected someone like LSU\u2019s Malik Nabers or Oregon\u2019s Troy Franklin to be the next receiver selected. And hey, some teams don\u2019t pay much mind to the 40, so maybe that will still be the case, but it\u2019s hard to imagine the many receiver-needy teams in this draft passing on a guy with record-breaking speed.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: QB Michael Penix, Washington, 6-2 1/4, 216 lbs\nAnalysts and scouts across the country had plenty of different takes on today\u2019s throwing drills. Mine is the following: while every single quarterback had at least a few poor throws, Penix seemed polished and demonstrated the arm power and accuracy to succeed at the next level.\n\nPenix looked noticeably more polished on the out-breaking routes than other quarterbacks, hitting his targets in stride with tight, fast spirals. Two of his three end zone fades were accurate, including a beautifully-placed ball to former Washington teammate Rome Odunze. Penix missed on a few throws, including a post-corner on which he led his receiver a bit too far outside. But just about every quarterback that threw on Saturday had a whiff or two on the deep balls, and while Penix\u2019s workout wasn\u2019t perfect, it was free from any horrendous misses, which couldn\u2019t be said for other top prospects (more on that later).\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that on a good number of his throws, Penix could be seen shifting his body and eyes upfield as if looking off his receivers just like he would in a game. This might seem like a small detail, but a major necessity of translating good quarterback play to the NFL is the ability to make accurate throws without staring down your target. The league\u2019s top safeties are adept at reading a quarterback\u2019s eyes and posture to determine where the ball is going, so a quarterback who keeps his eyes on his target as he moves downfield is more likely to be intercepted. Even in drills, Penix showed the habit of looking off his receivers as if looking at a checkdown before quickly turning his head and getting rid of the ball, a trait NFL coaches and scouts will surely be happy to see.\n\nBIGGEST RISER: RB Isaac Guerendo, Louisville, 6-0, 221 lbs\nThe running back group still stands as the most wide-open class in the draft. Pretty much every other group has that top guy or two that most analysts agree is the best at his position\u2014Marvin Harrison Jr. for receivers, Joe Alt for offensive linemen, Brock Bowers for tight ends. Guerendo certainly made his case to enter the conversation for that spot in the running back class with a 4.33-second 40-yard dash, a wicked speed for his 221-pound frame. He also had the highest vertical of any running back by an inch and a half at 41.5 inches, and displayed good speed and running form in field drills.\n\nGuerendo looked to be a 4th-round prospect coming into the NFL Combine, but makes his case for a Day 2 pick with an excellent showing of athleticism.\n\nMOST UNDERWHELMING: QB JJ McCarthy, Michigan, 6-2 1/2, 219 lbs\nFrom the media section at Lucas Oil Stadium, one could hear audible groans from the few dozen reporters present for throwing drills after more than half of McCarthy\u2019s throws. His dig routes were mostly thrown behind or low, including one rep that made Alabama wide receiver Trey Burton fully stop in his tracks to catch the ball when he didn\u2019t even look to be running full speed.\n\nMichigan quarterback JJ McCarthy showed strong footwork during throwing drills but was inaccurate on most of his deep balls, and showed inconsistent timing in the short game. (AP/Charlie Riedel)\n\nMcCarthy only threw one accurate go ball, with his first two landing wide out of bounds and eliciting gasps from fans in attendance. His timing on short game throws was consistently bad, and while some of that can be chalked up to a lack of chemistry with new receivers, you\u2019d expect a lot more from a quarterback rumored to be a top-three prospect at the position.\n\nOTHER NOTABLE PERFORMANCES\nLSU wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. (6-2 7/8, 209) ran the second-fastest 40-yard dash for receivers behind Worthy with a 4.33, and as Rich Eisen pointed out during his NFL Network broadcast, he ran that time 44 pounds heavier than Worthy. His jumps (38.5-inch vertical, 10-foot-6 broad) were middle-of-the-pack but respectable nonetheless among a stacked group of receivers. Thomas Jr. also showed great ball skills and footwork in the gauntlet drill. The performance confirmed Thomas Jr.\u2019s most obvious strength on tape: his insane speed and mobility for his frame.\n\nBYU quarterback Kedon Slovis (6-2 1/2, 223) showed flashes of the high-level quarterback play he displayed at USC before transferring away after Jaxson Dart took over while he was injured. Many quarterbacks elected not to run the 40, but Slovis was not one of them, recording the fastest time of the four that participated with a 4.55. His throws were far from perfect, but for the most part, he showed consistent footwork and accuracy. It\u2019s doubtful teams in need of a Year 1 starter will look to Slovis, but a team in the transition phase or in need of a backup with future upside could look to draft him in the mid-to-late rounds.\n```"}

Worthy's 4.21 is officially the fastest time in the history of the combine.(AP/Darron Cummings)\n\nBy Sullivan Maley\nMarch 02, 2024 at 3:44 pm PST\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 A day of athletic performances at Lucas Oil Stadium was highlighted by Texas wide receiver Xavier Worthy breaking the all-time record in the combine\u2019s most iconic event, the 40-yard dash.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, seeing John Ross run that, I never thought I\u2019d be on that stage and be able to do it,\u201d Worthy said in an interview with NFL Network after his run.\n\nWorthy ran a 4.25 in his first attempt, already the fastest time of this year\u2019s NFL Combine to that point. His fellow receivers could be heard celebrating with him in the end zone, advising him to \u201ctake those shoes off\u201d and ride with his first time. Instead, he decided to run again, telling NFL Network\u2019s Stacey Dales he was going for the record.\n\nAs his 4.22u was broadcast on the jumbotron, Worthy took a victory lap around the stadium, met with deafening applause from fans. Worthy\u2019s official time was later confirmed to be 4.21, making him the fastest player in the NFL Combine\u2019s history. John Ross set the current official record in the 40-yard dash at 4.22 seconds in 2017.\n\nAs the remainder of the receiver group moved into ball drills, Worthy had put his sweats and backpack back on, electing not to participate in the remainder of the day\u2019s drills. According to Dales, this was not in response to his time, as she said Worthy told her his original plan was to only participate in the 40-yard dash.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nMarch 02, 2024 at 3:06 pm PST\n\nHeading into the final weekend of the regular season, No. 7 USC (23-5, 13-5 Pac-12) had one mission: win out and secure the No. 2 seed in the upcoming Pac-12 women\u2019s basketball tournament. Two hard-fought victories over the Arizona schools got the Trojans to the promised land, plus the season sweep of both teams. USC will enter Pac-12 tournament play as victors of nine of its last 10 games.\n\nOn Saturday in Tempe, USC handed Arizona State (11-19, 3-15 Pac-12) its fifth consecutive loss in a game that was never really close, ending in a 70-55 rout. The Trojans showed no signs of fatigue, despite playing 50 minutes in a grueling, double-overtime win over Arizona just two days prior.\n\nJunior center Rayah Marshall\u2019s impact was immense on both ends of the floor, as she posted her second double-double of the road trip. The 6-foot-4 Los Angeles native has dealt with some consistency issues this season, but she got herself involved against the Sun Devils. Marshall scored 15 points and grabbed 15 rebounds, on top of blocking five shots. She set the tone early for USC, scoring seven points in the first, and contributed to the team\u2019s success in the paint. The Trojans scored 60% of their points from inside the key.\n\n\u201cAs strong as [Marshall] has looked, I thought she also started the year out really well and just had to find her way after her illness at the beginning of conference play,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cShe\u2019s anchored us on defense the whole year; I think she\u2019s found her confidence.\u201d\n\nFreshman guard JuJu Watkins fouled out Thursday at Arizona and couldn\u2019t help her team down the final stretch and into overtime, but she was disciplined against ASU and only picked up one foul. This was the first time Watkins had just a single foul in all of conference play this season. She also limited her turnovers while tallying 26 points and 12 rebounds. Watkins started out red-hot with 11 points in the first, but then stepped back a bit in the proceeding frames, allowing her teammates to make their own impact. She continued to show that she could score inside when receiving contact, picking two up and-one chances in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cComing off of a tough last game, it took a lot of our energy,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cIt was important that we finish the year off strong and try our best to close the season out to get us ready for March.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 defense held down the fort. USC held Arizona State under 33% from the field and added 10 blocks. The Trojans also heavily controlled the glass with 54 boards, while the Sun Devils only had 34. This allowed for 21 second-chance points by USC \u2014 ASU had zilch.\n\n\u201cI watched [Watkins] a ton in high school, and you saw some of the qualities that make her so exceptional,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cBut to carry that over to college and do what she\u2019s done in terms of a production standpoint, leading a team, carrying everything else she carries with the attention, and then to be that poised and graceful ... is what makes her uniquely special.\u201d\n\nGraduate forward Kaitlyn Davis became a full-time starter at the beginning of February and has embraced her role ever since. She had nine rebounds and also contributed to the defensive success with three blocks. Junior center Clarice Akunwafo, while only on the court for 10 minutes, was also a force on the backboard, tallying seven rebounds.\n\n\u201cWe always play together and we pick each other up when one is down,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cWe all play collectively.\u201d\n\nSecuring the No. 2 seed means that the Trojans will have a first-round bye in the conference tournament. Instead, USC will wait to face the winner of the opening-round matchup between No. 7-seeded Arizona versus No. 10-seeded Washington. This will be advantageous for the Trojans considering the top six teams in the Pac-12 are all ranked. With the regular season over, the Trojans\u2019 postseason mindset will be in full force. Anything can happen in Sin City, and USC will look to build on recent momentum to not only be successful in the conference tournament, but also in March Madness, as USC appears set to be a host the opening weekend.\n\nUSC\u2019s quarterfinal matchup in the Pac-12 tournament will take place on March 7 at 6 p.m. at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n```"}

Guerendo notched the fastest 40 time of the day at 4.33, as well as the best vertical jump at 41.5 inches. In a class with a number of smaller backs, Guerendo leading the pack at 6-0, 221 lbs will certainly intrigue teams looking for exceptional athleticism in a pro-level frame.

Wright\u2019s 4.38-second 40 made him the second-fastest back of the day, yet he seemed to expect a better time, glancing up at the jumbotron with a look of disgust after crossing the finish line. His broad jump, however, lead the running back group by nearly half a foot at 11-foot-2, and his 38-inch vertical was fourth-best at the position.

{"key": "/2024/03/01/rookie-report-bilal-coulibaly/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy Rookie report: Bilal Coulibaly  He doesn\u2019t have the same fanfare, but Bilal Coulibaly is leading the French New Wave alongside Victor Wembanyama. \n\nBy Jack Hallinan March 01, 2024 at 10:19 pm PST\n\nOn the most recent episode of Slate\u2019s excellent  Hang Up and Listen  podcast, hosts Josh Levin, Stefan Fatsis and Joel Anderson questioned the G League Ignite\u2019s utility amid college basketball\u2019s newfound NIL era and the team\u2019s poor results \u2014 a topic that deserves a column of its own \u2014 plus its sketchy record of producing successful NBA pros. While the program has churned out a respectable 10 draftees in the past three seasons, the most successful Ignite alumnus thus far is... Jalen Green? Jonathan Kuminga? During the podcast, Levin quipped that the \u201csuccessful version\u201d of the G League Ignite was actually Victor Wembanyama\u2019s Metropolitans 92 from the French LNB Pro A, which in addition to producing the No. 1 overall pick, also saw wing-forward Bilal Coulibaly drafted seventh to the Washington Wizards.\n\nUnlike Wembanyama, who draftniks penciled into the top spot a year in advance, Coulibaly was a late riser in the 2023 draft process. He started the 2022-23 season as a standout player for the club\u2019s under-21 team before eventually emerging as a rotational piece in the senior squad alongside Wemby, declaring for the draft in late April 2023. Like former  Rookie report star GG Jackson , Coulibaly was one of the 2023 draft\u2019s youngest players, meaning the rebuilding Wizards bet on his potential rather than his ability to win now. And it\u2019s a good thing the Wizards aren\u2019t really trying to win this season. As of Wednesday, they have a putrid 9-49 record\u2014the same as the Detroit Pistons, who famously endured a 28-game losing streak.\n\nIf not for the Pistons\u2019 more overt failures, the Wizards front office would probably be receiving considerable flak from the national media. That being said, the Wizards lack two things that make the Pistons an easy target:  a highly paid head coach (Monty Williams)  and an interesting centerpiece on the court (Cade Cunningham). Because Williams is one of the league\u2019s best-compensated coaches and Cunningham is a former No. 1 overall pick, fans and the media should reasonably expect their rebuild to be farther along. And whatever you thought about the fired Wes Unseld Jr., the now-former Wizards coach didn\u2019t have a lot to work with, namely because his team lacked a centerpiece of any real caliber.\n\nDespite where you think this long preamble may be leading me, I regret to report that I don\u2019t think Coulibaly is that potential All-NBA centerpiece. But that\u2019s perfectly fine. The Wizards are truly in stage zero of their rebuild. With the exception of Coulibaly, I would be semi-surprised to see any of these players on the roster three seasons from now. The Wizards\u2019 goal was to bottom out in 2023-24; they currently hold the joint-best odds at the No. 1 overall pick, and while the  2024 draft doesn\u2019t have the top-end talent  of previous classes, the Wizards could use anybody with No. 1 or No. 2 scoring option potential.\n\nLooking at the players who seem likely to land in the top three, could we see a French Revolution in the nation\u2019s capital? Jonathan Wasserman\u2019s latest 2024 mock draft for Bleacher Report , for example, has Toulouse-native and current Perth Wildcats standout Alexandre Sarr going first to the Pistons and JL Bourg\u2019s Zaccharie Risacher teaming up with compatriot Wembanyama on the San Antonio Spurs. And, yes, if you clicked on that link you saw that the Wizards sat sandwiched between these two picks, selecting Nikola Topi\u0107 out of Serbia. But here\u2019s the thing: we have literally no clue what the actual draft order will be come June. So, for the time being, I\u2019m going to dream about French duos in D.C. and Coulibaly has the perfect tools to support a bigger scorer in either the 7-foot-1 Sarr or Risacher, who\u2019s 6-foot-9, plus or minus an inch depending on the site where you find his height.\n\nComing out of the draft, Coulibaly measured 6-foot-7 with an absurd 7-foot-2 wingspan that makes him a formidable defender even as one of the league\u2019s youngest rookies. That width helps Coulibaly defend multiple positions and it\u2019s easy to envision him playing even as a small-ball center if the Wizards\u2019 future coach wanted to experiment with that kind of lineup. Averaging  26.7 minutes per game, the Frenchman posts almost a block (0.8) and a steal (0.9) per outing. Advanced stats show that Coulibaly still has work to do of course. His defensive box plus-minus, a stat that measures the defensive points per 100 possessions a player contributes compared to league average, is still minus-0.5. His shot remains a work in progress as well. Coulibaly has shot an underwhelming 44.2% from the field but has displayed solid three-point range at 35.7% on 2.8 attempts per game, suggesting he could become a reliable shotmaker from distance in the future.\n\nOn corner threes, Coulibaly\u2019s accuracy increases substantially to 40.8% and corner shots comprise 46.1% of his three-point diet, per Basketball Reference. And while Coulibaly has appeared in 56 of Washington\u2019s 58 games, the coaching staff has only selected him to start in eight, leaving a lot of room for his role to grow. Despite his current limitations, Coulibaly has taken over games in spurts. Well, taken over may be an exaggeration. But in a road game against the Celtics on Feb. 9, the kid from the Parisian suburbs displayed the exact traits that led the Wizards to draft him in the mid-lottery.\n\nIn the TD Garden against the East-leading Celtics, Coulibaly went 4-12 from distance and made all of his five free throws for a career high 21 points. Toss on eight rebounds, 3 three assists and two steals for seasoning and you have a well-rounded game on both ends of the floor. Crucially in this game, Coulibaly flashed offensive creation that makes him more than just a catch-and-shoot or spot-up threat. He has strong enough ball-handling and smooth athleticism that make him a competent driver in space, able to kick out for teammates, like here: In this sequence, fellow Wizards wing Corey Kispert screens the Celtics\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis, opening a wider lane for Coulibaly to drive into and he takes advantage, noticing Porzingis\u2019 flat-footedness. Porzingis\u2019 height eventually allows him to put an arm up and prevent Coulibaly from taking a lay-up, but the latter\u2019s drive has titled the Celtics\u2019 defense towards the rim and distracted Al Horford from his assignment on Deni Avdija, providing Coulibaly with an outlet, and Avdija draining the three.\n\nCoulibaly can drive with muscle, too: On this possession, Coulibaly sinks his left hip and pushes his shoulder into Jayson Tatum \u2014 a much stouter defender now than when he entered the league \u2014 taking powerful steps forward to create space and pass out to a wide-open Kyle Kuzma for the easy triple. If these drives can become a regular part of Coulibaly\u2019s game, he can become the kind of high-caliber third option who glues an offense together and takes pressure off of his team\u2019s top scorers.\n\nBut it\u2019s the All-Defensive Team potential that should really have Wizards fans feeling the magic. For a wing, Coulibaly is already a top-tier shot blocker. Against shifty guards and score-first forwards, the combination of his agility and wingspan always leave him with a chance of getting his fingers to the ball. Against the Knicks during the In-Season Tournament, New York center Isaiah Hartenstein attempts to screen Coulibaly to create space for All-Star Jalen Brunson to operate. Hartenstein sets a decent screen, but even with his back to the center\u2019s chest, Coulibaly manages to step out of it as Brunson passes him, trailing the point guard closely. Brunson does a stutter-step and goes all the way to paint with Coulibaly behind him, thinking he\u2019s in the clear, but Coulibaly stays tight the whole way through and puts his whole right hand on the ball for the block.\n\nNobody\u2019s safe when Coulibaly is around. As of now, it\u2019s hard to imagine Coulibaly becoming a bonafide, All-Star scorer. But if the Wizards can escape from the NBA\u2019s hellish floor and manage to construct a competent roster, Coulibaly is the exact kind of player who can separate mere playoff teams from true contenders. Dare I say it, Coulibaly has a bit of a Draymond Green vibe about him (and I mean that purely as a basketball comparison). In the Warriors\u2019 heyday, Green was never a go-to scorer, but he hit the shots his team needed him to and his switchability and defensive IQ defined the team\u2019s back court presence. If Coulibaly can become 75% of Green at his peak, Washington will have nailed the pick and may finally see quality pro basketball in the DMV again.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Doug McSchooler)\n\nBy Felipe Londo\u00f1o March 01, 2024 at 10:10 pm PST\n\nNon-Power 5 players are typically not selected in the first round of the NFL draft\u2013since 2014, only 24 out of 318 first-round selections have been G5 or FCS athletes, equating to around 7.5%. Shrink that range down to the top 20 and the number drops to 7%. Becoming a high draft pick from a non-Power 5 school is extremely difficult. Yet, there\u2019s a Mid-Atlantic Conference defensive back who appears to have defied the odds and is currently projected to be one of the first prospects to walk up the draft podium in late April: University of Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell, a two-time second-team All-America selection who cemented himself as one of the most feared defensive backs in college football and is quickly rising in draft boards across the country.\n\nMitchell has blown up throughout the draft season with a stellar performance during Senior Bowl week and significant hype from notable draft analysts like Mel Kiper, Daniel Jeremiah, and Dane Brugler, who all have him as a top 20 player in the draft. But should an NFL team be comfortable taking a corner that early who only played a ranked opponent twice during his college career? Or does Mitchell\u2019s skillset transcend the level of competition and makes him worthy of a top selection? We\u2019re here to break it all down in this week\u2019s edition of Tape Talk, where we\u2019ll go over Mitchell\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, scheme fit and his best possible landing spots in the league.\n\nWhen researching Mitchell\u2019s background, the first thing that stands out is how quickly he burst onto the scene at Toledo and the tremendous growth he underwent during his four years with the program. Graduating high school during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, Mitchell wasn\u2019t allowed to enroll at Toledo until the fall, yet still played in all six of Toledo\u2019s games during the shortened season and started every one of the Rockets\u2019 outings in 2021, despite having only one spring football season and two fall camps under his belt. And while he showed promise as a freshman and sophomore, Mitchell cemented himself as an elite corner during his upperclassman years, finishing his junior and senior seasons as top two among all college corners in pass break-ups (PBUs) and earning two back-to-back first-team All-MAC and second-team All-American selections, proving he belongs not only among the best players in the MAC but all of college football.\n\nMitchell won his matchups week after week through tremendous instincts and short-area quickness, which perfectly served Toledo\u2019s defensive identity; the Rockets played a predominantly single-high heavy scheme with some usage of Cover 4, meaning Mitchell was often manned up, particularly in off alignments, to opposing teams\u2019 number one receiver and free to quickly read and blow up plays in front of him with his high-level processing and quickness. The perfect marriage of Toledo\u2019s scheme with Mitchell\u2019s abilities is truly a joy to study; watch this compilation of Mitchell blowing up underneath-intermediate plays from his oft-deployed off alignment, for example. Note the phenomenal patience and processing with which Mitchell keys receivers\u2019 hips, not wasting any movement in his footwork while backpedaling or being fooled by head or shoulder fakes, before exploding toward his targets with exceptional plant and drive.\n\nMitchell also did a good job on deeper routes from his off-man alignment, where he showed the very good foot speed and lateral agility to stay on top of good athletes, with solid timing when flipping his hips and long speed to trail good athletes on deeper routes. He was especially lockdown on field-stretching routes in or near the red zone, where he showed good positional awareness and physical toughness to nudge receivers toward the sideline, shrinking the throwing window.\n\nMitchell\u2019s instincts and short-area quickness also allow him to thrive in zone coverage. Similar to his ability in man to read receivers\u2019 hips and react in a split second, Mitchell also displays the processing to read the quarterback\u2019s eyes and body language when dropping to his zone to anticipate throws, particularly when moving downfield, with his special transition quickness to blow up shorter and intermediate routes. Altogether, Mitchell\u2019s phenomenal processing skills and quickness are what make him such a terrifying coverage player. Yet, it\u2019s his good ball skills in addition to this, particularly with his back to the quarterback, that makes him a true weapon in coverage. When closing in downfield on receivers from his off alignments or fighting field stretching routes on all levels of the field, Mitchell showcases an almost Spider-Sense-like instinct to swat away incoming balls or obstruct the catch point for receivers.\n\nPlays like these are what have scouts, general managers and other high-level personnel executives excited when watching Mitchell\u2019s film. And while I don\u2019t think Mitchell\u2019s ball skills are as elite as some high-level analysts are saying (stemming from his lack of play strength to force incompletions after the catch against and concentration issues leading to dropped interceptions), Mitchell\u2019s ball-hawk instincts and inspiring competitiveness at the point of attack certainly flash on tape. At his best, Mitchell is a high-level coverage corner, particularly in off-man or zone assignments, due to his instincts, short area quickness, and impressive ball skills.\n\nYet, there are enough concerns that could make NFL decision-makers weary of making him an early-first-round pick. First\u2014and this is less of a negative and more of a question mark\u2014Mitchell\u2019s lack of experience and dominance from press alignments should definitely raise some eyebrows. As touched upon earlier, Mitchell primarily operated from off alignments at Toledo, which played perfectly to his excellent vision, anticipation and plant-and-drive ability, yet also prevented him from often being pressed up against number one receivers. Thus, while there are some flashes of Mitchell holding up in press (such as the Miami of Ohio clip referenced earlier), they are few and far between, which is particularly concerning since Mitchell played lesser competition in the MAC.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Mitchell had a very impressive showing from press alignments in the one-versus-one drills at this year\u2019s Senior Bowl, winning reps consistently against some of the best receivers in the class, yet just because Mitchell excelled in the technique for a few days in Mobile in a practice-like, isolated environment against college-level competition does not mean he will do so as easily in the league. And while, best case scenario, Mitchell ends up being solid or better as a press defender in the league, right now, he\u2019s not proven enough off his college tape to consider it a strength.\n\nMoving on to more prevailing cons, I have concerns about how Mitchell\u2019s ability in run support and open-field tackling projects to the NFL level due to his average frame (Mitchell is 195 pounds but plays in a slim, non-muscular frame), below-average angle processing when moving diagonally, and adequate play strength when tackling bigger skill players. Mitchell\u2019s deficiencies as a run defender are not due to a lack of effort; he shows good run/pass recognition and competitiveness to drive for outside leverage on outside runs or jet sweeps, with good quickness to force the play back inside to his help defenders. With that said, his \u201cstack-shed\u201d ability (referring to a defender\u2019s ability to disengage from a block by extending their arms and then \u201cshedding\u201d the defender) is below average at best, preventing him from making a play on the ball when blocked by tight ends and receivers. As an open field tackler, he does a good job of breaking down and wrapping defenders when moving vertically, yet shows adequate angle processing to take the right angle when approaching defenders at an angle, which, alongside adequate play strength against bigger skill players, leads to plenty of missed tackles, like on this play against Miami of Ohio in the MAC championship where he takes a poor angle on an outside zone run, allowing the running back to rush for ten more yards than he should have.\n\nWith all this in mind, Mitchell would best serve a team that majors in single high coverages, primarily utilizing off and some bail technique due to his tremendous instincts and short-area quickness to read and react to plays in front of him. Due to his lack of experience in press, I would not trust him to excel in a team that runs press-man at a high rate, and would also not be comfortable with him being a number one corner off the jump; number one corners are typically asked to press opponents\u2019 best receiving weapons, and Mitchell is simply too unproven at the skill right now to project him to do it at a high level. I would also be wary of deploying him as a cloud corner in Cover 2 or Cover 6 alignments or as a quarters defender in Cover 4, as he\u2019ll have an increased run-support responsibility in those coverages and projects to struggle.\n\nMoving on to team fits (while I would not pick him this high), the Indianapolis Colts at the 15th pick make a ton of sense; the team is in dire need of playmakers on the defensive side of the football, and defensive coordinator Gus Bradley is renowned for his high usage of single-high-centric schemes, particularly Cover 3, which would not have Mitchell pressed on most snaps and play to his strengths. The Pittsburgh Steelers at 20 are also a good fit with an already established up-and-coming corner in Joey Porter Jr., who would complement Mitchell\u2019s skillset well (Porter Jr. is renowned for his ability in press), and a defensive mastermind in Mike Tomlin, who runs high amounts of man-coverage and could assuredly develop Mitchell into a star just like he\u2019s done with Porter Jr., Minkah Fitzpatrick and myriad other defensive backs. Finally, the Detroit Lions at 29 could also be an ideal landing spot with an aggressive, man-coverage heavy defensive coordinator in Aaron Glenn, who\u2019s in dire need of talent in the secondary to run his scheme. In 2023, the Lions ranked third to last in net yards per attempt allowed through the air (7.1). Adding Mitchell would go a long way into boosting that secondary and cementing a good young core with nickel/safety Brian Branch coming off a stellar rookie season.\n```"}

(AP/Michael Conroy)\n\nBy Sullivan Maley\nMarch 01, 2024 at 8:46 pm PST\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Friday\u2019s defensive back drills saw Clemson cornerback Nate Wiggins potentially cement himself as CB1 in this year\u2019s draft before going down with an injury after his 40-yard dash. Meanwhile, the Brock Bowers\u2019 absence from tight end drills allowed for some of the position group\u2019s lesser-known depth to shine. Let\u2019s take a look at the best and worst performances from Day 2 and how they affected players\u2019 draft stocks.\n\nDAY 2 MVP: TE Ben Sinnott, Kansas State, 6-3 7/8, 250 lbs\nSinnott caught the attention of NFL Network\u2019s camera crew from a group of three fans clad in KSU purple that could be heard cheering all across Lucas Oil Stadium whenever he ran a drill. Apparently, the mini-fan club gave him a boost, as Sinnott let all tight ends with a 6.82-second three-cone time and put up amazing jump numbers (40-inch vertical and 10-foot-6 broad). His 4.68-second 40 was solid for his large frame, and he looked great in field drills, demonstrating good ball tracking and soft hands as he snagged passes with ease. It doesn\u2019t seem unrealistic to expect Sinnott to be the second tight end off the board in this year\u2019s draft after his impressive workout, possibly selected sometime mid-second round.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: CB Nate Wiggins, Clemson, 6-1 3/8, 178\nWiggins\u2019 insane 4.28-second 40 time (which currently stands as this year\u2019s fastest among all positions) had me tempted to dub him MVP of the day, but considering his absence from field drills, he\u2019ll make today\u2019s list as an honorable mention. After running the 40, Wiggins told NFL Network\u2019s Stacy Dales that he felt something pop in his groin, saying the area was \u201con fire.\u201d After being examined by medical staff, he returned to the field with a large ice pack taped around his hip and leg, and sat out the rest of the day\u2019s drills. Wiggins was diagnosed with a hip flexor injury, but expects to be good to go for Clemson\u2019s April 6 pro day.\n\nBIGGEST RISER: CB Max Melton, Rutgers, 5-11, 187\nMelton ran a 4.39-second 40 and impressed with a 40.5-inch vertical and an 11-foot-4 broad jump, but his best work came in field drills. Melton ran clean and smooth and looked comfortable flipping his hips. He\u2019s confident in his hands as a former wide receiver, and did much better at running through his catch during line drills than most DBs (those less confident in their hands tend to pull up at the end of the drill for an easier catch). Melton put himself on the map with a solid workout, and shouldn\u2019t make it out of the third round without being drafted.\n\nMOST UNDERWHELMING: SAF Kamren Kinchens, Miami, 5-11 1/2, 203\nKinchens was considered by most going into the NFL Combine as the top safety prospect of his class, but had the slowest 40-yard dash for the position at 4.65, as well as the shortest broad jump at 9-foot-2. He showed good ball skills, but lacked fluidity in most of his drills. Unless he turns things around at pro day, it\u2019s hard to imagine him still being the first safety off the board after a truly disappointing NFL Combine outing.\n\nOTHER NOTABLE PERFORMANCES\nWashington tight end Devin Culp (6-3 1/8, 231) had by far the fastest 40 time for his position at 4.47, and displayed that speed well with fast, fluid routes during field drills. Texas Tech safety Dadrion Taylor-Demerson (5-10 3/8, 197) ran a 4.41-second 40-yard dash, the fastest for a safety at the combine and ninth-fastest among all defensive backs, with an impressive 1.52-second 10-yard split. Arizona tight end Tanner McLachlan (6-5 1/8, 244) had arguably the most impressive tight end field workout, looking extremely comfortable tracking and catching the ball, as well as displaying solid route running ability and body control. His 4.61-second 40-yard dash was the third-best at the position, and faster than most other tight ends in the class of similar frame.\n```"}

Wiggins limped off the field after the run, telling NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales he felt a \u201cpop\u201d in his groin and that the area was \u201con fire.\u201d He returned shortly after with a large ice pack taped to his inner thigh, and did not participate in any further drills. Wiggins told NFL Network that he expects to be ready for Clemson\u2019s April 6 pro day.\n\nThe cornerback group as a whole impressed with their speed, with seven other prospects running sub-4.4 times: Toledo\u2019s Quinyon Mitchell (4.33), Mississippi State\u2019s Decamerion Richardson (4.34), Auburn\u2019s Nehemiah Pritchett (4.36), Florida State\u2019s Jarrian Jones (4.38), Penn State\u2019s Daequan Hardy (4.38), Ole Miss\u2019 Deantre Prince (4.38) and Rutgers\u2019 Max Melton (4.39).\n\nPending more news concerning his injury, Wiggins\u2019 time makes him a strong candidate for the CB1 spot in this year\u2019s draft. His main competitor for that spot, Alabama\u2019s Terrion Arnold, ran an underwhelming 4.50. Fellow top corner Quinyon Mitchell also impressed with his 4.33-second 40, but looked somewhat clunky in field drills. Mitchell lacked fluidity when flipping his hips, and was the only prospect to catch the ball with his arms during the speed turn drill instead of making a high-point catch.\n\nToledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell's 4.33-second 40-yard dash was impressive, but Mitchell looked uncomfortable in some field drills, electing to catch with his body during the speed turn drill in which defensive backs are instructed to high point the ball.\n\nMax Melton of Rutgers improved his draft stock with a great performance across drills, running a 4.39-second 40 and recording an 11-foot-4 broad jump, the second-longest of the 2024 NFL Combine so far and the longest among corners. Melton looked smooth in field drills, flipping his hips well in the line drill and showing solid ball tracking and adjustment to make an aggressive high-point grab during the speed turn drill.\n\nFull list of cornerback 40-yard dash times:\nName Height Weight 40-yard dash\nNate Wiggins, Clemson 6-1 3/8 178 4.28\nQuinyon Mitchell, Toledo 6-0 1/8 195 4.33\nDecamerion Richardson, Miss.

The NBA is entering the home stretch of the regular season and some former Trojans are balling out. In the past seven days of NBA basketball, six former Trojans suited up and earned minutes on the hardwood. With about six weeks left of the regular season, these Trojan basketball alums will look to contribute even more on playoff contending teams. This week\u2019s coverage highlights both a foreign-born Trojan and a Southern California native on potential playoff teams in their performances from the last week of February.\n\nNikola Vucevic\n\nThe Bulls have needed Nikola Vucevic\u2019s difference-making offensive talent in recent weeks. In his last 11 games, the Montenegrin has scored 20-plus points on all but one occasion, and he\u2019s averaging 22 points per game in those 11 outings. The two-time NBA All-Star started off the last week of February away in New Orleans. On February 25, Vucevic recorded 22 points and 13 rebounds to help the Bulls earn a crucial victory against the West\u2019s sixth-place Pelicans 114-106. Two nights later, the 33-year-old made an efficient 12 of his 23 shot attempts for 25 points. However, against the lowly Detroit Pistons, the Bulls failed to capitalize with his offensive output. The Pistons beat the Bulls by double digits in a Central Division matchup.\n\nIn another divisional rivalry game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Vucevic played over 40 minutes in a double-overtime victory. Vucevic predominantly played in a power forward role, matching up against fellow former Trojan Evan Mobley. The 33-year-old scored 24 points on 50% shooting from 3-point range and grabbed 13 boards. Vucevic collected his fourth double-double in as many games and his ninth in his last 11. The Bulls hope his offensive contribution can stay consistent for the team\u2019s last 23 regular season games, with the team looking to earn a playoff berth for the first time since 2022.\n\nDe\u2019Anthony Melton\n\nAfter missing 17 consecutive games for the Philadelphia 76ers, De\u2019Anthony Melton returned to action this past week. In 36 games played in 2023-2024, the North Hollywood native has started 33 of them. Melton has posted a career-high average in points per game this season, a possible result of the James Harden trade from Philadelphia to the Los Angeles Clippers in 2023, which created a scoring gap that Melton has helped fill.\n\nIn his first game since suffering a lumbar spine stress injury in early January, Melton started off the bench against Mobley\u2019s Cavaliers on February 23. In just over 16 minutes played, the former Trojan scored seven points, going 100% from the charity stripe. The 76ers snatched a crucial inter-conference 104-97 victory. Melton showcased his offensive prowess against the Milwaukee Bucks two nights later.  \u201cMr. Do Something\u201d  scored 16 points and dished out three assists in only 18 minutes of action. Despite shooting 50% from behind the arc against Milwaukee, the 76ers could not keep up with the Bucks as Philadelphia lost by 21 points.\n\nThings would go from bad to worse for the Sixers against the No. 1 seed Boston Celtics on Tuesday. The 2018 second-round draft pick would leave for the locker room after just nine minutes of playing time. Melton suffered back spasms against Boston, reaggravating the injury that previously kept him out for almost two months. 76ers head coach Nick Nurse said he is uncertain about Melton\u2019s timetable to return to action. The Sixers will hope their starting point guard Melton and the reigning MVP Joel Embiid return to make a playoff push in April.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Following a three-game homestand, LA ventured north for a handful of divisional matchups against rival teams in the race for Stanley Cup Playoff positions. However, the trip didn\u2019t go as the Kings would\u2019ve hoped. They lost back-to-back games for the first time in interim head coach Jim Hiller\u2019s tenure, but then rebounded with a big victory against the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 matchup against the Oilers was crucial. The Kings are one place behind Edmonton in the Pacific Division standings and a win would\u2019ve helped the Kings climb the ladder. Although the Oilers entered on a three-game skid, they did an effective job of matching Los Angeles\u2019 scorers and won the game in the third period.\n\nThe Kings started with strong momentum early in the first period. Winger Quinton Byfield made a perfect centering pass to the low slot that set up winger Trevor Moore for a wrist-shot score to give LA the lead. However, toward the end of the frame, Edmonton\u2019s forecheck forced a Pierre-Luc Dubois turnover, which led to a Zach Hyman equalizer.\n\nLA regained the lead with about 12 minutes left in the second period following a sequence of successful passes that resulted in winger Alex Laferriere\u2019s eighth goal of the season. But, once again, the Oilers showed that they weren\u2019t going to allow the Kings to be comfortable. Winger Leon Draisaitl deflected in Edmonton\u2019s second goal, tying the game heading into the third period.\n\nOilers defenseman Evan Bouchard gave his team their first lead early in the final period and center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins increased Edmonton\u2019s advantage to two scores with little time remaining. Los Angeles ended up falling 4-2.\n\nNot only did the Kings lose the game, but they also lost winger Adrian Kempe to an upper-body injury\u2014sidelining him week-to-week\u2014that depletes their forward cast even more. Kempe is LA\u2019s second-leading point generator with 51, and with wingers Viktor Arvidsson and Carl Grundstrom already on long-term injury reserve, general manager Rob Blake will need to be aggressive at the trade deadline to strengthen his squad.\n\nNot only that, but other forwards such as Kevin Fiala, An\u017ee Kopitar, Dubois and Byfield will need to rise to the occasion to fill the shoes of Kempe.\n\nThe very next day, the Kings headed to the southern part of the province to the Saddledome, where their bout with the Calgary Flames resulted in a similar story. Los Angeles put a goal on the board first, striking in the second period thanks to a slap shot from Phillip Danault that hit the post and landed in.\n\nBut the Kings\u2019 lead didn\u2019t last for long. Calgary responded in kind less than a minute later with a goal of its own and then took the lead within two minutes of the Kings\u2019 goal. Fiala, who notched two points in the game, clawed the Kings even again with a backhand goal of his own, but the Flames scored twice in the third, handing LA its second consecutive 4-2 defeat.\n\nCalgary earned its fourth straight victory, keeping it in the thick of the playoff mix at 63 points.\n\nThe Kings next faced a tall task on Thursday against the Western Conference\u2019s best: the Vancouver Canucks, a team that LA could likely face in the first round of the playoffs. However, Los Angeles didn\u2019t let road-trip fatigue and a two-game slide get in the way of answering the call to action.\n\nA retro-looking Drew Doughty became the Kings\u2019 catalyst as they routed Vancouver 5-1. The 34 year-old blueliner tallied three points for the first time in a single game this season and scored the Kings\u2019 opening goal to generate momentum.\n\nFiala, who also recorded three points, teed up a one-timer for Doughty, who used his forceful strength to put the puck through. Another veteran, Kopitar, then doubled LA\u2019s lead with a shot that went over the shoulder of Vancouver\u2019s All-Star goalie Thatcher Demko in the second.\n\nIn the third, Canucks winger Brock Boeser scored on the power play to cut the deficit to one, which ignited the Kings to show their Pacific rivals that they weren\u2019t finished.\n\nFiala scored a minute and a half later on the power play, having drawn the penalty himself, to regain the two-score lead. Kings rookie defenseman Brandt Clarke added his name to the list of goal scorers, faking out Demko in the crease for his second career lamp-lighter. Moore capped off Los Angeles\u2019 slugfest with a goal of his own with about four minutes left.\n\nWhile the two losses in Alberta were disappointing, the Kings found their footing against the Canucks and proved they can still tango with the West\u2019s best teams, even if Vancouver has struggled as of late. LA will hope to build off its statement win as it heads home for a date with the Devils, before taking on these Canucks again. The Kings will round off their week with matchups against the Senators and Stars.\n\nLosing Kempe for the foreseeable future will be detrimental\u2014but the \u201cnext man up\u201d mentality will have to be in full force. Tied with the Nashville Predators at 70 points and trailing Edmonton by just two, every game is crucial considering the Kings\u2019 limited breathing room in the Western Conference.\n```"}

In a press release, Honeybird stated, \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we announce that we will be closing our USC Village location.\u201d Nestled in between Starbucks and Stout Burgers and Beers, Honeybird offered a wide variety of food options including fried chicken, sandwiches, salads and sides like mac and cheese, waffles and cole slaw.\n\nHoneybird, similar to other Village stores, has been considered a pricier meal option for the college students surrounding the area. \u201cI\u2019m on the student meal plan, I would go to the restaurants if they were cheaper and more affordable, but at the same time, I know they\u2019re all kind of expensive because they\u2019re all not like fast food or anything,\u201d said Isaac Ashe-McNalley, a freshman studying geodesign. \u201cIt\u2019s not like everyone can afford to just buy or spend $20 on every meal.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant was established when the Village was created in 2017, its seven-year anniversary falls on the same day the chicken joint will shutter its USC-adjacent location. Honeybird listed their reasoning for shutting its doors in their statement, \u201cAs the years have gone by we have seen less and less business which ultimately has led us to make the difficult decision of closing this location.\u201d\n\nUSC students themselves admit to not stopping by this food joint very often. \u201cI\u2019ve only been there once, but I feel like the chicken sandwich is pretty good. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the cheapest,\u201d said Lauren Kim, a freshman studying psychology. Kyndred Lewis, a freshman studying international relations and global economy, had not frequented the spot very often, \u201cI\u2019m not really gaining or losing anything and the couple of times I\u2019ve eaten there, it\u2019s just been okay.\u201d\n\nThough, Honeybird will be missed. Written on a board in Honeybird is the announcement of its closing date, March 9.

[sic]\u201d\n\nHoneybird brought a friendly staff, and a hangout place to enjoy great food with friends and family to all USC students and visitors. To them, the closing of Honeybird comes bittersweet. Now would be the time to bid the birds a great migration. Their statement finished, \u201cCome by and say goodbye and have some fried chicken before we leave!\u201d\n\nHoneybird only has one other location in La Ca\u00f1ada, Flintridge that opened in 2016.

Now, he\u2019s one of many trying to figure out how to vote on SAG-AFTRA\u2019s \u201clandmark\u201d contract.\n\nPicketers carry signs on the picket line outside Netflix on Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2023, in Los Angeles. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie March 01, 2024 at 2:58 pm PST\n\nIt was October and Alan Starzinski was sorry. He apologized to everyone he told to use the crosswalk. He apologized when he asked for a thin crust pizza. He apologized for his absence on one of the rare days he could not make it to a SAG-AFTRA picket line. He does not, however, apologize to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.\n\nStarzinski was a volunteer strike captain outside Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters at Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood. Almost every weekday since the start of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s strikes three months prior, the affable, brown-haired actor \u2014 a man who doesn\u2019t seem tall but boasts on Instagram that he\u2019s taller than the 5\u20328 Robert Downey Jr. \u2014 could be seen by the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue.\n\nThe strikes were a major blow to the nation\u2019s economy. The Milken Institute\u2019s Kevin Klowden estimated they\u2019d cost around $6 billion dollars in a mid-October interview with Variety. For individuals, they were even more devastating, with many actors and entertainment workers emptying whatever savings they had. They dragged on for longer than any previous SAG strike for a variety of reasons, chief among them SAG-AFTRA\u2019s demand for improved pay for streamed programs. They dealt with hot-button political issues \u2014 what constitutes a fair wage and the expansion of artificial intelligence.\n\nToday, many actors are unsure whether those concerns have been met sufficiently. Starzinski helped patrol the L-shaped picket line in front of the leading streaming platform for upwards of three hours almost every day. He made sure people passed both gates SAG-AFTRA asked members to picket. He kept people out of the street, and he spent time on a megaphone. He, like the other strikers, did not earn money from the work he did for those 118 days.\n\nHe spent over an hour on the megaphone trying to bring the crowd more energy and beckoning passing vehicles to honk. That seemed to be his favorite aspect and the one he excelled in. Passing drivers saw Starzinski making strange gestures at them \u2014 lurching his palm forward in their direction while shouting. Some didn\u2019t notice. Some pointedly ignored him. The rest, however, honked their horns as they passed, signaling their support for striking actors. Loud cheers erupted from the picketing crowd every time he convinced an industrial vehicle to loudly proclaim its support.\n\nHe criticized many drivers for their texting habits. For some car brands, he had specific ways to call on drivers to honk \u2014 from Jeeps, he asked for beeps, from Toyotas, he asked for toots and he always celebrated a \u201cHonda honk.\u201d When he caught the attention of one truck, lacking a working horn, he got the dog inside to bark its support for the strike. \u201cI am the honk daddy, and I get my honks,\u201d he boasted to passing cars.\n\nWhen he first got on the megaphone that day, he came as close to apologizing to the AMPTP as it seems he ever will. \u201cI know everybody in that office is excited they don\u2019t have to hear my damn voice anymore,\u201d he yelled towards the Netflix building, still celebrating the WGA contract signed a week prior, believing it foretold an approaching end to the strikes which exhausted him.\n\nStarzinski knew he wanted to be a strike captain before SAG-AFTRA members even voted to strike. \u201cAs soon as the WGA went on strike, I was like \u2018Oh, we have to join them. This is a no-brainer.\u201d He was not new to the industry, having performed at the Upright Citizens Brigade for 16 years. Nor was he new to working with the union, having sat on SAG-AFTRA committees and run for a seat on the board. Multiple people on the negotiating committee recommended that he be a captain.\n\nHe was not even new to attempting collective action \u2014 that dated back to high school. \u201cI tried to get everybody to leave school one day,\u201d Starzinski recalled. \u201cThey can\u2019t stop us... What are they going to do, give us all detention? That\u2019s just school. That\u2019s all that is.\u201d\n\nDespite his long-time predilection towards striking, spending that much time on the picket line took its toll. \u201cBeing out there on the line is exhausting,\u201d he yawned. \u201cHaving general empathy for human beings within the same industry as you, that\u2019s... that\u2019s taxing... I have a lot of friends in [the International Association of Theatrical Stage Employees] that are hurting.\u201d\n\nStarzinski wasn\u2019t the only one exhausted by his time on the line. Strike captains were encouraged to take breaks when they felt they were close to being overwhelmed or breaking down. \u201cI did have to take two weeks off at one point,\u201d Emily Kincaid, another Netflix strike captain, said. \u201cI would come home, have to take a nap, and then I would wake up. I would be too tired to get anything [done] that I really needed to get done for my real life.\u201d\n\nAs much as the extensive time on the line and seeing friends suffer hurt, Starzinski said seeing the entertainment industry standing together on that street corner in Hollywood helped him and others through it. \u201cWe\u2019re all going through the same stuff. We are all in this together because you cannot break such a tight bond. There are more of us than there are of them.\u201d\n\nOne core of the strikes, Starzinski posited as he sat in a boxy, orange chair in the living room of his shared residence just over two miles from the Netflix strike location, was struck studios\u2019 desire to \u201celiminate humanity\u201d in art with the expansion of AI \u2014 a highly contentious issue \u2014 which he argued defeats art\u2019s purpose. \u201cThat\u2019s what art is. It\u2019s not pretty f\u2014ing pictures,\u201d he said with disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s human expression of capturing something \u2014 of how you feel or what you think \u2014 and conveying that to others.\u201d\n\nHe used photographers as an example. \u201cThey are capturing a moment,\u201d he argued, referring to their photographs. \u201cThey are not making it. They\u2019re not painting anything. They\u2019re not performing anything. They are, with their eye, telling you something is important.\u201d A robot could take pictures constantly, Starzinski expounded, and eventually one of those pictures might be good. Even then, however, someone would have to choose which picture looked best, thus assigning importance and meaning to the image. Even that, he believes, requires human expression.\n\nIt is that insight Starzinski argued for so strongly. \u201cNothing is important. Nothing. Truly, nothing really matters in life unless you decide that it does and artists are telling you what they decide is important,\u201d he proselytized. \u201cIf we\u2019re trying to take that out, then what the f\u2014 is the point of any of this?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s November, and Alan Starzinski is in Dublin. Flights were cheap and his mother had already wanted to go. With the strike behind him, he jumped at the opportunity to tour the British Isles with her and his sister. Even without picketing, half the world away, the community he formed with his fellow strike captains is as strong as ever. The night the strike ended, a large cohort of strike captains from multiple locations and members of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s negotiating committee went to a nearby brewery to celebrate. Tears flowed, Kincaid said, both in relief that a deal was finally done and in the worry that the close friendships they had built over the four months on the line would be gone.\n\nThat worry has not shown itself to be warranted so far. The captains\u2019 group chat remains in use every day, with conversations about the impending member vote and about everything else happening in their lives. \u201cI never would\u2019ve thought at this state and age of my life... I would make 15 new best friends, but I have,\u201d Kincaid said.\n\nWhile spending the last four months in a constant state of uncertainty as to what the future would hold, strikers have run the gamut of emotions; indignation at the studios refusing to give actors what they feel they are worth; resigned fury at California Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s refusal to grant striking actors unemployment benefits, which Starzinski relies on for half of most years; exhaustion from hours spent shouting in the sun; cautious optimism at the news that the strike was ending and so many more.\n\nNow, Starzinski and others have a new one to face: indecision. The deal is not what most had hoped, with only $40 million allocated to streaming residuals, down from 2% of streaming revenue, then down again from $500 million, many are also worried that the initially celebrated AI protections are not as strong as expected.\n\nKeeping his experiences volunteering for the union in mind, Starzinski now worries that the unity SAG-AFTRA formed during the strike could slip away, sending the union\u2019s politics back into an intensely factional debate. \u201cFor a long time there was a lot of infighting and it seems like now we\u2019re starting to try to move that- move it past that,\u201d Starzinski said in October. \u201cThere were two political parties that f\u2014ing hated each other for, like Montague-Capulet sh\u2014, like most people don\u2019t even remember why they don\u2019t like each other, but they just remember, \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t like each other.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring and before the strike, those rivalries found themselves leaving the forefront of the union\u2019s debate. There was a new \u201cbig bad\u201d to unite against and newer members of the union have pushed to move on from past differences. They want the union to work, Starzinski says, not to fight for petty reasons.\n\nDividing lines may be re-emerging with the new contract, however. \u201cWe do still have a strong core that is not willing to put up with bulls\u2014.\u201d Starzinski said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s willing to fight, some are willing to fight for less.\u201d\n\nThose dividing lines may not be the same ones originally causing conflict, however. People who have been involved in the union for decades, Starzinski said, are happy with the deal, even those who despise one another. Even those who are normally never happy with negotiations are happy with this contract.\n\nAlthough both have reservations about the deal, Starzinski and Kincaid both expect it to pass the member vote.\n\nWithout picketers, it\u2019s far quieter at Van Ness and Sunset. Honks are less common, chants nonexistent, the tables and tents set up for strikers with their food, their water, their information are all gone. Across the street, a billboard no longer advertises \u201cHeart of Stone\u201d or \u201cFair Play.\u201d With the picketers gone, it seems to be singing a different tune, promoting \u201cMaestro\u201d and emblazoned at the top with the words \u201cThe performance of a lifetime.\u201d\n\nDespite the honks Starzinski and his fellow captains summoned, despite the day-in, day-out passion of striking actors, despite the best efforts of the negotiating committee, it remains to be seen if SAG-AFTRA has had its performance of a lifetime.\n```"}

Megan Wong: It has a lot to do with, just, like, racism and prejudice to begin with. There have been multiple uprisings, rebellions. One in 65, one in 92, where the community has rebelled against the powers that be, that continually hold them down with an iron fist\n\nThat was Megan Wong, the volunteer coordinator at the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. Wong explained how the people of Watts have experienced environmental racism, referring to the disproportionate harm people of color face from environmental issues. According to 2020 Census data, the neighborhood is 78% Hispanic and 19% Black.\n\nWatts native, former Jordan High School student and current USC student Genesis Cruz, saw environmental racism every day. Genesis Cruz: In like the streets of Watts, you\u2019ll see, like, there\u2019s just a lot of trash. There\u2019s a lack of all those, like, resources that we will see in affluent communities.\n\nNear her high school, there is a metal recycling plant that plagues the area with loud noise, hazardous fumes and metal scraps Cruz: Going to high school all four years, I was able to see them in work. I was able hear them and I was able to smell. Jordan High School is right on Alameda Street and all down Alameda streets like an industrial corridor. There was actually a program manager at Jordan, where arriving at the parking lot, her tire was popped due to a metal that flew over to the parking lot.\n\nThis mistreatment is seen in other parts of L.A. Cynthia Babich is the Founder and Director of Del Amo Action Committee. She has encountered similar neglect to Watts. Babich: The redlining that\u2019s happened here is still in effect and until you really flip that and are willing to get rid of the industrial zones that are embedded right next to communities, the change is going to be slow.\n\nTo end this injustice, Wong is leading the Committee\u2019s campaign to stop dumping in Watts. Illegal dumping is caused when anyone, often contractors or truck drivers, leave waste behind to avoid fees. Wong: It\u2019s an eyesore to the community. The trash, it attracts like fleas, it attracts bugs, it attracts rodents that, you know, carry all of these different diseases. It not only affects, like, the environment, but also mental health, physical health. It\u2019s just like malign neglect.\n\nHealth disparities are seen by research done by Ph.D. student in the UCLA Environment and Sustainability program, Danielle Hoague. She\u2019s the research director for the Better Watts nonprofit and led research to see how environmental racism is harming the Watts communities\u2019 health. Danielle Hoague: For people who have existing heart problems, pulmonary problems they can be subject to hospitalizations. We\u2019ve heard reports of people developing cancers as a result of being exposed to these volatile organic chemicals.\n\nMany of Cruz\u2019s friends and family members have asthma and other disabilities. Cruz: A teacher in Jordan High School, she developed bronchitis and many other, like, respiratory issues. And when she went to the doctor, you know, she was asked questions, like, okay, where do you work? Or how is the environment you live in? The doctor told her like, okay, well, you working next to that recycling plant is likely the reason why you developed these issues.\n\nTo prevent further harm, Hoague hopes the research can grant access to funding for lead pipe replacement through Biden\u2019s 2021 infrastructure bill. Hoague: \u201cBy doing this study it can be a framework for other communities that have aging pipes to assess the danger of those pipes in their communities and hopefully apply for funding.\u201d\n\nUltimately, there is a necessity to have better living conditions in Watts. Danielle Hoague: \u201cEveryone deserves clean water and peace of mind that they\u2019re living in a safe environment\u201d\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m AC Shick.\n```"}

(Photo by Jillian Gorman)\n\nBy Jillian Gorman\nMarch 01, 2024 at 2:04 pm PST\n\nIn January, an immersive installation at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County \u2013 Sacrifice Zone: Los Angeles \u2013 addressed some of the city\u2019s most pressing environmental justice issues. Oil wells, battery recycling plants, and other industrial sites have caused environmental degradation that carry serious health implications for residents. These challenges tend to fall most heavily on lower-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where toxins and contaminants are present at higher concentrations, according to a 2023 report. These areas are named \u201csacrifice zones.\u201d\n\nThe installation, co-created by Michael Bodie, a filmmaker and USC professor, and Paula Cizmar, a playwright and USC professor, combined art, performance, informative writing and accounts from community members to tell the story of life in the sacrifice zone. The creative team worked with local partners like activist Hugo Garcia, People Not Pozos, which is Spanish for \u201cpeople not oil wells,\u201d and Esperanza Community Housing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily our story to tell, right? So, the partnerships were really key,\u201d Bodie said, \u201cWe saw ourselves more as kind of providing the space for the narratives to emerge.\n\nThe immersive experience not only featured informational displays but also video interviews and an animated 3D topographical map of Los Angeles. Upon entering the space, visitors were \u201cdropped\u201d into the sacrifice zone.\n\n\u201cProviding an immersive experience is something that\u2019s different than what we can get at home, than what we can get while we\u2019re looking at our phone in every other space,\u201d Bodie said.\n\nVideo components featured interviews with Angelenos and environmental advocates who shared their stories and health challenges. The installation merged art, science and social justice.\n\nThe production designer, Sibyl Wickersheimer, said she wanted visitors to have the impression of being \u201ca fly on the wall and witnessing this family\u2019s life within the sacrifice zone.\u201d\n\nAt the center of the room stood an abstract house. The acrid scent of sulfur infused with fruity perfume pervaded the space, mimicking the smells produced by oil refineries. Actors brought the story to life by portraying a family faced with living in heavily polluted neighborhoods.\n\nThe theater can help viewers \u201cunderstand the story of somebody first hand like you\u2019re reading a book or getting the depth of what it might mean to live in a place rather than just the information posted on a wall,\u201d Wickersheimer said.\n\nThe installation highlighted common health outcomes from living among environmental contaminants, including frequent nosebleeds, asthma, and increased school absences for impacted youth.\n\nEd Avol, a professor of Clinical Preventive Medicine at the USC Keck School of Medicine provided insight into the state of air pollution in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe air has dramatically improved here. That said, it is important to note that we are still in violation of federal air standards here in the basin,\u201d Avol said. \u201cThe impacts of air pollution are really almost endless in terms of thinking about our bodies\u2019 effects.\u201d\n\nPollution from oil drilling and freeway exhaust were the primary focus of the installation. Active and abandoned oil wells can be found in backyards, near schools, and in LA neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s as simple as making a phone call or sending an email to our elected representative to say\u2013we want this to change,\u201d Bodie said.\n\nAdditionally, some communities are close to major freeways like the I-710. Nicknamed the \u201cdiesel death zone,\u201d residents of such neighborhoods are more likely to experience adverse health effects impacting \u201cthe whole life spectrum,\u201d said Avol.\n\nThese health impacts are \u201cdisproportionately imposed upon people of color or people of lower socioeconomic means.\u201d\n\nAccording to Avol, the impacts often extend beyond respiratory and cardiovascular function. Air pollution can also indirectly contribute to other health consequences including dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, obesity and diabetes.\n\nThe installation highlighted local advocacy groups and community partners working to create safer and healthier neighborhoods.\n\nBodie noted that this issue is important for everybody because \u201cthere are no real boundaries\u201d to the impacts of industrial pollution.\n\nAs L.A. adopts new initiatives to promote sustainable initiatives and renewable energy, significant work still needs to be done to protect the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents from pollution.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy James Bao March 01, 2024 at 2:01 pm PST\n\nUSC men\u2019s basketball couldn\u2019t extend its win streak from last week\u2019s crosstown victory over UCLA, falling 75-72 to the Washington State Cougars in a dramatic fashion on Thursday night. Riding the momentum from their win over the Bruins, which snapped the Trojans\u2019 longest road losing streak in nine years, USC stormed out the gates in a rare leap day game with an 8-2 run.\n\nThe team\u2019s offense has improved in recent games after freshman guard Isaish Collier\u2019s return from injury. USC has averaged 74.3 points over their last six contests, an improvement from their previous six-game stretch, during which they averaged only 62.5 points. Collier has posted just under 18 points per game since returning from a hand injury that sidelined him for four weeks at the beginning of January.\n\nBut the former No. 1 recruit turned on the jets right away, scoring eight of the first 12 Trojan points. The freshman would end up with a game-high 24 points, shooting 53% from the field.\n\nNonetheless, USC was well aware they were entering a Cougars\u2019 den, as Washington State entered the game boasting a near-perfect 13-1 record at home this season. But the Trojans held the historical advantage, leading the all-time series 82-50 and winning 13 of their last 15 matchups.\n\nUSC\u2019s success this season has hinged on shooting. The team is 10-4 when posting a higher shooting percentage than their opponents and just 1-12 in the opposite case. But the trend didn\u2019t hold true in the Trojans\u2019 loss, where the team shot a strong 52% from the field to Washington State\u2019s 50%.\n\nOn top of a good shooting percentage, the Trojans racked up eight steals in the first half alone, already surpassing their season average of 7.1 steals per game. Washington State averaged 10.5 turnovers per game heading into the matchup and committed a staggering 14 turnovers.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t entirely surprising though, as the USC starting lineup included two former Pac-12 All-Defensive Team players in junior guard Kobe Johnson and senior forward Joshua Morgan. The Trojans effectively slowed down Washington State\u2019s star senior forward Isaac Jones, who had previously torched USC for 26 points in a win earlier this season. Jones was held to six points on just three shot attempts.\n\n\u201cWe had a really good game plan on Isaac Jones,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cHe dominated us in the first game with 26 [points] and 11 [rebounds]. He only had six points and four turnovers [this game], we did an outstanding job as a team.\u201d\n\nUSC dominated inside the paint and finished with a 26-point advantage in that category, outscoring Washington State 46 to 20 around the rim. However, the focus on interior defense came with a cost and the Trojans paid it in full.\n\nDespite outplaying Washington State per many statistics, the Cougars\u2019 10 3-pointers compared to USC\u2019s two changed the math. The Cougars snatched their first lead with just two minutes remaining behind a three from freshman guard Isaiah Watts on the right wing. Watts\u2019 go-ahead three came as the Cougars had found their hot hand late in the second half. Watts shot 5-for-6 from deep and totaled a career-high 18 points. Senior forward Andrej Jakimovski also hit four 3-pointers on 40% accuracy.\n\n\u201cWe mixed up man and zone, left the 3-point shooters [open],\u201d Enfield said. \u201cToo many threes in the second half, two guys made nine [3-pointers] between the two of them, and there has to be a sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nFifth-year guard Boogie Ellis had a quiet night after leading the Trojans in scoring the previous week. The veteran only managed to contribute five points and committed a critical turnover in the final minute.\n\n\u201cThe margin of error at this level is very small and every possession counts,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cYou have to defend, you have to rebound and you have to execute. We made some mistakes, and then we got passive at the wrong time in the last minute and a half.\u201d\n\nFreshman guard Bronny James and senior forward Joshua Morgan struggled with personal fouls. James picked up three fouls in just four minutes of play, which limited him to only 12 total minutes of action. Morgan committed four personal fouls himself and played just 18 minutes.\n\nThe lead yo-yoed back and forth after Washington State\u2019s late 3-point barrage, and the Cougars managed to hold onto their slim advantage down the stretch. USC had two 3-point shot attempts to tie the game at 75-75 but missed both, suffering yet another defeat.\n\nThe Trojans are now 11-17 overall and 5-12 in the Pac-12. They will play their final road game of the season against Washington on Saturday at 1 p.m.\n```"}

California is currently conducting advance voting by mail and at local election offices, polling sites and ballot drop boxes. You can find those nearest to you with the California Secretary of State\u2019s Vote California tool.\n\nWhile Feb. 20 was the last day to register to vote, California allows for conditional same-day voter registration through Election Day. Polling places and vote centers will be open statewide from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on March 5. Voters registering that day will have their ballots processed and counted upon verification of their registration. California does not require voter identification, except for some first-time voters.\n\nThe most accessible way for Trojans to vote is by dropping off their ballot or completing same-day registration and voting at the USC Village Vote Center. There are three other voting centers near USC\u2019s campus for early and Election-Day voting. For those living off-campus, find your closest voting center on the California Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the ballot:\n\nNational and Statewide Presidential Primary Election\n\nIf you are registered to vote in any of the following parties, your ballot will include candidates solely from that party: Democratic Party, Republican Party, Green Party, Libertarian Party, Peace and Freedom Party and the American Independent Party. If you are registered under \u201cNo Party Preference,\u201d you must request a ballot with candidates from the Democratic Party, Libertarian Party or American Independent Party.\n\nCandidates for the Democratic Party include President Joe Biden, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson. The Republican Party ballot will have former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Notable third-party candidates include environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and professor and progressive activist Cornel West both running as independents, as well as doctor and activist Jill Stein running for the Green Party.\n\nU.S. Senate Elections\n\nThe U.S. Senate elections have a bit of an odd look this year due to the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s untimely passing while in office. There are two separate elections with the same candidates, and voters can choose their preferences in each. The first is to elect a senator to serve the rest of Feinstein\u2019s term, which ends in January 2025 and is currently held by Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s appointee, Laphonza Butler. The second is to elect a U.S. senator to serve a full 6 year term beginning in January 2025.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s top two primary system means that the two candidates \u2014 from any party \u2014 who receive the most votes will move on to the general election. Former Dodger Steve Garvey is running as a Republican, and Reps. Barbara Lee, Katie Porter and Adam Schiff are running as Democrats.\n\nProp 1\n\nBallots will include one statewide measure, Proposition 1, which would fund a $6.4 billion bond to vastly expand California\u2019s mental health and substance abuse treatment infrastructure. It stipulates that $4.4 billion of the funding would go towards building 10,000 in-patient and residential treatment beds throughout the state. The remainder of the funds would be used for permanent supportive housing, half of which would be specifically set aside for veterans experiencing mental illness or addiction. The measure would also require counties to prioritize housing for houseless individuals when allocating their existing mental health funding.\n\nState District-specific races\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Seats\n\nAll of California\u2019s 52 U.S. House of Representatives seats are up for grabs in this primary election and like the Senate race, the top two candidates in each district will move on to the general election in November. If you are a California resident registered in a district other than USC\u2019s, you can find specifics about your candidate and race details here.\n\nUSC\u2019s campus and surrounding area fall under U.S. House District 37. Four candidates are running for the seat, including the incumbent Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Democrat and U.S. Navy veteran Adam J. Carmichael, working-class advocate John Thompson Parker for the Green Party and train mechanic Juan Ray running under no party.\n\nState Legislature Seats\n\nHalf of the California State Senate districts also have elections this year, not including USC\u2019s State Senate District 28. Other district race information can be found here. All seats in the California State Assembly are up for election, and you can find your district using your address here.\n\nUSC\u2019s South Los Angeles Assembly District 57 has been held by Democratic Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer for more than a decade, who will not be running for re-election due to term limits. Five Democratic newcomers are running for the seat with no Republican challengers. The candidates are: small-business owner and U.S. Marine Corp veteran Efran Martinez who ran a competitive race against Jones-Sawer in 2020, educator and community organizer Sade Elhawary, community organizer and nonprofit director Greg Akili, educator and neighborhood council member Dulce Vasquez and Tara Perry, reparations advocate and founder of Black Pact.\n\nL.A. County Elections\n\nParty-nominated\n\nThere are two party-nominated races and three nonpartisan races on the ballot for L.A. County. Party-nominated offices include Democratic and Republican Party County Central Committee seats and Peace and Freedom Party Central Committee seats, which are elected by Assembly Districts. There are 10 candidates running for the Democratic County Council in USC\u2019s 57th District, but there is not a Republican Party race in our district this year.\n\nNonpartisan\n\nNonpartisan races follow the top-two runoff system, with the exception that if one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, they automatically win the race. Nonpartisan offices on the ballot are County Supervisor for the 2nd, 4th and 5th Districts, District Attorney and Superior Court Judge. USC belongs to L.A. County District 2, in which four candidates are running to be on the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. Incumbent Holly J. Mitchell has held the seat since 2020, and prior to that she served as a state senator. Challengers include education consultant Daphne D. Bradford, businessman Clint D. Carlton and nonprofit executive Katrina Williams.\n\nThere are 11 candidates running against incumbent L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gasc\u00f3n, who has been criticized to be easy-on-crime. The top-two candidates from this race will compete for the seat in November.\n\nAn extensive number of candidates are running for Superior Court Judge seats, but LAist has put together a comprehensive guide to help curious voters.\n\nL.A. City Elections\n\nCity Council\n\nL.A. City Council seats are open in Districts 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14. USC\u2019s campus resides in City Council District 9, represented by Councilmember Curren D. Price Jr., but closely borders surrounding districts 1 and 8, so be sure to check where your address falls. Of those, only District 8 has a race, in which three candidates are running: incumbent Marqueece Harris-Dawson, real estate broker Jahan Epps and union community organizer Cliff Smith.\n\nBoard of Education\n\nFour L.A. Board of Education seats are on the ballot in Board of Education Districts 1, 3, 5 and 7. USC resides in District 1, with some housing east of campus falling in District 5. Seven candidates are running for USC\u2019s District 1, and four candidates are running for the neighboring District 5.\n\nCitizen Ballot Measure HLA\n\nThe final election on the ballot for L.A. City will be citizen ballot Measure HLA, the City Mobility Plan Streets Improvement Measures initiative. This measure will force the city to implement its Mobility Plan approved in 2015, on which little progress has been made. The measure requires a majority vote of 50% + 1 to pass. Supporters of the measure point to its value in terms of street safety, while opposition alleges that the measure would cause chaos for Angelenos on the roads.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy nikki thomas February 29, 2024 at 11:02 pm PST\n\nDespite losing star freshman guard JuJu Watkins in the fourth quarter, No. 7 USC women\u2019s basketball found a way to pull out a 95-93 win at Arizona in double overtime on Thursday. The Trojans defeated the Wildcats 81-64 in their last matchup on February 12, but both teams have been at the top of their games since then. Coming into Thursday\u2019s game, Arizona was on a four-game winning streak \u2014 including a win over then-No. 3 Stanford \u2014 and USC maintained its top-10 spot in the national rankings, even with a loss to Utah on February 25.\n\nThe first quarter started slow, with Arizona eventually grinding out an early 11-7 lead. USC graduate guard Kayla Padilla picked up her second foul about halfway through the quarter, rattling the Trojan lineup. But strong interior play from junior center Rayah Marshall kept USC in the game; Marshall led the team with seven points in the first quarter. Watkins and senior guard Kayla Williams also contributed crucial buckets as the Trojans fell into a rhythm, hitting four straight shots to end the quarter up 16-14 on the Wildcats.\n\nThe two teams continued to struggle on offense through the second, and shots didn\u2019t come easy for the Trojans, especially for Watkins. Behind Arizona\u2019s pressure, Watkins shot only 1-for-5 in the period. Marshall put in some impressive defensive work on the block, but she similarly struggled to generate offense. The offensive support of graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis was the Trojans\u2019 saving grace in the second quarter, as the Wildcats only led 33-31 at the break.\n\nFreshman guard Skylar Jones and redshirt junior forward Isis Beh led the charge for Arizona with a combined 19 points in the first half. Strong post play from Marshall kept USC in the game early in the third quarter, but the Wildcats remained unfazed and seemed to always have an answer for the Trojan offense. Then, halfway through the third, a switch clicked. Both offenses picked up and shots started to fall. A layup from Jones tied her then-career high of 13 points and put Arizona up 47-41 with over two minutes left in the period.\n\nThe teams traded threes, and a three-point play gave Arizona an eight-point lead with 1:45 to go in the third. Watkins still wasn\u2019t looking like herself offensively at this point, but she managed eight points for the quarter. The bigger story for the Trojan star was foul trouble; she picked up her fourth foul with 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter and didn\u2019t return until just under seven minutes to go in the fourth.\n\nArizona took advantage of Watkins\u2019 absence and mounted an offensive barrage that would give the Wildcats their largest lead of the night, 58-48. The teams traded buckets as the minutes slipped by, and Trojans were losing their chance to sweep the Wildcats this season. But Marshall and Watkins wouldn\u2019t go away, and USC brought the game back within five with just under four minutes to play.\n\nBut just when USC\u2019s offense seemed to finally come together, Watkins was called for her fifth foul with 1:41 remaining. Watkins finished with 20 points on 7-for-19 shooting and added eight rebounds. She averages 28.2 points per game for USC, No. 2 in the nation.\n\nDespite losing Watkins in clutch time, the Trojans rallied back. USC kept fouling to stay alive, and, although the Wildcats were perfect from the line in the fourth, Davis had answers. She scored on three consecutive possessions for the Trojans to bring them back within three down 71-68. Graduate forward McKenzie Forbes assisted on all three shots.\n\nDavis drew a foul on Beh on her last bucket in regulation and went to the line with 16 seconds to go. She rebounded her own miss and found Padilla outside for an open three. Padilla didn\u2019t connect, but Davis rebounded that miss and found the sharpshooter again; Padilla sank that second-chance triple with seven seconds left to tie the game at 71 and send the teams into overtime.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s selfless in an unbelievable way, but doesn\u2019t lack confidence at all,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said about Padilla. \u201cTo be able to play her role, and not hunt shots all the time, but hit the big ones when we need it, says a lot about her.\u201d\n\nForbes and Davis helped to lead the charge in overtime for the Trojans, who couldn\u2019t shake the Wildcats. The teams recorded seven lead changes through the period. Freshman guard Jada Williams took over in overtime for Arizona, and USC missed a few key free throws that stopped it from putting the Wildcats away.\n\nMarshall made two clutch free throws with 25 seconds left to put USC up 85-83, but she was almost immediately called for the foul on Williams on the other end. The Trojans were unable to counter and headed to double overtime tied at 85.\n\nThe second overtime was more of the same, with both teams battling for the lead as more and more players fouled out of the game. Padilla, who shot 5-for-7 from 3-point land for the game, dropped another clutch shot to start creating distance. Marshall\u2019s strong post presence and timely free throws from Forbes kept the Trojans ahead, as Arizona went scoreless for over 2:30.\n\nThe game came down to the wire, but USC ultimately pulled out the 95-93 win after Williams\u2019 last-second heave hit back iron. This is only the second time this season that Watkins, who is leading the Pac-12 in scoring, has been outscored by a teammate. Against Arizona, it was Marshall who led the Trojans to victory with 26 points and 11 rebounds. It was her ninth double-double of the year.\n\nBut, it was a team effort through and through: Davis contributed 16 points, nine rebounds and four steals, while Padilla added 15 points. Forbes finished with nine points and five assists, several of which came in key moments for the Trojans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a character win, and I do think it\u2019s defining,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be an elite, elite team nationally. We know that that\u2019s about more than just one or two players.\u201d\n\nIt was a pivotal victory for USC, who will compete in the Pac-12 tournament from March 6-10 in Las Vegas. All five of the team\u2019s losses this season have come at the hands of conference rivals, but the Trojans have won eight of their last nine games. USC travels to Tempe to take on Arizona State on Saturday at 11 a.m to wrap up the regular season.\n```"}

(Photo by Marcus Heatherly)\n\nBy Will Simonds February 29, 2024 at 10:32 pm PST\n\nThursday night\u2019s Crosstown Showdown at Galen Center was a battle of fresh talent against veteran experience. On one hand, No. 4 UCLA is the reigning NCAA champion and returned most of its top contributors from last year\u2019s squad. On the other side, USC\u2019s four NCAA titles in program history can\u2019t compete with the Bruins\u2019 20, but the No. 11 Trojans appear to be headed in the right direction.\n\nUSC entered 2024 with the best recruiting class in the nation, according to VolleyballMag.com, in addition to the No. 1 player in the freshman class, middle blocker Wesley Smith. But the Bruins\u2019 proven pedigree was more than enough to take down their upcoming rivals, as UCLA (13-4, 4-1 MPSF) swept USC (10-7, 2-3 MPSF): 25-20, 25-10, 25-14.\n\nIn fact, although the score appears lopsided, it seemed that the Bruins\u2019 mental advantage was the deciding factor. \u201cThe biggest thing is that our attitude and effort needed to change,\u201d USC redshirt junior opposite hitter Jack Deuchar said. \u201cWe executed on our game plan, but the attitude and effort were not there tonight.\u201d\n\nEarly in the first set, USC responded to a 6-1 UCLA run to keep things close throughout the remainder of the frame. Though the visitors still held a narrow lead, the young Trojan squad didn\u2019t appear to be significantly outmatched. Trailing just 22-20, USC still looked like it could potentially steal the opening set as the Bruins called a timeout. But that was the closest the match ever got.\n\nThree straight points out of that timeout clinched the first set for UCLA, and perhaps just as importantly, established momentum against the home crowd on Figueroa Street. And USC never found a way to swing it in the other direction.\n\n\u201cWe started pretty good,\u201d USC head coach Jeff Nygaard said. \u201cThey made a number of really high-level plays. We didn\u2019t recover.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were thinking three, four points in the past. It just snowballed from there, and we couldn\u2019t get out of our own way,\u201d Deuchar added.\n\nIn what ended up being a bloodbath of a second set, UCLA outhit USC by a ridiculous .824 to -.111 margin, as the Trojans committed more errors than kills. Add on a near-perfect 10-for-11 on sideouts \u2014 USC couldn\u2019t get in any kind of rhythm.\n\nIn particular, USC\u2019s leading scorer, sophomore outside hitter Dillon Klein, had nothing going on offense. Klein entered the night hitting .345 and averaging over 3.5 kills per set, but he managed just four kills and five errors on 22 total attacks against a stout UCLA defense.\n\nAcross the net, the Bruins had five starters with at least six kills apiece, and each of them hit at least .400. In the end, UCLA had 39 kills to just seven errors, while USC managed only a 21-to-17 ratio.\n\nThe third set wasn\u2019t quite as one-sided, but UCLA kept a firm grasp on the match \u2014 a sweep felt like a foregone conclusion from the start of the final frame.\n\nNygaard, once a two-time NCAA title winner in Westwood himself, pointed out the Bruins\u2019 depth, physicality and experience as reasons for their dominance. \u201cThey\u2019ve been at a high level for quite some time,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cIn the sense of iron sharpening iron, their daily practices are probably pretty grinding.\u201d\n\nSo, Nygaard has a clear benchmark across Los Angeles demonstrating where he wants his talented, but youthful, Trojan program to reach. But in the meantime, USC needs a mental reset ahead of another matchup with the Bruins on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWill the game plan be the same? Probably not. We\u2019ll probably make some tweaks,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cI think it\u2019s got a lot more to do with our mentality than this chess piece or that chess piece.\u201d\n\nFirst serve for the second half of this home-and-home crosstown series is set for 5 p.m. on Saturday, this time over at Pauley Pavilion.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/29/nfl-combine-day-1-takeaways/", "response": "```\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Defensive linemen, linebackers and edge rushers took the field today at Lucas Oil Stadium for the first day of the 2024 NFL Combine\u2019s on-field drills. The day was filled with both impressive and underwhelming performances, some more expected than others. Let\u2019s take a look at today\u2019s best and worst performances and what they mean for draft boards across the league.\n\nDAY 1 MVP: DT Braden Fiske, Florida State, 6-3 5/8, 292 lbs\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll catch some flack for not putting Dallas Turner here, but Fiske led the defensive tackle group in every drill he took part in\u2014what more can you expect? The Florida State product knew he ran a good 40, saying \u201coh yeah\u201d into the camera as he crossed the finish line after a 4.78 time that was 0.07 seconds faster than the next-fastest DT.\n\nFiske\u2019s measurements weren\u2019t the greatest\u2014292 pounds is a bit light for an interior lineman in some schemes, and his 31-inch arms are a bit shorter than teams may hope for at the position. But he more than made up for it with a 33.5-inch vertical and a 9-foot-9 broad jump, and showed great hustle in his field drills.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: EDGE Dallas Turner, Alabama, 6-2 3/4, 247\nThere\u2019s no other way to put it: Turner had himself a day. He posted the second-fastest 40 time of the day at 4.46, the best vertical at an insane 40.5 inches and tied for the second-best broad jump with 10-foot-7. It\u2019s hard to say Turner\u2019s stock \u201crose\u201d today\u2014he was already considered the best EDGE in his class by many before stepping onto the field in Indianapolis. But among some disappointing performances from other top pass rushers, Turner seized the opportunity to confirm he is the athlete he has been talked up to be, making him a strong candidate to be the first defender off the board come April.\n\nBIGGEST RISER: Penn State EDGE Chop Robinson, 6-2 7/8, 254\nChop Robinson is an extremely fun prospect to watch on film\u2014he\u2019s an explosive player with a wicked get-off who can rush the pass while staying honest in the run game. But that athleticism didn\u2019t transfer to the stat sheet, as Robinson only recorded four sacks last season at Penn State. Sure, he had some injury issues and only played in seven games\u2014but nonetheless, you\u2019d expect a bit more production out of a player with his traits. For this reason, the Combine was extremely important to Robinson\u2019s draft stock, and an opportunity he certainly made the most of. His 4.48-second 40-yard dash was second among EDGE rushers and fourth overall on the day, and his 10-foot-8 vertical tied with Jalyx Hunt and Edefuan Ulofoshio for the longest of day one.\n\nRobinson also looked extremely fluid in field drills, turning quickly around the bags and showing solid body control to stop and change directions. Questions about his production may linger, but NFL scouts today confirmed Chop is every bit the athlete they see on film, likely making teams for whom his numbers were a concern more willing to spend a first-round pick on the former Nittany Lion.\n\nMOST UNDERWHELMING: Washington EDGE Bralen Trice, 6-3 1/2, 245\nTrice\u2019s 4.72-second 40-yard dash was rather unimpressive compared to other top pass rushers in his class, especially considering it was the only drill he recorded. That time puts him firmly below other top EDGE prospects like Turner, Robinson, Jared Verse (4.58) and Chris Braswell (4.60). Add that to the fact that Trice was listed at 274 pounds for Washington last year...yet only weighed in at 245. You\u2019d like to expect more speed from him at that weight, and the two numbers combined will likely bring pause to teams looking at Trice as a first or second-round EDGE.\n\nOTHER NOTABLE PERFORMANCES\nN.C. State LB Payton Wilson (6-4, 233) clocked the fastest 40 of the day at 4.43, and tied for the fastest 10-yard split at 1.54. Texas DT Byron Murphy II (6-0 1/2, 297) solidified his place as a first-round prospect with a 4.87-second 40 and looked smooth for his size in field drills. Florida State LB Kalen DeLoach (5-11 1/2, 210) impressed with a 4.47-second 40, the second-fastest of the position group. His 30.5-inch vertical, however, was the second-worst among all linebackers, and his measurables are certainly quite small for an NFL box linebacker.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Angie Canonizado)\n\nBy Taryn Snyder February 29, 2024 at 8:58 pm PST\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know the sounds of Sierra Sky before, you will now with the release of her debut single \u201cBroken\u201d earlier in February. Aside from her budding music career, Sky is currently a senior in the USC Thornton School of Music studying music industry. Through a unique blend of singer-songwriter ballads, pop and R&B, Sky details her experience learning to walk away from a toxic relationship.\n\nBeing her musical debut, \u201cBroken\u201d has introduced her artistic brand through a combination of authenticity and vulnerability. Partnering alongside USC student-run music label 840 West, Sky has created a set of visuals to complement this tone. While she has only just started releasing music, Sky hinted at two more upcoming songs that would make up a trilogy of songs that take listeners through the different sides of a relationship.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with Sky about her inspirations, creative processes and artistic branding on her debut single \u201cBroken.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The full transcript has been edited for clarity. This episode was recorded before the release of \u201cBroken.\u201d\n\nSky: Hi, my name is Sierra Sky. I am a music industry major at USC and I\u2019m a senior and I was born and raised in Los Angeles. So I\u2019ve been singing and songwriting and playing piano since first grade and I think what really got me into music was the songwriting aspect because it really helped me understand my kind of place in the world and express myself and work through emotions that I was dealing with.\n\nSky: I\u2019ve always kind of grown up in a musical household. My stepdad was an artist, my older sister was an artist. And they were really big inspirations to me and also, my dad kind of had this really sick tradition growing up where he would always take us to concerts and expose us to new music.\n\nSky: You know how some people are really big Swifties? I always say Frank Ocean is my Taylor Swift. I absolutely love Frank Ocean. I discovered his music, I think in ninth grade of high school and I\u2019ve just been listening to him ever since.\n\nSky: I think growing up in L.A. is really dope for an artist because L.A. is such a creative hub for music and entertainment. So it definitely gave me a lot of opportunities because a lot of producers are here. A lot of musicians are here. We have incredible venues in L.A. as well, so it\u2019s definitely helped me in my career with the convenience and just creativity and opportunities.\n\nSky: Honestly, one of my best memories throughout my musical career has been this year. I got my first residency at a place called the Georgian Hotel in Santa Monica. They have this really dope speakeasy underground and it\u2019s very private. There\u2019s no phones allowed, no videotaping, no photography. It\u2019s a really intimate, cool, old, sexy jazz bar space.\n\nSky: I think a big challenge for me was when I was little, I\u2019ve always loved singing and songwriting and playing piano, but I was the shyest kid. I had the worst stage fright. I literally never sang in front of anybody I think until like 11th or 12th grade of high school.\n\nSky: I got involved with 840 West in the spring of 2023. I was walking through the career fair and I found them and I was like, \u2018Whoa, USC has a student-run record label? This is so cool. I totally want to be involved.\u2019\n\nSky: \u201cBroken\u201d is kind of a ballad about being heartbroken and learning how to walk away from a toxic relationship. And I love R&B music, so Damon Elliott, who produced the song, really did a great job of blending some elements of R&B into it and matching my rhythms and my vibe.\n\nSky: I think that something that I struggle with, especially in relationships, is honesty and loyalty are my two biggest things and the opening lines of the song is \u2018I can\u2019t sleep with your secrets on my mind / You say you tell the truth to me / So why does it feel like a lie?\u2019 \n\nSky: The next steps \u2013 I\u2019m currently working with a producer named Nick Rosen. He is the dopest guy ever. And we\u2019re kind of working on songs that I wrote around that time as well and producing them. And I have a song \u2013 I have two songs that kind of align with this song that are hopefully going to come out sometime soon in the near future. They\u2019re called \u201cForgive and Forget\u201d and \u201cAngel in the Darkness.\u201d\n\nSky: The highest dream goal that I have, and I know this is incredibly hard to achieve, but I would die to perform in a stadium.

Starting Monday, March 4, the USC Village Trader Joe\u2019s will be closing one hour earlier, moving from 10:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. And while the change may be undesirable to some, it will put the USC Village shop hours on the same timeframe as most other stores in the area, with nearly every Trader Joe\u2019s in the Los Angeles area already closed at 9:00 p.m.\n\nSome Trojans believe that it shouldn\u2019t matter that the USC location is an outlier, noting that college students often have schedules that don\u2019t always align with regular store hours due to late-night classes and other extracurricular activities. \u201cSometimes people only have time to get groceries late at night when they are done with everything,\u201d said Madelyn Sequeira, a junior studying international relations. \u201cAlso, if you want a late-night snack, it\u2019s not like there is anything around here you could get.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has been to Trader Joe\u2019s in the 9 p.m. hour has experienced firsthand the late-night rush of students to the Village to do a bit of last-minute shopping \u2014 whether that\u2019s picking up a few quick meal ingredients or doing a larger grocery store haul. But students aren\u2019t completely out of luck. The Target, right next door, will still be open until 10:00 p.m., though it doesn\u2019t hit the same as Trader Joe\u2019s exclusive products. Not to mention, Trader Joe\u2019s is one of the most affordable grocery stores with top-notch quality food, according to the LA Times. And though there is a Ralphs nearby, less than a mile away from campus that\u2019s open until 1 a.m., some students said they just don\u2019t feel comfortable traveling all the way there \u2014 especially at night.\n\n\u201cIt can be unsafe for me to go walk to Ralphs to my apartment just to get food, and it\u2019s really convenient that I have Trader Joes right next me,\u201d said Thea Millam, a junior studying biochemistry. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient. I can go buy dinner and not have to pay the expense of UberEats with it.\u201d\n\nWhile some students disagree with the decision, others said they don\u2019t see it as too much of an inconvenience and sympathize with the employees. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal. I don\u2019t live near Trader Joe\u2019s, so I only go during the school day. I do most of my grocery shopping at Ralphs,\u201d said Stella Dziedzic, a junior studying biochemistry.\u201dAnd if people want to get home early from work, go for it. I wouldn\u2019t want to get home at 11:00 p.m.\u201d\n\nBut others said that if Trader Joe\u2019s wanted to make the day easier for its employees, it should have changed their work hours instead of closing time. \u201cCustomers are hungry, we all depend on you, I say put in the work,\u201d said Darius Kashani, a sophomore studying philosophy, politics and economics. \u201cAdd a new shift so people can do their late-night shopping and keep the business open.\u201d\n\nThough an hour might not seem like that big of a change, it\u2019s one that Trojans, and the greater South Los Angeles community, will have to get used to.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Karen Hudson for USC Today)\n\nBy Delaney Polocheck and Lily Coleman\nFebruary 29, 2024 at 6:03 pm PST\n\nFrom LAX to the Beverly Hills Hotel to the Shrine Auditorium, USC Architecture alumnus Paul Revere Williams played a part in some of Los Angeles\u2019 most iconic buildings. He designed more than 2,000 private homes, including ones for Golden Age stars Frank Sinatra and Cary Grant, plus I Love Lucy\u2019s Lucille Ball. But behind the facade of glitz and glamour, Williams faced countless obstacles as a Black man in segregated America. Many of the homes he designed were built in neighborhoods with segregated covenants that made it illegal for Black people to live there, and he would tour buildings with his hands behind his back to avoid someone refusing to shake hands with him.\n\nNoelle Osborne is a junior studying architecture at USC. She shares what Paul Revere Williams\u2019 impact means to her as an aspiring Black architect.\n\nNOELLE OSBORNE: Currently, there are less than 2 percent Black architects in America, and even smaller than that, there\u2019s less than 1 percent of woman architects in America. He was the first African American to be introduced into the Architecture Institute. So, his work really has driven me to just kind of keep pushing and being a part of the space, because it\u2019s not being taken up by Black people. His message of how he can create an impact in the space is, is very important, because it\u2019s so shocking to this day, that there\u2019s still just not enough representation.\n\nOsborne is not the only USC student who has been inspired by Williams. Asia Gaines is a sophomore also studying architecture, and she additionally explained what Williams\u2019 role in the architecture field means to her.\n\nASIA GAINES: How I think about architecture, my career, I definitely, know and appreciate his contribution to the field is. It makes my integration into the field a lot better. I also identify as African American, and him being a minority, and being a trailblazer in the industry that\u2019s predominantly been occupied by cis white men is, yeah, like, I understand and appreciate what he\u2019s done.\n\nWilliams\u2019 ability to power past these challenges earned him a spot in history - he was the first Black American to be admitted to the American Institute of Architects, its first African American fellow, and ultimately its first Black American Gold Medalist, which was awarded to him 37 years after his death.\n\nOsborne described how she is inspired by Williams\u2019 dedication to his work, specifically when he learned to draw his designs upside down because clients would refuse to sit next to him in meetings.\n\nOSBORNE: One cool thing about him, he used to draw backwards for his clients. He would draw so that they would be able to see it, but he wasn\u2019t fully seeing the picture. So, he was doing it in the reverse way to make his clients feel comfortable. And I think myself, I have before in the past, tried to make other people feel good in their space. But now I\u2019m having my own voice. I\u2019m having my own drive. I\u2019m doing what I think is best, that I know is best for myself. Because at the end of the day, I will always have to work a little bit harder than everybody else to just get my foot in the door. So, him opening up that area has been amazing.\n\nWilliams\u2019 legacy has had a lasting impact on not only Los Angeles but the world. This October, Williams and his legacy were honored at the Beverly Hills Hotel with the official launch of the Paul R. Williams Scholarship & Education Fund.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Pickle Coleman.\n```"}

Hip-hop! Today is leap day! Leap day has a scientific purpose. It takes the Earth about 365 and a quarter days to completely revolve around the sun. Every four years, the extra quarters of a day add up to once full day. Hence, we have leap day and leap year.\n\nFor those with a birthday on leap day...\n\nIsabella Friedelli: Honestly, it kind of feels extra special when it finally does come around. USC biochemistry sophomore Isabella Friedelli was born on leap day in 2004, so technically, she\u2019s five years old.\n\nIsabella Friedelli: \u201cMy parents have always done a really good job of making sure that every birthday feels special. Just making sure that I get a regular celebration like everybody else. But it\u2019s definitely really fun to be here when the leap year does come around. Just because everybody\u2019s low key more excited than I am.\u201d\n\nLow key? Not everybody... Some who wait four years to celebrate their birthday go all out when February 29th comes around, like a friend of computer science sophomore Emma Yu.\n\nEmma Yu: \u201cIt was like a huge kind of festival because it\u2019s so long. Usually, annually, he would celebrate a little bit like have a dinner on February the 28th. But then, every four years, he\u2019s going to gather a lot of people and it was a big dinner and all those karaoke sort of things.\u201d\n\nFor those who don\u2019t have a birthday or friend\u2019s birthday on leap day, there are other ways to enjoy the extra day. Restaurants and bakeries are giving out leap day deals across the country. If you want to leap into some donuts... Krispy Kreme is offering a dozen donuts for $2.29 with a purchase of a regular priced dozen. For leap day birthdays like Friedelli\u2019s, a dozen donuts is free at Krispy Kreme. Also, you can get your crunch wrap on at Taco Bell for $2.29. Chipotle is offering free guac to rewards members, and Wendy\u2019s offered free Cinnabon Pull-Aparts to customers during breakfast hours.\n\nWith the last leap year being 2020, and leap day occurring just weeks before the outbreak of the Coronavirus in the U.S., students like pre-med freshman Chichi Makasi are hopeful that this leap year brings good fortune along with it.\n\nChichi Makasi: \u201cI feel like just an extra day in the year to do anything that you want to do is good luck.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s to this leap year bringing better tidings to us than the last! \n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Roman Marchetti.\n```"}

She recounts that she has enjoyed the events held on campus and is excited to see more events for the Black community in the future. Since this event was focused on empowering excellence, Smith spoke about what Black excellence means to her.\n\nBridget Smith: Black excellence means that you really dig deep and do the best you can all the time. Never allowing others to dictate what you can and can\u2019t do. And allow yourself to be open. Allow yourself to be able to make mistakes, because that is truly how you grow. Then that shows real excellence that shows you coming out to being the person you are meant to be.\n\nNickey Woods is the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at the USC Gould School of Law. She graduated with a doctorate from USC in 2015 and now has a son enrolled at the university! Woods has been able to see the Black community of faculty and students evolve over time.\n\nNickey Woods: There\u2019s more activities and involvement and ways for the Black community at USC, to engage with one another. But not just engaged with each other, but just to bring in other folks too, that may not be a part of the African American diaspora to learn more about Black culture.

She helps host weekly events for Black students on campus to connect with one another. BSA hosts workshops on academic, professional, and social developments.\n\nANN MARIE EASY: I definitely believe it feels like a safe space for black students as it\u2019s a space for them to come and like, talk to each other, just meet new people, build community and also just let their voices to be heard.\n\nHajer Jama is a junior studying Business Administration and the Vice President of the East-African Student Assembly.

Starting Tuesday, faculty and students were allowed onsite to move into their offices and begin in-person classes in the new facility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this for decades, as a school, so it\u2019s a really big milestone moment,\u201d Sara Fousekis, the SDA Associate Dean for Advancement, said. Since the university broke ground nearly two years ago, Fousekis said the swift turnaround from construction to opening was \u201cpretty remarkable.\u201d\n\nThe new building will act as a \u201chome base\u201d to all SDA students who have been jumping between Grace Ford Salvatori Hall and the Physical Education building while the new building was under construction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to have a serious conversation about death when the volleyball team is screaming down the hall and you can hear everything that they\u2019re saying,\u201d Keilah Mora, a freshman BFA stage management major, said. \u201cSo it\u2019s nice to kind of finally be in a new quiet space.\u201d\n\nAlong with classrooms and offices, the new building is home to various resources for SDA students, such as the Professional Development Center, which will provide students with resum\u00e9 overviews and a self-taping room that students can book for auditions.\n\nThe Sparks Center for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which is named after distinguished SDA professor and associate dean of equity, diversity and inclusion Anita Dashiell-Sparks and her husband, SDA alum and current Board of Councilors member Anthony Sparks, will act as a community space and hub for collaboration.\n\nFor those missing the Massman Theatre, the two new theater performance spaces \u2014 the Stop Gap and Sanctuary \u2014 aim to recreate a space for student-led productions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little sad I won\u2019t really get to experience the space too much before I graduate,\u201d senior Caroline Goldenberg, a Theatre major with an Acting emphasis, said, \u201cBut I am really excited about the new theater. ... SDA is kind of in need of some new performance spaces.\u201d\n\nThe Stop Gap houses a smaller cabaret-style theater where students can have late night shows and improv performances, and the Sanctuary is a larger state-of-the-art space for larger stage acts. Goldenberg said she would be acting in her final show for SDA at the Sanctuary, one of the first few shows in the new performance space starting April 12th.\n\n\u201cIt was time to move out of that building,\u201d Fousekis said. \u201cIt really had a lot of wear and tear over the years, but the history we\u2019re trying to bring with us.\u201d\n\nThe tradition of the signature wall from the Massman Theatre will be replicated in the student lounge of the new building, and a kiosk-like tool will allow students in independent student productions (ISP) to add on their signatures at the end of a show. ISPs will also have a place to rehearse with a designated classroom rehearsal hall in the Pollitt Family Rehearsal Hall.\n\nThe Scene Dock Theatre, located in the corner of campus, will now act entirely as a space for ISPs. General education classes will be held inside the Sanctuary at SDA, with the goal of connecting students with interdisciplinary classes.\n\n\u201cWe want the minors in dramatic arts to feel like this is truly their home,\u201d Fousekis said. \u201cWe want to have that engineering or Marshall student taking a Gen Ed class in our building and have a chance to experience the school of Dramatic Arts and this creative space.\u201d\n\nStudents will also have access to the Audio and Design Labs and Integrated Media Labs, classroom spaces where students can learn media integration and explore artificial intelligence and dramatic arts. Voice practice rooms will also be available to students for rehearsal practice.\n\nThe historic building which the SDA building now stands within was originally designed by C. Raimon Johnson in the 1930s, and has been named to the National Register of Historic Places by the Los Angeles Conservancy. The stained glass windows from the original building were maintained and restored with the help of former Roski dean, Ruth Weisberg.\n\n\u201cThis mix between new and old...was actually perfect for sort of everything we stand for,\u201d Fousekis said.\n\nThe Board of Counselors, alumni and parents all played a role in fundraising the new building with many alumni opting to leave their names and a personal message on pavers and benches surrounding the building\u2019s outdoor courtyard.\n\nThe official ribbon-cutting ceremony will take place March 28th.

(Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nBy Krystle Ehara and Zainab Malik\nFebruary 29, 2024 at 5:09 pm PST\n\nAt a Sacramento press conference on Wednesday, Assemblymember Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) announced he was bringing back legislation to prevent California\u2019s private universities and colleges from receiving state funding if they give preferential treatment to legacy applicants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re told that opportunities are available to anyone who works hard and gets good grades. But that\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Ting said in a news release on his website. \u201cThere\u2019s a side door for students who come from wealth or have connections.\u201d\n\nLegacy admissions, or the preferential treatment toward applicants with connections to alumni or donors of the school, is a longstanding practice, particularly in private universities. While there have been attempts to decrease the impacts of the practice in the past, Ting said this bill was a response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last June striking down race-based affirmative action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to close the door on privilege-based admissions, or legacy admissions as elite private universities call them,\u201d Assemblymember Kevin McCarty (D-Sacramento), joint author of the bill, said in the same press release. \u201cLegacy admissions are based on privilege and wealth, and diminish the work non-legacy admits do to get into college.\u201d\n\nThe bill moves to prevent private universities from receiving Cal Grant program funding if they give preferential treatment to legacy applicants, potentially putting USC at risk of losing millions in state financial aid funding. In the 2021-22 school year alone, USC students received $26.6 million from Cal Grant financial aid, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cTaking money away from people who need it, and can\u2019t already afford school, is outrageous and does not address the root of the issue,\u201d said Alejandra Reyes-Perez, a sophomore studying economics and data science who receives financial aid from Cal Grant.\n\nPublic universities in the state do not consider legacy status in admissions decisions, and at least two private colleges have ended the practice. Pomona College hasn\u2019t considered legacy status \u201cfor many years,\u201d and Occidental College ended the practice last year following the Supreme Court ruling. However, many of the state\u2019s larger private institutions still engage in the practice.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Stanford admitted 287 students with donor or alumni ties, USC admitted 1,740 students, Santa Clara University admitted 1,133 students, and Pepperdine admitted 86 students, according to Ting\u2019s office.\n\nPatrick Nguyen, a first-generation advocate in USG and a sophomore studying biopharmaceutical science, said that while he believes there needs to be reform when it comes to legacy admissions, he did not feel it should come at the expense of student financial aid.\n\n\u201cCutting funding off actually creates more of a wealth gap for students where the rich who can pay the tuition will be able to attend the school, whereas students who don\u2019t have the Cal Grant won\u2019t have access to USC because of the lack of financial aid,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of the way the flaw is.\u201d\n\nWhile Nguyen said there\u2019s no perfect fix, noting that wealthy students with connections to the university will always be able to signal that to an admissions officer, he said the goal should be to allow more non-legacy students a real chance at attendance.\n\n\u201cThe best way to sort of provide the most resources is to allow first-gen students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds to come to a school like USC,\u201d Nguyen said.\n\nIn an email to Annenberg Media, USC said it had not taken a position on the legislation.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/29/why-california-is-voting-twice-for-their-senator/", "response": "```\nThe California primary senate race is raising this question amongst voters: Why are we voting twice on the same ballot? The first election on the ballot will determine the next full-term California junior senator of the United States, a position that follows the constitutional 6-year term, which is set to end on Jan. 3, 2031. The second election on the ballot, deemed a special election, will fill the position now occupied by Laphonza Butler, who assumed the seat of late Senator Dianne Feinstein in late 2023 via appointment.\n\nCalifornia uses \u201ctop two\u201d open primaries for the election process. The two candidates who get the most votes in the primary for both elections will advance to the November general election. If the candidates come from different political parties (one Democratic and one Republican), the Democratic candidate is favored to obtain the seat. The winner of the special general election in November will take over from Butler immediately and serve for two months until Jan. 3, 2025. After that term expires, the winner of the regular general election will take over. It is likely the same candidate will win both races.\n\nFeinstein became California\u2019s first female U.S. senator in 1992, a position in which she was reelected five times. In her last election in 2018, Feinstein obtained the seat for its whole term, which is set to end Jan. 3, 2025. California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Butler on Oct. 1, 2023, to serve out the remainder of Feinstein\u2019s term until the next election. Butler announced later that month that she would not run for the full-term seat, making the senate election the first fully open race in California with no incumbent since 2016.\n\n\u201cHaving elected officials turnout from certain positions, just ends up creating this kind of rat race and ladder climbing, where people are more focused on what position they\u2019re going to do next and less focus on doing a good job in the position they\u2019re currently in,\u201d said Liam Rinehart, a member of the USC Political Union. \u201cPeople are actually dropping their house seat to pursue a senatorial seat when they could just continue doing good work in the house.\u201d\n\nRep. Katie Porter is one of the candidates for the California senate election. Since 2023, she has served California\u2019s 47th congressional district, having previously held the same position for the 45th congressional district from 2019 to 2023. Notably, she made history as the inaugural Democratic representative for the 45th district, which covers significant areas of south-central Orange County including Irvine, Tustin and Lake Forest. Following redistricting, Porter was re-elected in 2022 within the newly redrawn 47th congressional district. Since the third and final televised senate debate, Porter has been fighting to remain in the race. The debate on  Feb. 20, 2024 included a heated debate with her fellow Democrat Adam Schiff surrounding child care and affordable housing. Schiff is on the ballot twice for the full six-year term and remainder of Sen. Feinstein\u2019s term.\n\nKamy Akhavan, the executive director at the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future believes that Rep. Porter\u2019s decision to run makes sense. \u201cIt is common to look at a senator\u2019s resum\u00e9 and see that before they were a senator, they were in the U.S. House of Representatives, and before that they were in their state assembly or state legislature, and before that they were maybe a mayor or city council member,\u201d said Akhavan. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s disappointing that people are leveraging their experience to have a greater impact.\u201d\n\nAccording to Emerson College Polling\u2019s  survey  earlier today, the current standings for public support are as follows: Rep. Adam Schiff maintains the lead with 28%, Republican Steve Garvey with 20%, Rep. Katie Porter with 17%, and Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee with 8%. This does not include the 17% of undecided voters. The stakes remain high for candidates as undecided voters are demanding for the appointee of the remaining term to quickly address pressing issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paying less attention to their long term platform and more on their practices as well as how likely they are to vote on the issues that we\u2019re facing today with Gaza and Ukraine,\u201d said Keji Jurkin, a junior studying international relations and non-governmental organizations and social change. \u201cWhoever is going to be on the ballot for the next six years, I want to see a very strong platform.\u201d\n\nAs we head into the primary election date this upcoming Tuesday, March 5, candidates are taking their last strides to potentially win the race. Election guides for voters are available on the California Secretary of State  website . Polling locations will be open from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.\n```"}

Woodson conceived of Negro History Week to teach Black history in schools. Today, in the final week of what is now known as Black History Month, the same books that have been deployed for decades to share the storied and contested history of Black people in America are being pulled from shelves. According to the American Library Association, book bans have been on a rapid incline, with 2023 being a record year. Most of these challenges were attempts to censor multiple titles at the same time. This \u201cbatch ban\u201d method poses questions about what challengers are really trying to sweep off library shelves, as most were written by or are about LGBTQ+ people, Black people, indigenous people and people of color.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has taken legislative action to protect students\u2019 access to books that reflect diverse communities. On Sept. 25, he signed a law prohibiting California school boards from banning textbooks and library materials.\n\nAs we close out Black History Month and eagerly await spring break, here are five must-reads about Black America to take with you wherever you go.\n\n1. \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d by Toni Morrison\nIn Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison\u2019s first book, 11-year-old Black girl Pecola Breedlove aches to be as beloved as blue-eyed children in America. So much so that she prays for her eyes to be blue. This is a story about love, beauty and what acrid soil can do to flowers that yearn to grow. According to PEN America, this book was the second most banned book of the 2022-2023 school year with 29 bans.\n\n2. \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates\nA writer who learned his craft by reading the monuments of writers such as Morrison, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a daring and honest reproach of a nation reeling from police brutality against Black men and women. Daring in his intimate confession of what it\u2019s like to father a 15-year-old Black boy in the United States, and honest in his thoughtful evaluation of landmark historical events that have shaped whiteness \u2014 and therefore Blackness \u2014 in this country. To understand where we are going, we must grapple with the past; this is required reading.\n\n3. \u201cBeloved\u201d by Toni Morrison\nPublished in 1987, \u201cBeloved\u201d is one of the most popular, and most perplexing, of Morrison\u2019s books. Another one of Morrison\u2019s works sits on this list precisely because of that: her spiraling, alluring sentences reel you in one place and spit you back out another, making you wonder what exactly you just read. So anchor yourself with this one, maybe with a thick blanket and your feet firmly rooted on the ground, because working through this book is entirely worth the effort. A bonafide ghost story, this book is an evocative portrait of a mother named Sethe and a house named Sweet Home, both haunted by the perils of love as a Black woman in America.\n\n4. \u201cThe Fire Next Time\u201d by James Baldwin\nJames Baldwin\u2019s final works were published two years before his death in 1987, but his words remain as relevant as ever. In an essay entitled \u201cThe Doom and Glory of Knowing Who You Are\u201d for Life Magazine in 1963, he wrote: \u201cYou think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.\u201d Baldwin\u2019s deep appreciation for the written word blooms through his sentences. Known for his lucid honesty and knack for the remarkably long sentence, \u201cThe Fire Next Time\u201d feels like a sermon on what it feels like to be Black and angry in the United States and a testament to the power of love to bridge all divides.\n\n5. \u201cHeavy: An American Memoir\u201d by Kiese Laymon\nWhere Baldwin writes to his nephew and Coates to his son, essayist Kiese Laymon pointedly writes to his mother. This book makes you feel like you are peering into the inner lives of a family with tightly bound secrets, but read closer and you will realize \u201cHeavy\u201d is one capsule of the Black Southern experience at large. Be sure to take your time with his chapter \u201cContraction,\u201d where Laymon reflects on the many book reports his mother assigned him that forged him into the writer he is today. It\u2019s also my personal favorite.\n```"}

It was the largest 4th-quarter comeback win by a LeBron-led team in his career, as they defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 116-112 in dramatic fashion. The win marked the Lakers\u2019 third victory in four games over the Clippers this season, capturing the season series for the purple and gold over their crosstown rivals, despite the Clippers\u2019 having the more successful regular season to date. It was also the first time in 20 years that the Lakers have come back from a 20-plus point deficit in the 4th quarter.\n\nDuring the 4th quarter, James singlehandedly outscored the whole Clippers roster by 19 to 16 and contributed five of his season-high seven threes during the quarter. He scored or assisted on 11 of the Lakers\u2019 final 13 baskets and finished with 34 points on 13-19 shooting for the night, pretty ridiculous for the oldest player in the NBA. All of the Lakers\u2019 starters eclipsed double digit points, with Anthony Davis being the second-highest contributor at 20 points. D\u2019Angelo Russell had 18 points while Rui Hachimura dropped 17 and Austin Reaves finished with 13. Every Lakers starter finished the game shooting above 50% from the field.\n\nThat being said, the Lakers bench didn\u2019t offer much on the night. Their reserves combined for a feeble 14 points. Cam Reddish played his first game since returning from an ankle injury that kept him out for 14 games and scored just 5 points in 20 minutes. Anthony Davis dominated the paint early on by scoring 12 points, but had to be taken out due to foul trouble. After that, Kawhi Leonard and James Harden fueled a massive Clippers\u2019 run, stepping up in Paul George\u2019s absence because of a sore left knee.\n\nThe Clippers had control for the entirety of the first half, as they had a comfortable 14-point lead at halftime. The third quarter featured more of the same. The Lakers had a tough time stopping the Clippers from scoring and besides the starters, the Lakers couldn\u2019t find a basket from anybody else. The script flipped for the Lakers in that last period as LeBron was on a mission to shrink the Clippers\u2019 lead. James took most of the defensive responsibilities on Leonard during the period and shut him down, including clamping him on the Clippers\u2019 last shot of the game.\n\nThis matchup was the final crosstown rivalry game in which the Clippers were the home team in the Crypto.com Arena, as they\u2019ll head down the 110 freeway to Inglewood and play in the brand new Intuit Dome Arena next season, closing a chapter in the Hallway Series between the two teams. The Lakers remain in the ninth seed in the Western Conference, five and a half games back of the fourth-seed Clippers. The Lakers will now face a team on the opposite side of the standings of the Eastern Conference in the Washington Wizards at home on Thursday, Feb. 29 at 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

The Black and Gold continued their 100% record in home openers as they look to reach a third straight MLS playoff final.\n\nTheir home opener showed what to expect for the coming year, here\u2019s a breakdown. The headlines for the offseason were highlighted by captain Carlos Vela\u2019s absence from the team, with rumors of a potential transfer away or even retirement. An unresolved issue for the club since it stagnates the club\u2019s position to get reinforcements in the front line, leading to midfielder Bogusz playing striker; an unfamiliar position.\n\nWith injuries and no alternative striker, Bogusz took matters into his own hands and scored from the edge of the box with a curler into the far post. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see Tommy \u00c1ngel tonight, who\u2019s a nine as well, [he is] catching up on some fitness from the offseason. We didn\u2019t see David Martinez tonight, he\u2019s a very talented player, more coming from the flanks, but definitely can play in the middle as well. So we have multiple options. Mati was the right choice for tonight\u2019s game,\u201d LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo said to concerns for the striker position.\n\nEven with issues, the team pressed on. New signings Eduard Atuesta and World Cup winner Hugo Lloris played pivotal roles in the victory. Lloris saved all of the shots other than the penalty. Atuesta ran the midfield and showed many qualities as to why he was brought back from Brazil. \u201cI want to give my experience and intensity to my teammates. [I hope] to get my other teammates to do that,\u201d Atuesta said.\n\nThe fans showed up for the home opener and cheered on throughout the match. The 3252 unveiled a tifo of a skeleton holding a skateboard stating \u201cYou Can\u2019t Bring Us Down.\u201d The 3252 supporters section started the game off with traditional songs and drums, along with smoke dispensers of the team\u2019s colors.\n\nThe team lost many players in the past transfer window. Only 49.5% of total minutes played by last season\u2019s roster are still in L.A. World Cup winning center back Georgio Chiellini was given a ceremonial goodbye before the game, acting also as a falconer before the game. Additional losses like goalie Maxime Crepeau and potentially Carlos Vela will be deep holes to fill.\n\nAs of now, the team should still make a deep playoff run, but it will be very difficult to win a second MLS cup in three years. Lack of experience, and most importantly depth, it will force manager Cherundolo to be careful with minutes. He must be careful with which competitions he will prioritize. The club played the most matches any MLS team had played in a single season last year, something that can only be done with adequate depth.\n\nLAFC will play Real Salt Lake on March 2 in Utah. Black and Gold alumni and MLS cup champion Cristian Arango will lead RSL. Los Angeles will then return home for their second home game of the season against Sporting Kansas City on March 9 before traveling to Norwich City legend Teemu Pukki-led Minnesota United on the 16th.\n```"}

Driven by her youthful curiosity, Mendelsohn remembers asking her grandmother, \u201cwho are these people?\u201d Her grandmother replied that they are her family. Confused about not having met them, Mendelsohn\u2019s grandmother explained, \u201cthey\u2019re dead, a bad man killed them,\u201d which Mendelsohn said was her introduction to the Holocaust that killed the majority of her ancestors.\n\nMendelsohn, a precocious young girl, said she was confused as to why her grandmother never did anything to stop the mass murder of her relatives. But, as she grew older, she learned that those efforts would have been nearly impossible. She has now worked as a political volunteer for over 20 years, where she is driven to be the one who does something. \u201cI feel like I have to do whatever I can and hope it works,\u201d she said.\n\nLeah Mendelsohn's grandparents. (Photo courtesy of Leah Mendelsohn)\n\nMendelsohn is a Democrat who volunteered as a fundraiser for President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign, and is now helping garner support for Biden\u2019s ticket for this year\u2019s election. But, she said she dedicates the most time and effort towards Rep. Adam Schiff, whose campaign she\u2019s been volunteering for since the beginning of her political involvement 25 years ago. Schiff, a Democrat from Burbank, is running for the highly-contested U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Dianne Feinstein.\n\nThe top four challengers \u2014 Schiff, Rep. Katie Porter from Irvine, Rep. Barbara Lee from Oakland and former baseball star Steve Garvey \u2014 are battling to be in the top two which would advance their campaign to the general election in November. Mendelsohn cares strongly about women\u2019s reproductive rights, preserving American democracy, the environment and Israel \u2014 an issue that her family\u2019s past has strongly influenced. Mendelsohn considers herself a strong supporter of Israel. She feels strongly about supporting Democratic candidates who she considers pro-Israel, like Biden and Schiff. \u201cI think Adam and I are somewhat in agreement about Israel,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Holocaust experience of my grandmother affects a lot of things, the way I view things.\u201d\n\nShe believes in a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is unhappy with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but she added, \u201cthere is a place for us to go. I do want Israel to stay as a Jewish state.\u201d Right now, Mendelsohn wishes more young voters would understand her belief that Biden is better for both Israelis and Palestinians. She explained that she believes voting for third-party presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is essentially throwing away a vote for Biden and giving a vote to Trump. She added she also cares about supporting democracy and is fearful of former President Donald Trump\u2019s threats of dictatorship. She fears that Trump wants to be a dictator, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, and is appalled by the \u201ccult-like\u201d personality that follows him. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to help Israel if we don\u2019t have a democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to have a democracy for everything else that matters.\u201d\n\nLeah Mendelsohn (left) with Adam Schiff (middle) at a campaign event in Westlake Village. (Photo courtesy of Leah Mendelsohn)\n\nShe recalled watching Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial in 1999 and described it as a distressing experience for a Democrat, witnessing what she perceived as a Republican attempt to take down the president in Congress. Motivated by this, she sought to support the election of more Democrats to Congress and reached out to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which directed her to Schiff\u2019s campaign. At that time, Schiff was running for Congress in the Pasadena and Burbank area. Despite living in Santa Monica and not being in Schiff\u2019s district, Mendelsohn was less concerned about the geographical details and more focused on the political battle. She found it particularly compelling because Schiff was running against James Rogan, the lead impeachment manager in the case against Bill Clinton. Mendelsohn noted the irony in Schiff eventually becoming the lead impeachment manager in the 2019 proceedings against Trump, despite her initial lack of familiarity with him. \u201cI met him, I liked him, I did an event for him at home,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody liked him.\u201d\n\nSince then, she has continued to organize fundraising events for Schiff, sometimes raising more than $160,000. Before becoming a political fundraiser, Mendelsohn attended UCLA and Loyola Law School, where she took night classes at night due to a young marriage. She practiced law for about 5 years, but shifted to politics due to her belief that the legal system serves few people effectively. Typically, Mendelsohn spends up to 5 hours of unpaid time over a couple of weeks preparing for an event. She is involved in raising funds, hosting and co-hosting events and organizing the campaign event details.\n\nShe now has Jewish-Chinese grandchildren who she said have experienced double levels of prejudice \u2014 antisemitism and Asian hate. Mendelsohn continues to fight to ensure that her grandchildren and future generations live peacefully. She feels confident about the upcoming Super Tuesday election and sees a bright future for Schiff. \u201cI\u2019d like him to eventually run for president,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how much I adore him.\u201d\n```"}

Gauff won 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 against Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1, but the umpire didn\u2019t make it easy on her.\n\nShe got into a heated exchange with an umpire during her match, because her first serve at deuce was called out by the umpire after Pliskova returned it into the net. Gauff successfully challenged the call, as a replay showed the serve was in. However, the umpire still didn\u2019t give her the point. The umpire argued that he called out before Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 returned it, so the point should be replayed because it\u2019s his fault. Gauff was firm in her claim that he called it out after she returned it. After reviewing the clip, Gauff was right, but the umpire remained stubborn and wouldn\u2019t give the point.\n\nAfter several minutes of arguing with each other, Gauff requested to speak to the tournament supervisor, something that\u2019s well within her right as a competitor. The umpire refused to let her speak to the supervisor and wouldn\u2019t let her talk without constantly interrupting her. Gauff had to replay the point instead of being awarded a point that was rightfully hers. This set a fire under Gauff as she ended up winning her serve and ended Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 11-match winning streak.\n\nAfter the incident, Gauff\u2019s father took to Instagram to defend and praise his daughter. \u201cThe scene is so familiar to women and women of color pleading and fighting to be treated fairly and respectfully by their male counterparts,\u201d he said. Gauff\u2019s father is absolutely right. This isn\u2019t the first time she has gone viral for an incident like this, and she isn\u2019t the first player who has had to stand up for herself. Serena Williams has gone viral for similar interactions. Women, especially Black women in tennis, always have to stand up for themselves. Tennis is a predominantly white sport, so it unfortunately isn\u2019t shocking that Gauff is familiar with having to advocate for herself.\n\nIn the past, when Williams dealt with the same issues, however, she didn\u2019t have as much support from the media or from the fans. It\u2019s refreshing to see so many people come to the support of Gauff and call out the umpire. Gauff advocating for herself inspires future generations of athletes, especially female athletes that they can advocate for themselves. She continues to impress the world with not only her phenomenal playing, but her poise and maturity for a 19-year-old. I\u2019m excited to follow along Gauff\u2019s career as she continues to break barriers in and out of tennis. \u201cGameChangeHERS\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}

Well, today, we have it.\n\nTime is always ticking, but what happens when we have an extra 24 hours?\n\nBy Julia Zara February 29, 2024 at 11:47 am PST\n\nDoes anyone have an iron? It appears we\u2019ve encountered a wrinkle in time. February 29 is a leap day. And no, leap day is not dedicated to playing leap frog or rewatching Maddie Ziegler\u2019s ballerina feature film, \u201cLeap!\u201d A leap day is tacked onto the end of February, giving the year 366 days instead of the normal 365.\n\nAccording to Vah\u00e9 Peroomian, the director of undergraduate studies at the USC Department of Physics and Astronomy, a leap day isn\u2019t a ripple in the space-time continuum. It\u2019s a deliberate calculation that occurs every four years.\n\n\u201cIf you measure how long it takes for the earth to go around the sun, the number you come up with is 365 days and a quarter,\u201d Peroomian said, with the quarter being about six hours. Since six hours is shaved off the calendar during a normal year, those six hours get added back every four years for a total of 24 hours \u2014 meaning, an entire extra day.\n\nI\u2019m no Google Calendar fanatic, but I can\u2019t help but acknowledge that I operate on a tight schedule. My timeline often leaves me racing against the clock, and being a fiercely competitive person, a race means I\u2019m running fast to win. Need to meet? I\u2019ve got you penciled in for 4 p.m. Can\u2019t decide on an outfit? Just call while I\u2019m on lunch at 1:30 p.m. He said what? Dinner and debrief at 9 p.m.\n\nI used to prize my flexibility as a strength, but now I fear I\u2019m simply pliable, like a piece of rubber getting bent out of shape. I should\u2019ve known better than to test time. It\u2019s only when I run out of it that I realize I\u2019m giving it away.\n\nAvery Goodman, my executive producer for Annenberg Media\u2019s social media news show, The Rundown, views her time like I do. \u201cEvery week is a battle with how I can manage my time,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m always grasping for more. Maybe that\u2019s my fault because I overbooked myself.\u201d\n\nEspecially at a work-hard, play-hard university like USC, Goodman, like many students, finds herself lamenting: \u201cI wish I had more time.\u201d\n\nTechnically, this year she will. So, what will Goodman do with the extra 24 hours of her senior year? \u201cOh, I\u2019m probably going to do more homework and prep for spring break,\u201d she said. For her, leap day is just another Thursday.\n\nBill Rockas, a junior studying cinema and media studies and a fellow Rundown writer, concurred. He says he\u2019ll \u201cget some work done early\u201d and watch \u201cDune 2.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a long movie, so that\u2019ll be, what, like, 21-22 hours left [in the extra day]?\u201d he joked.\n\nBesides sitting through the nearly three-hour-long film, Rockas said he\u2019ll also apply to jobs. Sophia Perez, a senior political science major, said she might go to the beach since she doesn\u2019t have class. Meanwhile, if Peroomian didn\u2019t have two classes to teach, he says he\u2019d do his \u201cfavorite thing:\u201d hiking.\n\nVictoria Mora, a senior business administration major, has two midterms and a full day of classes, so she\u2019s not quite sure what she\u2019s doing. On the other hand, Taylor Brown, a full-time volunteer at the Church of Latter Day Saints who stopped me on a stroll through campus, knew exactly where one could find him on the extra day.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be doing the same thing I\u2019m doing today,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have you been doing today?\u201d I asked. \u201cI studied my scriptures today,\u201d he replied. \u201cI studied Chinese today, and then I\u2019m just out on campus talking to people about Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nI reframe my question for his fellow volunteer, Noah Hadley: \u201cWithout the bounds of space and responsibility, let\u2019s say you have 24 hours, a blank slate. Would you shake it up and do something different?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I want to be here, too,\u201d Hadley said, \u201cjust because what we\u2019re doing right now is very special, trying to help people. This is, I think, the point of our time, trying to help people, make people happier. For us to actually land on a year with a leap year is kind of special, right? That\u2019s one extra day we get to do it.\u201d\n\nEven if they could go anywhere in the world for 24 hours, Brown and Hadley would stay right where they are. This grounded appreciation for the present is striking, especially given that the last time a leap year rolled around was 2020, which proved that a lot can happen in four years\u2019 time.\n\n2020 saw the world standing at the cusp of the coronavirus pandemic, right before we delved inward into locked houses, logged in to Zoom classrooms and pulled masks over dry noses. It saw the death of George Floyd. It saw the stock market crash, wildfires blaze through four million acres of California land and Joe Biden defeat incumbent president Donald Trump.\n\nIt saw communities break apart and come together, families separate and reunite, beloved hobbies come and go. 2020 even tricked me into trying whipped coffee. The world is still reckoning with the unprecedented events of the last leap year, which leaves me wondering if we should capitalize on the day while we have it.\n\nBut like Brown and Hadley, Perez thinks that the value in having an extra day doesn\u2019t stem from doing something new. It\u2019s appreciating what\u2019s right in front of her. \u201cLooking back to four years, that COVID year has just made me so much more grateful for this specific experience. Even just the simple things like this, right now,\u201d she said, gesturing to the plaid picnic blanket she shared with Mora in Founder\u2019s Park.\n\n\u201cEvery millionaire or billionaire ever, at the end of their life and of their careers, has never said they wish they had more money or fame, but they wish they had more time with people they love, and so that\u2019s what I would spend my day doing. Just spending it with people I love,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s four years, I forget how much has gone by, how quick it felt,\u201d Mora added. \u201cIt almost makes you a little bit scared and a little, like, nauseating knowing that the next time it [leap day] happens, these [next] four years will feel even quicker. It is a blessing to be able to say that,\u201d she said.\n\nGoodman shared the same sentiment, saying, \u201cOne more day means I\u2019m less close to graduation than I thought I was. In the next four years, I don\u2019t know where I will be, but I\u2019m happy with where I\u2019ve come since 2020. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m even happier where I will be in 2028.\u201d\n\nOut in the universe, there\u2019s an endless stream of possibilities. Sometimes, I wonder if I could do more good if I reach into the cosmos with a wave of a hand, peer into our realities and tug on every timeline.\n\nIn four years\u2019 time, I want to see what\u2019s in store for Goodman, Rockas and Peroomian. Where will Perez and Mora be? Will they meet up every leap year like they promised? How about Brown? Hadley? Myself? The country? Earth? What about that caterpillar my roommate found in her strawberries this week \u2014 will it turn into a butterfly? And the @uscmissedconnection from three years ago that I never discovered, will they still be in love with me? Will the unknown student who got my dream job be my future boss?\n\nHeck, what will happen to the speck of a star that twinkles above my apartment in the dark? My interminable web of questions runs constantly, so I turned to my younger brother \u2014 a literalist \u2014 for resounding clarity.\n\nWhen I asked what he plans to do with his extra day, he responded, \u201cProbably the same thing I\u2019d do without it.\u201d\n\nHonestly, he seems to be on the right track. I went into my leap day eve excursion believing that people would complain, like I had, that having one more day simply isn\u2019t enough time to finish the deed, to make the move, to do whatever it is that\u2019s left on the list.\n\nBut Peroomian says that humans measure time with the idea that it\u2019s never truly lost or gained: \u201cTime can\u2019t be reversed. Time can\u2019t be created or destroyed,\u201d he said.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, in today\u2019s culture of hustle and burnout, people constantly yearn for \u201cmore time,\u201d which astronomically doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s no use in wondering about the unknown, the next move, the big plan.\n\nRockas said, life \u201cis a continuum of permanent things that happen, and you can\u2019t rewrite the record.\u201d\n\nAll I\u2019ve ever wanted to do is zoom out, but today, I think it\u2019s time to zoom in. All we ever have is the here and now. It may be leap day, but I\u2019m not leaping anywhere.\n\nAs Rockas puts it, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t like more life?\u201d\n```"}

The Boston Bruins have been among the top teams for the whole year, the Florida Panthers are coming off a Stanley Cup Finals appearance, the Toronto Maple Leafs are recently coming off a seven-game win streak and the Detroit Red Wings have won six straight. Even the Tampa Bay Lightning, who are amid a down year, occupy a wild card spot.\n\nThe Panthers and Bruins have a heated history. On top of defeating Boston in the 1996 playoffs (the year of Florida\u2019s first Stanley Cup appearance), the wild-card Panthers stunned Presidents\u2019 Trophy-winning Boston in seven games en route to earning their second Wales Trophy in franchise history last season. Despite losing in the finals, the red-hot Panthers are back this year and better than before.\n\nComing off a four-game skid in mid-January, Florida is 12-2-0 in its last 14 games. The Bruins, like Florida, are also elite this year. However, a 3-2-5 record in their last 10 games \u2014 including a current three-game slide \u2014 has left both teams even atop the division at 82 points.\n\nOne thing the Bruins and Panthers have in common is elite goaltending tandems. Boston\u2019s Jeremy Swayman and Linus Ullmark have split time fairly consistently, with each nearing 20 wins on the season. Recently, though, the pair have had games they\u2019d certainly like to have back. The Bruins have been blowing leads lately, and Swayman and Ullmark combined for a .904 save percentage and a 2.91 goals against average in February. That isn\u2019t terrible, but it certainly isn\u2019t enough to win close games.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Sergei Bobrovsky has dominated in the crease for Florida. He\u2019s top three in wins (29), and top five in both save percentage (.916) and goals against average (2.35) in the NHL. While he\u2019s been the Panthers\u2019 main option, Anthony Stolarz has provided some quality starts as well. The duo hasn\u2019t allowed more than two goals in their last 14 games, a franchise record.\n\nAmid a rough stretch, expect Boston to be a big spender come the March 8 trade deadline. The team could certainly benefit from acquiring a forward to bolster their top six, especially on the power play. Winger David Pastrnak is putting together an electric season, tallying 85 points thus far, and he could use some extra help. Bruins president Cam Neely has also indicated that another defenseman is desired.\n\nFlorida should be a buyer too, in theory, but it doesn\u2019t hold a first-round draft pick until 2026, making it low on tradable assets. Nonetheless, the Panthers should be able to add some depth to lighten the load from star forwards Sam Reinhart and Matthew Tkachuk. Florida\u2019s electric offense has generated a plus-52 goal differential, the best in the league.\n\nCritically, Boston has taken both head-to-head matchups, but the most recent was on November 22. The Panthers will look to win the two crucial games left on the calendar against the Bruins to further make their case for the Atlantic crown.\n\nLooking at the rest of the division, the Maple Leafs, Red Wings or Lightning all have a chance to take the Atlantic\u2019s third spot at this point. Detroit\u2019s six-game win streak has been led by its stout depth and a retro-looking Patrick Kane, who\u2019s on a nine-game point streak throughout every game in February. Toronto\u2019s seven-game win streak of its own was snapped by the Golden Knights in a 6-2 rout on Tuesday. With three skaters already eclipsing 70 points in William Nylander, Auston Matthews and Mitchell Marner, the Leafs will hope to avoid the wild card and stay in front of the Red Wings, who are just two points behind.\n\nTampa Bay\u2019s issue is consistency. The Lightning recently went on a three-game win streak including victories against top teams in the Bruins and Avalanche, but then proceeded to drop their next three with losses against the struggling Senators and Capitals. However, more than any squad in the NHL, Tampa Bay has Cup-winning experience. The Lightning are a team that might have issues in the regular season but are a completely different animal come playoff time. They\u2019ll need to strengthen their defense if they want to solidify a wild card spot at 69 points so far.\n\nWith varying levels of playoff experience, the Atlantic\u2019s top five teams could all very likely make the postseason. The Panthers and Bruins headline the Eastern Conference with their strong casts, but don\u2019t count out the Red Wings, Maple Leafs and Lightning, who will try to prove doubters wrong.\n\nWorry like it\u2019s 1996 in Winnipeg?\n\nCanada Life Centre, which has the lowest capacity out of all non-temporary arenas in NHL, resides in Winnipeg, the league\u2019s smallest market. Nonetheless, Jets fans have historically sold out the place and the team has been stable in the smaller city \u2014 well, this iteration of the Jets has at least. The NHL\u2019s original Winnipeg Jets packed their bags for Phoenix in 1996 after suffering intense financial problems. However, Winnipeg got another stab at an NHL franchise when the Atlanta Thrashers moved to the city in 2011, rebirthing the Jets name.\n\nThis season, Winnipeg has seen its season ticket numbers decline to just 9,500 with an average attendance of 13,140 fans per game. This comes at a time when the Jets are atop the Central Division and eyeing a deep playoff run. In a press conference Tuesday, Commissioner Gary Bettman said that Winnipeg is a strong NHL market and was assuring that ticket sales will reach previous heights, but he also bluntly urged fans to fill the arena again.\n\n\"This is a place where hockey matters.\"\n\nGary Bettman speaks about the importance of the Winnipeg Jets staying in Winnipeg.\n\nThe Jets likely won\u2019t move anytime soon, but low attendance figures are still alarming, especially for a contending team. The team saw its lowest non-pandemic crowd in franchise history (its second iteration) on October 24, hosting just 11,136 fans in a divisional bout with the Blues. The Jets will look to increase their support as the team prepares for a long road ahead. They\u2019ll hope that Bettman\u2019s presser \u2014 and decreasing fan engagement \u2014 won\u2019t distract them from keeping up their winning ways.\n\nArizona Coyotes: once a dark horse, now under a dark cloud\n\nEarlier this season, the Coyotes seemed like a potential playoff-caliber team in the Central. But now, Arizona has lost 13 straight games, which is nearing their embarrassing franchise record of 15. Not only are the Yotes dropping games repeatedly, but in seven of the streak\u2019s matches, they\u2019ve allowed five or more goals.\n\nOn top of the on-ice issues, relocation rumors are surging. Team ownership is yet to announce any concrete arena plans, and the time is ticking for the Coyotes to figure out where they\u2019ll be playing for the future. They currently play home games at Arizona State\u2019s 4,600-seat Mullett Arena.\n\nOn the bright side, Arizona currently has fifth-best odds of landing the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming draft. However, considering that the Coyotes were emerging as a dark-horse playoff team not long ago, this season has been an utter failure.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Robert Falconer/Netflix)\n\nBy Paige Shea February 28, 2024 at 9:02 pm PST\n\nMy favorite television show of all time, Nickelodeon\u2019s animated, ground-breaking \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender\u201d (ATLA) has been on a decades-long quest for the perfect live-action adaptation. Since the show\u2019s end in 2008, fans have followed the sequel series made by ATLA\u2019s creators, \u201cThe Legend of Korra,\u201d which aired from 2012-2014 on Nickelodeon. In between ATLA and \u201cThe Legend of Korra,\u201d prolific filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan created a live-action movie adaptation of the first season of ATLA in 2010, titled \u201cThe Last Airbender.\u201d The adaptation faced (a fully deserving) critical failure and caused drastic disappointment for fans around the world.\n\nThe 2010 film was harshly criticized for many reasons: the whitewashing of the cast in a very clearly Indigenous and Asian-influenced show, horrible plot adaptation and writing, poor special effects and the lazy condensing of 20 episodes of television into less than two hours, to name a few. While I was personally disappointed by \u201cThe Legend of Korra\u201d (I\u2019m sorry) and horrified at the 2010 live-action adaptation of the television series, the thought of yet another botched ATLA adaptation made my skin crawl. I was even more anxious when the show\u2019s creators \u2013 DiMartino and Konietzko \u2013 left the Netflix show due to \u201ccreative differences,\u201d leaving filmmaker Albert Kim, who did not have a role in the original ATLA series, as the sole showrunner.\n\nSince I was five I\u2019ve watched ATLA. I have always considered the show as the standard in terms of television due to its superior worldbuilding ability through the synthesis of cultures, beautifully written characters and masterful handling of incredibly mature themes for a children\u2019s show that still holds up after decades. While the show is primarily plot-driven, DiMartino and Konietzko took such care with each character, giving the viewer a deep sense of motives, backgrounds, goals and personalities, and bringing each character to a perfectly-balanced arc by the end of the series.\n\nATLA\u2019s tightly-constructed and beautifully woven script that allowed the time for dramatic plot points, comedic relief and beautiful character development has proven to be almost impossible to recreate. Going into the Netflix series, I knew that one of my biggest deal breakers would be the diminishing of these character transformations over the course of the series. This also meant that casting was also a high priority.\n\nTo prepare for my review of Netflix\u2019s ATLA adaptation, I rewatched all of the original show\u2019s first season \u2013 titled \u201cBook One.\u201d After burning the plot into my memory, I took a deep breath, put on a pair of sweatpants, let go of my dream of potentially working at Netflix one day and started to watch the new ATLA.\n\nLength and Pacing\n\nThe first thing that struck me was that the Netflix season was only eight episodes, whereas \u201cBook One\u201d in the Nickelodeon ATLA series was 20 episodes long with each episode lasting about 24 minutes, for eight hours of television. However, the Netflix series had eight episodes, each lasting about an hour, for a total of eight hours, just like the original series. I was immediately apprehensive; to me, it felt impossible to somehow condense the source material by more than half of the episodes and still remain faithful to the story. I knew that meant the pacing would probably be rushed.\n\nMy initial hunch was correct \u2013 some of the silly shenanigans that kept the Nickelodeon series so lighthearted were cut, as well as the thought-out backstory and exposition that never felt exposition-y. In the Nickelodeon series, the viewer does not learn about the genocide of the Air Nomads by the Fire Nation until a few episodes in, when Aang discovers that it happened. Additionally, Fire Lord Sozin\u2019s beginning of the war is only told through flashback narrations. The history and state of the ATLA world is slowly revealed to Aang, and by default, the audience, thus raising the stakes of the childrens\u2019 quest and the dramatic nature of these reveals higher.\n\nAnother collateral damage of the show\u2019s pacing was the characters\u2019 backstories; much of the characters\u2019 pasts were forced into the first few episodes. This had the effect of knowing too much about each character, leaving no sense of mystery into their motives or reasons for acting the way they do. In the season finale, Katara masters waterbending \u2014 a skill that takes decades of training in the ATLA world \u2014 in 20 minutes. What an incredibly lazy writing choice. Katara learning waterbending from Master Pakku of the Northern Water Tribe was a massive part of her original character development, and this expedited \u201cmastery\u201d feels severely less deserved.\n\nThe season also relies on a ticking time bomb in an attempt to justify a sped-up timeline; Aang has a \u201cvision\u201d of the Northern Water Tribe being attacked, and he, Sokka, and Katara race there to protect the water tribe. In the original show, Aang journeys to the North Pole to find a waterbending master that can also teach Katara, and the Fire Nation attacks the Northern Water Tribe because they realize that he needs to master water first. Without the small moments and filler episodes, the storyline becomes plot-driven rather than character-driven. We do not get a full grasp of the characters or their relationships with one another.\n\nExposition, Destroyer of Worlds\n\nMy mortal enemy, exposition. While I understand that exposition is necessary, the writers clearly felt as though they needed to explain everything that happened, its significance, and how it affected the characters and world. Netflix\u2019s take of ATLA\u2019s iconic intro felt sloppy and slow, as if they were paraphrasing the original intro, yet simultaneously trying to up the word count to allow for more exposition. The writers left the actual script from the original intro up to Katara and Sokka\u2019s grandmother, Gran-Gran, who delivered a cheesy rant that killed the dramatic effect of the worldbuilding.\n\nThat is one of my main issues with this show: it relies on verbally explaining everything that happens to the audience instead of showing them, as the Nickelodeon show did, which is interesting considering the target audience of this show is clearly older. While Nickelodeon\u2019s ATLA had to include exposition due to the intricate worldbuilding and political turmoil, it was revealed mainly through conversational dialogue as characters explained to Aang how his world had changed in the past 100 years. It never felt like exposition, since you were discovering the world along with Aang.\n\nTone\n\nRight off the bat, the Netflix adaptation marked a large departure from the childlike and playful tone of the original series, beginning with Fire Lord Sozin\u2019s starting of the war and the genocide of the Air Nomads 100 years before the events of the show take place. And my god, was seeing the ambush of the Air Nomads brutal. Naively, I never realized how graphic bending would be in a live-action portrayal, but seeing the firebenders kill all of the air nomads was incredibly upsetting. This occurred in the first 20 minutes of the pilot episode, instantly leading the viewer to understand that this show is more geared towards adults or teenagers.\n\nWhile I understand maintaining a more serious tone for a live-action adaptation not on a children\u2019s network, this overarching seriousness made the entire series less endearing and heartwarming. If you want to watch a heavy show with epic battle scenes completely geared towards adults, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is more suitable. While adaptations are not supposed to be carbon copies of the original series, taking the childishness out of a children\u2019s show made the adaptation seem confused, rather than serious.\n\nCasting and Performances\n\nFirst of all, thank GOD someone finally nailed Appa\u2019s \u2013 Aang\u2019s flying bison \u2013 look. While he\u2019s pretty noticeably CGI, he\u2019s still as adorable and fluffy as he was portrayed in animation. I was ready to log out of Netflix if he was anything resembling M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s gremlin-like monster Appa. Momo the flying lemur, another one of Aang\u2019s animal companions, was also well-portrayed in the Netflix series, keeping his goofy, inquisitive nature intact. If Netflix got one thing right, it was the animals.\n\nOverall, the accuracy of the casting in terms of race and ethnicity was handled astronomically better than the 2010 adaptation. The casting was appropriate in terms of the cultures that ATLA was inspired by, and it\u2019s refreshing and heartening for me to see a full cast of Asian and Indigenous actors and actresses. A win for Netflix, and for Asian and Indigenous representation.\n\nIn terms of casting, looks-wise, I think the casting directors nailed the looks of most of the characters, particularly Sokka, Jet, the Earth Kingdom rebel, Longshot, his warrior, June, the bounty hunter and Suki, the Kyoshi warrior. They looked as if they were literally plucked from the cartoon, \u201cEnchanted\u201d style. Their performances were also the standouts of the series for me. Suki, played by USC Alum Maria Zhang, was every bit the formidable warrior that she was in the Nickelodeon version, and Sokka, portrayed by Ian Ousley, was still a goofy teenager prone to comedic outbursts, at least, whenever the script *cough cough* allowed him to. June, played by Arden Cho, and Fire Lord Ozai, casted as Daniel Dae Kim, were also perfect, looks and performance-wise, and I\u2019m actually glad we spent more time with June than we did in the animated series. Cho and Dae Kim, you two can do no wrong.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised by Dallas James Liu\u2019s Zuko, who far exceeded my expectations. I think his performance was noticeably better than most of the other child/young adult actors and actresses in the series, and I\u2019m excited to see more of his acting skills develop as Zuko does.\n\nHowever, many of the performances left much to be desired, which was mostly due to the writing; actors and actresses can only do as much as the script allows them. I won\u2019t even dive into King Bumi, Mai and Ty Lee. Just know that I\u2019m disappointed.\n\nGordon Cormier\u2019s leading role as Aang was a promising start, but definitely suffered from the effects of the writing. His character lacked a lot of the childish naivety that made everyone fall in love with Aang, and it seemed as though the directors wouldn\u2019t let him use any other facial expression than perpetually concerned. Hopefully in the future, the directors will give Aang more room to be a child, as Gordon Cormier is a great casting choice. After all, he is only supposed to be 12.\n\nOne noticeably flat performance was Kiawentiio Tarbell\u2019s Katara who lacked so much of the spunk and fierceness that her animated character possessed. Her character relied too heavily on her emotional and maternal qualities. She is not a force of nature in this series but a byproduct of circumstance, who politely asks for things rather than fighting for them. Justice for Katara.\n\nAzula also suffered the effects of a poor script. Nickelodeon\u2019s Azula is truly a wild card \u2013 neither the characters nor the viewer knows what her next move will be, but one thing is sure, she is relentless. Elizabeth Yu\u2019s Netflix portrayal of Azula was more innocent and vulnerable than Azula in the original series, who never shows a shred of weakness until the very last episode. Maybe the writers wanted to humanize Azula more than the cartoon did, but Azula wasn\u2019t as terrifying as her character should have been. In Nickelodeon\u2019s ATLA, you keep having to remind yourself that Azula is a child, but in Netflix\u2019s ATLA, Azula\u2019s childlike anger and vulnerability is at the forefront of her character.\n\nVisuals\n\nI\u2019ll give it to Netflix; the visuals of the show, for the most part, far exceeded my expectations. The bending looked surprisingly good in the live-action, and the world was generally visually appealing. Firebending in particular looked incredibly realistic; however, there were parts of the show where the waterbending and earthbending could have looked more realistic. The airbending, probably the hardest element to visually represent, actually looked pretty realistic as well.\n\nIt\u2019s near impossible to bring an animated fantasy world to life, and I think that Netflix actually did a fine job with the visual world building \u2013 especially the Fire Nation palace, which looked even better than the cartoon, and the Northern Water Tribe and Southern Air Temple, which looked incredible in scale and detail. The Earth Kingdom stronghold, Omashu, was stunning from an aerial view and looked straight from the cartoon, and I appreciated that Netflix added an element of gritty realism to the city that was not quite captured in the animation.\n\nHowever, the oversaturated color palette made the CGI a little more obvious. The epic battle at the Northern Water Tribe that ends the first season was the visual standout of the entire season to me, especially when the moon spirit takes over Aang in a water-formed, Godzilla-esque creature. Seeing the actual scale of that battle in live action, and executed well, fulfilled my inner child.\n\nWhile they were accurate to the original show, some of the costumes bordered on cosplaying territory, and I would have appreciated a different or more realistic take on some of them. But I digress. There definitely needs to be a new wig designer, but that\u2019s another issue.\n\nRating\n\nIn summary, I\u2019d rate the show a solid 5/10. While it sporadically managed to capture some of the magic of the original series, lazy writing and sub-par dialogue, serious pacing and exposition issues, and altering of the characters \u2013 which will surely affect their future character arcs \u2013 were hard to overlook, especially after watching Nickelodeon\u2019s first season the day before I watched Netflix\u2019s.\n\nThis adaptation seemed to be the product of a larger issue in the film industry right now: studios and streamers are pushing shorter seasons of television shows that force their writers to over-explain everything that happens to the audience. While the adaptation was not a total failure, it was a muddled compression of too many intricate, moving parts mixed into eight episodes of television.\n\nThe show hasn\u2019t been renewed for a second season yet, but hopefully the down time will give showrunner Albert Kim, the writers, and the producers more time to formulate a better direction for the series.\n\nOh Netflix, how I love to hate you. Maybe some things are better left untouched.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Gabe Singer).\n\nBy Lindsey Miller February 28, 2024 at 5:57 pm PST\n\nGabe Singer is 44 years old and about to vote in his first election. Singer is a Los Angeles native and a former felon. This year, he will join other former felons in heading to the polls as eligible voters for the first time thanks to a new California law that automatically restores voting rights for ex-felons, even if they are on probation or parole.\n\nFor Singer, it\u2019s about more than voting. It\u2019s about being welcomed into society. \u201cThis is not only my first time voting in a presidential election since coming out of prison, this is the first time I\u2019m going to vote in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nHaving gone to prison at age 25, Singer now works to educate others, especially young people, on the importance of voter participation. \u201cYou have this change come along and you gain motivation, this want so badly to come back because you\u2019ve been exiled for so long,\u201d he said.\n\nThe change Singer is referring to is the implementation of California Proposition 17, proposed by State Rep. Kevin McCarty and passed Nov. 3, 2020. The proposition amended the state\u2019s constitution to allow automatic restoration of voting rights after a person is released from prison.\n\nBefore Proposition 17, the California constitution prohibited individuals with felony convictions from voting both while in prison and on parole. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, this kept more than 50,000 Californians from voting.\n\nDisenfranchisement, or voter disqualification, has had a disproportionate impact based on racial demographic in Los Angeles and in the country at large. According to the Los Angeles Almanac, the population of Los Angeles county jail in 2023 was 55% Hispanic, 29% African American and 13% White, with African Americans representing a disproportionately large portion of the jail population compared to their county population \u2014 about 8%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand disenfranchisement was never instituted because it was considered an issue of public safety. It is a direct result of racism and our country\u2019s legacy of slavery,\u201d said Taina Angeli Vargas, founder and executive director at Initiate Justice Action, a non-profit working to educate those affected by mass incarceration.\n\n\u201cThe idea was that your right to vote is no longer being taken away because you\u2019re Black,\u201d said Vargas, who was chairperson of the Yes on Proposition 17 campaign. \u201cNow, it is being taken away because you\u2019re in prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a legacy that has continued to this day and continues to have an incredibly disproportionate impact on Black Americans,\u201d she said.\n\nThe restoration of felon voting rights in California comes on the heels of a national trend that has taken place over the last few election cycles. \u201cIt still is in a way state by state, but there is a national movement that is picking up steam,\u201d said Reggie Thedford, legal counsel for the Restore Your Vote program at Campaign Legal Center.\n\nFederal lawmakers have proposed multiple bills designed to restore ex-felon voting rights across the country. The Democracy Restoration Act, introduced by Maryland U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, aimed at returning voting rights to those with felony convictions, would effectively restore federal voting rights to just under 6 million people.\n\nAnd the Inclusive Democracy Act proposed by U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley goes a step further, proposing the return of voting rights to anyone with a felony conviction including the currently incarcerated.\n\n\u201cNot much is getting passed in Congress these days, so we know these bills will not necessarily pass,\u201d Thedford said. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is lay the groundwork, so there is a foundation for when the time is right for these bills to pass.\u201d\n\nAfter passing Proposition 17, California joined 22 other states in automatic restoration of voting rights upon release from incarceration. So far, only Maine, Vermont and the District of Columbia have abolished disenfranchisement for people still incarcerated.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day these are very new policies, and it\u2019s going to take time to weed them out to make sure they aren\u2019t just policies but actual change that transfers to the electorate.\u201d Thedford said.\n\nInitiate Justice Action and other advocacy and education groups say there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of re-enfranchisement policy, their ultimate goal being to abolish the practice of disenfranchisement entirely.\n\nAntoinette Ratcliffe, executive director of Initiate Justice, a Los Angeles based organization empowering individuals impacted by incarceration, said the restoration of felon voting rights is a \u201cfundamental aspect\u201d of an inclusive democracy.\n\n\u201cAs a state, when we are allowing ourselves to remove people from the voting block because of incarceration, we are also saying that it is ok to remove people from the voting block because they are Black or Latin[x], or because they are poor and from communities with little to no resources,\u201d Ratcliffe said.\n\nPeople like Singer who have experienced incarceration are well aware of the feeling of exclusion that comes with being an ex-felon. \u201cOutside the punitive systems, if you were making payments on a car and messed up, you have the ability to fix your credit score over a period of time. But if you make a bad choice because of where you grew up, or your trauma, you don\u2019t ever get to have that new credit score,\u201d Singer said.\n\n\u201cIt is like continually re-punishing, re-traumatizing an individual about a mistake made years and years ago.\u201d\n\nWhile passing Proposition 17 could have a profound impact on communities at large, Ratcliffe said gaps around implementation and timely, consistent voter education have created significant barriers to seeing the kind of change the legislation intended.\n\nOne example of this is discharge cards, which provide proof that an individual is no longer on parole. \u201cWe have had a few members reach out to us and show us their discharge card which says \u2018now that you are off parole your right to vote has been restored,\u2019\u201d Vargas said.\n\n\u201cThis is implying that while they are on parole they cannot vote.\u201d\n\nVargas said another instance took place at a resource fair within the California Women\u2019s Facility Thursday, Feb. 22. Vargas said she recalls a surprising conversation with a representative for the Division of Adult Parole Operations, whose responsibility it is to prepare people for reentry after incarceration.\n\nVargas asked the representatives what the division\u2019s process is for letting people who are about to get out of prison know that their right to vote has been restored.\n\n\u201cThey stared at me with a blank expression,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cThey responded, \u2018You\u2019re saying that people can vote when they\u2019re on parole?\u2019 They didn\u2019t know. And it\u2019s these people who are responsible for preparing people before they get out.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the work Initiate Justice and Initiate Justice Action are doing to inform people that they are able to vote in his upcoming presidential election, they are also providing comprehensive information for first time voters.\n\n\u201cWhat we remind people of is that the vote is already extremely diluted. Our Black vote is diluted, our Latino vote is diluted, our poor vote is diluted significantly,\u201d Ratcliffe said.\n\n\u201cThat means each one of us that does show up and votes down our ballot really has a profound impact.\u201d\n\nThe introduction of this demographic to the electorate through Proposition 17 is unlikely to have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential race in California, since the state already trends Democratic.\n\nBut it could be highly impactful in local elections that will more closely impact Californian cities like Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI was giving a presentation recently where I showed the result of a local city election where the difference between one candidate and another was about 20 votes,\u201d Ratcliffe said.\n\n\u201cTo sit in a room of 20 people and let them know that you 20 can impact a local election, that is where you see the impact.\u201d\n\nAccording to Vargas, introducing ex-felons to the California electorate bolsters the democratic process and ensures elected officials represent the collective will of the communities they represent.\n\n\u201cWhen you have people who are marginalized, they feel disempowered and they don\u2019t have the tools and skill they need to participate fully in our electorate,\u201d Vargas said.\n\n\u201cYou end up electing people that are only representing a portion of the electorate, the portion that has the time, money and resources to participate fully.\u201d\n\nWhile the outcome of the presidential election in California might not be as suspenseful as other states, for ex-felons like Singer, the act of voting symbolizes a change as impactful as any election result.\n\n\u201cIf you were to ask in a private room of these people, whenever they started getting into trouble, I guarantee every single person wants to be a part of the system. It\u2019s just they don\u2019t feel that the system wanted them there,\u201d Singer said.\n\n\u201cBeing able to vote creates this excitement and joy where you think, I can be a part of the system, and I want to be a part of the system.\u201d\n\nA previous version of this article stated that State Rep. Isaac Bryan introduced California Proposition 17. State Rep. Kevin McCarty introduced the proposition. Annenberg Media regrets this error.\n```"}

Hill claims that despite filing a petition with the U.S. Copyright Office in 2021, Amazon ignored his ability to regain rights to the screenplay once the production company United Artist\u2019s claim expired in November 2023. Amazon allegedly moved forward with production during the SAG-AFTRA strike in an attempt to finish the film before the copyright expired. According to the lawsuit, they simulated actors\u2019 voices with AI to do so.\n\nGabe Kahn is a journalism professor at the University of Southern California, and taught USC Annenberg\u2019s first course on AI. His findings? The entertainment industry is vulnerable. He alluded to many examples of AI already performing on par with the job a human can do, and studios have motivation to opt away from real editors, designers, and actors.\n\nThe LA Times reported that someone close to the studio said the reboot only used AI in the early stages of production, and no AI or nonunion actors made it into the final cut. But even then, the usage of AI allowed Amazon to side-step the SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\nKahn: AI doesn\u2019t go on strike, and AI doesn\u2019t have schedules that need to be coordinated... there\u2019s definitely some marketing challenges, but what you\u2019re going to see is an effort to really drive down costs in the historically, incredibly expensive movie production process.\n\nUltimately Kahn said the usage of AI in entertainment isn\u2019t so cut and dry. Kahn: It doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s a black and white AI is evil humans are good kind of dichotomy, that would be, you know, too simple.\n\nKahn said the issue is that courts are not equipped with precedents to address cases involving generative AI, but though it is difficult to regulate, there needs to be standards. Kahn: What I think we need to first establish are sort of, what are our values, and our ethical lines that we don\u2019t want to be crossed in this, and then demand that big tech, Hollywood, whomever, respect those.\n\nHill\u2019s lawsuit hopes to block distribution of the film, but it is unclear whether it will prove Amazon did use AI, or what will happen if they did.\n```"}

On Monday, the FTC led a federal lawsuit alleging that the $24.6 billion acquisition would harm millions of American consumers and supermarket workers. The FTC said the lack of competition could lead to higher prices and lower quality products, as well as restrict grocery options for shoppers. Workers at Kroger-owned Ralphs, Albertsons-owned Vons and Safeway stores would also be threatened, with less of an ability to negotiate better wages and benefits.\n\nThe companies said the proposed deal -- the largest supermarket merger in American history -- is essential for Kroger and Albertsons to continue to compete with Walmart, Amazon and other retail chains. For low-income communities in Southern California where only Kroger- or Alberstons-owned stores are available, the proposed deal is especially concerning. Since the pandemic, the price of groceries has skyrocketed. From 2019 to 2023, food costs rose by 25% according to  U.S. Department of Agriculture .\n\nMichael Josephson, a Southwestern law school student, said the FTC\u2019s lawsuit is essential to protect consumers. Josephson: In Southern California, we lock diverse markets -- you have Trader Joe\u2019s, you have the Kroger brands, and you have Safeway, Albertson\u2019s brand. Realistically speaking, out of those main market competitors, prices aren\u2019t low enough as it is. And, we\u2019re seeing major increases in inflation. Josephson said the government should do more to block mergers like Kroger-Albertsons from occurring. Josephson: Realistically speaking, I don\u2019t think those two companies should be merging. I do think that having fair competition is what drives prices down, especially since both companies are already quite expensive.\n\nSamuel Escue, a fifth year computer science student at USC, relies on Kroger brands like Ralphs to obtain affordable groceries near campus.

Gavin Newsom speaks during a Clean California event in San Francisco, Nov. 9, 2023. On Sunday, Feb. 25, 2024, Newsom announced an advertising campaign to combat proposals in several Republican-controlled states that he said are designed to prohibit out-of-state travel for abortions and other reproductive care. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)\n\nBy Joseph Domingot, Heli Ruiz and Makenzi Johnson\nFebruary 28, 2024 at 5:42 pm PST\n\nRescue California, a Republican group, served Gov. Gavin Newsom with a recall notice on Monday morning, arguing that the governor has abandoned California and calling for his removal from office. This isn\u2019t Newsom\u2019s first time in the political hot seat. Rescue California previously challenged the governor in a failed recall attempt in 2021. California voters rejected the recall attempt by over 3 million votes. The last successful recall was against Gov. Gray Davis in 2003. Arnold Schwarzenegger was subsequently elected as his replacement.\n\nFor a recall election to occur, the petitioners must get signatures from about 12 percent of the previous voter turnout. That means the new recall order must get about 1.3 million verified signatures to put Newsom\u2019s name on the ballot for his own seat. Only about 48% of voter-eligible adults in California approve of California\u2019s current governor, according to a survey from the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nRepublicans said they are beginning the recall attempt on Monday, Feb. 26, after Newsom released a hard-hitting pro-abortion rights ad campaign in red states on Sunday, Feb. 25. The new recall attempt by Rescue California calls for the removal of the governor, as they accuse Newsom of being too busy advancing an eventual presidential bid to focus on issues facing the state. The organization is also criticizing the governor for his efforts on addressing various issues such as public safety, immigration, education, homelessness, taxation and spending.\n\nDaniel Schnur, a politics and public relations adjunct professor at USC and former Republican political operative, said, \u201cwhile it\u2019s very unlikely that the recall succeeds, its real goal may be to simply remove Gavin Newsom from the national political debate during the presidential campaign to force him to spend more time in California.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s recent ad campaign released in Tennessee confronts the conservative state\u2019s bill that charges adults assisting pregnant minors in receiving out-of-state reproductive care without parental consent, with a felony.\n\n\u201cI completely disagree with the Republican recall,\u201d said Francisco Espinoza Miranda, a sophomore theater major. \u201cThere has been a lot of progress from Gavin.\u201d Miranda said when he sees efforts like this it makes him frown, adding that Newsom is \u201cdefinitely more progressive than most of America, which is dope.\u201d\n\nNewsom took to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday to assure his followers that his campaign will overcome Rescue California. \u201cRepublicans are launching another wasteful recall campaign to distract us from the existential fight for democracy and reproductive freedom,\u201d Newsom tweeted. \u201cWe will defeat them.\u201d\n\nSchnur, a veteran political operative, said that \u201cfor a lot of Democrats who think that Newsom is a particularly effective surrogate for Biden, this could be a loss to the party nationally.\u201d\n\nRescue California raised concerns about the state\u2019s large budget deficit. According to the Legislative Analysts\u2019 Office, California is currently under a nearly $73 billion deficit. Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass announced via X Newsom\u2019s plan for the state to spend around $300 million, $60 million of which will be spent on a post-pandemic effort.\n\nIn the previous 2021 recall effort, Rescue California raised concerns about Newsom\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The California-based Republican organization also cited worries this week about Newsom passing legislation regarding the accessibility of health care to undocumented immigrants. The group also brought attention to California\u2019s high-income tax rate. In 2023, the state of California hosted the highest income tax rate of any state at around 13.3%, according to American business software company Intuit.\n\nRescue California organizers said they understand the recall will take much more effort to be accomplished during the November 2024 election period.\n```"}

McConnell says he'll step down as Senate Republican leader in November. The 82-year-old Kentucky lawmaker is the longest-serving Senate leader in history. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)\n\nBy Laya Albert February 28, 2024 at 5:41 pm PST\n\nMitch McConnell, the longest-serving United States Senate leader in history and current Republican minority leader, announced his resignation for November this morning, leaving the USC community with mixed feelings. McConnell, a Republican representing Kentucky, turned 82 last week and announced this decision in the well of the Senate Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cIt was a wise decision\u201d for McConnell to step down, said David Cerna, a sophomore studying piano performance and a member of the USC College Republicans. \u201cThat\u2019s only going to benefit the party,\u201d Cerna said, adding that he thought McConnell \u201cdid a reasonably good job as senator.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has represented the Bluegrass State in the Senate since 1985 and has been his party\u2019s leader since 2007. Known for his sharp disagreements with former President Barack Obama and skirmishes with former President Donald Trump, he has raised controversies from within the Republican Party and with Democrats.\n\nDaniel Schnur, a USC Annenberg professor of political communication and former Republican political operative, said losing McConnell would hurt more establishment Republicans. \u201cThis is a very, very difficult blow for the more traditional wing of the Republican Party,\u201d Schnur said.\n\nSchnur explained that this recognition would upset politicians like Nikki Haley and her supporters, who wanted the Republican party to return to its goals from before Trump came on the scene. But he said it will please strong Trump and MAGA supporters who do not see McConnell as conservative enough.\n\n\u201cMcConnell represents a brand of the Republican Party that either no longer exists, or at the very least, is in hibernation until Trump finishes his time in public office,\u201d Schnur said.\n\nSchnur also noted that McConnell worked closely with President Joe Biden over the years and most recently worked with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on funding for Ukraine. Just two weeks ago, McConnell strongly defended a foreign aid package for Ukraine and supported a bipartisan border security deal that was under heavy criticism from other right-wing politicians.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of Democrats who think he\u2019s far too conservative, and a lot of conservatives who don\u2019t think he\u2019s conservative enough,\u201d Schnur said.\n\nMcConnell raised controversy within the Democratic party because of his pro-life abortion policy and his refusal to hold confirmation hearings for Merrick Garland, an Obama nomination for the Supreme Court and the current attorney general. But Schnur said McConnell\u2019s anti-abortion rights work was a fair representation of his constituency.\n\nCerna said he feels similarly about McConnell\u2019s abortion policy, saying, \u201che was reflecting what his constituency is voting for.\u201d\n\nBob Shrum, the director of the USC Center for the Political Future and a former consultant in the Democratic Party, had a different response to McConnell\u2019s tenure. \u201cMitch McConnell, along with Donald Trump, is the author of the death of reproductive rights,\u201d Shrum said.\n\nBy refusing to hold hearings on Garland but confirming Justice Amy Coney Barrett under similar circumstances, McConnell could be described as an architect of the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority and its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nCalifornia Senate candidate and U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff said Wednesday morning on X, formerly known as Twitter, that McConnell will not be missed. \u201cMitch McConnell stacked the Court, undermined our democracy and enabled Donald Trump. And yet \u2013 in his absence \u2013 the @SenateGOP will invariably select someone more extreme,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nShrum explained that McConnell \u201cgave us the Trump Supreme Court\u201d and refused to vote for Trump\u2019s second impeachment after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMoving forward, the USC community has different ideas of what the future of Senate Republicans should look like. Cerna said he would like to see someone like former Florida governor Sen. Rick Scott as the new leader. Schnur said he expects to see one of McConnell\u2019s top three deputies\u2014South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso or Texas Sen. John Cornyn take the helm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see a very wide range of opinions on Mitch McConnell,\u201d said Schnur.\n```"}

This year\u2019s theme is \u2018Get in the Know,\u2019 a call to action to shed light on the second most deadly mental illness\u2014 eating disorders.\n\nEating disorders can happen to anyone, but college students are often at a higher risk of developing one. Eating disorders thrive in chaos, and the pressure of college life combined with other mental struggles often manifest in the form of an eating disorder. It is estimated that 10-20% of girls and 4-10% of boys in college suffer from an eating disorder, and those numbers are only increasing. These numbers are merely estimates and fail to account for those who live with an eating disorder in silence.\n\nAnyone can suffer from an eating disorder, and it is important to raise awareness about the seriousness of this illness. There are harmful stereotypes surrounding eating disorders that people fail to recognize are far from the truth. Individuals can struggle with an eating disorder regardless of age, gender or background. And it isn\u2019t something only women struggle with, men are just as likely to suffer from one, and even more are transgender or nonbinary individuals.\n\nEating disorders are mental disorders, not physical ones, even though they may have physical manifestations, it is important to know that someone may be struggling with an eating disorder yet seem healthy. It is important to acknowledge that eating disorders don\u2019t have one look. They encompass a range of conditions including Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder (BED), Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (OSFED), Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), and Pica Disorder \u2014 all disorders that have serious consequences and affect individuals physically and mentally.\n\nThis week serves as a reminder of the importance of raising awareness and advocating for change. Through education, conversations and community engagement, we can challenge the stigma around eating disorders. There are warning signs that you can look out for whether it be for yourself or a loved one. Anorexia Nervosa can often involve food rituals, weight loss, body dysmorphia and ignoring hunger cues. Bulimia Nervosa can be characterized by eating in secret, weight fluctuation, abusing laxatives/pills, and uncontrollable overeating. Glimpses of Binge Eating can be seen if using food as a coping mechanism, eating abnormally large meals and feeling guilt or shame. Signs of ARFID are noticeable through the avoidance of food due to smell, texture or appearance, a lack of interest in eating, being \u2018extremely picky,\u2019 and fears of allergies or choking. If you recognize symptoms across different disorders, that is often the manifestation of OSFED. Sometimes individuals may even experience a strong desire to eat things that aren\u2019t food and contain no nutritional value, this is known as PICA and is just as serious as any other disorder even if it isn\u2019t known as widely.\n\nHelplines, support groups and treatment centers offer lifelines to those in need, reaffirming that recovery is not only possible, but achievable with the right resources and support system. Everyone has a chance to play a pivotal role in showing compassion and solidarity to those struggling. If you or anyone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, reach out for help. There are several helplines for you including ANAD Helpline: 1 (888) 375-7767, National Alliance for Eating Disorders Helpline: 1 (866) 662-1235, and Diabulimia Helpline: 1 (425) 985-3635. USC also offers an array of mental health and behavioral services.\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier February 28, 2024 at 3:39 pm PST\n\nAfter dropping both matches at Grand Canyon last week, USC men\u2019s volleyball (10-4) looks to get back in the win column during their matches against crosstown rival UCLA. Head coach Jeff Nygaard, who won two national championships as a player with the Bruins, said that despite the rivalry, the Trojans\u2019 preparation plans will remain the same.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows this is a rival game. It\u2019s a big week of just UCLA vs. USC. I mean, for me, the stakes probably have overtones or undertones, I go back a number of decades,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cBut in terms of preparation for the team, it\u2019s business as usual. It\u2019s not too high, not too low, it\u2019s just taking care of things on our side of the net, continue to grow, continue to learn, continue to get better and better every time we go out there.\u201d\n\nUSC dropped one spot in this week\u2019s AVCA/NVA poll to No. 11, while UCLA held steady at No. 4 after splitting their series against BYU last week in Provo. Despite their losses against GCU, Nygaard said the Trojans still walked away learning from the experience against the Lopes, who are now ranked first in the nation.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we came away taking a game and then going deuce in that third game in the second night, after having seen some things that we probably hadn\u2019t seen a team do the night before, they came back and we learned on the fly that we just keep adding and adding and adding,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying it for a long time: this group is scrappy, they fight hard, they\u2019re completely unified as a team, and they get stronger the more we play.\u201d\n\nSenior middle blocker Kyle Paulson echoed Nygaard\u2019s statement about the Trojans leaving GCU with new lessons learned.\n\n\u201cWe had some good moments against GCU, obviously not the results we wanted,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cBut there were a lot of things we learned and I think we\u2019re gonna apply those this week, and hopefully we get some wins.\u201d\n\nPaulson, who has yet to win a match against the Bruins, stressed the importance of keeping practices consistent as they prepare for UCLA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge rivalry for our school, the other L.A. school,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cOne thing is you just gotta play your game, what you practice, it\u2019s no different than any other game we\u2019ve played. So just trust the process that we\u2019ve been doing and we\u2019ll go out there and compete.\u201d\n\nNygaard values the importance that team leaders, like Paulson, have on making sure the team stays focused throughout the week.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are also really great sounding boards of what is important, knifing through a lot of the stuff that isn\u2019t all that important that we just don\u2019t need to focus on,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of the distractions, we just need to go out there and take care of things on our side of the net. And we have confidence that we can go out and compete against anybody in the nation. So this is another opportunity for us to go out there and prove that.\u201d\n\nNygaard sees the Crosstown Showdown matchups as a way for USC to evaluate where the team is at, especially with the Trojans having played just over half of their matches so far this season.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a team that won a national title last year,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re meeting them right at a really great time of the year, to where there\u2019s learning to be done after that so that we can continue to chip away at getting those one or two points. A lot of this year has been just one or two more points, and we are getting the wins that this team\u2019s working hard for.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans host the Bruins at Galen Center on Thursday at 7 p.m. before traveling to UCLA on Saturday, where the first serve will take place at Pauley Pavillion at 5 p.m.\n```"}

They believe that changes to the airport could lead to an increase in emissions \u2014 which is why they attended an LA City Council special session to oppose helicopter company Helinet Aviation\u2019s bid for a new lease at the airport to initiate \u201crenovations\u201d on their hangars.\n\nResidents were affirmed when LA City Council\u2019s Trade, Travel, and Tourism Committee (TTT) voted unanimously on February 8 to recommend the rejection the Bonseph-Helinet proposal during a special session at Van Nuys City Hall, where Helinet executives hoped a long-term, up to 25-year lease could help initiate improvements on their leased hangars. Several city council members seemed to at least agree that more community input is needed before a new lease.\n\nBefore the unanimous vote to reject the Bonseph-Helinet proposal, Councilmember Traci Park spoke to Helinet\u2019s \u201cinvaluable service\u201d to public safety and emergency medical transit for the Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, emphasizing that their mission should not be interrupted. \u201cWith that said, I remember during the height of the pandemic reading about the large increase in charter jets flying in and out of Van Nuys Airport, [creating] potent fumes that prevented parents from letting their kids play outside, poor air quality because of the increased particulate matter, as well as noise at all times of day,\u201d Park said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t adequate community engagement around this [proposal].\u201d\n\nVNY is a non-commercial airport serving wealthy clientele \u2014 including Kylie Jenner, who flew a 17-minute flight out of VNY in 2022 \u2014 as well as chartered flights that sell individual tickets as high as $46,000. The airport also serves organizations like newsrooms and hospitals.\n\nEmployees from Helinet hold photographs of leaking ceilings at their workplace, claiming they need to be granted the lease to do necessary maintenance and upgrades, on Feb. 8, 2024 (Photo by Shane Dimapanat / Annenberg Media)\n\nHelinet brought a fleet of executives and airport workers to the February 8 session, along with representatives from Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles, which the company works with to provide medical services. \u201cFor about nearly 25 years, Helinet has served as a sole provider, private helicopter air ambulance provider for Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, at no cost to CHLA or to the families [and] the patients brought to the hospital for care,\u201d said Dr. Calvin Lowe, medical director of the Alan Purwin Emergency Transport Program at CHLA.\n\nHowever, local residents at the meeting called on the TTT Committee \u2014 including Councilmembers Park, Tim McOsker, and Hugo Soto-Martinez \u2014 to reject the proposal, raising public health and environmental concerns. \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t light a match outside in my yard because the fumes are so bad,\u201d said Evelyn Gray, a resident from the Lake Balboa neighborhood.\n\nResidents also noted that Helinet\u2019s life-saving medical services can continue under their existing month-to-month lease. \u201cNo medical flights are in jeopardy, nor are their luxury Fortune 500 charter flights,\u201d said Timi Romolini, a legal researcher advising a group of Lake Balboa residents called Fume Fighters United VNY. The group also denounced the proposal, pointing to its lack of mitigation measures against environmental pollution.\n\nTimi Romolini, legal researcher advising FumeFighters VNY, waits in line for public comment during special session convened by the Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee at Van Nuys City Hall on Feb. 8, 2024 (Photo by Shane Dimapanat / Annenberg Media)\n\nUnlike LAX, VNY hasn\u2019t adopted widely-used technologies like ground-powered units (GPUs) and pre-conditioned air (PCA) facilities to reduce air pollution. In 2013, the city built a jet blast deflector wall to protect workers near the 8,000-foot runway, which, unlike hangar space, is regulated by safety standards from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\u201cCity Council has historically allowed Van Nuys Airport developments [by] lease holders without scrutiny over whether their proposal included significant [environmental] mitigation components, some of which LAX has had in place since 1993,\u201d said Councilmember Imelda Padilla. Padilla introduced two motions \u2014 one to create a comprehensive airport plan to replace existing zoning code and another to appoint a citizen committee to advise the process. She also emphasized the imperative to conduct independent environmental reviews as part of the airport\u2019s Vision Study.\n\nResidents\u2019 top priority is for the airport to adopt technologies that would limit emissions from auxiliary power units (APUs), diesel units that are a chief cause of air pollution at airports. A 2021 review noted several studies that tied emissions to increased rates of premature death, preterm births, decreased lung function, and childhood leukemia. Data consistently shows elevated levels of ultrafine particulate matter, widely proven to cause respiratory illness, around airports.\n\n\u201cIn Van Nuys, we are in the 94th percentile for pollution out of all census tracts in California. We are the 75th percentile on diesel emissions. And we have above average rates of low birth weights,\u201d said Jared Negr\u00f3n, Lake Balboa Neighborhood Council member.\n\nSmaller planes, which use leaded fuel, also operate at VNY and pose the additional threat of toxic lead exposure to residents. Last October, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined lead emissions from small aircrafts could endanger public health under the Clean Air Act, particularly causing irreversible health effects in children, a chief concern for the Van Nuys neighborhood, where 22% are minors, according to data by Niche.\n\n\u201cThe expansion that has already occurred here over the last several years has put the health of this community in jeopardy,\u201d Gill said.\n\nResidents and Helinet employees gather for a special session convened by the Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee at Van Nuys City Hall on Feb. 8, 2024 (Photo by Shane Dimapanat / Annenberg Media)\n\nLos Angeles World Airports, the city department that owns and operates LAX and VNY, maintains that no land expansion was proposed in the Bonseph-Helinet lease plan. However, residents allege the airport is expanding the amount of jets stored and taking off from the airport, in effect increasing APU emissions in Lake Balboa.\n\nHelinet employees claimed the company could not be blamed for alleged increases in APU emissions; it owns no jets, which are the primary aircrafts using APUs, and only one of its helicopters uses the technology.\n\n\u201cBy allowing the building upgrade of our facility, Helinet will be able to continue to provide the vital services for the community while providing a safe place for our employees,\u201d said Alison Rakun, executive vice president at Helinet Aviation.\n\nHowever, Federal Aviation Administration regulations \u2014 which apply to airports like VNY that are accepting federal grants \u2014 state neither Los Angeles World Airports nor Helinet can decide the parameters for aviation use in their hangars. If more jets arrive at VNY, Helinet must accommodate them in their hangars.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a wide range of aviation usage, including storage and parking of jets, that could be permitted under this lease,\u201d said Mark Adams, Los Angeles World Airports governmental affairs representative.\n\nFollowing the committee\u2019s recommendation to reject the Bonseph-Helinet proposal, LA City Council voted on Tuesday, February 20 to pass Motion 23-1339, Councilmember Padilla\u2019s motion to appoint a citizen committee to advise further development at VNY \u2014 a step forward for residents hoping to incorporate environmental protections at the first point of airport business.\n\n* Correction: This article was updated on February 29, 2024 for clarity and accuracy.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Disney+ Press and Lucasfilm Ltd.)\n\nBy  Grace Sutherland February 28, 2024 at  2:24 pm PST\n\n\u201cStar Wars: The Bad Batch \u2018\u2019 released the first three episodes of its third and final season on Disney+ recently, but unless you\u2019re a mega-fan, you likely haven\u2019t heard about it. It\u2019s not the most well-known Star Wars property; it\u2019s not even the most (or second most) well-known Star Wars animated series. But despite this and its questionable quality at times, the show retains a dedicated fan base.\n\nTo me, \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d is something like a younger sibling. It can be annoying, strange and even a little fun to mock, but you love it nonetheless. I can\u2019t pretend I don\u2019t enjoy ridiculing \u201cThe Bad Batch,\u201d but the second anyone joins in, I feel myself shift onto the defensive. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good show,\u201d I\u2019ll say. \u201cWell...it\u2019s not a good show, but it\u2019s a great show. You know what I mean?\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just the show\u2019s quality that is difficult to express. The plot is equally troublesome to summarize; the typical attempt starts with something like \u201cA group of genetically divergent clones...\u201d which seems to be an oxymoron.\n\nBefore diving into the show itself, I\u2019ll attempt a summary from a wider angle for the benefit of anyone unfamiliar or needing a refresher. Be warned of spoilers ahead.\n\nIn 2002, \u201cStar Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones\u201d was released. This film saw Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) discovering that an army was being built entirely out of genetic clones of a bounty hunter named Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison.) The movie ends with the implication of this army and the start of what will become the Clone Wars.\n\nThe next live-action film, \u201cStar Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith\u201d (2005), takes place three years after the start of the Clone Wars. While the clones have fought on the side of the Jedi throughout the war, a complicated series of betrayals reveal that the clones have a computer chip in their brain, which, when activated, turns them into mindlessly obedient soldiers. With one simple order, the clones turn on the Jedi, killing most of them.\n\nCreated by USC alum George Lucas but more frequently associated with supervising director Dave Filoni, \u201cStar Wars: The Clone Wars\u201d  is an animated series set in the three-year gap between episodes II and III. The show, which ran for seven seasons,  tells the stories of previously well-known characters such as Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, as well as introduces dozens of now beloved original characters such as Ashoka Tano, Rex and Cad Bane.\n\nAmong the characters introduced in \u201cThe Clone Wars\u201d are four clone soldiers who had been genetically modified to operate as a special task force. Nicknamed Hunter, Wrecker, Tech and Crosshair, the four clones make up Clone Force 99, also known as the Bad Batch.\n\nAfter appearing for a couple of episodes, the Bad Batch leaves \u201cThe Clone Wars\u201d with a new member, a cyborg clone called Echo.\n\n\u201cStar Wars: The Bad Batch\u201d picks up where \u201cThe Clone Wars\u201d and \u201cStar Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith\u201d left off, with the execution of the Jedi and the end of the Clone Wars. The Bad Batch, immune to mind-control because of their genetic mutations, refuses to kill the Jedi and find themselves on the run, as well as being responsible for the care of a mysterious young girl, Omega.\n\nSo, the concept of \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d can be complicated. Even  Rotten Tomatoes  \u2018Critics Consensus\u2019 says the show \u201cmay be too lore heavy for casual viewers.\u201d It\u2019s undeniably niche content, a spin-off of a spin-off of a spin-off. It\u2019s a \u201cStar Wars\u201d show for \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans, and even among \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans, it is often unknown or at least unseen.\n\nDespite this, the promotion of the show has been decently mainstream. As of this writing, the official  \u201cStar Wars\u201d Instagram account  bio reads \u201cThe final season of Star Wars: #TheBadBatch starts streaming February 21, with a three-episode premiere, only on @DisneyPlus.\u201d In addition, the account has posted  several trailers ,  countdown posts  and even a  dramatic poster boasting the words \u201cTHE FINAL SEASON,\u201d  which feels excessive for a show that has only had two previous seasons.\n\nAdditionally, a  link in the bio  takes readers to an  article  written by  Brandon Wainerdi , summarizing the events of the last two seasons of  \u201cThe Bad Batch.\u201d\n\nWhile Disney marketing their newest show shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, on some level, it is. Their main intention doesn\u2019t seem to be informing fans that a new season is arriving but instead to gain new viewers. It could even be seen as cause to wonder if Disney believes \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d could be the next \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d took a niche slice of a complicated universe and went mainstream, doing huge business for Disney, and the show has similarities to \u201cThe Bad Batch.\u201d Both exist within complex lore, but both focus on a simple and well-known plot structure: an emotionally stunted adult man is forced to care for a young child who teaches him how to express love.\n\nIn this precise way, Star Wars has already tried to recreate the success of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d with \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\u201d (which saw a depressed Obi-Wan entrusted with the care of a young Princess Leia) in 2022 to only limited success.\n\nIf this is Disney\u2019s intent, I predict the results of limited success will continue. The mainstream consumer audience has shown time and time again that they can be welcoming to genre content, but they have to be coaxed into it, and it has to be both spectacular and digestible.\n\nMany superhero movies had been made before \u201cIron Man\u201d (2008), but none were good enough or classically structured enough to outweigh their (then) outsider nature.\n\nWhile enjoyable to those who exist within its niche, \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d is neither spectacular nor digestible.\n\nBoth in concept and theme, the show has a solid foundation, and it asks an interesting philosophical question: if you were created for the sole purpose of being a soldier, what happens if you don\u2019t follow orders and, perhaps more interestingly, what do you do when the war is done?\n\nThe show\u2019s structure works well, with both seasons settling into a problem-of-the-week format and ramping up during the final few episodes. Its characters are also strong. The members of the Bad Batch are complex and interesting. They are united only by virtue of being different, leading to many personality clashes, yet they care for each other deeply.\n\nThe relationships between the members of the Bad Batch are undeniably the heart of the show. Yet, this is where the show often stumbles. Rather than play into the \u2018found family\u2019 trope already present in the show, \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d focuses on the relationship between team leader Hunter and young girl Omega.\n\nAs said before, this troupe is tried and true, but something doesn\u2019t quite click in \u201cThe Bad Batch.\u201d Hunter, while an adult man with face tattoos, is not in any way emotionally stunted. Hunter\u2019s care for his crew is open and intense. He is willing to do anything to keep his family safe and repeatedly puts aside his desires for theirs.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much for a vulnerable young girl to teach him. Additionally, the show relies heavily on a repeated plotline. Omega gets lost or kidnapped. The Bad Batch must then find or rescue her. This storyline has happened at least three times in previous seasons, which might not have been too excessive had the season three trailer not revealed that the season\u2019s primary plot will follow the Bad Batch on a quest to rescue a kidnapped Omega.\n\nIt\u2019s also a somewhat ironic plot to repeat since Hunter\u2019s \u2018power\u2019 is supposedly his ability to track people down.\n\nIn terms of digestibility, there is also a lot of variation. The Bad Batch themselves, as well as their week-to-week missions, are simple enough to understand without excessive context. However, quite a few elements of the show don\u2019t receive the necessary exposition to be enjoyed without prior knowledge.\n\nOne example I find entertaining is that Omega has a strong Kiwi accent. While this is (somewhat) explainable through more niche lore, it seems bizarre without context, as seemingly no one involved in raising Omega has a similar accent.\n\nMore substantial, but perhaps less amusing, examples of lacking exposition exist throughout the show.\n\nAnother place that \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d lacks mainstream potential is in its cameo appearances. With \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d though viewers found themselves deeper in lore than they might have previously enjoyed, they were constantly reminded by the show that they were never too far from the familiar.\n\nThe iconic visual appearance of Grogu, even nicknamed \u2018Baby Yoda\u2019 by the internet, and cameos of characters like Luke Skywalker reassured the audience that they were \u2018knowledgeable enough\u2019 to participate.\n\n\u201cThe Bad Batch,\u201d conversely, contains very few characters from any live-action media and  prefers to reference characters from other popular animated series , such as Hera Syndulla and Kanan Jarrus from \u201cStar Wars: Rebels\u201d (2014).\n\nSo, if Disney hopes that \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d will go mainstream, it is improbable that they will get their wish. However, my hope is that the promotion of the show\u2019s third season reflects a different intention entirely: a recognition of the value of niche content.\n\nAll of the elements that make \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d a poor candidate for a shift into the mainstream are the same elements that make it so beloved among viewers. Its lack of exposition, deep cuts, and even its loveable bizarreness make it precisely what it was always supposed to be: a Star Wars show for Star Wars fans.\n\n\u201cThe Bad Batch\u2019s\u201d viewers may not be as numerous as those of a mainstream show but they are loyal viewers who really care about the content. And while it\u2019s always nice to see people fall in love with Star Wars, \u201cThe Bad Batch\u201d isn\u2019t first-date material. Still, if it sounds interesting, I encourage people to check it out; you might find yourself in a new niche.\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/02/28/bachelor-nation-romance-or-drama-why-the-bachelor-is-such-a-big-hit/", "response": "```\nBachelor Nation! Romance or drama? Why \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 is such a big hit\n\nWhether you are a fan of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d or have never watched an episode a day in your life, you\u2019ve probably heard of it and know the premise.\n\nEven though \"The Bachelor\" often ends in drama and heartbreak, fans continue to flock to the weekly ABC show.\n\nBy Paulena Edelman February 28, 2024 at 11:57 am PST\n\nWhen I first caught a glimpse of what I thought at the time was the most scandalous show on television in 2014, I wanted to douse my eyes with bleach. There was a couple aggressively making out on a white sand beach while the tide washed up around them. I was horrified. What in the world did my mom have on? I later learned that it was \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\n\nAfter that scarring moment, I repressed thoughts of the show until 2018 when I was in eighth grade. On Monday night at 7 p.m. central, my mom and I would meet in the living room to watch \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d or \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d Some nights, my dad would join my mom and me on the couch to \u201cdo work.\u201d Other nights, he would \u201csecretly\u201d watch from the office. If you asked him about it, he would vehemently deny his participation.\n\nSo, in a world dominated by sports enthusiasts and news consumers, how on earth did a show about random people making fools of themselves under the guise of finding love gain such traction? How has viewership remained so high while other shows on cable TV have failed due to the numerous streaming services available? And, most importantly, why do men continue to deny their interest?\n\nThe Bachelor franchise has been around since its debut in March 2002 and has seen over 40 seasons of matchmaking between \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d How many of those love matches are still married...well, that\u2019s a different story. As of 2023, the number of couples who have remained together is shockingly \u2014 or unsurprisingly, depending on how you look at it \u2014 low. In the 27 seasons of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d only six couples have remained together. Similarly, in the 20 seasons of \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d only three couples remain together.\n\nThe success rate deeply contradicts the point of the show: to watch a couple fall in love. People watch because the franchise captures love and heartbreak through 18 hours over nine weeks. Oh, and, the chaotic drama is a plus. While the show features heartbreak, it still ultimately has a happy ending (again, generally), which satisfies our inner hopeless romantic.\n\nSo, that\u2019s why we watch, right? To watch a couple fall in love and give us hope that there\u2019s someone out there for everyone?\n\nThis season\u2019s bachelor, Joey Graziadei, features several entertaining contestants vying for his heart of gold. So far, there have been seven episodes filled with gut-wrenching melodrama. Sydney Gordon and Maria Georgas quickly became the focal point for dramatic confrontations. For what? I\u2019m still not exactly sure.\n\nContestants, like Jess Edwards, appear to be on the show for their 15 minutes of fame, causing drama from day one with obnoxious and unbecoming behavior. Others provide a good laugh with their antics and desperation to get an upper hand with Graziadei. Evalin Clark, of San Antonio, Texas, in a last-ditch effort to get a seat next to Grazidei, jumped over a table during a game of musical chairs, landing on top of a different girl in the group date.\n\nWhile there do seem to be some good contestants, like fan favorite Daisy Kent, the abnormal contestants greatly outweigh the normal.\n\nWeek four, excluding Hulu viewership, raked in 4.2 million viewers, according to Nielsen\u2019s Live + Same Day data. Last season\u2019s Bachelorette finale with Charity Lawson brought 2.99 million viewers. Considering the difference in viewership and taking into account that \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d episode was a filler episode compared to \u201cThe Bachelorette\u2019s\u201d finale, it\u2019s clear that \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has more fans than \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has higher viewership ratings because it\u2019s more entertaining. There\u2019s a certain level of drama you can reach with 32 women that you can\u2019t with 25 men.\n\nWhy is a show where women are pitted against each other so enthralling? Because women are consistently taught that every other woman is a rival. Despite today\u2019s progressive society, viewers still grab a bowl of popcorn and settle in to dedicate two hours a week to a show where women psychologically fight each other for a man.\n\nThe show\u2019s nature has fans rooting for one contestant while praying to see the downfall (elimination) of another because the franchise plays to societal conditioning by giving life to stereotypes. Every episode brings new drama and perpetuates the preconceived notions about women and gossip.\n\nWhile entertaining, the show ultimately contributes to the regression of society, especially in areas concerning women\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d and their conventional \u201crole in social norms and everyday sexism.\u201d\n\nSo, why do you watch \u201cThe Bachelor?\u201d Is it for the Bachelor himself? The theatrical drama? The dresses? The tears, tantrums and cake-throwing? Either way, you\u2019ll probably still enjoy watching sisters Lauren and Allison Hollinger compete for the same man... and not for the first time apparently.\n```"}

This was not the only native family targeted, but rather a part of at least 60 Osage people that had gone missing or were murdered in Oklahoma between 1921-1926, in what is known as the \u201cReign of Terror.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Martin Scorsese unveiled \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d a biographical epic spanning 3 hours and 26 minutes, featuring performances by Leonardo DiCaprio (Earnest) and Lily Gladstone (Mollie). This Tuesday, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in collaboration with Apple, hosted a special screening of the film followed by a Q&A with Gladstone and Senior Entertainment Writer at Variety, Angelique Jackson.\n\nGladstone shared with the audience the creative process that brought this film to life, and the unique steps needed to represent this story with \u201caccuracy and dignity\u201d. Earlier in the year, Gladstone made history by becoming the first indigenous person to secure a Golden Globe for Best Actress. Now, Gladstone is the first indigenous woman to nab an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and may be the first to secure the coveted accolade itself.\n\nDuring her acceptance speech for the Golden Globe award, Gladstone commenced by speaking in the Blackfeet language and expressed gratitude to her mother. \u201cEven though she isn\u2019t Blackfeet herself, she dedicated herself tirelessly to ensuring our language found its place in our classrooms, allowing me to have a Blackfeet language teacher while growing up,\u201d Gladstone said.\n\nGiven the profound significance of her own tribe\u2019s native language in her life, it was of particular importance for Gladstone to collaborate with Osage teachers and translators on the script. During the Q&A session, she revealed that numerous revisions were made to the original script to more accurately reflect the Osage language and way of life. Certain dialogues and scenes had to be reimagined so they could be more authentically conveyed in the language.\n\nGladstone remarked that it was so critical that an abundance of care and time was spent working on the Indigenous language in the film because it is a \u201creflection of the people\u2019s relationship to the land, the creatures, the elements that exist in the land and kinship terms.\u201d\n\nGladstone also delved into the pivotal role of the Osage language within the narrative, highlighting its significance in shaping the dynamics between the indigenous community and the white people. With the Osage holding considerable wealth, mastering their language became a powerful tool for the white population. William \u201cKing\u201d Hale (played by Robert De Niro), proficient in Osage, leveraged this skill to forge connections with the natives, exploiting these relationships for personal gain.\n\nHowever, Gladstone pointed out a stark contrast in Mollie\u2019s Husband, Earnest\u2019s, approach to the language. Despite the tragedy that unfolds, the film strives to still depict the love shared between Mollie and Earnest. Earnest\u2019s dedication to learning the language emerges as a gesture of love, a means to bridge the gap and deepen his understanding of Mollie.\n\nIn conversation with Osage people in the making of this movie, they advised the actors and show runners to \u201cremember that Earnest and Mollie loved each other,\u201d Gladstone said. Language, particularly indigenous languages, \u201cintricately defines the social dynamics among individuals,\u201d according to Gladstone.\n\nWhile Gladstone is not of Osage descent, she uniquely understands the value language holds in the preservation of indigenous history and culture.

Li is a Chinese mainland rapper and was the champion of \u201cThe Rap of China\u201d in 2020, a Chinese rap reality show that first aired in 2017.\n\nAt the event, Li (JelloRio) stressed that rap music is a powerful means of expression, but reaching this current stage also necessitates the integration of one\u2019s own culture and content. \u201cRap culture originated from the United States, so when I initially started making rap music, I drew a lot from rappers here,\u201d said Li. \u201cBut at this stage, I want to create something different, something that can represent our own culture, something with a Chinese flair, because making art requires having your own unique features. Blindly imitating others is meaningless.\u201d\n\nLi expressed at the event that music has the power to transcend language and culture, and that conveying culture has gradually become his goal in making music. \u201cWhen I first started making music, it might have been mainly for the enjoyment of the music-making and playing process,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, after gaining some influence, my aim is to integrate some Chinese culture into the music, creating works that can be presented to foreign audiences.\u201d\n\nChinese artist JelloRio (\u674e\u4f73\u9686) (Photo courtesy of Mengqi Huang)\n\nLennox expressed that mixing traditional Chinese instrumentation and culture into music is a significant challenge for Chinese artists. \u201cUtilizing Chinese style and traditional Chinese music, and integrating Chinese musical elements into Western art forms is something I am also pursuing at this stage,\u201d said Lennox. \u201cFor example, Sichuan trap was very popular when it first came out.\u201d\n\nSichuan trap is a subgenre of trap music that emerged from the Sichuan province in China. Trap music originally comes from the Southern United States and is a form of hip-hop characterized by its lyrical content and sound, which includes 808 kick drums, hi-hats, synthesizers, and the \u201ctrap\u201d beat pattern. Sichuan trap incorporates these elements but is distinguished by its use of local Chinese cultural elements, including Sichuan dialect, traditional Chinese instruments, and references to Sichuan culture and lifestyle.\n\nIt has gained popularity in China and among global audiences interested in international hip-hop scenes, showcasing how local artists adapt global music trends to reflect their unique cultural backgrounds. Artists within this genre may blend traditional Chinese music with the aggressive and rhythmic beats of trap, creating a unique sound that resonates with both local and international listeners.\n\nHowever, according to Lennox, there are differences between China and the United States when it comes to the music market and work environment. \u201cThe industry standards for music production in the United States are different in China,\u201d said Lennox. \u201cOne important difference is speed, such as being able to produce a beat for artists to use in a very short time. Chinese artists, on the other hand, prefer to collect beats and then have their own time and space to express themselves.\u201d\n\nLennox\u5b50\u6602 (Photo courtesy of Mengqi Huang)\n\nLennox also mentioned that the Chinese rap market is still growing, which is valuable for artists pursuing their original goal. \u201cThe Chinese music market is at an earlier stage compared to the American music market, with fewer clear rules,\u201d said Lennox. \u201cThis leads to many clients making excessive commercial demands on artists, so for music producers, balancing the market value of music and what the music itself wants to express is very important. Artists need to be guided in a good direction. For artists, maintaining the original intention is very important. There will always be many obstacles and temptations in music production, so those who can keep their original intention are very respectable.\u201d\n\nThe Founder of dop music: Boyang Shi (dopBS) (Photo courtesy of Mengqi Huang)\n\nThe event was co-hosted by dop music, U.S. Southwestern Chinese Students and Scholars Association (\u7f8e\u897f\u5357\u5b66\u8054 SWCSSA), US Overseas Student Union (\u7f8e\u56fd\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u534f\u4f1a\u8054\u76df USOSU), UCLA Chinese Students and Scholars Association (\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u5206\u6821\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u8005\u8054\u5408\u4f1a CSSA), and USC Chinese Students and Scholars Association (\u5357\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u8005\u8054\u5408\u4f1aCSSA), providing international students with the opportunity to engage with artists and participate in cultural exchanges.\n\nAll the group representatives expressed their agreement on the significance of the event and their anticipation for future cultural exchange activities.\n\nThe founder of dop music, Boyang Shi (dopBS) said, \u201cThrough Jialong Li\u2019s sharing and his personal struggle story, we hope to convey a message: Whether it\u2019s music or any form of art, it\u2019s an important way to cross cultural barriers and connect people from different backgrounds. Hip-hop culture, as a global cultural phenomenon, does not belong to any one country or region; it is the common language of young people around the world. We hope this event will serve as a platform to inspire thought, encourage innovation, and promote Sino-US cultural exchange, allowing more young people to express themselves bravely and pursue the realization of their self-worth. Moreover, we look forward to such exchanges deepening the mutual understanding and respect between the younger generations of the two countries, jointly promoting the development of global cultural diversity.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/27/cbb-recap-tier-ranking-march-madness-contenders/", "response": "```\nCBB Recap: Tier-ranking March Madness contenders\n\nAfter the selection committee released its first top-16 ranking, here\u2019s who I think has a real chance to emerge victorious from the tournament gauntlet.\n\nTennessee guard Dalton Knecht (3) congratulates forward Jonas Aidoo (0) as they walk off the court after Aidoo dunked the ball during the second half of an NCAA college basketball game against Texas A&M Saturday, Feb. 24, 2024, in Knoxville, Tenn. (AP/Wade Payne)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington February 27, 2024 at 11:00 pm PST\n\nOn Feb. 17, the NCAA tournament selection committee released its eighth annual \u201cin-season bracket,\u201d which is a ranked list of the committee\u2019s top 16 teams. Since the in-season bracket began, only one national champion (Connecticut in 2023) did not appear in the committee\u2019s top 16, which means 2024\u2032s champion will likely be one of these 16 programs. With a few weeks remaining until the real Selection Sunday, let\u2019s take a look at the committee\u2019s list, both ranked and tiered by how likely they are to be the last team standing.\n\nTier 4: Don\u2019t count on it\n\nThese teams do not meet most of the criteria that past champions have met. Winning it all is technically possible for them, but it would be truly surprising.\n\nNo. 16: Wisconsin Badgers\n\nOn the same afternoon that Wisconsin was announced as the committee\u2019s 16th-ranked team, they lost to an Iowa Hawkeyes team that entered the day with an 0-4 record against ranked opponents and a sub-.500 record in conference play. If the committee waited a few more hours to release their bracket, it\u2019s unlikely that Wisconsin would have made the cut. Granted, the Badgers are battle tested. Per KenPom, Wisconsin has played the fifth-toughest schedule in all of college basketball. However, they have lost many of those battles. They\u2019ve lost five of their last seven games and seem to be losing any chance of finishing the season strongly. Don\u2019t expect Wisconsin to string together six straight wins in March.\n\nNo. 15: Baylor Bears\n\nSince winning the national title in 2021, Baylor has not returned to the Sweet 16, despite earning a top-three seed in each of the last two seasons. The Bears sport a top 10 offense in the country, but their leading scorer, Ja\u2019Kobe Walter, is a true freshman guard with zero March Madness experience. Additionally, their defense ranks well outside of the top 50. Opponents make over half of their 2-pointers against Baylor, which is not a recipe for postseason success. Historically, national championship teams have three things: veteran leadership, defense and size. Considering that Baylor\u2019s tallest upperclassman contributor is a 6-foot-7 forward in Jalen Bridges, it looks like the Bears are missing all three.\n\nNo. 14: Iowa State Cyclones\n\nAgainst unranked opponents, Iowa State has a 19-1 record this season and the Cyclones are a perfect 16-0 at home. That\u2019s impressive, but the NCAA Tournament is not at Iowa State\u2019s James H. Hilton Coliseum and the Cyclones will have to beat top-25 caliber teams en route to a national title. Away from home, Iowa State is just 5-6, and their record against ranked teams is a paltry 3-6. One of their top scorers is a freshman guard and this is the team\u2019s first season with a new offensive system that is much faster than in any other year during T.J. Otzelberger\u2019s tenure as head coach. They may contend in the near future, but this won\u2019t be the Cyclones\u2019 year.\n\nTier 3: It could happen\n\nThese teams meet more of the criteria of past champions, but I am concerned about their play styles or some of this season\u2019s results.\n\nNo. 13: Houston Cougars\n\nHere\u2019s the toughest pick of the list. Houston ranks first in KenPom\u2019s efficiency metric (including the top-ranked defense), and ESPN\u2019s Basketball Power Index currently estimates the Cougars\u2019 title chances at 32.7%. The next best team is at 12.5%. They have essentially secured a 1-seed, and they will be one of the most popular title picks based on advanced analytics. Houston checks many of the boxes that historically indicate championship-level teams and a title is realistically possible. However, Houston has checked the same boxes for the last three seasons with no title to show for it. Each of those three iterations of Cougars possessed a top 10 KenPom defense. Interestingly, those defensive juggernauts were each eliminated by a team ranking in the top 10 offenses, also per KenPom. Will the Cougars be lucky enough to draw six straight tournament games that do not include an elite offense? Those chances are low. After Selection Sunday, pay close attention to Houston\u2019s pathway to the title game and take note of the teams on their side of the bracket who can score at an elite level.\n\nNo. 12: Marquette Golden Eagles\n\nLast season, Marquette shocked the college basketball world by becoming the first team to win both the Big East regular season title and conference tournament since the Villanova Wildcats in 2019. The committee granted the Golden Eagles a 2-seed, but Marquette flamed out in the round of 32 against the Michigan State Spartans. This season, Marquette is no longer atop the Big East standings, and they have generally taken a slight step back. Olivier-Maxence Prosper declared for the NBA draft instead of coming back for his senior season and his absence has been felt on the offensive side of the ball. It is rare for a team that has regressed since its previous season to win a title.\n\nNo. 11: Kansas Jayhawks\n\nMuch like Iowa State, Kansas looks like a different team away from home. The Jayhawks are 5-6 outside of Allen Fieldhouse and they are simply less dependable compared to the other elite teams. Although they possess wins against impressive teams on this list like Houston and Iowa State, Kansas has also lost to weak Big 12 opponents, such as West Virginia and UCF. On Tuesday night, Kansas lost to BYU at home and about two weeks ago, Texas Tech blew out the Jayhawks by 29 points. On a year by year basis, Kansas is consistently elite. However, their results this season have been unpredictable enough that it\u2019s hard to believe they will have six straight solid performances in the tournament.\n\nNo. 10: Connecticut Huskies\n\nThe Huskies are the defending champions, and they currently have the shortest odds of winning this season\u2019s title, according to the major sportsbooks. So, why do I have them ranked tenth? The last team to win back-to-back titles was the 2007 Florida Gators, who had six future NBA players on their roster. Unless the Huskies just picked up Joakim Noah from the transfer portal, their talents don\u2019t compare to that Florida squad. Winning two years in a row is rare for a reason.\n\nTier 2: Strong contenders\n\nAny of these teams could feasibly find themselves cutting down the nets in March.\n\nNo. 9: San Diego State Aztecs\n\nSan Diego State proved that they were built for the postseason when they made it all the way to the title game last season. Despite being a mid-major school, the Aztecs do not play down to weaker competition. In fact, the last time San Diego State lost a game to an opponent outside of Quadrant 1 was on Jan. 14 to New Mexico... in 2023! San Diego State is 14-0 in Quadrants 2 through 4 this year and their 5-7 record in Quad 1 is more than respectable for a non-Power 6 team. The Aztecs have a borderline top-10 defense, and if they draw the right opponents in the tournament, they are more than capable of another big run.\n\nNo. 8: Illinois Fighting Illini\n\nAccording to KenPom, Illinois has the fourth-most efficient offense in the nation, and all three of their leading scorers are seniors, including Terrence Shannon, a 6-foot-6 guard who scores 22 points per game. Illinois had a weak loss to Penn State last Wednesday and has yet to secure a big, signature win, but they have two opportunities next week: Wisconsin on the road and Purdue at home. If Illinois wins one of those games and has a strong showing in the Big Ten Tournament, they will be a popular Final Four pick. Not only do they have an experienced star guard, but they could have positive momentum headed into the postseason and a lot to prove.\n\nNo. 7: Arizona Wildcats\n\nThe last time a team from the West Coast won a national title was Arizona in 1997. Can they do it again 27 years later? Last season as a 2-seed, the Wildcats flamed out in the first round in a shocking upset to Princeton, and this year\u2019s squad already has as many regular season losses as last season. However, they meet all the criteria for a championship-caliber team. For one, they are arguably the most experienced team in the country. Four of their five starters are seniors, including star transfer Caleb Love, who led North Carolina to the national championship game two seasons ago. Additionally, they have started the same five-player lineup in all 27 games so far this season, so chemistry is not a problem. If Arizona can advance through the first round and rid themselves of their easy-upset reputation, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nNo. 6: Auburn Tigers\n\nAgainst Auburn, opponents shoot 38.4% from the field and 29.6% from three. In layman\u2019s terms, offenses forget how to make shots against the Tigers. Auburn has proved itself as the toughest team in the country by destroying SEC teams all season long. The team beat South Carolina by 40, Ole Miss by 23, Alabama by 18,and LSU by 15. In fact, all of their 21 wins have been by double digits. The Tigers\u2019 closest win was an eleven-point victory against Texas A&M in which Auburn held the lead for the last eight minutes. They\u2019ve lost six games, but all were against Quad 1 opponents. After their matchup against Tennessee this Wednesday, we\u2019ll know more about how Auburn plays against the upper echelon.\n\nNo. 5: Purdue Boilermakers\n\nIt\u2019s easy to clown on Purdue after how many disappointing tournament exits the program has suffered recently, but the Boilermakers have played as well as anyone this season. They\u2019re 25-3, have three different win streaks of six games (the number of rounds in the tournament) and are led by the best player in college basketball: Zach Edey. KenPom ranks their offense as second-best in the country, in large part due to Edey\u2019s easy 23 points per game, but the Boilermakers\u2019 supporting cast has also stepped up. As a team, Purdue shoots north of 40% from three, which will be crucial to their success in the tournament. An off shooting night would derail Purdue, and a team from the Big 10 hasn\u2019t won a title in over 20 years, but purely based on this season\u2019s results, Purdue has as good a chance as anyone.\n\nTier 1: My final four\n\nGiven an average draw in the NCAA Tournament, the following teams would be my picks for the Final Four.\n\nNo. 4: Duke Blue Devils\n\nGive or take a few unspecial seasons, it feels like Duke is always in the mix for a national title and this year is no different. Duke lost this past Saturday to Wake Forest, but they have generally been great against good and bad teams alike. In Quadrant 1, Duke is 6-3, including wins against Baylor and Michigan State away from home. The Blue Devils rank 12th in three-point percentage on offense while also allowing opponents to make less than a third of their threes. The game has evolved to the point of teams living and dying by the three and Duke will have the advantage beyond the arc on both sides of the ball against most teams. Additionally, the Blue Devils have only lost three games on the road and seem to have the composure that will allow them to thrive in hectic environments in March.\n\nNo. 3: North Carolina Tar Heels\n\nCould we see a third Duke-UNC matchup this season in the Final Four? Both teams are leagues above the rest of the ACC and seem like they have found their footing under their new generation of head coaches. Senior guard RJ Davis leads the Tar Heels\u2019 offense with more than 20 points per game, while senior forward Armando Bacot leads a top ten defense in the country. They\u2019re experienced, big and have already challenged themselves with one of the hardest schedules in the country. Out of all the \u201cBlue Bloods,\u201d Duke and North Carolina are the best this season and both are in prime position to cut down the nets.\n\nNo. 2: Alabama Crimson Tide\n\nLast season, Alabama was the number one overall seed after eventual No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 draft Brandon Miller\u2019s dominant regular season. However, in March, Miller and the Crimson Tide fell apart. San Diego State knocked them out in the Sweet 16, while Miller scored only nine points and made three of his 19 shot attempts. Without experience, a team is bound to fall apart, and Miller was a freshman one-and-done NBA prospect. This year, Alabama\u2019s 20 point-per-game scorer, Mark Sears, is a senior who has started 104 games in his collegiate career. As a team, Alabama has one of the most efficient offenses in the country, per KenPom. They have the talent and they have the experience, too.\n\nNo. 1: Tennessee Volunteers\n\nIf every team was guaranteed an equally difficult path in the NCAA Tournament, the Tennessee Volunteers would be my pick to win it all. Dalton Knecht, the Volunteers\u2019 senior guard, averages 20 points per game and is the most versatile scorer in the country. In the postseason, given that each team must face a variety of different defensive coverages, Tennessee has the tools to have success against all of them. Knecht is elite in isolation, can score at all three levels and moves without the ball better than anyone. As a team, Tennessee has built a 16-1 record outside of Quadrant 1, and has wins against Alabama, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. Based on their strong performances away from home and against tougher opponents, the Volunteers appear to have the personnel to survive against every type of team. It will depend on their matchups, which we won\u2019t know until Selection Sunday, but Tennessee currently has the best chance to win the NCAA Tournament this season.\n```"}

(Photo by Kim Ly)\n\nBy Kim Ly\nFebruary 27, 2024 at 10:11 pm PST\n\nIn a close race won by 152 votes, Bryan Fernandez and Brianna Sanchez were announced tonight as president and vice president, respectively, for USC\u2019s Undergraduate Student Body for the 2024-25 school year. Fernandez and Sanchez ran on a \u201cC.A.R.E\u201d platform that stood for community, accessibility, representation and equity.\n\nTheir first plans as president and vice president will be to ensure the accessibility of USG to students. \u201c... One of the biggest parts is going to be budget allocation,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to be meeting with our newly appointed cabinet, and also ourselves, seeing what we can do to allocate that to the best of our abilities. We want to really focus on student basic needs [and] trying to see how we can incorporate line items and how much discretion we have with allocation.\u201d\n\nThe duo also emphasized a focus on reaching out to students and crossing that bridge between the student government versus the student body. \u201cWe look forward to reaching out to as many of you as possible to ensure that USG is more transparent and more worried about USG getting around to students,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\nUntil their official appointment in the fall 2024 semester, Fernandez and Sanchez plan to establish their cabinet to get things running in the coming months. This year, 4,306 students participated in voting during the presidential and senatorial election, which is an increase of 201 votes from last year\u2019s turnout. Of the 4,306 students who voted, 4,099 casted a ballot in the presidential race.\n\nAccording to USG\u2019s election code, the ticket that receives over 50% of the vote wins the election. With USG\u2019s new ranked-choice voting format, the winning ticket needed 2,050 votes to win. Since none of the tickets won the majority of the votes, the second-choice votes from the ballot with the fewest first choice votes were allocated to the rest of the tickets. The votes were then retallied with the additional votes.\n\nFernandez and Sanchez won with 1,504 first-choice votes and 596 of the reallocated second-choice votes, a total of 2,100 votes. Sam Stack and Christian Shaw followed in second with 1,564 first-choice votes and 384 second choice votes, a total of 1,948 votes. Julianna Melendez and Klarissa Palacios finished third with 1,031 first-choice votes. Out of the 1,031 ballots casting Melendez and Palacios first, 980 second-choice votes were reallocated; 51 students abstained.\n\nThe results of USG\u2019s senatorial race were also announced Tuesday. Since only 11 students ran for the 12 positions, every nominee was granted a seat. The next chief justice and executive cabinet will decide whether a special election will be held for the 12th seat or if the seat will remain vacant. From ascending vote order, the meeting confirmed that the 2024-25 USG Senate will consist of Heydy Vasquez, Patrick Nguyen, Mikaela Bautista, Diana Carpio, Brandon Tavakoli, Seva Raman, Jackalyn Karamanougian, Dane Sprague, Jeremiah Boisrond, Elija Martice Barnes and Akshay Manglani.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/27/fernandez-sanchez-clinch-victory-in-usg-presidential-and-vice-presidential-race/", "response": "```\nFernandez-Sanchez clinch victory in USG presidential and vice presidential race\n\nBy Quinten Seghers February 27, 2024 at 7:45 pm PST\n\nThe results are in: Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidate Bryan Fernandez and vice president candidate Brianna Sanchez have won the election by 152 votes. The duo campaigned on creating an administration that provides a voice for different campus communities. Additionally, they said they aim to create a USC that \u201cC.A.R.E.S about our students,\u201d with the acronym spelling out community, accessibility, representation and equity.\n\nThis election cycle marks the first time USG has deviated from the plurality voting system. This year, ranked-choice voting was adopted for the presidential contest. In a ranked-choice voting system, instead of casting a ballot for one top choice, voters can rank multiple candidates. Voters select which candidate is their first choice, then which one is their second choice and so on until every single candidate has been ranked.\n\n\u201cI think ranked choice voting was a huge success this year,\u201d USG Chief Justice Nivea Krishnan wrote in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cWe reached comparable turnout levels to previous years despite having an entirely different voting interface and process, and I think that speaks to the quality of our USG-led outreach by our Judicial Council, Communications Department, and every USG member who helped get out the vote.\u201d\n\nThe ranked-choice voting also comes with a majority voting rule. In majority voting, a winner is only declared when a candidate wins more than half of all votes cast. If none of the candidates reach a majority, then students\u2019 second-ranked votes are taken into account, which is what happened in this election cycle.\n\nThe total number of votes cast for this race was 4,099, meaning that a presidential ticket needed at least 2,050 votes to win, per the new majority voting system. However, none of the presidential tickets reached that threshold \u2014 that\u2019s where ranked-choice voting comes into play.\n\nTo break the impasse and determine a winner in a ranked-choice and majority voting, the ticket that receives the fewest first-choice votes gets eliminated \u2014 which was Julianna Melendez and Klarissa Palacios. All the votes that ranked Melendez and Palacios first were redistributed to the other candidates based on their second-choice ranking. Of those 1,031 votes, 596 went to Fernandez and Sanchez and 384 votes went to Sam Stack and Christian Shaw. Another 51 of those ballots didn\u2019t rank any other candidate, so these votes were not redistributed.\n\nThe votes were then retallied, leaving Fernandez and Sanchez with a total of 2,100 votes. Stack and Shaw ended up with 1,948. This pushed Fernandez and Sanchez past the 2,050 majority threshold to become next year\u2019s USG president and vice president.\n\nFernandez and Sanchez received 1,504 first-ranked votes, Stack and Shaw received 1,564 first-ranked votes and Melendez and Palacios received 1,031 first-ranked votes. Although Stack and Shaw received the most first-place votes, they did not reach the 2,050 votes needed to win.\n\nUSG formerly used plurality voting to determine its presidential winners. Plurality voting is when voters only cast a ballot for their top choice candidate. Whichever candidate wins the most votes overall -- even if it\u2019s only by a single vote -- wins the election.\n\nSanchez, a sophomore majoring in legal studies, said in a past interview with Annenberg Media that she wants to ensure the legislative process runs smoothly and that free testing for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 a program she pushed for alongside USG senator Rudra Saigal \u2014 continues.\n\nFernandez, a sophomore studying public policy, wants to change the format of the campus town hall meetings to make them more welcoming and comfortable. In a previous interview with Annenberg Media, Fernandez pointed out that students may feel \u201cintimidated\u201d by the current format.\n\nFor the senatorial race, there were 12 open spots for the 2024-2025 senate, but only 11 students ran. All 11 candidates were elected.\n\nHeavy rains partially impacted voting for the 2024 USG election last week, as all four polling locations were temporarily moved inside. Additionally, one of the food vendors \u2014 that USG commissioned to offer students a free treat if they showed proof of voting \u2014 had to come back another day, thereby temporarily stripping students of their ability to enjoy shaved ice.\n\nIn an effort to boost voter turnout, USG extended the voting period from Friday, Feb. 23, to Sunday, Feb. 25. On Sunday evening, USG posted on their Instagram and sent out a mass email to all undergraduate students that \u201cten lucky voters\u201d will receive a $100 Amazon gift card.\n\n\u201cI think turnout could have reached historic highs if more work was done by candidates to reach out to [Recognized Student Organizations] and cultural assemblies during the campaign period,\u201d Krishnan wrote. \u201cCandidate visibility was lower than in past years, and I think the extra final push that the Judicial Council had to make during the voting period speaks to the fact that candidates and the way they campaign play an outsized role in driving voter turnout.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s total voter turnout of 4,306 ballots is slightly higher than the 2023 election, in which 4,105 ballots were cast.

From the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 Tim Mayza serving as a bat boy to the Baltimore Orioles winning on a walk-off, the first weekend of spring training was filled with noteworthy moments, including for my own Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nYankees look to bounce back\nAfter failing to make the playoffs last season, the New York Yankees seem determined to turn their fortunes around. They bolstered their roster by acquiring outfielder Juan Soto from the San Diego Padres and it seems to be paying off. The Yankees earned their first win, a 12-6 result against the Bluejays, in which Soto got his first home run. Additionally, he went 2-2 with three RBIs. The Yankees secured another impressive win against the Detroit Tigers, beating them 22-10. Top Yankees prospect and No. 84 overall in baseball per MLB Pipeline, Spencer Jones went 3-3 with one home run and four RBIs.\n\nThe Yankees appear ready to contend seriously this season after a disappointing 2023. They\u2019re already a stacked team with players like outfielder Aaron Judge and first baseman Anthony Rizzo, so with the addition of outfielder Alex Verdugo along with young talent like Jones, the Yankees should make the playoffs with relative ease.\n\nYoung Orioles don\u2019t miss a beat\nThe Orioles had an electrifying win over the Red Sox on Saturday, winning 4-3 on a two-run walk-off homer by outfielder Colton Cowser. According to MLB Pipeline, Cowser is the No. 19 prospect and he showcased his talent in this game-saving at-bat. In addition to their talents for the future, a current MLB star, Corbin Burnes posted a standout Orioles debut. He\u2019s a new addition to the squad, as the Orioles acquired him from the Brewers. While he only pitched one inning, the Red Sox went scoreless and Burnes struck out two batters.\n\nOn the other side of the plate, young catcher Adley Rutschman is living up to the hype, blasting a home run in his first at-bat. From his batting to his fielding, he was on fire, further highlighted by an out in which he and No. 1 prospect and shortstop Jackson Holliday threw out first baseman Bobby Dalbec on a stolen base attempt. The Orioles have an absurd four top 50 prospects in their lineup. If this game proved anything, it\u2019s that the Orioles future is bright if their prospects are already producing.\n\nDodgers hit dingers\nSurprisingly, the highlight of the weekend for my fellow Los Angeles Dodgers fans wasn\u2019t the Veteran players. Although they performed well\u2014signaling a promising season ahead for the team\u2014what peaked interest was their dominant 14-1 victory over the San Diego Padres. Many of the players who started aren\u2019t traditional starters. Second baseman Chris Owens went 1-2 with two RBIs, while outfielder Jose Ramos posted the exact same line with two RBIs.\n\nThe Dodgers exhibited surprising depth that suggests support for their established veteran lineup, potentially easing concerns about their future. In another notable event, pitcher Tyler Glasnow made his debut against the Los Angeles Angels\u2014but it wasn\u2019t a very good one. He pitched one-and-two-thirds innings and gave up one hit and four runs in that short stretch. This shouldn\u2019t be a major concern, it\u2019s the first game of the season after all, but Dodger fans are probably hoping this isn\u2019t another Noah Syndergaard situation.\n\nDon\u2019t lose your fantasy football league\nIn some funny news, left-handed pitcher Tim Mayza from the Toronto Blue Jays had to work as a bat boy for the first three innings at their game against the Philadelphia Phillies. This was apparently his punishment for losing the Blue Jays fantasy football league. He came last in the league with a record of 4-10, so while he was being a batboy, he had to wear a jersey with 4-10 on the back. Blue Jays Manager John Scheider poked fun at him when talking about his expectations for him being a bat boy \u201cWe\u2019re looking for proper form to and from, putting bats in the right rack,\u201d Schneider said in an interview with MLB.com. \u201cIf my 6-year-old could do it last year, Tim should be ok.\u201d While it seemed like a good joke, it turns out that the Blue Jays should\u2019ve been more focused on the game. The Phillies had a huge, 10-run fifth inning, ultimately winning the game 14-13.\n```"}

With an investment of $20 million into new technology and artificial intelligence, the time of day, your location, and even the amount of customers in-line could all affect how much you pay. So, how will customers react to these fluctuating prices? We took to our local Wendy\u2019s to find out.\n\nEllen Sheehan, a Wendy\u2019s customer, shared why she chooses to eat at Wendy\u2019s: \u201cBeing a single mom full-time college student, they have lots of good deals, so I can get a decent amount of food for less expensive and it\u2019s also better quality than like other fast food restaurants.\u201d However, Sheehan feels that given the surge in prices, she will look for alternative places to eat. \u201cBecause if alleged already is already $9 and the search goes up, I\u2019m going to spend $12 I\u2019m not going to come to a fast food place I\u2019ll go somewhere else.\u201d\n\nFor other customers, like Alander Pulliam, budgeting is very important to them and they value predictability in prices. \u201cI live off of budget. So when I come I expect the price that I see if it\u2019s changes every moment, you get a massive amount of people or short amount people. It goes against my, my budgeting system.\u201d And no matter how good the food is, Pulliam shared that he will only eat at places that fit his budget. \u201cI would definitely choose another place to go to eat. You know, I would hate not to eat because I love the baked potatoes, but for the price if you know, I gotta make what fits my budget.\u201d\n\nBut how will Wendy\u2019s new dynamic pricing strategy affect those who heavily rely on fast food as a primary source of nutrition? We spoke to Dr. Cary Kreutzer, USC Professor of Clinical Gerontology and Pediatrics and dietician for 42 years. \u201cPeople with money, will, will say it\u2019s fine, you know what I\u2019m ready to eat now. But I think for lower-income families that are on a tight budget, I think they probably will learn the system, almost better than people that aren\u2019t on a tight budget. And instead of a frosty, they\u2019ll have a McFlurry across the street.\u201d\n\nKreutzer\u2019s insight highlights an essential aspect of this conversation: the impact of fast food availability and affordability on community health, especially in low-income areas. \u201cAnd if you look at the area surrounding USC, as you know, South Central LA, the food deserts and if we look at social determinants of health, which is a really important concept for students and others to recognize the social determinants of health basically say that if you live in a zip code that has poor housing, has poor access to grocery stores, has high stress level, has poor employment rates has schools that don\u2019t score as high that people in that community, they\u2019re gonna live 20 years less than the zip code where I live.\u201d\n\nAs we discuss the implications of Wendy\u2019s pricing experiment, it is clear that the fast-food industry\u2019s role in our daily lives and its influence on our health and wallets remains a hot topic. On one hand, dynamic pricing could lead to healthier consumer choices, while on the other, it risks alienating customers and exacerbating food insecurity among vulnerable populations.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sethan Perez.\n```"}

With a 99% survival rate for cancers caught in stage one according to a RadNet press release, access to screening technology is crucial for a better outcome.\n\nBy Robert Westermann and Makena Arteaga\nFebruary 27, 2024 at 6:01 pm PST\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to Walmart, you\u2019ve likely seen a host of restaurants inside, like Subway or Wendy\u2019s. Now, Walmart\u2019s dabbling in an entirely different field. Back in December, Walmart launched its first MammogramNow center in its Superstore in Milford, Delaware. The center, which is operated by the radiology provider RadNet, offers basic mammogram screenings to Walmart shoppers who can then use that screening to seek further primary care if necessary.\n\nDr. Shawana Moore, a member of the Women\u2019s Health Advisory Council at HealthyWomen, said that the centers break down accessibility barriers including time and money, but most importantly increase the number of early detections of breast cancer. Shawana also said that by offering a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for women, they can get several tasks done in a single trip.\n\nShawana: Now that helps with them being able to do multiple things, including care for them, their families, by getting the groceries that they need, or clothing they may need or necessities they may need, but also being able to use that same time to then get your screening mammogram.\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with breast cancer, early detection is crucial for better management and better outcomes, said Shawana. In addition to its accessibility, RadNet\u2019s partnership with Walmart deals directly with issues of equity and diversity.\n\nShawana: I think equity was at the forefront of this, if not explicitly said, partnering with Walmart, knowing that Walmart clarifies for or serves a diverse population of women, equity was at the key of this.\n\nWithin its first month of opening, the Milford location identified one true-positive mammogram. Through early detection, that woman can then go on and seek the appropriate treatment while not having to worry about any responsibility from the screening received at MammogramNow.\n\nDue to the success of the pilot location, RadNet has plans for expansion in the near future, said Tim Merchant, National Director of Screening Networks and Population Health Strategy at RadNet.\n\nMerchant: We think there\u2019s a wonderful future for this. We are investing a significant amount of money right now into the technology, and to help facilitate operations like this.\n\nNext time you go shopping at your local Walmart, keep your eyes out for the newest mammogram screening location. According to a RadNet press release, Walmart shopper Dierdre Bell puts it simply.\n\nBell: You come here to get clothes, food, medicine. Why not a mammogram?\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Robert Westermann.\n```"}

(Photo by Wyatt Murell)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi, Dylan Luden and Qais Adawiya\nFebruary 27, 2024 at 5:51 pm PST\n\nLAPD arrested at least three suspects on Monday near the USC Village, blocking off the intersection of S. Hoover St. and W. 32nd St. and drawing assault rifles and handguns, according to a video obtained by Annenberg Media. The incident happened around 3 p.m. right outside the USC Caruso Catholic Center.\n\nAccording to DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle, LAPD attempted to detain two suspects in connection with a grand theft. At least five police cars barricaded the intersection, with one car facing sideways to stop oncoming traffic.\n\nA video of the incident taken by student Wyatt Murell gained traction online after it was posted onto the Barstool USC instagram account, where it has garnered around 72,000 views in 18 hours.\n\n\u201cWhen I was walking out [of Bank of America], I realized that there are a bunch of cops with their guns out aimed at these people,\u201d said Murrell, a junior studying business administration. \u201cI walked out and just pretty much immediately started recording everything I saw.\u201d\n\nThe video also shows LAPD officers standing behind the doors of their vehicles with their guns drawn and an LAPD helicopter flying overhead.

Two of the suspects approached the unidentified victim and demanded her purse while the remaining suspect kept watch on the opposite side of the street, according to the alert. One of the suspects allegedly revealed a black handgun to the victim. The suspects struggled with the victim but ultimately failed to take the purse and subsequently ran away on foot towards Figueroa Street from 27th Street.\n\nThe incident has left residents of Annenberg House feeling rattled. \u201cI\u2019m pretty terrified now to walk home alone at night. Especially considering that this attempted robbery was in broad daylight,\u201d said Alexandra Goldberg, a graduate journalism student who lives at Annenberg House.\n\nUSC DPS sent out the crime alert through email shortly after the attempted robbery took place on Monday evening. The suspects have not been taken into custody, and the victim was not injured, according to DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle. \u201cThe suspects escaped, so there\u2019s still a possible threat,\u201d said Carlisle. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re in the area, or they could have fled the entire neighborhood, but there\u2019s no update at this time.\u201d\n\nStudents residing at Annenberg House reported seeing the victim with campus police following the incident. \u201cShe was definitely shaken up for sure. And the police officers looked concerned,\u201d said Michael Kittilson, a graduate student studying public relations who lives at Annenberg House. \u201cYou could tell that they were doing a really thorough job to make sure that they got a good idea of who the suspects were so that they could...make sure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nGoldberg did not see the robbery take place and doesn\u2019t know who the victim is. \u201cI\u2019m in a house group chat. No one even made mention of the attempted robberies. So I\u2019m a little bit in the dark on, you know, who was affected,\u201d said Goldberg.\n\nGoldberg and Kittilson said that security for Annenberg House should improve. \u201cI\u2019d like to see it increase a little bit more. But I think, since it\u2019s on the outskirts, it\u2019s really difficult for campus police to be everywhere at once,\u201d said Kittilson. Goldberg said she lacks complete confidence in Yellow Jackets, USC\u2019s security ambassadors, but still feels safer with them around. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of those Yellow Jackets patrolling the area. In my opinion, I think that the shifts that they work are inconsistent,\u201d said Goldberg. \u201cI don\u2019t always see them. I don\u2019t know that if there was an altercation, that the yellow-jackets would be able to de-escalate it.\u201d\n\nJournalism graduate student and Annenberg House resident Hien Nguyen said security for the building seemed thorough. \u201cWhen I moved in, I felt safe in the sense that, you know, you have to be a resident in some capacity to be able to enter.\u201d This is Nguyen\u2019s first year living in L.A., and said this is why she was cautious about this situation. \u201cI always heard from my friends, like, \u2018Hey, like, you should be careful when you go out at night.\u2019 Hearing something like this, that\u2019s happening in broad daylight...it\u2019s really scary.\u201d\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/02/27/an-evening-on-self-love-with-common/", "response": "```\nAn evening on self-love with Common\n\nThe line outside of Bovard Auditorium was long, the kind that makes your heart drop when you\u2019re in the back. A legion of fans of elder hip-hop statesmen, actor, activist, and author, Common, packed the auditorium. The room buzzed with excitement as they waited to see Common discussing his newest book, \u201cAnd Then We Rise: A Guide to Self-Love and Taking Care of Oneself,\u201d with award-winning journalist and founding director of the USC Charlotta Bass Lab, Dr. Allissa Richardson. Dr Richardson was also set to present Common with the 2nd Annual Charlotta Bass Media Trailblazer Award.\n\nAs people spilled into the auditorium, Common hung out backstage. He greeted some of the Charlotta Bass Lab fellows before speaking to Annenberg reporter Maya Broomfield about the journey to self-love that he details in his book.\n\n\u201cI really found something that I love to do that allowed me to feel confident in myself, which was music and properly expressing myself in that way really allowed me to learn things about myself. But that didn\u2019t totally build my belief and love for self. So I started that quest of loving self like making it intentional, as you say, because it does take work now.\u201d said Common during the backstage interview.\n\nIn the book Common intimately shares his journey towards wellness and self-love and how it played a role in his success: it\u2019s split into four sections that focus on distinct lessons. \u201cThe Food\u201d focuses on nutrition. \u201cThe Body\u201d focuses on fitness. \u201cThe Mind\u201d focuses on mental health. And \u201cThe Soul\u201d focuses on perhaps the most profound thing of all\u2014spiritual well-being.\n\nWhen the time came for Common to take the stage with Dr Richardson, the audience erupted with applause. It was one of many crowd eruptions as Common\u2019s humor kept them laughing throughout the night, making jokes while sharing personal stories and pouring knowledge into the crowd. Common answered questions about his background growing up in Chicago, his love for music, his first supporters, how he cultivated a community of care and intention for positive messages, how he chooses collaborations, the creative process for his book writing, his activism, and the lessons he learned from his dad.\n\nWhile Common was sharing about the first moment he fell in love with hip hop he treated fans to a snippet from the first rap he ever wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ll let me tell you about a trip, a time ago. I was going there to run a Cold blooded show. When I got there I saw some people jamming too. They called themselves, the Bon Hill crew. Dr Ice, Romeo, and M\u00e1ster E All the Bonne Hill Crew, rapping to a tee. I asked them could they rock with me.\u201d Common rapped in his signature style.\n\nFollowing their discussion. Dr. Richardson presented Common with the Media Trailblazer award. With the first award previously bestowed to journalist Nikole Hannah Jones, Dr. Richardson addressed the decision making. \u201cI know you may be wondering why we\u2019re giving a musical artist a journalism award, but as great philosopher Chuck D once said,\u201d said Richardson as made eye contact with Common, anticipating his finishing of the phrase. \u201cHip-hop is Black America\u2019s CNN.\u201d they said in unison.\n\nThe crowd erupted with supportive hoots, hollers, and applause. Eventually, Common took audience questions and eager attendees lined up. One attendee, before asking their question, felt compelled to share that the biggest lesson they got from Common was to treat everyone with respect \u2013 like they are important.\n\nAfter receiving the award and delighting the crowd with another impromptu rap, the event transitioned to the book signing portion. Dozens of his fans lined up with giddy anticipation to have their book signed and to take a picture with the inspiring entertainer. Common seemed to beam almost as much as each person that shared a moment with him.\n\n\u201cAnd Then We Rise: A Journey to Self Love and Taking Care of Oneself\u201d can be found at the USC bookstore for $30.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/27/the-business-of-indonesian-flavors-with-chef-zen-ong/", "response": "```\nZen Ong, chef and founder of specialty food experiences, Inda and Awan, first left Australia and came to L.A. in 2015 to help a friend open up a business. Nine years, two businesses and some really good \u201cnot ice cream\u201d later, Ong is still in L.A. serving up nostalgic Indonesian flavors in West Hollywood.\n\nIn a fireside chat held by USC Flavors and the USC Association of Indonesian Students (ASIS) on February 22, Ong opened up on his experiences as the owner of two small businesses and his journey as an Indonesian chef. Ong\u2019s start as a chef began in his local hometown in Sydney, Australia, starting off at local restaurants before building his way up to Bentley in Sydney.\n\nAfter several years of working in the food industry, Ong noticed the absence of Indonesian fine dining. Now, it\u2019s his life\u2019s goal to create an Indonesian restaurant with a Michelin star. \u201cFor me, I noticed that there\u2019s a couple of [Indonesian] restaurants that are fine dining globally and their main focus would be \u2018Let\u2019s mix Indonesian food with French or Italian\u2019 and I was never a big fan of that,\u201d Ong said.\n\nHis first business venture was Inda, a series of pop-up dinner experiences hosted around L.A. serving 12 dishes that show off the diverse flavors of Indonesia\u2019s many regions. The aim was to create feelings of nostalgia while presenting Indonesian food in a new, innovative way. The pop-up\u2019s first night sold out, and when Ong walked out to greet the guests, he was hit with the biggest compliment: endless comparisons of his Indonesian food to their family\u2019s versions.\n\n\u201cThe criticism was comparing me to their mom or grandma. To me, this is like comparing me to Michael Jordan. As long as you put me in this bracket, it\u2019s a win,\u201d Ong said.\n\nAfter Inda came the creation of Awan, a dessert shop created by Ong and co-owner, Tohm Ifergan. \u201cAwan, in a lot of ways, was just meant to be me dipping my toes into the water of owning a restaurant in L.A.,\u201d Ong said. Awan is hidden in an alleyway in West Hollywood selling scoops, pints and quarts of what they call \u201cnot ice cream.\u201d Awan, meaning \u201ccloud\u201d in Bahasa, uses Indonesian coconut to create a creamy, frozen dessert akin to ice cream. Though, they\u2019re not legally allowed to call it ice cream since their product doesn\u2019t contain any dairy, therefore, they\u2019re \u201cnot ice cream.\u201d\n\nRegardless of their product name, it\u2019s undoubtedly delicious. Awan\u2019s silken smooth texture and delectable flavors can be attributed to Ong\u2019s emphasis on quality ingredients. Their Gaviota Strawberry uses strawberries that come straight from Harry\u2019s Berries in Oxnard, California while their famous Balinese Vanilla Bean sources vanilla from Bali, Indonesia. These flavors change approximately bi-weekly and are decided upon through access to seasonal, local produce and memories of Indonesia.\n\n\u201cNostalgia is a massive inspiration for us,\u201d Ong said. \u201cNostalgia is a simple thing to chase but a difficult thing to tap in.\u201d\n\nDespite their current success and expansive menu, Awan started out with nothing but $30,000 and a single freezer. Originally, Awan wasn\u2019t meant to be a storefront but rather an ecommerce business or a vending machine that sold exclusively Balinese Vanilla Bean pints and quarts to consumers to bring home. After realizing the idea wasn\u2019t feasible, Ong took up a location opportunity from co-owner Ifergan. Thus, Awan was officially established, tucked away at a take-out window next to Ifergan\u2019s cafe, Dayglow Coffee.\n\n\u201cI still, to this day, believe that foot traffic is important. But, if the product and the experience is good enough ... people will come,\u201d Ong said.\n\nDuring Awan\u2019s inception, Ong originally ignored the creative aspect. Ong\u2019s opinion only changed after Ifergan convinced him of the importance of branding and design. Thus came the creation of Awan\u2019s logo, a pixelated serif font with Awan in all-caps.\n\n\u201cWe told people we were loading through COVID, so everything\u2019s pixelated. And once we finally opened, it\u2019d be fully crispy and good,\u201d Ong said. \u201cWe fell in love with the idea that we\u2019re always loading and always changing, so we just kept it pixelated.\u201d\n\nWith branding, flavors and a storefront set and ready to go, Awan officially opened in Sept. 2021. On opening day, not only was it flooded with interest from friends and family but also journalists and food critics.\n\n\u201cWe had the L.A. Times come in on day one and I was like aw, we\u2019re set,\u201d Ong said. \u201cI thought we were going to crush L.A.; we were going to have five stores across L.A. and then we\u2019ll have an exit strategy with Nestle.\u201d\n\nBut like the majority of small businesses in L.A., Ong faced a lot of difficulties. A wet winter slowed down foot traffic and rising rent costs loomed over the store. Ong made several financial decisions such as being Awan\u2019s single worker to cut costs; with savings and a one-man team, Awan was able to survive the year.\n\nThe dessert shop has been growing everyday since then, serving customers with never-seen-before Indonesian flavors and fun collaborations such Steve Lacy\u2019s Gemini Rights flavor which combines Filipino Ube with the all-American classic: the Oreo cookie.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s much more interesting to go down the path of giving people something they can\u2019t get anywhere else,\u201d Ong said. \u201cWe would do collab[oration]s with fine dining chefs, pastry chefs, etc. ... we wanted to give that experience you wouldn\u2019t get at other ice cream shops.\u201d\n\nLooking towards the future of Awan, Ong has his sights on global endeavors. Currently, they\u2019re making deals with investors in the U.K. and developing licensing deals in Mexico. The long term goal is to have a coconut farm and distribution center in Indonesia which will give back to the Indonesian community and provide jobs.\n\nFor Trojans looking to open a food business, Ong emphasizes the importance of being realistic and understanding the struggles that come with being a small business owner. \u201cBe strategic with it. At the end of the day, it is business. You will lose friendships, you will make friendships. [But] you need to make money at the end of the day to be viable. If you can do it doing something you love, that\u2019s [the] best case scenario,\u201d Ong said.\n\nAnd for Trojans trying to figure out how to know if an ice cream shop (or a \u201cnot ice cream\u201d shop) is good or not, Ong recommends getting vanilla. \u201cAny time you go get ice cream, you try the vanilla and it\u2019ll set the tone for what the rest of the menu is going to be like,\u201d Ong said.\n\nInda is currently not accepting reservations. Awan can be found on 866 Huntley Dr. in West Hollywood, right next to Dayglow Coffee.\n```"}

(AP/David Zalubowski)\n\nBy James Bao February 27, 2024 at 2:04 pm PST\n\n\u201cTriple Threat\u201d is a column by James Bao in which he covers trends in the NBA through an analytical lens. It\u2019s time to talk about Scoot Henderson. \u201cI think I have the ability to go No. 1,\u201d Henderson said in an interview at the Draft Combine last year, before the Portland Trail Blazers eventually picked him third overall. The former G League guard came in at 6-foot-3, weighing 202 pounds \u2014 fairly typical NBA guard measurements. But his athleticism made him stand out, drawing comparisons to explosive guards like Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook and Ja Morant.\n\nHowever, Henderson\u2019s transition to the NBA has been anything but smooth. The rookie, who\u2019s supposed to be the Trail Blazers\u2019 next franchise player, has suffered from injuries since his Summer League debut and has been unable to find any momentum at the NBA level. And, unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any better soon, especially if his perimeter game fails to improve.\n\nThe issue with explosiveness\n\nFront offices are enamored by athleticism. But while raw talents light up the court, injuries cast a shadow. And more often than not, that\u2019s the price of explosiveness. During Rose\u2019s 2010-11 MVP season, more than 75% of his shot attempts were within the arc and almost 40% of his total points came from inside the paint. That\u2019s ridiculous for a point guard, even considering the league\u2019s less perimeter-oriented playbooks at the time. But during the playoffs of the very next season, he tore his left ACL after landing awkwardly from an explosive hop step into the paint. The injuries limited him to just 39 games in the 2011-12 season and sidelined him for the entire following year. It also sparked constant speculation about \u201cwhat if Rose never got injured?\u201d, as the three-time All-Star\u2019s career hasn\u2019t been the same since.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve seen similar stories of injuries impacting explosive guards, with an Achilles tear in 2019 derailing John Wall\u2019s career and Morant\u2019s season-ending labral tear in January of this year.\n\nHigh usage rates\n\nOne other thread connects these cases \u2014 a high usage rate. Rose, Wall and Morant were all, at one point, the No. 1 scoring option on their teams. This put them under the constant demand of ball handling, taking copious shot attempts and making aggressive plays that pushed their bodies to the limit: Rose played 37.4 minutes per game in the season before his ACL injury. Wall played 34.5 minutes a game from 2018-19 before a heel injury shut him down. Morant averaged 35.3 minutes over nine games this season before his season-ending shoulder injury.\n\nRookie Henderson has only averaged 27 minutes thus far on a guard-heavy Trailblazers team, and still couldn\u2019t stay clear of setbacks: Left his Summer League debut in the third quarter due to a shoulder injury. Out for 21 days in November due to bone bruising and an ankle sprain. Saw just eight minutes of action on January 19 due to a nasal contusion. Played six minutes on January 26 due to a quad contusion. Hasn\u2019t played a game since All-Star Weekend (February 16-18) due to a left adductor strain.\n\nGiven his potential role as a cornerstone in Portland\u2019s rebuild, Henderson\u2019s struggles to stay healthy raise concerns about his long-term durability once, and if he\u2019s even able to fully embrace the role of a starting point guard.\n\nLack of perimeter offense\n\nThe importance of having a solid perimeter game in today\u2019s NBA can\u2019t be overstated. And this extends beyond guards, as we\u2019ve seen a surge of stretch fours and 7-footers hitting shots from deep, including the No. 1 pick in Henderson\u2019s draft, Victor Wembanyama. Right now, Henderson\u2019s limited ability from 3-point range (27.5% accuracy and less than one 3-pointer made per game in the G League) suggests that teams don\u2019t need to defend him tightly beyond the arc. Although his 3-point shooting has slightly improved in the NBA (31% accuracy and 1.2 made per game), Henderson still lacks the consistent deep-range threat to stretch defenders a foot or two past the arc. This makes him rely on blowing past defenders with pure speed and force, then battling centers and helpside defenders inside the paint. And the downside of that is, again: injury risks.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to deny the former five-star prospect\u2019s undeniable talent and ideal frame \u2014 he\u2019s often referred to as \u201ca point guard built like a linebacker.\u201d However, concerns surrounding his long-term health cannot be ignored. But if Henderson develops a consistent 3-point shot and manages to stay on the court, the sky\u2019s the limit for the 20-year-old.\n\n\u201cTriple Threat\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

Neither side could break the deadlock in normal time. In the first half, the best chance fell to Chelsea: a 6-yard attempt by winger Raheem Sterling against his former team was canceled out by a VAR check for a marginal offside on striker Nicolas Jackson\u2019s run preceding the shot.\n\nThe second half\u2019s best opportunity fell to the head of captain Virgil Van Dijk, who appeared to score from fullback Andrew Robertson\u2019s set-piece delivery into the penalty box. However, the chance was also ruled out by VAR due to a foul Wataru End\u014d committed by obstructing Chelsea defender Levi Collwill while in an offside position.\n\nA goalless 90 minutes meant extra time. The deadlock was broken in the 118th minute, fullback Kostas Tsimikas\u2019s corner-kick was received again by Van Dijk\u2019s head, this time at the near post, where he found the bottom left corner to seal the victory for the Reds.\n\nManager Jurgen Klopp\u2019s farewell tour has started with a bang. With the win, Liverpool earned the club\u2019s 10th English League Cup trophy \u2014 the most by any team in the competition\u2019s history. Liverpool also made it three consecutive wins against Chelsea in their last three cup final meetings.\n\nThe Reds are in contention to win the quadruple, as they sit at the top of the Premier League and remain in the FA Cup and Europa League. Liverpool ended the match with several young academy graduates on the field as the team faces somewhat of an injury crisis. Several key players, such as Mohammed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold, were not in the matchday squad. Midfielder Ryan Gravenberch also had to be stretchered off the field during the final, adding to the team\u2019s injured list.\n\nLiverpool return against Southampton in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday, hoping their good fortunes in cup competitions will continue.\n\nChelsea and manager Mauricio Pochettino continue to be disappointed at the team\u2019s ability to finish key opportunities. Winger Cole Palmer missed three chances inside the penalty box and the Blues have now lost their last three EFL Cup finals.\n\nGiving the pressure Pochettino already faced due to the team\u2019s league position, losing out on a potential first piece of silverware to mark his reign as coach will hurt. His personal record against Jurgen Klopp, going back to his days as Tottenham Hotspur manager, is now winless in the last eight matches.\n\nChelsea are also back in cup competition action, taking on Leeds United in the FA Cup fifth round at Stamford Bridge.\n\nPhil Foden\u2019s first-half goal pushes Man City forward in the title race\n\nIt was an unconvincing showing by Manchester City at the Vitality Stadium facing Bournemoth, but manager Pep Guardiola\u2019s squad managed to scrape a 1-0 win to keep pace in the title race.\n\nThe Citizens took a 1-0 lead midway through the first half from a Erling Haaland shot inside the penalty box that Neto parried to midfielder Phil Foden to tap in.\n\nIn the second half, the hosts Bournemouth ramped up the pressure on City but were unable to find an equalizer, with midfielder Marcus Tavernier wasting two great chances. Late on, left winger Antoine Semenyo\u2019s cross landed on the head of substitute striker Enes Unal, who redirected the ball but only hit the woodwork.\n\nMan City moved back to second place with the win, closing the gap to one point behind Liverpool in first. The Citizens now have nine away wins this season \u2014 the most out of all Premier League clubs.\n\nPhil Foden also added to his tally of 16 goals in all competitions, his most in a season since 2020-21, underscoring his importance to the squad following Ilkay Gundogan\u2019s summer departure.\n\nCity returns to action in the FA Cup fifth round, facing Luton Town on Tuesday before a Manchester derby in the league on Sunday.\n\nThe opportunities the Cherries missed will be on manager Andoni Iraola\u2019s mind, with his team sitting in 14th position, eight points from the relegation zone. They\u2019re now winless in seven matches since they defeated Fulham 3-0 on Boxing Day.\n\nSince being promoted twice to the Premier League in 2014-15 and 2021-2022, Bournemouth have never won against Man City, losing 14 out of 20 games they faced against each other in the top-flight.\n\nThe Cherries return in the FA Cup fifth round against Leicester City on Tuesday.\n\nA last-gasp Alex Iwobi goal defeats European hopefuls Man United\n\nManchester United suffered a last-minute 2-1 defeat to Fulham at Old Trafford, a setback to United\u2019s push for a Champions League spot.\n\nAn entertaining first half nonetheless ended goalless, with Fulham forward Rodrigo Munoz having the best chance of the period, which hit the right post after spinning past defender Victor Lindelof.\n\nThe away side had many wasted chances, but eventually found the opener through defender Calvin Bassey, who struck his shot with power into the back of the net after hitting his first effort into teammate Timothy Castagne inside the penalty area.\n\nCenter back Harry Maguire rescued the Red Devils before stoppage time when he found himself at the edge of 6-yard box to rebound in Bruno Fernandes\u2019s long-distance curler, leveling the scoreline at 1-1.\n\nThe game wasn\u2019t over, though. Midfielder Alex Iwobi had the final say, snatching the winner at the death for his team with a shot inside the penalty area that surprisingly found the bottom left corner, leaving United keeper Andre Onana flat-footed.\n\nA disappointing result keeps Manchester United in sixth place, eight points from fourth-place Aston Villa after their own win this weekend. Going into the match, the Red Devils had won four league matches in a row, scoring 11 goals \u2014 the home side also were unbeaten in 2024.\n\nMan United will look to bounce back in the FA Cup fifth round traveling to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday before their trip to Manchester City in the league.\n\nA deserving away victory for Fulham helped the club remain in 12th position, four points from 10th place. It\u2019s been 12 years since the Cottagers\u2019 last victory at Old Trafford, when they won 3-1 in 2003.\n\nFulham was also without star defensive midfielder Joao Palhinha, who was serving a three-match suspension for receiving ten yellow cards.\n\nFulham will take on Brighton & Hove Albion at Craven Cottage in the league next weekend.\n```"}

Gavin Newsom released an advertisement Sunday in response to the increased restrictions and legal consequences for those who travel across state lines for abortion access. The 30-second advertisement, which aired in Tennessee, shows a tearful young woman handcuffed to a hospital bed crying out for help. Beside her is a sexual assault evidence kit. A narrator reads, \u201cTrump Republicans want to criminalize young women who travel to receive the reproductive care they need. Don\u2019t let them hold Tennessee women hostage.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s advertising campaign comes after Tennessee legislation established an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d felony that targets adults who help transport pregnant minors for reproductive care without parental consent. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, 14 states have implemented abortion bans, according to the Center for American Progress. A UCLA report in 2022 estimated that between 8,000 and 16,000 women will travel to California each year for abortion care.\n\nPaula Tavrow, a UCLA adjunct professor of community health sciences, said that the advertisement shines a light on the kind of legislation that is being passed after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Tavrow said that this advertisement was an important step in raising awareness about the ongoing legal threats to abortion access. \u201cWe pride ourselves as a country that is based on freedoms, and this ad is showing that women are literally chained to a bed with the idea that they would not be free to exercise or to obtain reproductive health care outside of their state,\u201d Tavrow said. \u201cIt\u2019s an appalling infringement on women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nAshwin Balaje, a senior from Tennessee studying computational neuroscience, said that he hopes the advertisement makes an impact on voters in his home state. \u201cGrowing up in Tennessee, I know that the Tennessee senate and the Tennessee congress is largely dominated by people who are in favor of abortion bans and abortion measures like this,\u201d Balaje said. \u201cI think that for a lot of voters, they\u2019re just strongly against abortion in all cases.\u201d Balaje said that he is hopeful that the more attention brought to the issue, the more public sway could potentially pave the way for federal legislation. \u201cIf this happens to other states as well, we can have some federal legislation to enable travel and things of that nature,\u201d Balaje said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how feasible that is, but at least building some sort of momentum towards it, swinging public opinion to be more in favor of measures like that, could be impactful.\u201d\n\nAlly Atwell, a student from Texas majoring in theater, said that she thought the way the advertisement was written would make for a compelling message. \u201cI think that having it on air in red states is a good thing, because of the way the commercial is, and it\u2019s not so much pointing a finger, it\u2019s more like telling a story, which I think is a good thing,\u201d Atwell said. \u201cI kind of have to have hope that it would be effective.\u201d\n\nTavrow said the advertisement should signal to Californians the importance of voting and maintaining local structures in place of Roe v. Wade. \u201cThese shield laws that we have recently introduced to shield abortion providers who might dismiss people from other states so that... if the Tennesseans get abortion pills from a California provider, Tennessee could not prosecute that California provider,\u201d Tavrow said. \u201cI think these are important things for us to maintain.\u201d\n\nUSC professor Randall A. Lake, an expert in public communication, including rhetoric of social change and presidential discourse, said that Newsom\u2019s campaigning efforts in red states emphasize and appeal to the diverse range of voters present in every state. \u201cOpinion polling on reproductive choice would suggest that red states are not monolithic and that to succeed nationally, advocates for reproductive rights need to talk to folks from those states,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThere is a kind of a broader recognition among Democrats that they shouldn\u2019t just \u2018surrender\u2019 red states that that\u2019s not a path to ultimate success.\u201d\n\nBalaje said he was unsure about the results of Newsom\u2019s social campaign, but the advertisement is a clear and effective criticism of the legislative direction of his home state. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will be enough to sway public opinion enough to get them to vote for somebody else other than whoever is just the primary Republican candidate in their county or district,\u201d he said. \u201cI love Tennessee, that\u2019s my home and where I grew up, but this ad is a stark reminder of where it\u2019s heading and that\u2019s just so disappointing and upsetting to me.\u201d\n```"}

(Los Angeles Clippers via AP)\n\nBy Dash Chaiyasen, Sam Cohen and Riley Rodriguez\nFebruary 27, 2024 at 10:59 am PST\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are looking to embrace their maritime roots in San Diego with the reveal of a new look starting in their next season, and USC students have mixed opinions. Despite the billions of dollars spent on a new arena and rebranding, the Clippers have long struggled to break out from the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 shadow. The Lakers are tied with the Boston Celtics with 17 national championships, while the Clippers have never won league or conference titles.\n\n\u201cThe Lakers overshadow them a lot,\u201d said junior communication major Tatiana Sigg, an NBA fan. \u201cI think that even if the Lakers are doing bad, and the Clippers are doing better, the Lakers will always get much more attention.\u201d\n\nThis season, the Clippers are performing at a high level with a record of 37-19, putting them 4th in the Western Conference standings, just three wins behind first place. The Lakers stand at 9th place with a record of 31-28.\n\nThe new branding may be meant to distance the team from the Lakers, but since its announcement yesterday, the change has received mixed reactions. The new logo features a Clippers \u201cC\u201d that surrounds the point of a compass with a ship that has etched basketball seams on the hull. The silhouette of an impending ship signifies the team\u2019s origins in the San Diego Harbour. The Clippers got their name from fast-moving sailboats popularized in the 1800s. They were predominately popular in San Diego, where the team played from 1978 to 1984. When they relocated to Los Angeles, they brought their name with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sweet that it\u2019s paying homage to San Diego, and I can totally understand that, but it is the Los Angeles Clippers now,\u201d Sigg said. \u201cI feel like the old logo was kind of cooler. This one is a little confusing.\u201d\n\nPriscilla Tune, a customer service representative at USC, grew up following the Clippers organization. Her mother became the seamstress for the Clippers cheerleaders in 1994, and at the young age of nine, the team offered her floor tickets. She has been a lifelong fan since.\n\n\u201cI do love the new logo and uniform,\u201d Tune said. \u201cIt truly gives patriotism to our country, almost as though they were calling themselves America\u2019s Team.\u201d\n\nWhile some fans contemplate the new look, others anticipate the new beginnings in the Intuit Dome, a $2 billion arena that Clippers owner Steve Ballmer has worked towards for the past decade. His investment, which he claims to be a \u201cbasketball mecca,\u201d will finally give the Clippers their own home after sharing the Crypto.com Arena with their rivals. The Intuit Dome will be located in Inglewood, California, just south of SoFi stadium.\n\n\u201cA new stadium with new uniforms and logos creates a new identity,\u201d said business administration sophomore Cooper Reif. \u201cThis is the next generation of Clippers fans.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Riley Sager February 26, 2024 at 9:44 pm PST\n\nDespite a screaming sea of blue and gold, USC silenced the Bruins in a nail-biting win on Saturday at Pauley Pavilion. These teams are no strangers to rivalry, but with both schools transitioning from the Pac-12 to the Big Ten conference this fall, the Trojans will have more than a crosstown rival to worry about.\n\n\u201cThere will be new challenges with travel adjustments to time zones [and] style,\u201d former UCLA and NBA point guard Baron Davis said. Learning the playing pace and style of 14 new teams will certainly come with its challenges, but USC fans remain focused on the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be tough for these players to travel across the country every single week.\u201d USC junior and huge basketball fan Jackson Stimmler said. \u201cBut, at the same time, we\u2019re going to get the recruits, and we\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trojan-Bruin rivalry will continue on the Big (Ten) stage, USC has new opponents to watch out for. No. 3 Purdue currently leads the Big Ten with a 25-3 season record, despite fumbling a one-seed ranking in the first round of last year\u2019s NCAA March Madness tournament. USC and UCLA won\u2019t be alone in the transition to the Big Ten, with Washington and Oregon bringing the total to 18 teams.\n\nSpread across three time zones, traveling and time changes on the road pose a significant challenge for USC. However, it will make the home-court advantage against Midwest and West Coast teams that much more valuable.\n\nAs for UCLA, it has historically been one of the most successful basketball programs in the country, with 11 NCAA titles. \u201cIt will be good for the program, expand the horizons a bit,\u201d UCLA alum Curtis Goal said. \u201cA lot of money coming into the program is promising, but we\u2019re a very young team and must grow and learn a lot.\u201d\n\nDespite an additional four teams, the Big Ten scheduling format will remain the same. The men\u2019s teams will play their usual 20 conference games per season, but instead of all 15 teams advancing to the Big Ten Tournament, starting next season, only 15 of the 18 will.\n\nRegarding the decision to join the Big Ten, both push and pull factors come into play. The Pac-12 is the only conference in the Power Five without a long-term TV contract. Part of this is due to systemic financial issues consuming the media journalism industry, with more and more digital platforms streaming content online.\n\nSportico.com reports that the Pac-12\u2032s $580 million revenue provided each member school a $37 million payout, while the Big Ten\u2019s $845 million revenue distributed roughly $59 million to every full-fledged team. With the fate of the Pac-12 still in question, the Big Ten\u2019s future looks even more promising.\n\nIn 2022, the network announced a $8 billion contract with CBS, NBC and Fox to broadcast Big Ten games. ESPN estimates this seven-year deal, running from 2023-2030, has a team payout of $80-100 million annually.\n\nEven with all the benefits that come with broadcast coverage and recognition, efficiently navigating the challenges won\u2019t come overnight. \u201cIt might take a couple of years to adjust, but at the end of the day, I think it will end up being a good and necessary change,\u201d Stimmler said.\n\nAlthough the USC and UCLA rivalry remains strong, fans of both teams agree that moving to the Big Ten is in the schools\u2019 best interest. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be fun and positive,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt should be a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nWith only two home games left in the Trojans\u2019 regular season schedule, the Pac-12 Crosstown Showdown is officially over. USC and UCLA\u2019s first tip-off was in 1928, when the teams were part of the Pacific Coast Conference. Since then, the Bruins have led the overall record 147-116 but have lost four of the past six matchups against USC.\n```"}

While many teams have already unofficially punched their ticket into the Big Dance, a large group of teams are still fighting it out within their conferences to remain relevant in tournament talks.

Headlined by one of the most improved players in all of college basketball, junior guard Hunter Sallis, who is averaging nearly 19 points per game on over 50% shooting from the field, the Demon Deacons are a dangerous team. Wake also has three other scorers averaging over 13 points per game, meaning the team is well developed and has more than one player who can make up for scoring. The Demon Deacons\u2019 best wins are over Duke, Virginia and Florida, all teams who have spent time within the AP Top 25 and are near the top of their respective conferences. Wake\u2019s problem is that it has just been too consistently mediocre. Their losses are nothing out of the ordinary, but do include a blowout defeat to North Carolina and a not-so-great fall to LSU. The Demon Deacons win over a top-ranked Duke is the signature win they have been thirsting for to prove they belong in March Madness. Wake will have to win out to prove it truly is one of the best 68 teams in the country. Luckily for the Demon Deacons, they only play one team inside the top five of the ACC standings to close out the regular season. The Demon Deacons are yearning for a tournament appearance in the midst of a seven-year drought from the Big Dance, and this is the year that Wake Forest fans are finally fulfilled of their tournament needs.\n\nSouth Florida\nThe world needs to see the Bulls of South Florida in March Madness. The Bulls are a fun team to watch with some of the best uniforms in all of college basketball. After Florida Atlantic\u2019s impromptu run to the Final Four last year, everyone thought the Owls would steam roll through the American Athletic Conference with every other team jockeying for second place. Yet, as it stands, South Florida has won 13 games in a row and has now clinched at least a share of the AAC regular season championship. The Bulls are three games ahead of Florida Atlantic \u2014 the team currently in second place \u2014 and will have the opportunity to outright clinch the conference championship later this week. However, the Bulls are lower on my ranking than bracketologist Joe Lunardi\u2019s current projections. South Florida is one of the hottest teams in the country, if not the hottest, right now, but the Bulls cannot be justified as an automatic shoe-in due to their earlier losses. In late November and early December, the Bulls lost three straight games to Maine, Hofstra and UMass. A team with losses that bad is hard to picture earning an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Yes, those losses were early, but they are just so, so bad. Not a single one of those teams are currently in any position to win their conferences, or come particularly close, which makes it very difficult to justify South Florida as an at-large bid. Still, the Bulls are scorching hot and will be dangerous to any five or six seed who has to play them in the first round.\n\nNebraska\nAnother fun team to watch that deserves a spot after years of being kept out of March Madness is the Cornhuskers. Nebraska does not have a great resume, but it does have a dominant win over Purdue, where the Huskers trounced the Boilermakers 88-72 in Lincoln. The Cornhuskers have been consistent in the Big Ten and currently sit at fifth in the conference. They still have the opportunity to make strides in terms of conference tournament placement, and they will be incredibly dangerous to any team in the Big Ten tournament. The problem with Nebraska is that it is incredibly streaky. Yes, the Cornhuskers have a win over now-No. 2 Purdue with probably the best player in college basketball, but they also lost to Creighton by 29 in (insert month for accuracy). Nebraska feels like a team that can be king slayers and could take down any No. 1 seed, but it also has the makings of a 20-point blowout loss to a mediocre six seed like Saint Mary\u2019s.\n\nGonzaga\nThe final team in the last four of Terence Holton\u2019s bubble is the Zags. Gonzaga has fallen off its shiny pedestal of greatness from the 2020-21 season where the Bulldogs were nearly perfect. Gonzaga has had one of its worst seasons in years, currently sitting at 22-6, with some decent losses to Purdue and UConn, but the fact that the Bulldogs aren\u2019t dominant in the West Coast Conference is a testament to where this program is currently at. The Zags will sneak into this list, as they do have wins over Kentucky and USC \u2014 USC isn\u2019t good but they need to be mentioned at least once a week to stay relevant. The problem Gonzaga has is it has no more possibilities to impress the committee, as Saint Mary\u2019s has already been called a fraud by one accredited journalist. As long as the Bulldogs win the games they should, then they will make it, but it is very hard to pick them against any decent team.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo by Terry Wilson/OHL Images)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nFebruary 26, 2024 at 8:54 pm PST\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 Left unpicked through four rounds, the Anaheim Ducks took a chance on Swiss defenseman Rodwin Dionicio with the 129th overall selection last year. Not only was he a later pick, but he was actually a re-entry player\u2014someone who NHL teams had overlooked the year prior.\n\nThis season, in the Ontario Hockey League, Dionicio has posted 60 points with a plus-11 rating in 49 games, spending time with both the Windsor Spitfires and Saginaw Spirit. Dionicio was named OHL Player of the Week on Feb. 19 and has been a catalyst for Saginaw this season. The Spirit acquired him back in November via trade, after he posted 20 points in 16 games with Windsor.\n\nOn the ice, Dionicio is a Swiss Army knife. He\u2019s unpredictable, deceptive and crafty in all three zones and is an elite playmaker with his stick. Although his skating and agility could be improved, his handling skills compensate for his subpar mobility, allowing him to generate offense. He knows how to set up offense with ease and can locate teammates with precise passing.\n\nAs an offensive-minded defenseman, his defense could certainly use some improvement. For example, he\u2019s had trouble with preventing opponents from entering the defensive zone and his skating struggles have hindered him from retrieving the puck more quickly than opponents. Dionicio plays like a winger, which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but he\u2019ll need to bring his defensive abilities up to the pro standards if he wants to make it as an NHL blueliner.\n\nCritically, despite his shortcomings, Dionicio has shown vast improvement over his young career. As a member of the Niagara Ice Hogs, in 2021-22, for example, he only posted 31 points in 57 games while posting an inefficient minus-22 rating. Now, he\u2019s making a case to be a full-time Anaheim Duck with his exceptional performances this season.\n\nDionicio might be considered second fiddle to Spirit blueliner Zayne Parekh\u2014who leads the team in points and all OHL defenseman with 81\u2014but Dionicio is still a top-five point-generator among all OHL defensemen this season and has shown that despite his previously looked-over potential, he can still ride with some of the most highly touted players.\n\nParekh is expected to be an early draft selection this year, and could even find himself selected in the lottery. While he does have 21 more points than Dionicio, in the grand scheme of things, the fact that a team will likely take Parekh in the first round highlights the true steal that Anaheim found in the fifth round in Dionicio.\n\nDionicio scores almost as frequently as Parekh with 22 goals to the latter\u2019s 28, so Parekh\u2019s stout assist numbers are what make him such a desirable prospect. Dionicio was also an impact player for Switzerland in the 2024 World Juniors. His two-goal performance against Norway helped the Swiss advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nEven at just 19 years old, Dionicio has loads of experience in international play as well as in North America. Dionicio is the textbook definition of a diamond in the rough. He\u2019s a part of Anaheim\u2019s star-studded defenseman prospect pool that includes current Duck Pavel Mintyukov and American Hockey League stud Olen Zellweger.\n\nThe Ducks\u2019 2023 draft might be remembered primarily for No. 2 overall pick Leo Carlsson, but general manager Pat Verbeek\u2019s best work might\u2019ve been selecting an under-the-radar future star that could bolster Anaheim\u2019s blue line depth for years to come.\n\nAt 6-foot-2 and 207 pounds, Dionicio has the build to hold his own in the big leagues, he\u2019ll just need to keep developing as a skater to earn a future callup. Dionicio is a unique player with a variety of skills, room for improvement in the defensive zone and an unconventional draft story. It might take some time before he\u2019s an everyday Duck, but when the moment comes, his extensive development and experience will more than likely pay off.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Business Wire)\n\nBy Maddy Myer February 26, 2024 at 8:24 pm PST\n\nThe last premium live event before WrestleMania, also known as the Elimination Chamber, took place Saturday night in Australia but super early Saturday morning in Cali. That meant I stayed up until 2 a.m. to watch the event due to the time difference. Thankfully, it was worth it. While most of the match outcomes were predictable, Elimination Chamber is one of my favorite events due to the concept. Superstars enter a steel cage with glass pods. While two superstars start the match, the remaining superstars are locked in the pods, then they are released one by one every couple of minutes. The twist to this match is the use of the steel cage and pods to the wrestler\u2019s advantage. Eliminations happen like a normal match (pinfall or submission), and they win by being the last remaining superstar. The winner goes on to face whichever champion wasn\u2019t picked from the Royal Rumble winners.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the best matches from the Elimination Chamber.\n\nWomen\u2019s Elimination Chamber Match (WWE Elimination Chamber February 24)\n\nThe women\u2019s elimination chamber featured Liv Morgan, Raquel Rodriguez, Naomi, Becky Lynch, Bianca Belair and Tiffany Stratton. Naomi and Becky Lynch started the match. This match definitely had some crazy moments. From Rodriguez showing her pure strength, lifting people up just to slam them against the steel cage chains, to Morgan thrashing Stratton\u2019s body into the glass pods. It was the type of match you didn\u2019t want to blink on, because you\u2019d miss something unbelievable. Stratton was quite impressive in this match, keeping up with some of the more veteran superstars and even showing off a flip from on top of the pod that knocked down all her opponents. I wanted this to be the match that finally gave Morgan her shot at revenge, but Lynch was the victor in the end, hitting Morgan with the manhandle slam finisher.\n\nThe Judgment Day vs. New Catch Republic (WWE Elimination Chamber February 24)\n\nThe tag team champions, Finn B\u00e1lor and Damien Priest (Judgment Day members), defended their titles against Tyler Bate and Pete Dunne (New Catch Republic). Simply put, Bate and Dunne put on a wrestling clinic with this match. Between their innovative double team moves and their strategic strikes at Priest and B\u00e1lor, there were so many moments that made me think we\u2019d have new tag team champions. On the other hand, B\u00e1lor and Priest had double-team moves of their own that were a bit more powerful than New Catch Republic\u2019s. The Judgment Day duo earned the victory after Priest hit a double chokeslam from the top rope, followed by B\u00e1lor\u2019s coup de grace finisher. And, of course, the outside aid of Dominik Mysterio\u2019s distractions also helped Priest and B\u00e1lor clinch the victory.\n\nMen\u2019s Elimination Chamber Match (WWE Elimination Chamber February 24)\n\nThe men\u2019s elimination chamber match had Kevin Owens, Bobby Lashley, Randy Orton, Drew McIntyre, Logan Paul and LA Knight. Similar to the women\u2019s match, this was absolutely stacked with talent and incredible spots. For one, Lashley speared Paul through one of the glass pods. There was also a random attack with a steel chair from AJ Styles, which aided in getting LA Knight eliminated from the match. Since it\u2019s elimination chamber rules, outside interferences do not automatically end the match. While I figured McIntyre would win, it was great to see Orton truly shine in this match and live up to his \u201cRKO out of nowhere\u201d name. In the end, McIntyre did win, but not from his own doing. After Orton RKO\u2019d Paul, Paul was angered and came back into the match to hit Orton with brass knuckles. McIntyre took advantage of that attack and pinned Orton for the 1, 2, 3 and secured his ticket to face Seth Rollins at WrestleMania.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/26/clippers-los-angeles-has-shaky-weekend-results/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 After finishing their Grammys road trip 6-1, the Los Angeles Clippers were running on all cylinders. Recently, though, they\u2019ve sputtered through their schedule. The Clippers went 1-1 this past weekend, beating the Memphis Grizzlies 101-95 Friday night and then falling to the Sacramento Kings 123-107 at home on Sunday. The Clippers are now in fourth place in the Western Conference, 2.5 games behind the Minnesota Timberwolves and Oklahoma City Thunder, who are tied for first.\n\nFriday\u2019s win improved the Clippers\u2019 head-to-head record against the Grizzlies since 2019 to 9-8, while also giving them a league-best away record of 17-7 since Nov. 17. The Grizzlies, who are struggling without Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and several other players due to injury, still showed signs of life thanks to a 29-point contribution from forward Jaren Jackson Jr.\n\n\u201c[The Grizzlies\u2019] physicality, the way they pressured us and got into us, it really took us out of what we wanted to do offensively,\u201d Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to be able to handle that pressure. We didn\u2019t do a good job of executing, and so we\u2019ve got to be better with that as well.\u201d\n\nTerrance Mann jump started LA\u2019s momentum, scoring 10 of the team\u2019s first 12 points. Kawhi Leonard added his usual 24 points while grabbing eight boards and Russell Westbrook tacked on 13 more points. However, Paul George and James Harden, who round out the Clippers\u2019 star-studded trio along with Leonard, struggled in this matchup, combining for only 23 points. Harden\u2019s only made basket of the night, however, was a clutch stepback three-pointer in the final minute that helped seal the game for LA.\n\nThe Clippers, despite the win, recorded one rather worrying stat: 20 turnovers. Compared to the Grizzlies\u2019 12, losing the turnover margin seems to be a trend for the Clippers. In their past four losses, including to the Kings on Sunday, Lue\u2019s squad lost the turnover margin in all of them. The most egregious margin came in their 117-106 loss against the New Orleans Pelicans earlier this month, when the Pelicans forced 19 turnovers.\n\nWhen the turnovers combine with a poor shooting night\u2014as the Clippers have had a few of recently\u2014the odds are not in LA\u2019s favor. The win against the Grizzlies, regardless of the underlying poor stats, proved that the Clippers can win tight games, something they have struggled with in past years. LA is the league\u2019s oldest team, at an average 29.1 years old, and their veteran experience surely helps them win games that come down to the wire.\n\nHowever, against younger teams like the Sacramento Kings, some of the Clippers\u2019 weaknesses get exposed. The Kings\u2014right behind the Clippers in the Western Conference standings\u2014just seemed to have more stamina as they went on to beat the Clippers by double digits. For the Kings, Domantas Sabonis recorded a triple-double with 17 points and De\u2019Aaron Fox added 33 more.\n\nThe Clippers, who were without George due to a knee issue, were led by Norman Powell\u2019s 21 points, with Leonard adding another 20. The Clippers led at the first quarter\u2019s end, but once the Kings took the lead early in the second, LA never regained it.\n\nIn addition to losing the turnover margin, which gave the Kings 25 points, the Clippers were also outrebounded on the offensive end 14-10. Both teams shot nearly the same field goal percentage, but losing the rebound and turnover games gave the Kings extra possessions that the Clippers couldn\u2019t compensate for.\n\nWhen asked what went wrong against the Kings, Lue had an elaborate response: \u201cEverything.\u201d Lue said that the Clippers didn\u2019t do a good job crashing the boards early and helping their big men close out on the glass when they attempted to block shots. \u201cWith turnovers... [it\u2019s] just making a simple pass and making a simple read,\u201d said Lue. \u201cTaking care of the basketball, which we haven\u2019t done a good job of as of late.\u201d\n\nWith the Kings right behind them in the standings, this loss in particular will sting for the Clippers. This weekend made clear why the Clippers have been in a bit of a slump recently. The Clippers\u2019 recipe for success is a combination of not turning the ball over, being better on the defensive glass and, most importantly, keeping Kawhi Leonard healthy. If the Clippers can succeed in those areas and find their rhythm offensively, they still pose a great threat and cannot be overlooked come playoff time.\n\nThe Clippers will take on the Lakers at 7:00 p.m. PST Wednesday night.\n```"}

In the midst of Hollywood\u2019s brightest stars this weekend, Lily Gladstone made history.

And, she\u2019s the first Indigenous Oscar nominee for best actress.\n\nIn Martin Scorsese\u2019s film, Gladstone plays an Osage woman named Mollie. The film tells the true, mostly untold story of the many Osage murders in 1920s Oklahoma.\n\nGladstone began her SAG Award acceptance speech in the Blackfeet language. Gladstone\u2019s SAG Awards Speech translation: \u201cHello all my friends... relatives. My name is Eagle Woman. I am Blackfeet.

She expressed her joy at seeing the media represent native people as not just a people having survived an immense trauma, but who have persevered and are still here. Goodwill commends Gladstone on her accurate portrayal of native people and ability to embody this persevering spirit.\n\nDylan Goodwill: \u201cShe\u2019s pioneering a whole new kind of area that our people haven\u2019t been in yet. And so it\u2019s really awesome to be able to see her just being able to win. It\u2019s a win for all of us.\u201d\n\nUSC junior, Kaitlin Becenti, who\u2019s on the board of the Native American Student Assembly, echoes Goodwill\u2019s sentiments.\n\nKaitlin Becenti: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing like res kids being represented on the screen. And that\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever wanted, because it really shows us that we can dream bigger and be able to make it.\u201d\n\nLily Gladstone ended her acceptance speech with a heartwarming call to action for us to continue creating visibility and representation for underrepresented individuals and communities.\n\nLily Gladstone: \u201cThose of you who are not actors, but have a voice have a story that needs to be heard....

The case centers on two bills in Florida and Texas that limit the ability of companies like TikTok, YouTube and X to curate their content. Jeff Cohen directs the USC IT Directory Law Clinic. He says the Florida and Texas laws are trying to prevent conservative voices from being censored. Jeff Cohen: These two cases are both about two state laws that are meant to regulate social media companies, and that have, to different levels, have been pretty much explicitly passed with the goal of addressing what is perceived as sort of either de-platforming or censorship of conservative voices. Two technology trade groups that have challenged the laws are NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association. They say that platforms have the same First Amendment rights as conventional news outlets. However, Florida Solicitor General Henry Whitaker argued that the laws are necessary to prevent censorship. Henry Whitaker: The telephone company and the delivery service have no first amendment right to use their services as a choke point to silence those they dislike. The laws could have far-reaching consequences if upheld, according to USC Reach President Dylan Huey. Dylan Huey: If we remove these moderations, like states, like Florida and Texas are proposing, we\u2019re gonna see content that is more controversial, that you can still see right now on these platforms, but it\u2019s not being pushed to your Explore page not being pushed on your for you page on a higher level because it gets people riled up and not in the best way. USC Sophomore history major Heidy Cho says that some regulation is necessary to prevent the spread of fake news. Heidy Cho: I think it\u2019s important to at least have some guidelines, because I think social media is so pervasive that it can spread a lot of misinformation, a lot of hate. Meanwhile, Freshman Luisa Luo, who is studying comparative literature worries that removing the ability to regulate social media platforms could lead to an increase in hate speech. Luisa Luo: Free speech is definitely valuable. But at the same time, the toxicity that forms a breeding ground for actual hate speech can become target for marginalized populations, especially when it\u2019s anonymous, then you\u2019re like, basically covered and not held accountable. Conservative and liberal Supreme Court justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, seemed doubtful of the state laws during the hearings and could send the case back down to the state level.

Out of 281 adjuncts eligible to vote, 231 participated, and 219 votes were deemed valid. Adjunct professors compose 70% of SCA\u2019s workforce.\n\nThis union was formed because adjunct, or part-time, professors claimed to feel underpaid. SCA adjunct professors teaching 20 hours a week make only $22,000 per year. In comparison, the average adjunct professor in Los Angeles makes $76,289 a year, according to Indeed. The average salary of adjunct professors at USC\u2019s rival, UCLA, is around $104,000.\n\n\u201cI think [unionization is] wonderful.

(Photo by Micah Chow)\n\nBy Anna Shvidler\nFebruary 26, 2024 at 5:37 pm PST\n\nThe weather is often a go-to topic for small talk, yet the increased rainfall and the repercussions following it made it an overwhelming issue for California residents, including USC students. According to the LA Times, last week\u2019s storm accounted for more than 60% of the city\u2019s average annual rainfall. The bad weather, which may have been insignificant elsewhere, has had a dramatic impact on the lives of people living in Los Angeles. The atmospheric river that drenched Southern California had a dramatic impact on residents, flooding streets and downing trees. But it also affected mental health and well-being.\n\nUSC students were not exempt from the storm\u2019s consequences, with certain classes being moved online, or canceled altogether, due to hazardous road conditions or professors tending to the results of the rain. In general, the weather constantly affects our daily experiences and mental states. Rainy days can evoke feelings of gloominess or reflection, while on sunny summer days, we have a calling to go outside and play on the beach. Well-established scientific research can easily explain the link between good weather and our moods: sunlight exposure is linked to the production of serotonin, our happiness hormone. Dreary weather can disrupt sleep cycles and make our moods as dark as the clouds themselves. That\u2019s why light therapy is a popular treatment for those experiencing seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\n\nRebecca Llopis, a USC Freshman from the UK majoring in Theater and Global Studies, said that because rain in England is so persistent it becomes ingrained into daily life. Over time, the restrictions on outdoor activities and social interactions pile up. The feeling as described by Rebecca of being, \u201chidden under an umbrella or staying cozy and safe inside,\u201d fosters a sense of growing stagnation. People living in California may be unaccustomed to harsh weather, so the adverse effects on mental health could be particularly prominent.\n\nFreshman Political Science major, Ava Keshavarzi, remarked that, \u201cfor me, the rain brings a sense of loneliness because it holds me back from leaving indoor spaces like my room or the library, which limits the social interaction I have.\u201d Although some people enjoy occasional rainy days, finding them fun or cleansing, after a while, we need the sun to return and re-energize us. Since moving here, Rebecca has recognized how much of our mood can be attributed to the weather, saying that sunny days \u201cgenuinely make us happier.\u201d\n```"}

According to the Brookings Institute, Americans aged 65 and older vote more than young people at a rate of three to one in recent elections. USC political science professor Douglas Becker unpacks the cyclical nature of youth voter disaffection.\n\nDouglas Becker: It\u2019s a terrible cycle. Young people don\u2019t vote anywhere near as high of a level as older people. Their issues aren\u2019t being talked about, so then they pay attention less and less and less.\n\nSo what are the issues that young people feel don\u2019t get enough attention? Junior economics student Keri Carter shared some of the issues that are important to her.\n\nKeri Carter: Police brutality, environment, cost of things, cost of living...\n\nYoung people, aged 18-24, make up around one tenth of voters, unlike senior voters who account for more than half. Junior pharmacology student Benjamin Katz says he hasn\u2019t voted before, but that he is ready to vote in this election. Katz says he\u2019s not excited to vote, but he better understands the implications of young people\u2019s disengagement and doesn\u2019t want to be part of the problem.\n\nBenjamin Katz: It\u2019s a very important election, I think a lot of changes are happening that could lead to terrible consequences so I believe it\u2019s important to vote.\n\nBecker: Why are young people disaffected? My initial reaction is: why is nobody giving them a reason to get excited to vote?\n\nThere are many organizations that provide information and resources to young people to get more involved in the political process.

(AP Photo/Deepak Sharma, File)\n\nBy Estelle Atkinson February 26, 2024 at 3:23 pm PST\n\nPASADENA \u2013 Randeep Singh stood alone in the corner of a small Hindu temple, on the edge of the white cloth that lined the floor. It had been a long time since he\u2019d attended a temple service, and it had been a bad year. Having recently lost his job as a security guard, when Singh saw advertising for an event celebrating \u201cRam Lala\u2019s Pran Pratistha at his birthplace,\u201d he decided to make the trip from West Covina.\n\nWhile several people sat or kneeled at the altar under twinkling lights, Singh stayed upright, watching. \u201cWelcome\u201d was written in flower petals on a sign spanning the ceiling. \u201cMaybe things will get better,\u201d Singh said of his return to worship.\n\nDozens trailed into the room as the puja, an offering of flowers and food, continued. They were here to celebrate the culmination of more than 500 years of conflict over a sacred site found in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOutside the temple doors, a livestream was being set up. Several attendees wore T-shirts bearing the phrase \u201cChalo Ayodhya,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cLet\u2019s go to Ayodhya.\u201d A projector displayed a live news broadcast from the city in India.\n\nA crowd of around 200 gathered Jan. 21 in Pasadena to witness Prime Minister Narendra Modi lead the Pran Pratistha, a ceremony to consecrate the opening of the new Hindu temple, the Ram Mandir. The site is believed by some to be the birthplace of Rama and the location of a former Hindu temple destroyed by the Mughals in the 16th century.\n\nFrom then on, a mosque called the Babri Masjid stood until it was torn down by a Hindu nationalist mob in the early \u201890s, provoking riots that claimed nearly 2000 lives, most of them Muslim. A symbol of faith to some, for others, the temple\u2019s opening is evidence of political trends threatening India\u2019s secular democracy on its way to becoming a Hindu nation.\n\nOne man quieted the Pasadena crowd and urged attendees to greet each other with the phrase \u201cjai shri ram,\u201d the same rallying cry of \u201cVictory to Lord Rama\u201d reportedly heard in 1992 as crowds rushed the Masjid.\n\nThese trends carry what many say are known consequences in India today: \u201cMinoritized communities are beaten up,\u201d said Akhila Ananth, associate professor of criminal justice at Cal State LA. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of gymnastics you have to do to separate all of that from the opening of this temple.\u201d\n\nAnanth called to mind Salman Rushdie\u2019s work writing about how the secular Bombay he grew up in no longer exists. \u201cIt\u2019s a photograph, the photograph fades,\u201d Ananth said. \u201cThe photograph is crumbling at this point.\u201d\n\nAttendees reflected on the meaning of the temple\u2019s opening as they shared meals brought from home and sipped cups of chai. Aparna Kumar moved to the U.S. more than 30 years ago from Bangalore and recalled the site of the temple the year she and her husband, Sid, got married in 1994: \u201cIt was a big plot of land with a small temple on it. Now, it\u2019s this.\u201d\n\nKumar shared a feeling of excitement to be witnessing the event. Still, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s always the fear that it overtakes the secular part of India. But it\u2019s nice to have it as one part of India.\u201d\n\nSushma Kapoor remembers Ayodhya as a small city. The Los Angeles resident remarked on the recent addition of an airport and a train station, with an expected influx of devotees visiting the Ram Mandir. Kapoor, while emphasizing that India is a secular country, said the consecration brings people together, a far cry from the language of division that so often surrounds the site.\n\n\u201cAfter so many years, it\u2019s happening,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cEveryone is so happy.\u201d\n\nKamal Kapoor introduced himself as Sushma\u2019s husband, seeking to share how the Supreme Court\u2019s approval of the temple\u2019s construction in 2021 lended legitimacy to the project. Only with the court\u2019s approval could plans for the temple proceed after a long history marked with bloodshed.\n\nFor Ananth, this history is paramount: \u201cThis prime minister has consecrated a Ram temple on the site of where the Babri Masjid used to stand with no kind of acknowledgement of what happened for that to be there,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you see how times have changed?\u201d\n\nasked Sid Kumar, a psychiatrist in Glendora originally from Uttar Pradesh. He said the Ram Mandir was a symbol of meaning among an eroding culture. \u201cBuilding a temple or mosque is not easy,\u201d he said: \u201cYou have to do it in a way so people see the reason behind it, the meaning.\u201d\n\nFor Kumar, the Ram Mandir represents \u201cone way to let people feel.\u201d\n\nAlso reflecting on how times have changed, Ananth mused, \u201cWe in the diaspora are strange creatures.\u201d She reflected on her experience as a first-generation Indian American raised in an upper caste family. \u201cMany of us were raised by parents who really tried to pass on something about India to us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted us to have a connection to India, but the India they wanted us to have a connection to was the India they left behind.\u201d\n\nAnanth said she has been outspoken about social justice issues since she was 17. She protested against Modi\u2019s rule at community events, including the Lotus Festival honoring India at Echo Park. And, in August 2022, she penned a column in the Los Angeles Times titled, \u201cAs a Hindu, I can\u2019t stay silent about injustices in India \u2013 committed in the name of our faith.\u201d\n\nHer outspokenness came at the cost of relationships with family, but Ananth refused to bemoan this fact. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and act like it traumatized me,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause people are dying.\u201d\n\nAnanth acknowledged she can\u2019t speak for the entire diaspora. Still, she said she hopes \u201cthat there are more in the diaspora who are realizing that we were told a glittery story about India that just is not true.\u201d\n\nThe event in Pasadena was organized in part by Haimant and Rima Ji, with a car rally throughout the city in the morning. As night fell, the celebration featured a Tesla light show, with around a dozen Teslas parked in a row with their headlights blinking in unison.\n\nThe biggest challenge was \u201cgetting people together,\u201d Haimant said. But after 500 years of conflict, Rima called the ceremony \u201ca dream come true.\u201d\n\nRima said she had received an invitation to attend the ceremony in Ayodhya, but kindly declined. It had been extended to her by the Ram Mandir\u2019s chief engineer, who had paid the Pasadena temple a visit when he was recently in Southern California, Rima said.\n\nThe Pasadena location had become a community hub upon its founding back in 2003 by Pawan \u201cCharlie\u201d Madan, alongside other community members. It\u2019s nearly a decade older than the grander BAPS Mandir in Chino Hills, just less than an hour away. BAPS organized a series of celebrations across the globe that same night.\n\nSingh said he had been to the Chino location but preferred the Pasadena temple. \u201cIt\u2019s a business,\u201d he said of the BAPS Mandir.\n\nLooking around the festivities under a darkened sky, Madan reflected on the sense of togetherness. He also sought to answer the question, \u201cWhy now?\u201d Why, after 500 years, is the Ram Mandir finally open for worship?\n\nIn a rare break from the apolitical celebrations happening around him, Madan mused, \u201cMr. Modi had a lot to do with it.\u201d\n```"}

The court found that frozen embryos are the legal equivalent of children under state law, a decision reached in response to cases involving three couples whose embryos were destroyed in an accident at a storage facility. This ruling has already impacted IVF in the state, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling stemmed from a peculiar incident at a fertility clinic in Mobile, Alabama, where frozen embryos were mishandled due to inadequate security measures at the fertility and IVF location, according to the Associated Press. By allowing the families to sue for wrongful death, the court set a precedent that raises questions about the future of reproductive rights and legal responsibilities in the realm of assisted reproduction. This ruling could have larger impacts if it sparks new federal legislation.\n\n\u201cFor students and faculty at USC, the contentious debate of women\u2019s reproductive autonomy still rages on,\u201d Sophia Gruskin, director of the USC Institute on Inequalities in Global Health, said. Even if the potential implications are not immediately known, students across the USC campus remained steadfast in their support of those who could be impacted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t personally agree with it,\u201d Christopher Chen, a sophomore studying computer science, said. \u201cI think even if we do not necessarily know anyone that might be affected by this change, it\u2019s important that we always try to understand people who might be and try to garner a sense of empathy for people that again might be affected by this.\u201d\n\nAnd while some remained focused on the potential human impact, others highlighted the potential political implications of the ruling. \u201cI think it\u2019s just like an ongoing tactic by the Republican Party to try and shred away different aspects of reproductive rights,\u201d Nivea Krishnan, a senior double majoring in public policy and economics, said. \u201cLooking at some of the implications of it, it hurts people\u2019s ability to have a baby through IVF, which impacts people that can\u2019t have kids for various reasons, so I think in that way, there\u2019s a lot of scary legal implications for doctors too.\u201d\n\nThose potential legal dangers for doctors, Krishnan said, could make them less willing to perform the procedure. \u201cDoctors are afraid they\u2019re gonna face legal consequences if something goes wrong, because the embryo is considered a child, so I think that is making the whole procedure less accessible,\u201d Krishnan said.\n\nFor Krishnan, the ruling is the logical continuation of the push from some to define life as beginning at the point of conception. \u201cI\u2019m not the most well-versed in reproductive law and everything, but I think it\u2019s definitely part of the larger narrative that life begins at conception and driving home that narrative, which I personally stand on not that side of the aisle,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cSo I think it definitely is a knock on reproductive access to reproduction, just in general.\u201d\n\nAnd while the many impacts of the ruling have still not been fully realized, some are concerned that the court ruling that an embryo being granted the legal status of a child could have impacts far beyond IVF. \u201cConsidering an embryo as a human will only have negative impacts on specifically low-income women and girls who don\u2019t have access to abortion,\u201d Lisa Soorenian, assistant professor of the Practice of Environmental Studies, said.\n```"}

(AP/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nBy Matt Kim February 26, 2024 at 1:18 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Spring Training games have begun and there\u2019s plenty of questions surrounding the Angels. Coming into camp, the starting rotation seemed set aside from two spots. Reid Detmers, Patrick Sandoval and Tyler Anderson would headline the rotation as right-handers Griffin Canning, Chase Silseth and Zach Plesac fight for the remaining two slots.\n\nZach Plesac, the nephew of former three-time all-star LHP Dan Plesac, has the longest track record out of the group. Through five seasons with the Guardians dating back to 2019, he tossed 466.2 innings with a 4.20 ERA. Plesac had a steady start to his MLB career, as he gave the Guardians 115.2 innings with a 3.81 ERA in his rookie season and followed that up with a tremendous Covid-shortened 2020 season where he posted a 2.28 ERA. However, his production took a sharp dive as Plesac failed to post another productive season in year three. His struggles led to a demotion to Triple-A in 2023 and Plesac elected free agency this offseason, eventually signing with the Angels.\n\nPlesac has never been a strikeout pitcher, averaging just 6.9 K/9 over his career, but the Angels will give him plenty of looks through Spring Training in hopes of restoring his 2019-2020 self. Canning is the second-most experienced arm out of the group and quietly recorded a solid 2023. His 4.32 ERA over 127 innings provided depth at the bottom of the Angels rotation and barring a disastrous spring training, he\u2019ll be penciled in to make the Opening Day rotation.\n\nThe key for Canning will be limiting the long ball, as he gave up 1.6 HR/9 last season. That inflated home run mark led to a slightly elevated ERA, but with a revamped coaching staff, especially a new pitching coach in Barry Enright, Canning will look to make strides in reducing hard contact.\n\nSilseth arguably has the most upside, but he may be better suited to a multi-inning relief role. He\u2019s still young at 23 years old and was recently drafted in 2021 out of the University of Arizona. Silseth\u2019s arsenal is still a work in progress, but a low-leverage bullpen role will allow for a smooth transition into the rotation. If he can manage to control his mid-to-upper 90s fastball, he\u2019ll be a great depth option for the Angels in the event of an injury or an underwhelming performance from a current rotation member.\n\nShifting to the outfield grass, the Angels currently have a logjam of options they could potentially turn to in right field. Taylor Ward and Mike Trout are set to handle left and center field respectively, as Mickey Moniak, Jo Adell and Aaron Hicks will compete for the final spot.\n\nAaron Hicks has by far the most big league experience, recording 716 hits over an 11-year career. Hicks broke out with the Yankees after a stellar 2018, slugging 27 home runs and posting an .833 OPS. The Yankees inked him to a seven-year, $70 million deal the following offseason, but injuries derailed his career in New York. In 2022, Hicks was finally healthy and played 130 games, but he struggled. The following season was even worse as Hicks stumbled out of the gates and the Yankees designated him for assignment in May. He was picked up by the Orioles and Hicks seemed to have found his former self in Baltimore, posting an OPS above .800 before a hamstring injury prematurely ended his season.\n\nIf Hicks can recapture his power and ability to get on base while staying healthy, he\u2019ll be a quality option for the Angels. Moniak and Adell are both former top prospects, but haven\u2019t played up to their lofty expectations. Moniak was the Phillies\u2019 first overall pick out of La Costa Canyon High School in 2016, forgoing his college commitment to UCLA. But in his limited playing time with the Phillies, he struggled tremendously and failed to cement himself as an everyday outfielder. Philadelphia ultimately decided to move on from him and traded him to Anaheim in exchange for RHP Noah Syndergaard.\n\nIn 2023, while filling in for the injured Mike Trout, Moniak was an above-average contributor, slashing .280/.307/.495, although most of his production came against right-handed pitching. Adell still hasn\u2019t found his footing at the big league level, as his bat seems to be between Triple-A and MLB. Power is his most notable trait, as in minors, he has slugged 95 home runs and with the Salt Lake City Bees last year\u2014the Angels Triple-A affiliate, he hit a mammoth 514-foot home run.\n\nAdell has no trouble putting the ball over the fence, but he struggles to put the ball in play if it\u2019s not going yard. He\u2019s gone down on strikes over 35% of the time with the Angels and doesn\u2019t supplement it with big enough power numbers. So far in Spring Training, he\u2019s 2-2 with two extra-base hits, so if Adell continues to succeed, he and Moniak could form a dangerous platoon in right field. This ensures both players receive at-bats with the platoon advantage and could maximize their strengths.\n\nOnly time will tell who eventually starts in right field on Opening Day, but the Angels will most likely lean on Hicks to begin the season. Hicks is a switch hitter, but hits lefties much better, so on days where the Angels face a righty, Moniak will likely see increased reps. Adell may thrust himself to the top of the conversation with a strong Spring Training showing, but he\u2019ll have to prove to new manager Ron Washington that he\u2019s created a more contact-oriented approach.\n```"}

(Photo by Shantala Muruganujan)\n\nBy Hayes Flanagan February 26, 2024 at 10:57 am PST\n\nPlaying in the team\u2019s second home game at Dignity Health Sports Complex, USC lacrosse walked out onto the field hoping to secure its first upset of the 2024 season. Fans packed into the bleachers, excited to watch a match-up of top 15 teams. After a 3-0 start on the season and 30 goals scored so far, the No. 13 Trojans seemed to be a well-oiled offensive machine. Saturday was a different story.\n\nThe Trojans struggled to string together a good sequence of plays and find harmony on defense, losing 9-3 to No. 6 Michigan. Winning games in lacrosse most often means winning the draw, but the Trojans struggled to win draws and got called for clamping multiple times, automatically giving Michigan a chance to score.\n\nAfter the match, senior attacker Shelby Tilton talked about how the team dealt with Michigan\u2019s offense. \u201cI think we let adversity get the best of us this time,\u201d Tilton said. \u201cIt was a low-scoring game, and offensively, that can be hard when producing is a main reason for what gets the energy going for the unit. So we need to find ways to stay connected and bring energy when we aren\u2019t scoring in the majority of possessions.\u201d\n\nMichigan came out aggressively, winning the first draw and scoring first within seconds. The Wolverines then did that twice more, tallying a 3-0 lead. The Trojans did not respond until the end of the first quarter, when Tilton went one-on-one with a Michigan defender and took it to the goal. Tilton was the only thing working on the USC offense on Saturday, scoring all of the Trojans\u2019 goals.\n\nTrailing by five at half, the Trojans came out in the third quarter looking revived. They won the first draw control and scored, and it seemed they may have gotten a second wind. But, Michigan won a couple key draw controls in a row that put the Trojans down by seven. Still, the USC defense fought hard to hold the Michigan offense at bay.\n\nJunior defender Cate Lord said the team made good adjustments throughout the game. \u201cThrough each quarter respectively we went four goals against, three goals against, two goals against, and then held a shutout in the last quarter, which is a pretty great defensive game,\u201d Lord said. \u201cWe worked through four different defensive sets within the game and were able to implement adjustments frequently to keep control on our side of the ball.\u201d\n\nLord also credited the team\u2019s coaching staff for the defensive effort. \u201cOur defensive coach, Asa Goldstock, coached an amazing game, and I give credit to both her abilities to read the offense and proactively make decisions for our defense, as well as the defense\u2019s ability to trust and lean in to every on fly adjustment we are given.\u201d\n\nThe fourth quarter was uneventful, as the Trojans looked to bounce back and find some momentum.

The Trojans tried to produce something on offense but could not find the back of the net.\n\nWhen discussing what the team could do better, Tilton pointed to transitions. \u201cDuring practice our offense feels great, but the transition piece felt lost today.

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nFebruary 25, 2024 at 10:13 pm PST\n\nPrior to USC\u2019s series with the University of Portland, the Trojans were winless and had been outscored 26-7 in four games. However, in its first \u201chome\u201d series at OC Great Park in Irvine, USC took two solid victories over the Pilots to get back on track.\n\n\u201cJust exciting, obviously, to break whatever funk we were in,\u201d sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously very happy, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 (2-5) first bout with Portland (3-3) on Friday told a story of leaving too many men on base. USC was shut out 4-0 despite tallying eight hits and having junior pitcher Caden Aoki \u2014 who is coming off a stout 2.98 ERA season in 2023 \u2014 on the mound.\n\nThe Pilots wouldn\u2019t have done it without senior outfielder Christian Cooney and redshirt junior pitcher Nick Brink. Cooney drove in Portland\u2019s first run in the third inning on a single up the middle and later homered to left to drive in two more. Brink shut down the Trojans\u2019 offense, striking out 10 hitters in six innings.\n\nMoving to 0-5 on the year was a wake-up call for USC. On Saturday, the Trojans edged out Portland thanks to a walk-off double from sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges. USC took a commanding five-run lead by scoring twice in the second, twice in the fourth and once in the fifth.\n\nGalloway continued his hot streak, as he got the Trojans started with a two-run single with the bases loaded to put them on the board in the second frame. Senior infielder Ryan Jackson extended USC\u2019s lead to three in the fourth with an RBI single to right field. Later that inning, Galloway delivered once again with a sacrifice fly; in the fifth, freshman infielder Abbrie Covarrubias hit an infield single to drive in the Trojans\u2019 fifth run.\n\nHowever, even with a 5-0 lead in the latter half of the game, USC got too comfortable. The Pilots posted four runs in the seventh inning and eventually rallied all the way back with a game-tying solo shot from sophomore infielder Brady Bean in the eighth.\n\nAs a ninth-inning pinch-hitter, Hedges rose to the occasion. With two men on base, he launched one all the way to the left-center field wall to score the winning run from second. The Trojans finally won a game in 2024, 6-5.\n\nJunior designated hitter JT Waldon, freshman outfielder Andrew Lamb and senior outfielder Carson Wells all posted two hits en route to the thrilling victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy game,\u201d head coach Andy Stankiewicz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. \u201cAny time you get a win, especially when we\u2019re in kind of a slide \u2014 big exhale.\u201d\n\nUSC ended the weekend with a series-clinching, 10-4 victory Sunday. Galloway extended his hitting streak to five games and now sits at a whopping .391 batting average on the year.\n\nThe Trojans got the ball rolling early, as Hedges and Lamb each drove in runs in the first frame. USC allowed a run in the second but would soon run away with the game, scoring five in the third to take a 7-1 lead.\n\nA Pilots home run and a bases-loaded walk cut the lead to four in the fifth, but USC responded in kind with a KaiKea Harrison solo homer, the first of the season for the sophomore infielder. Jackson capped off the Trojans\u2019 scoring day with a two-run single to left-center field.\n\nWhen it was all said and done, USC took an easy 10-4 victory.\n\n\u201cThe whole offense, earlier, was pressing to do too much instead of just playing easy and freed-up,\u201d Stankiewicz said.\n\nThe Trojans got a much-needed two wins to end the week and will play one more game at home before participating in the Kubota College Baseball Series in Arlington, Texas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about going in there and executing it and trusting it,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to click.\u201d\n\nUSC will attempt to extend its winning streak to three against future Big Ten opponent Michigan on Tuesday at 6 p.m. at Page Stadium, one of USC\u2019s other two home fields this season.\n```"}

Interim head coach Jim Hiller\u2019s team tallied two big wins on the road this past week before heading home for a date with the Columbus Blue Jackets, where Los Angeles won its fourth straight game in a 5-1 rout. LA\u2019s hopes of extending its four-game win streak were shattered, though, when the Nashville Predators\u2019 defensive performance shut down the Kings in a 4-1 result. However, Los Angeles found the win column again in a rivalry affair with the Anaheim Ducks in a 3-2 shootout win to finish the homestand on a positive note.\n\nWhile the Kings have been victorious recently, two players did suffer injury setbacks. Forward Viktor Arvidsson was placed on the long-term injury reserve right as he had returned to action, following a back surgery that sidelined him for the first 50 games of the season. Arvidsson sustained a lower-body injury against the Blue Jackets which will keep him absent for the next 10 games at least. He only appeared in four games before this new injury.\n\n\u201cWhen [Arvidsson] is in the lineup, he\u2019s full of energy, he\u2019s passionate,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cHe wants to win as bad as anybody in the building.\u201d\n\nOn top of Arvidsson\u2019s injury, top-four defenseman Mikey Anderson will sit out week-to-week as he suffered an upper-body injury against the Predators, bringing a need for the Kings\u2019 defensive pieces to rise to the occasion.\n\nIn the previous week, when the Kings were on the road, Los Angeles secured a 6-5 overtime win over the Boston Bruins, a game for the ages. The Kings\u2019 penalty kill answered the call in the extra frame when Boston went on the man advantage before rookie defenseman Brandt Clarke exited the penalty box in a heartbeat. As soon as center Phillip Danault defended a pass from Bruins winger David Pastrnak, Danault found Clarke, whose breakaway opportunity resulted in his first NHL goal and the game winner for Los Angeles. Center Pierre-Luc Dubois tallied two assists in the win as well, marking his first multi-point performance since Jan. 15.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 next test was the Pittsburgh Penguins, who were celebrating the jersey retirement of legend Jaromir Jagr. Kings winger Adrian Kempe was the game changer in a close, 2-1 finish. LA couldn\u2019t find the back of the net in the first two periods before Kempe evened the game with about six minutes remaining in the third. A delay of game call on Kings winger Trevor Moore, though, with 5:03 remaining, gave the Penguins the chance to win the game. With seconds ticking on Pittsburgh\u2019s power play, Kings center An\u017ee Kopitar intercepted a pass and dished it to Kempe in the neutral zone, who wristed the puck from the far-side circle to score the shorthanded, go-ahead goal. LA held on to win and headed home with confidence.\n\nAgainst Columbus, Dubois had himself yet another two-point performance, but it was Winger Quinton Byfield who got the show started. After a tiresome start to the first period, Byfield notched an impressive coast-to-coast goal where he deked a defender and finished with a backhanded shot on his knees. Goaltender Cam Talbot also made 33 saves in a solid 5-1 Kings victory.\n\nThe following game against Nashville was a different story, however. The Kings and Preds traded one goal apiece in the first before Nashville\u2019s Mark Jankowski poked in the eventual game-winner in the second. The Predators later scored twice on the empty net for insurance and finished with a 4-1 victory.\n\nMost recently, LA defeated Anaheim in this season\u2019s second Freeway Face-Off. The Kings and Ducks needed a shootout to decide the victor, but in regulation, battled in a special teams war. The teams both tallied power play goals in the first period and Kings winger Kevin Fiala extended his goal streak to three straight games. Anaheim took the lead on a shorthanded, two-on-one breakaway chance in which center Sam Carrick tipped in the go-ahead goal. Los Angeles found itself on the power play five minutes later, though, and Drew Doughty tied the game with his 13th goal of the year, his most in a season since 2015-16. The third period and overtime frame saw efficient defense. In the shootout, L.A. outlasted the Ducks as David Rittich made the game-winning stop to seal the matchup\u2019s fate, 3-2.\n\n\u201cThat was huge. Every point matters right now,\u201d said defenseman Matt Roy. \u201cWe dug ourselves a bit of a hole there in January, so we need to take what we can get now.\u201d\n\nThis week, the Kings will venture up to Western Canada for critical bouts with Pacific opponents. The Oilers, Flames and Canucks are on tap next and Los Angeles will hope to keep its playoff push going strong.\n```"}

Richardson.\n\nRapper, actor, and social activist Common did a book signing and photo op after his panel discussion this past Tuesday, less than a month after the release of his latest book \u201cAnd Then We Rise: A Guide to Loving and Taking Care of Self.\u201d The event was hosted at the Bovard Auditorium by Dr. Alissa Richardson, the director of the USC Annenberg Charlotta Bass Journalism and Justice Lab, in affiliation with the USC Visions and Voices initiative.\n\nCommon opened the event by discussing how his diverse environment affected his upbringing and mindset growing up in the southside of Chicago. He said that the town provided a \u201cbeautiful and colorful foundation\u201d for the person he would become and cited the diversity present in his community as the reason for his current open-mindedness.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my mother put me in an unapologetically Black non-denominational church, and with that came spirituality, self-love and self-pride,\u201d Common said. \u201cI was around very different kinds of people and it all shaped and put me on the path of who I wanted to be. It helped me find myself and I felt confident because of how accepted I was in my community.\u201d\n\nWhile Common said that the love and support offered by his community was a cornerstone of his development as an artist and person, he recognized the shortcomings of growing up in an environment where discussions around mental health and self-love were stigmatized and completely nonexistent.\n\n\u201cWithin the writing of this book, I was thinking about some of my friends who hadn\u2019t been exposed to concepts like taking care of themselves or dismissed the idea of therapy,\u201d Common said. \u201cI wanted these Black and brown men and women to know that it\u2019s okay to seek out help and talk to someone who isn\u2019t a family member about emotional traumas and things you\u2019re going through. Going to those deep places allows you to heal, which is liberating.\u201d\n\nA lifelong activist, Common\u2019s involvement with \u201chigh potential\u201d communities has stretched far beyond discussions about mental health. He talked about how his work with the \u201cImagine Justice\u201d foundation is helping those affected by the mass incarceration \u201cepidemic\u201d in the United States and how prison reform was a cause he was passionate about.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been visiting prisons here in California and bonding with the most beautiful and enlightened individuals that might not ever get out of prison,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current system is built around punishment instead of healing, and I want those incarcerated to come back better instead of being locked in a punishing cycle.\u201d\n\nCommon\u2019s activism work has been a major proponent of his career, as well. He won Grammy Awards and an Academy Award for his song \u201cGlory,\u201d which is featured in the historical drama \u201cSelma\u201d about the voting marches led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s.\n\nWith the variety of causes that Common has covered over his lifetime, he said that one of the biggest lessons that he has learned during this time is the importance of self-care, which is how he came up with his book title.\n\n\u201cWithout really taking care of myself, I would never be able to fully provide a community or the world with what I want to do,\u201d Common said. \u201cI came up with the name \u2018And Then We Rise\u2019 because if I love and take care of myself, I\u2019m going to organically elevate my community by allowing my light to shine through my work.\u201d\n\nCommon stated that writing \u201cAnd Then We Rise\u201d was a \u201ctherapeutic\u201d experience for him because of the intense period of reflection it provided.\n\n\u201cWe have so much stuff going on in our lives that sometimes we forget to remember who we are,\u201d he said. \u201cWriting this book let me revisit that. People ask me if I was always like this, and while I had love and peace in me growing up, I learned so much more once I left Chicago. It\u2019s really helped me remember where I came from and how I\u2019ve grown.\u201d\n\nCommon said that he saw the idea of organically elevating the people around him that was presented in his book three days before the panel, when he talked to a veteran who was escorting him during an All-Star basketball game in Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cThe guy escorting me told me that he was overseas during intense periods of war and had to deal with a lot of loss happening around him,\u201d Common said. \u201cAnd he told me that the people he was serving with listened to my music to see a hopeful side of life and it really helped him get through the war. It really made me recognize the power that a microphone held.\u201d\n\nStudent reactions to Common\u2019s panel were overwhelmingly positive and many were deeply moved by his anecdotes. Senior Amari Ponds said that Common\u2019s words to USC students were more relevant than ever and was grateful that he shared the lessons that he had learned throughout his life.\n\n\u201cI feel like Common has so much wisdom to share, and I see it in his spoken word and his music, which are [both] very powerful,\u201d Ponds said. \u201cAt a PWI [Predominantly White Institution] specifically, I feel like it is just so important to have these influential people come and speak with us and have this representation for us, especially during Black History Month, because it\u2019s something that will bring together the Black community at USC.\u201d\n\nZamaria Demby, a recent USC Marshall alum, also said she was glad that the Bass Lab hosted the event because she believed that it would inspire students who were creatively focused and interested in the activist work that Common championed.\n\n\u201cOne thing that USC does really well is foster creatives, entrepreneurs and people who are just really driven and I think that\u2019s what Common is all about,\u201d Demby said. \u201cSo this just seems like a really good match. Since he\u2019s rapping about social injustice, a place of academia is where he needs to be to meet the audience that he\u2019s talking to, people that are understanding what he\u2019s talking about, and maybe want to do something about it.\u201d\n\nCommon closed out the event by surprising students with an impromptu rap performance, joking that he couldn\u2019t call himself a real MC without doing a fun rap to the crowd of cheering students.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pentatonic the way I be bending phonics; It was written like I\u2019m living in a sonnet,\u201d Common rapped. \u201cThey be marveling at me like I\u2019m in a comic; I ain\u2019t sharp as iron man, it\u2019s ironic.\u201d\n\nNolan Ezzet contributed to this story.\n```"}

Galen Center was packed with players\u2019 family, friends and dedicated fans to support the graduating Trojans on Senior Day, but the high energy in the stands was not enough to propel the Trojans to victory.\n\nComing off of their high-scoring win over Colorado on Friday, the Trojans were expected to take care of the ball and shoot accurately from the field, but they couldn\u2019t quite emulate their scoring success from the other night. The Trojans got off to a slow start in the first quarter, as their shots wouldn\u2019t fall and they struggled to finish at the rim. USC was unable to contain Utah\u2019s scrappiness or defend its shots from the field, which continued to be a theme throughout the rest of the game. By the end of the first, USC trailed Utah by the low score of 14-6.\n\nThe squad picked up momentum in the second quarter. Freshman guard JuJu Watkins had back-to-back 3-point plays and some important assists, allowing the Trojans to slowly catch up. As the best shooting team in the Pac-12, however, Utah continued to nail its jumpers and led 34-28 by halftime.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t run them off the 3-point line enough, flat out, for them to take 27 [3-point] attempts total,\u201d USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cSome of it was missed shots, but most of it was that we couldn\u2019t catch our rhythm. But, I thought we started attacking more in quarters two, three and four.\n\nThe second half was a constant game of catch-up for the Trojans, and aggression was at a high for both teams. Senior forward Kaitlyn Davis stood out as a team player with eight rebounds, but, unfortunately for the Trojans, she was a bit too aggressive on the defensive end and fouled out of the game toward the end of the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cShe plays extremely hard on both ends of the floor and everything in between,\u201d Gottlieb said of Davis. \u201cFor the 40 minutes of the game, she\u2019s gonna go all out, and that\u2019s one of the million reasons we love her.\u201d\n\nThe final minutes of the matchup were stressful. Down by just three points, the Trojans worked to close the gap, but the end-of-game free throws did not work in their favor. Overall, USC was unable to string its offense and defense together, resulting in the team\u2019s first loss since January 28 and ending a seven-game winning streak.\n\nAlthough Sunday\u2019s competition was the last regular-season home game for the graduating Trojans, there is a lot more basketball ahead of them, including the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments. USC is still in good shape to grab a top-four seed in the NCAAs, which would give the Trojans up to two more games at Galen Center. Before that, the team looks forward to its road trip to Arizona. USC will face Arizona on Thursday at 5 p.m. and Arizona State on Saturday at 11 a.m. PST.\n```"}

The Bruins took home a 65-50 victory in the teams\u2019 first meeting on January 27; UCLA is 6-2 since then, while USC has gone 3-5 in that same stretch. Prior to Saturday\u2019s matchup, USC had lost their last seven road games and nine of their last 11 total games.\n\nThe game started slow, as both teams struggled to generate offense early. But fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis got into an offensive rhythm, both attacking the basket and picking up threes for USC. Ellis had a fantastic start to the game, scoring 17 of the Trojans\u2019 first 25 points. USC racked up fouls early, sending UCLA into the bonus about halfway through the first period. But the offense kept flowing for the Trojans, especially Ellis. USC was able to sink seven 3-pointers in the first half and the team looked comfortable in its rotations. Junior guard Kobe Johnson hit a big three to put USC up 33-19, giving the team its largest lead of the night.\n\nThe end of the first half, though, was all Bruins. They put defensive pressure on Ellis and created second-chance opportunities to begin creeping back into the game. It didn\u2019t help that USC went cold offensively and struggled from the free-throw line, shooting 3-for-8 in the first half from the stripe (UCLA, meanwhile, went 9-for-9). The Trojans only scored one point in the last 5:41 of first-half play, allowing the Bruins to go on a 15-1 run to tie it, 34-34, at the half. It was the first time the teams had tied since it was 10-10.\n\nWhen the Trojans returned from the locker room after halftime, it was clear they had a sense of purpose about them. Through the first six minutes and change, USC put together a 10-0 run. UCLA sophomore center Adem Bona and freshman forward Brandon Williams each committed their third fouls early in the half, limiting the Bruins on both sides of the floor. Freshman guard Isaiah Collier only put up three points in the first half, but he helped lead the Trojan charge early in the second. Johnson, Ellis and graduate forward DJ Rodman also contributed timely offensive buckets. In the first half of the second period, USC outscored UCLA 16-3 and held the Bruins to 1-for-14 from the floor in that time.\n\nEvery now and then, it seemed like UCLA might make a run, but the Bruins missed Bona\u2019s presence due to foul trouble and struggled with turnovers in key moments, amassing 15 for the night. The Bruins brought it back within six near the end of the game, but never seemed to get in a rhythm, and the Trojans ran the clock down.\n\nThe game was a glimpse at what this USC team could look like at full health. Head coach Andy Enfield said he looks forward to the future with this established lineup. \u201cWe need every day of practice because we\u2019ve been so sporadic with our lineups all season, with guys being out from November all the way through now,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThe last two weeks, we\u2019ve had the best practices we\u2019ve had all season.\u201d\n\nInjuries and illnesses have plagued this Trojan team all season. Ellis, who has missed six games this year, commented on the recovery process. \u201cIt was really frustrating. I couldn\u2019t beat anybody off the dribble for a long time. It was getting very frustrating for me. But I just stuck with it.\u201d\n\nEllis contributed a team-high 24 points and grabbed five boards for the Trojans. Collier had a bit of a slower start, but he finished with 11 points and four assists. Johnson added 10 points and four steals.\n\n\u201cTonight, I think they made their mind up that enough was enough, and they played as hard as they could,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nThe Trojans visit Washington State to take on the No. 21 Cougars on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

Goaltender David Rittich sealed the Kings victory, saving Ducks winger Alex Killorn\u2019s potential game-extending effort. The Kings are now 6-2-0 under the helm of interim head coach Jim Hiller, and sit at 68 points, now even with the Edmonton Oilers in the Pacific Division.\n\n\u201cObviously, the shootout, we haven\u2019t been great at shootouts all year, so that was big for confidence,\u201d said Kings forward Adrian Kempe. \u201cAnd I think overall [we] deserved the two points. Maybe wasn\u2019t our best performance overall, but it was a big win.\u201d\n\nThe first period started fast and physical for both sides. Los Angeles created some quality chances until center Blake Lizotte received a holding penalty, which shifted momentum. From the face-off\u2014and less than 10 seconds into the power play\u2014Ducks winger Jakob Silfverberg\u2019s wrist shot from the left side put Anaheim on the board.\n\nThe one-goal deficit ignited the Kings\u2019 energy, however. Los Angeles had chances from Quinton Byfield, Jaret Anderson-Dolan and youngster Brandt Clarke, before Lizotte drew an interference call on Killorn. From there, Kempe and blueliner Drew Doughty set up winger Kevin Fiala, who hit the top corner of the net to tie the game with under five minutes remaining in the first.\n\n\u201cGoal-scorers, they like to feel it,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cOnce you get one, all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence. Instead of thinking pass, you\u2019re thinking shot, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with Kevin [Fiala]. I thought that was one of Kevin\u2019s better games of the year. In the O-zone, he looked like himself.\u201d\n\nAt first intermission, the teams were even at one goal apiece. Early in the second period, L.A. killed off a Ducks power play and Rittich made some nice stops, before the Kings found themselves on a man advantage of their own. However, Adam Henrique led a two-on-one shorthanded chance and connected with centerman Sam Carrick for the tip-in to take the lead.\n\nKillorn would make his way back to the sin bin with 6:47 remaining in the period, which set up Los Angeles to tie the game. This time, it was Doughty who lit the lamp. A successful goalie screen from Byfield allowed Doughty to find the back of the net from the center point over halfway through the power play. Fiala and Kempe helped Doughty for the score, putting all three skaters at two points on the night. Right after the goal, L.A. had a few more chances, but the teams headed to the dressing room even at 2-2.\n\nIn the third period, both teams reached a stalemate. Kings winger Trevor Moore\u2019s on-target shot with 14 minutes remaining was nearly rebounded in, but Anaheim goalie John Gibson immediately hopped on the puck. The Ducks nearly tallied the go-ahead goal themselves off a shot from Mason McTavish with just under eight minutes remaining, but Rittich used his pads to make the save. Clarke also had a quality chance with about three minutes remaining, but couldn\u2019t get it to go. At the end of regulation, the score remained 2-2.\n\nBoth Los Angeles and Anaheim couldn\u2019t generate much offense in the five-minute overtime frame, sending the game to a shootout. Center Pierre-Luc Dubois wristed in the Kings first attempt and Rittich saved McTavish\u2019s shot for the Ducks. Moore made L.A.\u2019s second round try, but Anaheim responded in kind, as first-line center Leo Carlsson beat Rittich in the crease. Gibson used the blocker to prevent Fiala\u2019s third round attempt, giving Killorn the chance to extend the game. On his knees, though, Rittich\u2019s pads blocked Anaheim\u2019s final shot which won the game for the Kings, 3-2.\n\n\u201cTonight, our offense was really good,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need that type of game with that balance on the road, playing three good teams.\u201d\n\nDoughty\u2019s impact in this game was crucial considering defenseman Mikey Anderson\u2019s recent injury. Ironically, on the day of his bobblehead giveaway night, it was reported that the upper-body injury Anderson suffered during Thursday\u2019s game against Nashville will sideline him week-to-week. Anderson had been second in average ice time per game for the Kings, so his injury is detrimental.\n\n\u201cOur line of Lizotte, Lewis and [Anderson-Dolan] played very well tonight,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cThat was a real spark for us.\u201d\n\nThe Kings grabbed a huge two points, putting them right back in contention for a top-three spot in the division. The Ducks, on the other hand, have now lost six of their last 10 games and sit third-to-last in the entire NHL. These two clubs will meet two more times this season, but the Kings have taken both games thus far. Los Angeles will venture up to Western Canada next for critical matchups against the Oilers, Flames and Canucks. Anaheim, on the other hand, will head back down on the I-405 to host the Predators, before heading up north for a bout with the Sharks.\n```"}

(Photo by Kendall Arjoon)\n\nBy Sammie Yen February 24, 2024 at 8:08 pm PST\n\nThe No. 10 Trojans (10-6, 2-2 MPSF) fell to the No. 2 Antelopes (13-0, 4-0 MPSF) in back-to-back matches. Coming off of a tough 3-1 road loss to the Grand Canyon Antelopes the night before, the Trojans could not regain their footing in the second half of back-to-back matches on February 24, falling 3-0 in the Antelope Gymnasium.\n\nBut USC head coach Jeff Nygaard didn\u2019t take the loss as a disappointment. How did he feel? \u201cEncouraged,\u201d Nygaard said, \u201cI was encouraged. We kept our composure. We kept at it. At that level, when we\u2019re playing at the top . . . it\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nClearly, the first set showed it was anyone\u2019s game. While Grand Canyon boasted some hard-hitting kills, the Trojans answered viciously, with powerful slams from senior middle blocker Kyle Paulson and freshman middle Wesley Smith. Sophomore outside hitter Riley Haine seemed to place a kill right on the line. But after further review, the call was reversed, changing the momentum of the set, as the Antelopes followed up with an ace and subsequent kill.\n\nSmith\u2019s blocks were otherworldly, rejecting futile attempts of back row and outside kills. \u201cHe\u2019s never made those big-block moves the way he did tonight. He got some guys real good,\u201d Nygaard said.\n\nAlthough USC sought to close the 23-16 gap, GCU proved why it\u2019s ranked second overall, slamming it home with well-placed kills and monster serves. The Antelopes ran away with the first set, 25-18.\n\nThe second set was marked with a defiance of gravity on both ends of the court. The Trojans hung in there until the Antelopes\u2019 late run gave them just the boost they needed to take the second set, too, 25-20.\n\nBut the Trojan\u2019s effort shone through in the third set, which was quite literally a battle to stay alive and in the game. Point to point. Kill to kill. Block to block. USC was not letting the Antelopes get away with it so easily, battling past the deuce until the Antelopes sealed the game, with a final set score of 30-28.\n\nSophomore outsider hitter Dillon Klein put up a fantastic performance, leading the team in spirit and in kills. He reached double-digit kills for the 33rd time in his career. \u201cWe ran the middle really well,\u201d Klein said. \u201cThat\u2019s just a great team on the other side of the net.\u201d\n\nThe third set was also littered with contentious calls and several challenges. The refs often paused the game to review the latest play, like whether or not the ball actually landed out, or if hands reached too far over the net. \u201cThat\u2019s 30 seconds away from playing, so your muscles start to cool down, and focus starts to lapse a little bit,\u201d Klein noted.\n\nA couple of call reversals went the Trojans\u2019 way, and others didn\u2019t. But those one-point and two-point differentials solidified the fact that USC is playing at the top of its game.\n\nNygaard mentioned Klein\u2019s tenacity as a key component to USC\u2019s overall effort: \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter. We need him to be successful. He knows the responsibility he has, and it\u2019s something he wants. And that says a lot about the competitive spirit that he has.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s loss both shed light on the positives and negatives of its overall game. In looking ahead to USC\u2019s next match against No. 1 UCLA, Nygaard believes the team needs to sharpen \u201cfirst touches, first contact and first kills.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will host the Bruins on Thursday, February 29 at Galen Center at 7 p.m.\n```"}

(AP/Rick Scuteri, File)\n\nBy Victor Kevorkian February 24, 2024 at 6:39 pm PST\n\nFor the past month, Talk of Troy\u2019s in-house team of NFL Draft scouts have been hard at work analyzing this year\u2019s crop of top college football prospects. The following analysis reflects the opinions of the entire scouting team. Prospects in this article have been listed in alphabetical order and are not ranked.\n\nKeon Coleman, Florida State. 6-foot-4, 215 pounds. The top threat for the ACC Champion Seminoles boasts an elite frame with good speed for his size. Coleman shows elite ball skills and has amazing body control. His ability to contort his body in the air and snag the football is unreal\u2014many scouts consider Coleman the most talented jump-ball receiver in his class. Coleman possesses an absurd amount of overall strength, which makes it difficult to bring him down. He is an impressive athlete considering his size and is scary in the open field with the ball in his hands. Coleman is a tough player who brings a high level of intensity to his game. He can explode off the line of scrimmage and possesses great agility. Coleman\u2019s overall mechanics are below average. His footwork is choppy and he does not impress as a route runner, struggling to get separation more than most top receivers in his class.\n\nPros: - Size and build - Jump balls and contested catches - Physicality and athleticism - Body control\nCons: - Route running - Separation - Mechanics/footwork\n\nTroy Franklin, Oregon. 6-foot-3, 187 pounds. The name of the game is speed for the Ducks\u2019 leading pass catcher of 2023. Franklin shows blazing, NFL-ready speed from anywhere on the line of scrimmage. He works best in intermediate to deep concepts with a diverse route tree, and can take the top off a defense in an instant. Franklin is a patient route runner who keeps a low center of gravity and has sharp mechanics. He has a knack for the football and is always in the right place at the right time. He possesses a great understanding of leverage and always finds himself open down the seam. Franklin also shows elite burst and an impressive get-off, keeping corners honest. Although it has potential, Franklin\u2019s run-after-catch ability does not impress for a player as fast as he is. He lacks the vision and patience to follow his blockers, and his slim frame prevents him from breaking tackles. Franklin is also prone to drops and is not the best at tracking the football down the field.\n\nPros: - Speed, burst, get-off - Change of direction - Versatility - Route running\nCons: - Lanky frame - Hands - Ball tracking - Run-after-catch\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr., Ohio State. 6-foot-4, 205 pounds. As the number one option at Ohio State for the past two years, Harrison is as close to the perfect wide receiver prospect one can get. He can win reps over the best corners on the field against man and zone coverage due to his rare combination of athleticism, route running, technique and play strength. Harrison can run just about any route in the book and has a very good release off the line of scrimmage, which allows him to beat press and jam coverages. He is a quick athlete and can manipulate cornerbacks with his hips. He is also a great blocker who is physical at the point of attack. Harrison\u2019s one glaring issue is his run after the catch ability. He lacks the long speed and burst to pull away from corners, and struggles to break tackles or make defenders miss in space due to his high center of gravity.\n\nPros: - Route running - Athleticism - Hands - Get off\nCons: - Run-after-catch - Ability to break tackles\n\nMalik Nabers, LSU. 6-foot, 201 pounds. The number one target for Heisman-winning quarterback Jayden Daniels is an elite athlete with exceptional ball skills and an incredible ability to adjust. Nabers\u2019 tracking ability is second to none, and the LSU product can high-point a football with great body control. He can not only take the top off a defense with his exceptional speed and burst, but take a slant to the house with his run-after-catch ability. Nabers is not much of a route technician and relies on his athleticism to beat cornerbacks. He often rounds off his routes and is not mechanically sound. His get-off is not as quick as you\u2019d want at the pro level, and his play strength is subpar.\n\nPros: - Athleticism - Body control - Speed - Run-after-catch\nCons: - Route running - Strength - Mechanics/footwork - Get-off\n\nRome Odunze, Washington. 6-foot-3, 216 pounds. The number one option for the Pac-12 Champion Washington Huskies is a true X receiver with elite mental processing. He has strong body control and ball skills with an impressive ability to track the football and adjust. Odunze shows a knack for the football with his contested catch ability. He can work all areas of the field and is a great route runner who can sell vertical routes. He\u2019s a versatile athlete who is a lot quicker than his height and weight should allow. Odunze shows a high understanding of leverage and coverage concepts, often finding and sitting in the soft spots of the zone. He is a patient player with the ball in his hands and a decent run-after-catch threat. Odunze is a decently fast player but lacks a second gear and the ability to explode out of his breaks. Odunze lacks physicality and is often overwhelmed by stronger defenders. He also struggles against press and man coverage.\n\nPros: - Football IQ - Body control - Contested catch ability - Route running\nCons: - Physicality - Burst\n\nBrian Thomas Jr., LSU. 6-foot-4, 205 pounds. Nabers\u2019 counterpart comes in next on the list with a high, explosive motor and great overall length. While he may not be as explosive as Nabers, Thomas shows great ability with the ball in his hands and has great vision when navigating through traffic. He demonstrates excellent footwork and get off, and understands leverage and zone concepts to a high degree. Thomas is a threat down the field and in the intermediate passing lanes. Thomas has soft, reliable hands and has an excellent combination of size and speed. He is also a good blocker and finishes plays from snap to whistle. For a player of his size, his ability to sink his hips and change direction is absurd, demonstrated by his strong run-after-catch ability. Thomas tends to struggle to create separation at the top of his routes and does not have a diverse route tree. He often rounds off routes like Nabers, and works best when given a free release off the line of scrimmage. Jam and press coverage looks seem to be an issue for him and he fails to manipulate corners with his eyes and hips.\n\nPros: - Understanding of coverages - Size - Blocking - Run-after-catch\nCons: - Route running - Get-off\n```"}

Photo by Daphne Yaman\n\nBy Daphne Yaman\nFebruary 24, 2024 at 3:02 pm PST\n\nIRMO, S.C. \u2014 Barry Boyett is a self-described hillbilly from Alabama. He dons blue jeans and what appears to be a homemade yellow T-shirt with \u201cYou can do it Nikki !!\u201d printed on the back. His long white hair is tied in a loose ponytail at the nape of his neck, and he shoulders a proportionately large walking stick as he stands at the edge of the Nikki Haley rally he has just attended at Irmo Town Park.\n\n\u201cI always go for whoever\u2019s the best person,\u201d Boyett proclaims. His Alabama twang prevails in his drawn-out vowels and slow, rhythmic pronunciation. He says that he appreciates Haley\u2019s honesty, and believes in the sincerity of her statements and policies. He\u2019s lived in South Carolina for the past 60 years and experienced her 8-year stint as governor first-hand.\n\nThe former construction worker explains that he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. When it comes to former President Donald Trump, Boyett is unequivocal. \u201cTrump scares the everloving devil out of me.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Trump won the state in the general election with 55% of the votes compared to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s 40%. Four years later, Trump claimed the same percentage, again winning 55% of votes to Joe Biden\u2019s 43%. The state\u2019s Republican primaries were canceled in 2020, but the former reality TV star came out on top in 2016, with roughly one-third of South Carolina Republicans casting their ballots in his favor.\n\nWill it be different on Saturday? Haley sure hopes so. But Annenberg Media interviews with voters across the state the week before the primary mostly pointed to a bad night for the former governor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of the two old men,\u201d states Karla Koenig. She\u2019s at the same Irmo Town Park rally as Boyett, wearing a navy puffer jacket covered in iron-on patches about her favorite things \u2014 Pok\u00e9mon and Batman \u2014 as well as the countries she had visited while serving in the U.S. Air Force. She\u2019s a disabled veteran and says she voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020.\n\nShe explains that she\u2019s frustrated with the Biden administration because of high inflation and a competitive job market, but that the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was a huge turning point for her potential support of Trump again. \u201cI\u2019m really upset about January and the lady dying who was in the Air Force,\u201d she explains with tears brimming in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it gets me emotional.\u201d\n\nFor many of the Republicans voting in the primaries, the fight is about fixing the mistakes they believe the Biden presidency has brought. \u201cThe view of America has definitely changed in a negative way over the last couple of years,\u201d says Hillary Higgins, a dance studio owner and single mom of three. She\u2019s just finished early voting in Lexington, a suburban area not far from the state capital, and as a U.S. military daughter, she\u2019s adamant in expressing her support for Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in the past that [Trump]\u2019s really good at defusing situations that are high, especially emotionally,\u201d she explains.\n\nRoy and Gretchen Parker have also just finished early voting at the same Lexington location. They\u2019re retired, with Roy having worked in the agricultural chemical business and Gretchen having worked as an occupational therapist. The couple explains the motivation behind their votes: \u201cEverything the Democrats are doing, and everything they\u2019ve undone from the Trump presidency.\u201d\n\nA sign outside of Lexington\u2019s early voting center at the county\u2019s administration building on Main Street. Photo by Daphne Yaman.\n\nWhen asked about specific policies they\u2019d like to see overturned, both are quick to point out the pitfalls of the current immigration system and how \u201cAll these people are just coming in and over-running us.\u201d They are in favor of Trump\u2019s \u201cStay in Mexico\u201d policy, citing concerns about gang violence and the protection of sanctuary cities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to lose our culture,\u201d said Gretchen Parker. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid for young people who have to live with the changes that are happening. Because you\u2019ve never experienced what we\u2019ve experienced.\u201d\n\nAlthough they admit that Haley was an \u201cexcellent governor,\u201d the Parkers say the former governor just doesn\u2019t have the same success rate that Trump has in their eyes.\n\nRight outside the front door of the voting center, 18-year-old first-time voter Christopher Hopkins II explains that the Trump presidency brought in an enthralling new age of entertaining politics, which is among the biggest drawing factors for him as a young voter. His dad smiles beside him as his son talks about his support for the former president.\n\nFor foreign policy, Hopkins explains that America\u2019s withdrawals from the Middle East have allowed terrorist groups to roam free, \u201cWe quite literally got the Taliban rollerskating down the streets now in night vision goggles.\u201d A video released three months ago by The Telegraph corroborates this claim.\n\nThe student is adamant that something like this would not happen under a Trump presidency. He says that inflation and the job market are the most notable America-based failures of the Biden administration that he\u2019s hoping to see changed, and it\u2019s a change that he doesn\u2019t believe Haley will have the tenacity to make.\n\n\u201cI feel like a lot of people still are going to vote for Nikki Haley because she\u2019s local ... but I don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s going to be as strong as Trump,\u201d Hopkins says.\n\nAnd this sentiment may be a pretty good summation of the aura of Republican politics in Haley\u2019s South Carolina.\n\nBack at the rally at Irmo Town Park, Boyett slowly walks past the event barricades, his yellow t-shirt and walking stick disappearing as he climbs the hill to the street. His fearful words about a second Trump presidency still hang in the air.\n\nAsked if the general election was to come down to Biden and Trump once again, he had paused before answering, \u201cI\u2019d have to go with Biden.\u201d\n```"}

If Haley is not the GOP nominee, some said here the week before the election, they might even abstain from voting altogether.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not a good candidate in that scenario,\u201d Sam Stanyon, a nurse manager for a national health insurance company, told Annenberg Media after a rally here for Nikki Haley, the state\u2019s former governor. Stanyon, who has lived in South Carolina for three years, said he is voting for Haley because he likes her standing on border control issues, but admitted she may not be perfect.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will be fully successful in everything, that\u2019s just unrealistic in any president,\u201d Stanyon said. \u201cTrump brings too much baggage, [he] is not good for the United States and Biden is not the worst president, but neither the best one, he has not done everything he said.\u201d\n\nEven those who backed Trump in 2016 said they will sit it out come November if Haley is not on the ballot. \u201cI would not vote at all,\u201d said Kim Holston, an insurance claims adjuster who voted for Haley during early voting in Lexington County where she grew up. Holston said that Haley handled a lot of \u201cterrible things\u201d happening in South Carolina when she was the governor with \u201ca lot of grace\u201d and she thinks that she can do the same as president of the country. She was joined by her daughter.\n\nFor many Republican voters, immigration policies and the border issue are a big problem. \u201c[South Carolina] is not a state border but it is still a concern for the people,\u201d said state Sen. Shane Massey, who serves as the majority leader. Massey spoke with Annenberg Media about the top concerns of his district and the state. He explained that many South Carolinians tend to be more enthusiastic than others when it comes to the type of policies that they think should be created to address illegal immigration and about the extensive involvement of the federal government on issues they would like the state to handle.\n\nHolston said she likes Haley\u2019s propositions on border control and that she will be a good candidate to take care of the country\u2019s financial issues even though she disagrees with some of Haley\u2019s social policies. \u201cMost people are not Democrat and Republican, most people fall in the middle. I\u2019m typically more liberal towards the social aspect,\u201d she said, after being asked about immigration policies and abortion.\n\nAfter a fundraising blitz and two rallies in Texas, Haley arrived in her home state a week away from the first in the South Republican primary. She visited multiple cities on a \u201cBeast of the Southeast\u201d bus tour, and told voters here in Irmo that \u201cthere will be a female president of the United States.\u201d\n\nSome Republican voters said they think it is about time to have a woman lead the country. \u201cNikki is good, she is strong, she [was] the ambassador of the United Nations, that\u2019s not a small feat,\u201d said Manning Frankstone, a Haley supporter who attended the Irmo rally on Feb. 17. \u201cI think she will make a great president... it\u2019s about time a woman is there.\u201d\n\nFor Loretta Smith, a retired artist who voted early for Haley and also saw her in Irmo, Trump did what he could as president during a pandemic. \u201cTrump did the best he could in a very difficult time, however, there was a lot of chaos and a lot of divisiveness in the country. It\u2019s not a time I look back fondly,\u201d Smith said. She said she voted for Haley because she was a great governor for South Carolina and that she has high expectations of her intelligence: \u201c[Haley] is a very strong, powerful woman and I think she can do this.\u201d\n\nSeven months ahead of the general election, some Haley supporters were already speculating about a Trump vs. Biden rematch in November. \u201cI would vote for Biden,\u201d said Katherine Frankstone after the Haley rally. \u201c[Trump] is so chaotic... he is a liar, a misogynist. I can\u2019t think of a good thing to say about him and to have him as the leader of the free world scares the ... out of me.\u201d\n\nA married retired couple supporting Haley at the rally in Irmo said even though they backed Trump previously they won\u2019t do it again. \u201cWe\u2019re just not gonna vote for Trump,\u201d George Long said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with Biden, I just wish the Democrats would put up a younger person up just to give us some more of a choice.\u201d This comes after the rising concerns among people who say they think both Biden and Trump are too old for the job and they need a younger person in the office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been Republicans most of our lives but we\u2019re definitely not voting Republican if it comes to just Trump and Biden.\u201d Sarah Long said. She added that they both \u201cfeel very strongly\u201d Trump is \u201cnot qualified.\u201d \u201cHe is not capable of handling the job,\u201d Long said. \u201cHe has done a lot of unethical things during his lifetime.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Carlson)\n\nBy Chuck White\nFebruary 24, 2024 at 11:19 am PST\n\nLEXINGTON, S.C. \u2014 Even as former President Donald Trump is poised to win South Carolina\u2019s Republican primary Saturday, there\u2019s a notable subset of voters backing Nikki Haley in hopes of stopping Trump\u2019s momentum toward becoming the nominee. Their votes for Haley, their former governor, are more about blocking Trump than supporting her record leading the state. The votes for Haley are coming from both Republicans and Democrats in the Palmetto State. In South Carolina voters can participate in either of the parties\u2019 primary elections.\n\nSeveral days reporting in the state revealed plenty of voters taking the opportunity to back Haley because of negative feelings about Trump. Some of the reasons voters gave an Annenberg Media reporter about why Trump should not be on the ballot this November included his policies on social issues, active lawsuits, and the need for new party leadership.\n\nExactly a week before the primary, early voters showed up to the Lexington Voter Registration Office, a long tan building which also had two white tents in front for easy curbside voting. It looked like an ordinary shopping center, but instead of going to a Michaels or T.J. Maxx, people came out on a cold morning to cast their ballots for the first-in-the-south Republican primary.\n\nA man walked out of the building in a zip-up hoodie with a gray t-shirt under that had a rainbow heart on it peeking out of the jacket. He was with his wife Heather Liasfha. They have lived for more than a decade in South Carolina, where Liasfha works as an R.N., and they are now questioning moving out of the state and possibly the country. The couple has a transgender son and said they fear for his safety in South Carolina.\n\nWhile they both identify as Democrats, they showed up here on Feb. 18 to vote for Haley. Liasfha said Trump getting back into office would lead to more laws like the  transgender healthcare bill  that is currently being debated in the South Carolina Senate. Liasfha and her husband are part of a movement of South Carolina Democrats who registered for the Republican primary to vote for Haley in an attempt to stop Trump from winning.\n\nPrimaryPivot, an organization working to weaken Trump, is calling on Independent and Democrat voters to join people like Liasfha in registering for the primary. In a media advisory sent last week, the co-founder of PrimaryPivot Robert Schwartz said, \u201cDemocrats and Independents have said for nine years that Trump is a unique threat to our democracy. Well now is the time to put our democracy first and vote against Trump.\u201d\n\nPrimaryPivot has also started promoting the same movement in Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia \u2014 states that allow for crossover voting in their upcoming primary contests.\n\nDrew McKissick, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, said he strongly condemns this effort. In a press release sent Monday, McKissick said their primary \u201chas the best track record in the country for picking presidents, and I\u2019m not going to sit back and allow Democrats to tarnish our reputation.\u201d\n\nIn an interview the same day, McKissick told reporters since the primary began in 1980, \u201cno Republican has ever become president of the United States without winning the South Carolina primary,\u201d said McKissick.\n\nDemocrats are not the only ones coming to the polls voting against Trump. Some Republicans told Annenberg Media they do not want Trump as the nominee in November and are choosing to vote for Haley to prevent that from happening.\n\nKatherine Barroll, a 67-year-old practicing attorney in Columbia, said she strongly wants to avoid a Trump-Biden general election rematch. \u201cHades would have to freeze hell over before I vote for Trump,\u201d Barroll said slowly with a thick twang while shaking her finger in the air. Barroll said she did not remember anything significant about Haley\u2019s time as her governor but still voted for her. She cited Trump\u2019s legal battles and his role in the January 6 insurrection as her main reasons.\n\nOther Republican voters said they are not happy with the current state of the party and do not like either of the candidates on the ballot. They expressed that change in the party leadership is not going to come from Trump returning to the Oval Office.\n\nDave Kelly is a Republican veteran who lives in Lexington. He said he does not have faith in the future of the party but still chooses to identify with it. Kelly said he liked Trump\u2019s charisma but that his approach to the presidency was too authoritarian. He liked Haley as governor, however he had some doubts about her gender. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a bit of a male chauvinist...we\u2019re not ready for a woman president, we need someone with a backbone,\u201d Kelly said. Still, Kelly did end up voting for her because he said the party needs to move on from Trump.\n\nSaturday\u2019s primary comes after Trump has built a delegate lead thanks to victories in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Haley has vowed to stay in the race no matter Saturday\u2019s outcome and compete in all the Super Tuesday states.\n```"}

(Photo by Grace Harrington)\n\nBy Grace Harrington\nFebruary 24, 2024 at 10:45 am PST\n\nLEXINGTON, S.C. \u2014 This county may have been the launching point for Nikki Haley\u2019s political career, but many of these voters are saying they don\u2019t want her back as president. On the final Saturday of early voting ahead of South Carolina\u2019s Republican primary, people lined up to cast ballots at a steady pace at the County of Lexington Auxiliary Administration building, just a 10-minute drive from Haley\u2019s old house.\n\nA sampling of these Republican voters told Annenberg Media that while they liked Haley as governor from 2011 to 2017, they aren\u2019t ready to make her president. \u201cShe was an excellent governor,\u201d said Gretchen Parker, a retiree who has lived in South Carolina for 27 years. Parker and her husband, Roy, said they both voted for former President Donald Trump. Haley is the last person standing between Trump and the Republican nomination to challenge President Joe Biden.\n\nEven though Trump has been leading her in state polls by more than 20 points, Haley has promised she would stay in the race past the South Carolina primary and even beyond Super Tuesday on March 5. But a loss in South Carolina \u2014 especially in Lexington County, where Haley was first elected to the state\u2019s House of Representatives in 2004 \u2014 would be a strong rebuke from the voters who know her the best.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t good with business,\u201d Gretchen Parker said. Parker did not specify what she didn\u2019t like about Haley\u2019s business record, but across the campaign trail, Haley has touted her economic record as governor\u2014 including calling South Carolina \u201cthe Beast of the Southeast.\u201d\n\nLike many other Lexington County voters on this cloudy Saturday, the Parkers\u2019 biggest concern is border security. Migrant crossings at the southern border hit a record high in 2023. \u201cAll these people are just coming in and over-running us. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re gonna lose our culture. I\u2019m afraid for young people who have to live with the changes that are happening,\u201d Gretchen Parker said.\n\nRoy Parker said that he believes Trump will reinstate his more strict border policies and continue the construction of a border wall upon which he had based his 2016 campaign. \u201cTrump delivers on what he says he will deliver on. So often politicians promise one thing and do something different,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump did construct around 450 miles of barriers along the southern border, but the majority of that was reinforcing a structure that was already in place, according to the BBC.\n\nThe economy is a top priority for Hillary Higgins, 38, a local dance studio owner and single mother of three. \u201cWhere we are now is the most difficult it\u2019s ever been in my entire life. I\u2019ve never lived during a time where things were so out of reach, affordability-wise,\u201d Higgins said just after casting her ballot.\n\nHiggins, who lives in Batesburg-Leesville, a small town of around 5,000 people, said she can\u2019t buy a house because interest rates are so high. There\u2019s a limited inventory of houses in her town, and when one goes on the market, it\u2019s too expensive. \u201cThey\u2019re two to three times as much as they were just 10 years ago,\u201d Higgins said.\n\nHiggins voted for Trump and said she doesn\u2019t like Haley because she\u2019s \u201cwishy-washy.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s going to be a strong candidate for me, in that I think she says what she thinks that people want to hear,\u201d Higgins said.\n\nAlthough Haley did serve as U.N. ambassador during Trump\u2019s administration, Higgins sees her as weak on foreign policy. Higgins said that her grandparents served in World War II and that shaped her view on foreign affairs. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of conversation about international relations over the years in my household, and really looking at how the president presents themselves makes a big difference in the outcome,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know that [Haley] would be the right one for that.\u201d Higgins said she\u2019s confident Trump will handle conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to defuse the situation and bring a little more peace to that area,\u201d she said.\n\nForeign affairs is also a top concern for Christopher Hopkins II, 18, who was there with his dad to cast a ballot for the first time. Hopkins criticized Biden\u2019s 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. \u201cWe drew out, you know, we quite literally got the Taliban roller skating down the street now,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nIn November 2023, a video of Taliban security forces patrolling the city on rollerblades went viral. Hopkins said he thought that people in Lexington County would vote for Haley, \u201cbecause she\u2019s local,\u201d but he voted for Trump.\n\nKim Holston, 38, an insurance claims adjuster, grew up in the Lexington area and said she voted for Haley. \u201cI think that she handled a lot of terrible things in the state of South Carolina with a lot of grace. And so I think that she can do the same as president,\u201d Holston said.\n\nHolston said she didn\u2019t vote in the 2020 election and won\u2019t vote this year if Trump is the nominee again. \u201cRight now, Trump just says whatever comes to his mind, and it\u2019s not exactly great for the country,\u201d she said.\n\nOf the dozens of people casting ballots for early voting Saturday, Holston was one of the few voters Annenberg Media could find in Haley\u2019s old stomping grounds who said they had chosen her.\n\n\u201cWe like Haley, we just don\u2019t think she\u2019s ready for primetime,\u201d Gretchen Parker said.\n```"}

(Photo by Anusha Shankar)\n\nBy Terence Holton February 23, 2024 at 11:34 pm PST\n\nIn a packed Galen Center, No. 7 USC women\u2019s basketball outlasted No. 11 Colorado Friday night in an 87-81 victory over the Buffaloes. Freshman guard JuJu \u201cWalking 30 Ball\u201d Watkins powered USC, dropping 42 points and continuing her historic season. Watkins also broke the all-time USC record for most 30-point games in a season (11), as well as the most points ever scored by a basketball player at Galen Center \u2014 men\u2019s or women\u2019s. Watkins went 18 of 18 at the free throw line as well, contributing to the Trojans\u2019 near perfect night from the stripe, setting a third record on the night with the most consecutive made free throws in Pac-12 history.\n\nThe first quarter can only be described as a slug fest between two titans of college basketball, as there were a combined 11 fouls. After an inefficient scoring output against Oregon State, Watkins had already nearly matched her point total against the Beavers, with 15 through the first. Regardless of Watkins\u2019 usual scoring expertise, USC started off on fire. The first half could not have started any better from beyond the arc for the Trojans; USC shot 10-for-12 from three. The Trojans made twice as many 3-pointers than 2-point field goals.\n\nHead coach Lindsay Gottlieb was happy with looks the Trojans got from three this time around, as the Trojans only shot 35% from three in Boulder. \u201cWe tried to figure out the best way we could get looks against Colorado\u2019s pressure, but they got to make shots, it\u2019s under high duress and Colorado\u2019s a great defensive team,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think there were a lot of toughness plays as well, but obviously the 3-point shooting took the shine, which it should.\u201d\n\nColorado, however, was not taking this 3-point barrage on the chin. The Buffaloes were shooting 16-for-22 from the field and 5-for-6 from 3-point land at the end of the half. Colorado was pounding the paint, led by junior center Aaronette Vonleh\u2019s 11 points, 10 of which came down low in the lane. After a late run from the Buffaloes, USC only led Colorado 47-43 heading into the half, but this didn\u2019t deter Gottlieb. \u201cI was proud of the way we stayed together amidst any adversity,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI thought we were locked in together the whole time. Even when we were giving up some buckets, I felt like we were locked in and could figure out a way to get some stops.\u201d\n\nBeginning the second half, the struggle for the Trojans was turnovers. Not even two minutes into the third, Watkins tied her season high in turnovers, with seven. The frustration began to show for Watkins. After committing a turnover on one possession, she elbowed Colorado graduate guard Jaylyn Sherrod for a flagrant foul. \u201cIt\u2019s so intense that I think I was a little crazy tonight.\u201d Watkins said. \u201cIt was a great environment, and I think that brings it out of me, but I was just glad I was able to chill out and get the dub.\u201d\n\nThe two teams kept trading blows like Rocky and Apollo Creed all throughout the third, until a late run by the Trojans propelled USC to a 67-61 lead to end the quarter. The fourth quarter was all Trojans, as Watkins began with a steal and a three. After that momentum swing lit a spark under the fans\u2019 seats, USC took control the rest of the way, gaining a lead as high as 15 with four minutes to play. Even when Watkins\u2019 jersey ripped and she was forced to play with a new No. 32 shirt, there was no stopping her down the stretch.\n\nThe Trojans extended their win streak to seven games to stay in a tie for second in the Pac-12. The team also picked up its sixth win over a ranked opponent this season. \u201cThis [Colorado] is a team that was projected to be a No. 1 seed a week ago. Obviously, they\u2019re one of the best teams in the country and were fighting for positioning in the Pac-12,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cEvery win can be a signature win on that NCAA resume. We\u2019re well aware of that, and that\u2019s what the strength of this conference does \u2013 it makes everyone better.\u201d\n\nUSC looks to solidify itself at the top of college basketball this Sunday at Galen Center against No. 18 Utah at noon.\n```"}

The Trojans were led by freshman Bailey Shoemaker in the first round, who recorded a 6-under-par 67 to card the best score of the day out of 60 golfers. \u201cIt was a super clean round,\u201d head coach Justin Silverstein said. \u201cIt was only her second time seeing the golf course. ... So, to be able to put up a number like that, with no bogeys is really, really impressive.\u201d This put USC in a tie for first place with Arizona at the end of the first round. Junior Amari Avery and senior Brianna Navarrosa both posted scores below par at 70 and 72, respectively. \u201cWe had a really good first round,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cIt was the first stroke play event as a team in almost four months.\u201d Individually, three Trojans finished in the top 10 after the second day. Avery\u2019s eagle on the par-5 sixth hole and two birdies on the second and 14th holes counteracted against her two bogeys for a 1-under-par 72. During her sophomore season, Avery placed No. 8 in USC history for average strokes per round (71.76) and tied for first for the most rounds in the 60s in a single season (11). \u201c[Avery] has been great,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cApart from her ball striking, she\u2019s really improved her mental skill; she\u2019s able to stay much more present during rounds, accept results as they happen and not let them affect what happens after that.\u201d Shoemaker posted a 3-over-par 76 in the second round. Her performance was disrupted by two setbacks on the second and 15th holes, where she carded triple bogeys after previously recording pars on the opening day. \u201cThe golf course definitely got harder. First day was the easiest day, hole locations were a little easier and the course was a little softer. It got faster and firmer as the week went on,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we adjusted well enough. A lot of that falls on me and Tiffany [Joh] as staff, but we needed to make quick adjustments to how the ball was reacting and how fast the greens were.\u201d Despite a drop in its performance, USC still managed to stay in third place out of 12 teams after the second round. While UCLA and Stanford shared the top spot, they held a narrow one-stroke lead over the Trojans. USC faced a challenging final round, finishing the day nine strokes over par as a team. Avery shot 3 under par, giving her a T-2 finish individually at a tournament total of 7-under-par. Shoemaker\u2019s 5-over-par final round brought her three-day total to 2 over par, while Navarrosa\u2019s 77 placed her at 3 over par overall. Rounding out the Trojans\u2019 scoring were senior Christine Wang and sophomore Catherine Park, carding 7-over-par and 10-over-par tournament totals, respectively. \u201cI think one thing that did hurt us a little bit is that it\u2019s been so wet [in Los Angeles]. We\u2019ve seen kind of wet slow golf courses the past few weeks,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cAnd in Hawaii, it was pretty dry and pretty quick. So I think it was a vast difference from what we\u2019d seen at home. But that\u2019s beyond anybody\u2019s control.\u201d The Trojans concluded the Pac-12 Preview with a team score of 3 over par, leaving them in fourth place after battling through three days of competition. Now, they\u2019ll enjoy a two-week break before returning to action at the Juli Inkster at Meadow Club Invitational in Fairfax, California, on March 4 and 5.\n```"}

By   Adam Bradford February 23, 2024 at  8:47 pm PST \n \n \n We are officially less than a week away from the 2024 NFL Combine. With the NFL Draft just two months away, not only are the Chicago Bears, who hold the No. 1 overall pick, on the clock, but so is Daniel Jeremiah. As the lead draft analyst for NFL Network, Jeremiah is entering his busiest time of the year. On Thursday, he spoke with the media to discuss the upcoming combine and his latest mock draft, the second iteration he\u2019s released so far this year. To no surprise, Jeremiah starts out his mock draft with the obvious: USC quarterback Caleb Williams going No. 1 overall to Chicago. Williams has been projected as the top pick for over a year now, and even though the Trojans struggled in 2023, that has not changed much over the past 12+ months. \u201cCaleb to me is a top guy,\u201d said Jeremiah of Williams. \u201cWhen you look at him specifically and his evaluation trying to stack him up with guys from the past, I think just talent...you can put him up there with really any of the guys we\u2019ve had just in terms of arm strength, athleticism, the creativity that he has, the play-making ability.\u201d \u201cI think there\u2019s still some more growth and some cleaning up to do with Caleb\u2019s game, but talent-wise it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d Jeremiah also has three other quarterbacks going in the top ten: North Carolina\u2019s Drake Maye at No. 2 to Washington, LSU\u2019s Jayden Daniels at No. 6 to the New York Giants, and Michigan\u2019s JJ McCarthy at No. 8 to Atlanta. Interestingly, despite giving high praise to both Washington\u2019s Michael Penix Jr. and Oregon\u2019s Bo Nix, Jeremiah did not include either of them in the first round. \u201cPeople can talk about where the ceiling is for these guys or how much growth there is,\u201d said Jeremiah of Penix and Nix. \u201cThese guys are ready to play. They\u2019re going to step in and have a chance to start right away, and it\u2019s not going to be too big for them because of all the experience that they have. That\u2019s kind of one of the trends I would say that\u2019s come up a lot lately.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen so many examples of guys shining at their second stop [in college], and I actually think [Nix] and Penix, both those guys going through adversity in their first stop I think is good for them wherever they land.\u201d Quarterback is not the only offensive position heavily featured in Jeremiah\u2019s mock draft. He currently has 22 offensive players going in the first round, including the first ten picks. Included in that group are the four aforementioned quarterback\u2019s, three wide receivers (Ohio State\u2019s Marvin Harrison Jr., LSU\u2019s Malik Nabers and Washington\u2019s Rome Odunze), and three offensive tackles (Notre Dame\u2019s Joe Alt, Penn State\u2019s Olumuyiwa Fashanu and Oregon State\u2019s Taliese Fuaga). This offense-heavy draft class marks a stark departure from two years ago, when the top five picks were all on the defensive side of the ball. By contrast, Jeremiah has the first defender off the board this year being Alabama edge rusher Dallas Turner to Minnesota at No. 11. Fans will be able to see all of these players, and many others, in action when the combine opens next week in Indianapolis. The entire event will be televised on NFL Network, with Jeremiah, Rich Eisen and others providing commentary. \u201cIt almost feels like Christmas when we do this call every year because this is really happening,\u201d Jeremiah said. \u201cWe\u2019re really getting into the thick of it.\u201d The NFL Combine\u2019s Media Availability opens next Tuesday, Feb. 27. On-field drills will begin Thursday, Feb. 29 at 3:00 p.m. EST/12:00 p.m. PST and run through Sunday, March 3. Stay tuned to the Talk of Troy next week for live updates from Indianapolis by managing editor Sullivan Maley.\n```"}

This week is a little bit different than usual. Due to the NBA All-Star break, only three Trojans suited up once in the past week. Here are the Trojans who played on February 22 and how they performed: Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers): 14 points, eight rebounds and six assists in a seven-point home loss to the Orlando Magic. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls): 22 points and 14 rebounds against the No. 1 seeded Boston Celtics. DeMar DeRozan (Chicago Bulls): 19 points in a double-digit loss at home alongside Vucevic.\n\nBecause of the lack of action in the past seven days, this week\u2019s column will take a different approach to highlighting former Trojans in the NBA. We will be taking a look at the decorated college and professional careers of two former USC Trojans inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame who also have their numbers hung in the rafters at Galen Center.\n\nBill Sharman\nCredited for inventing morning shootaround, Bill Sharman lit up Trojan men\u2019s basketball in an era where the team played at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which was demolished in 2016 to make way for BMO Stadium. Despite spending his four collegiate years between 1946 and 1950, his iconic No. 11 jersey still hangs in the rafters of the recently built Galen Center. The then-Washington Capitols would then select him in the second round of the 1950 NBA Draft. However, due to the organization\u2019s dissolution, \u201cBullseye Bill\u201d was shipped off to the Boston Celtics, where he would spend the rest of his playing career. During his ten years in green and white, the Southern California native would go on to win four NBA titles before calling it quits in 1961. In a team loaded with other superstar players like Bill Russell and Bob Cousy, the former shooting guard would also eventually have his No. 21 retired in Boston Garden. The College Basketball Hall of Fame inductee contributed heavily to the winning Celtics culture of the mid-1900s. The eight-time NBA All-Star averaged 17.8 points per game in his NBA career, the second-best average by a former Trojan behind DeRozan. Sharman proved to be hyper-efficient from the charity stripe, averaging just above 88% from the line, the 16th-highest efficiency in NBA history. Sharman is the only Trojan to be recognized as a member in all of the NBA\u2019s anniversary teams: the 25th anniversary team, the 50th anniversary team and the 75th anniversary team.\n\nPaul Westphal\nAnother former Trojan guard, Paul Westphal, helped the Trojans to their best winning percentage in a single season in USC history. In 1971, \u201cWesty\u201d led the team to a 24-2 record and averaged just under 17 points per game during his career as a Trojan. The 1968 national high school player of the year would eventually enter the NBA Draft in 1972, being selected 10th overall by the Celtics. Westphal spent three years as a Celtic, winning an NBA championship in his sophomore season. The eventual five-time All-Star was eventually dealt to the Phoenix Suns in 1975, where he made his name professionally. He guided the organization to its first ever NBA Finals appearance against his former team, but inevitably came up short. The Redondo Beach native was named to three All-NBA First Teams and one All-NBA Second Team between 1975 and 1980 in Phoenix. After spending stints as a Seattle SuperSonic and a New York Knick, Westphal returned to Phoenix, where he would finish his career in 1984. The Hall of Famer ended his playing career averaging 15.6 points per game on over 50% shooting from the field \u2014 highly efficient for a 6-foot-4 guard. Westphal\u2019s No. 44 and No. 25 jerseys are both retired by the Phoenix Suns and the USC Trojans, respectively.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Just three months after The Beatles\u2019 final song was released, it was announced that a new biopic about the legendary group is in the works. Not only that, but four different biopics on each of the members will be released. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison will all receive their own individual films released by Sony Entertainment and directed by Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes. In addition, the biopics will be able to explore the lives of the musicians like no other film has because Mendes has been granted both full life story and music rights \u2014 a first for a production about the group.\n\n\u201cThat will give them a chance to explore the connection between the songs and the lives of the individuals as well as the groups and its dynamics, and I don\u2019t think you can make a biopic without doing that,\u201d USC School of Cinematic Arts professor Ted Braun said. \u201cI expect we will have a chance to discover things about these already very public figures that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise discover, as a filmmaker it\u2019s a very tantalizing prospect.\u201d\n\nThe expectation for Mendes\u2019 film is high but he intends to make the production one to remember. According to The New York Times, Mendes said the eventual release process will be \u201cinnovative and groundbreaking.\u201d And while it\u2019s not yet known exactly when the films will hit theaters, Mendes said he has big plans for the movies, which will be released \u201cHere, There, and Everywhere\u201d in 2027.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,\u201d Mendes told The New York Times.\n\nWith Beatles fans around the world expected to \u201cCome Together\u201d to see the innovative quartet in a way they never have before, the question remains of whether Thornton students will do the same. The Beatles changed the way music sounds and influenced countless musicians, and this rings true for many USC music students.\n\nAt one point, The Beatles were one of the most popular groups in the world; fans might have even traveled in a \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d to see them, but not every USC student would take that method of transportation. Even students who aren\u2019t superfans, acknowledged the band\u2019s influence in one way or another.\n\nFor some, studying the musicians at USC has provided a whole new perspective on performing and writing songs. \u201cI just did a transcription of Eleanor Rigby, and that was cool to see the way that their string arrangement was laid out, especially how it interacted with the voice,\u201d Meghan Chen, a sophomore studying popular music said. \u201cI think a lot of their production techniques have been very big for the world of production and advancing the techniques used.\u201d\n\nSome people didn\u2019t grow up listening to The Beatles, but many students\u2019 parents and grandparents did. Countless parents would listen to The Beatles during long car rides, at family parties and on many other occasions. For those whose parents turned them on to the Beatles, they said they have been feeling the band\u2019s influence \u201cNow and Then.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew up on The Beatles. My dad was a huge fan, so I think it will be cool for each one to get their own stories, especially since George and Ringo get the back burner sometimes.\u201d Aria Morgan, a sophomore studying classical saxophone and performance, said. \u201cEverything they\u2019ve done is with instruments, and not every band can say that. They revolutionized recording arts as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe fanbase is so vast that even casual fans of The Beatles will still \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d when the stories of their lives unfold on the big screen. They are also thankful for the band, even if the Beatles didn\u2019t directly influence their music, they had an effect on their love for music.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s universal. I remember being a kid, and that was one of the first times I grasped the concept of artists having different albums and stories,\u201d Ethan Larson, a graduate student studying music industry, said. \u201cIt kinda puts all the pieces to the puzzle together in my head. That\u2019s kinda why I fell in love with music.\u201d\n\nThe unique sound and songs they created caught the world by storm so much that other artists just couldn\u2019t \u201cLet it Be.\u201d Doing so The Beatles had a direct influence on some Trojan\u2019s favorite bands.\n\n\u201cI listen to a lot of new wave artists so a lot of people who were from the UK were obviously majorly affected by them,\u201d Matthew Lucas, a graduate student studying music industry, said \u201cThey influenced me like that, never necessarily directly but through the artists that I care about.\u201d\n\nThe lasting effects of The Beatles is felt all throughout USC\u2019s music school, and it\u2019s no doubt they taught musicians here and \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d that when they are making art, \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d\n```"}

There are new fences around Howard Jones Field and McAlister Field, while the stands behind home plate at Dedeaux Field have vanished. As a result, the Trojan baseball and lacrosse teams aren\u2019t playing at their usual on-campus sites this spring.\n\nThat is because USC President Carol Folt announced last June a series of renovations to the university\u2019s athletic facilities as a part of her \u201cmoonshot\u201d visions. The main piece of news that grabbed headlines was plans for a new football performance center, in addition to a full second practice field. Other projects included a remodeled soccer and lacrosse stadium, as well as renovations to Dedeaux Field, which has housed USC baseball for half a century.\n\n\u201cThe three primary objectives of the vision are to position USC Athletics for success with world-class facilities, promote gender equity in support of Title IX and maximize space use through innovative planning,\u201d a statement from the university said.\n\nIt\u2019s barely been a decade since the 2012 opening of John McKay Center, USC\u2019s 110,000-square-foot facility for athletics that cost $70 million. In that center are a locker room for the football team, a weight room and a training room, along with dozens of meeting rooms and offices for everyone and everything associated with USC Athletics.\n\nSo, why does the Trojan football program already need a new facility? Jeff Fucci, USC\u2019s senior associate athletic director of operations and capital initiatives, explained to Annenberg Media why now is the time for these renovations, and how they will last much longer than just the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cOur coaches are completely bought in to where we\u2019re going to go being ultimately worth it,\u201d Fucci said. \u201cWe just have to make sure we deliver on that.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start over at McAlister Field \u2014 the former home of USC lacrosse and soccer \u2014 which will become Rawlinson Stadium once it\u2019s revamped with new amenities. Construction is slated to end in early 2025. This is a long overdue project, considering the field\u2019s subpar turf and practically non-existent fan amenities and capacity.\n\nFucci mentioned this renovation project has been in the works since 2019, and construction is set to begin within a matter of days. It\u2019s also going to be a natural grass pitch, an important factor for the safety of athletes in comparison to the potential dangers of using synthetic turf.\n\nUpdates to Dedeaux Field are also warranted, as Fucci notes the original stadium missed out on its 50th birthday by just a couple of months. The desire for diverse seating options also exacerbated the need for an upgrade. Fucci is calling upon his knowledge from overseeing improvements at the L.A. Coliseum in 2019 in order to improve the fan experience at the new Dedeaux Field.\n\nHowever, it appears that the stadium\u2019s capacity of 2,500 will remain about the same.\n\nOf course, with football, it\u2019s no surprise that USC wants to put its most prestigious \u2014 and important \u2014 athletic program in the best possible position to succeed. Its new three-floor performance center will have everything: player lounges and a locker room, areas dedicated to recruiting and meetings, and several different spaces focused on physical health and development.\n\n\u201cAnytime you can upgrade your facilities and become one of the top echelon of the college football world from a facilities standpoint, that\u2019s always going to be a great thing,\u201d new defensive line coach Eric Henderson said last week after USC hired him away from the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHe also mentioned the upgrades that the Trojans\u2019 coaches will receive with the new building, perhaps alluding to the allure of the facilities in his own decision to jump to the college level this offseason.\n\nNevertheless, the McKay Center is still a fraction of the age of its two counterpart facilities. One could argue USC shouldn\u2019t already need major improvements just 12 years later. But, as Fucci explained, a lot has changed in the last decade \u2014 and even the last couple of years \u2014 in college sports, both at USC and around the country, which makes a new building a necessity.\n\nVarious NCAA rule changes, from the transfer portal to NIL to roster and staff sizes, have crowded the building more than originally anticipated. Of course, the athletic department probably didn\u2019t expect to move to the Big Ten when it first planned the McKay Center, and it\u2019s not a coincidence that this project is kicking off as USC prepares for a massive change awaiting in the fall.\n\nWith that move, Fucci echoed the immediate importance of competing with other national powers when it comes to player amenities.\n\n\u201cThe peer group has changed,\u201d Fucci said. \u201cWe benchmarked ourselves against the Pac-12 and a handful of national competitors. Now, it\u2019s the Big Ten plus national competitors. It\u2019s a step up, so the timing component is good because it creates an urgency.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Fucci mentioned the limitations of USC\u2019s urban, 226-acre campus, which is dwarfed by other top athletic schools in more sprawled, typical college towns. USC can\u2019t compete with land-grant universities in how much space it can dedicate to sports, which is forcing Fucci and his team to be more purposeful and strategic in developing multi-use facilities that maximize the school\u2019s dense University Park Campus.\n\n\u201cHow the west side of campus was laid out \u2014 from an athletics perspective \u2014 wasn\u2019t necessarily the most efficient and responsible use of campus acreage,\u201d Fucci said.\n\nThat\u2019s why he and other USC administrators are focused on redesigning these sports-focused areas of campus in a manner that is more sustainable for the future of the university.\n\nIt\u2019s not simply for the benefit of the football program either, as Fucci asserted that other sports will also reap significant rewards. The departure of the football program, which currently takes up around half the space in the McKay Center, will open up around 55,000 square feet that will then be allotted to USC\u2019s 20 other teams.\n\nThe other programs will have a modified weight room that caters more specifically to their needs, as opposed to accommodating the massive football squad. Fucci added that his department is still working through exactly how the McKay Center will be reorganized, but he emphasized its commitment to student-athlete wellness, development and academic services, including for the football team.\n\nWith many of those athletes about to embark on significantly longer road trips to the Midwest and beyond, it will be particularly important for USC to take care of those athletes\u2019 well-being off the field.\n\nUSC\u2019s golf teams currently use a small practice green out behind the center field wall of Dedeaux Field; they will also get a new training area. Its exact details are still being ironed out, though Fucci reaffirmed his focus on efficient planning in the construction of that facility.\n\nMeanwhile, that new second practice field won\u2019t just be dedicated to the football program. Other teams, such as soccer and lacrosse, will have more flexibility when it comes to field space during offseason training.\n\nUSC\u2019s approach to these renovations is pretty clear. The next couple of years will be pretty hectic, with teams playing off campus and practicing under unconventional constraints. The university also has to be practical in how it goes about the construction itself; with students in nearby dorms, work can only occur at certain times of the day.\n\nThe athletic department is also cognizant of the extensive research occurring elsewhere on campus, which can be affected by inconsiderate construction.\n\nBut Fucci is confident that his efforts will be worthwhile. He believes that it\u2019s the right time to recalibrate the university\u2019s athletic spaces given the changing landscape of college sports.\n\nIt\u2019s an important, enduring change to enhance USC and all of its athletics \u2014 not just football \u2014 according to Fucci.\n\n\u201cEveryone will get a lift from this,\u201d Fucci said. \u201cThe part that everyone has to contend with is there are short-term challenges. ... If we\u2019re going to go through the challenges of the construction, it has to be a really impactful feature, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re committed to doing.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Prutha Satpute)\n\nBy Sangmin Kim February 23, 2024 at 3:14 pm PST\n\nWhen Prutha Satpute returned to her family home in the city of Nashik, Maharashtra with Paul Duran-Lemos, a white American filmmaker who grew up in an American Christian household, her parents were taken aback. Satpute\u2019s parents always knew their daughter would not choose the route of arranged marriage. As a child, she celebrated Hindu festivals and listened with interest as her grandmother told her stories about deities, but her personal faith was weak. She was never as religious as her mother. Moving to the United States for her studies only distanced Satpute further from Hinduism.\n\nWhen she moved to the U.S. in 2019, Satpute hadn\u2019t expected the COVID-19 pandemic to keep her isolated in her apartment. Her parents used their life savings to pay for her education at the University of Southern California, her dream college. Seeking some excitement in her life, Satpute signed up on dating apps like Bumble and Tinder. After speaking with a man named Paul on Bumble for a month and a half, Satpute decided to go on her first date with him.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like we clicked from day one, like the [first] date is still going on,\u201d Satpute said, reminiscing about the beginning of their three-year relationship. \u201cIt never finished \u2014 we got married on our first date, and we\u2019re living together on our first date. We never had any long-distance things separately, or something like that. It was just love at first sight, I suppose.\u201d\n\nIndia is home to a diverse group of religions. With growing polarization threatening the country\u2019s commitment to secularism, Indians both living in and outside of India are wary about marrying someone from another religion. According to a survey by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 97% of both Hindu and Muslim Indian Americans reported being somewhat or very comfortable with close friends from different religions. But only 52% of Hindus report being very comfortable with a close friend who is Muslim. 46% of Muslims said the same about a Hindu friend. Respondents felt similarly when asked about their children marrying outside their religion.\n\nBut the divide between groups is thinning among younger generations of Indians, particularly those who live in the U.S. As undergraduates at USC, Jay and Ayesha Soni met once in 2002 with little fanfare. But a year and a half later, the two met again and decided to go on a date.\n\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019re never gonna get married,\u201d were the first words Ayesha said to Jay during that first outing. Jay Soni was a North Indian Hindu and she was a South Indian Muslim. Two years later, she had changed her mind. Soni gave his parents an ultimatum: three months to accept the fact that he was marrying a Muslim woman. They could get on board or not.\n\n\u201cAnd I was like Dad, come on, this is my choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually thought about how this could work and we think it can. And you\u2019re not marrying her, I am.\u201d\n\nSoni, who is now the president of real estate development company Xebec, has three children ranging from ages six to 15. He was never very religious and, despite his parents\u2019 disappointment, he agreed to raise them as Muslims. But the family also celebrates Hindu and Muslim festivals.\n\nWhile some Indian Americans like Soni are more open to mixed marriages, interfaith couples in India often feel societal pressure and fear physical intimidation from right-wing groups. In 2020, Indian police in the Uttar Pradesh state interrupted a wedding between a Muslim man and a Hindu woman. They arrested the groom under the new anti-conversion law inspired by the threat of \u201clove jihad,\u201d a conspiracy theory that posits Muslim men marry Hindu women to convert them to Islam. The bride\u2019s father filed the complaint against the man.\n\nIn a report about religious tolerance and segregation in India, the Pew Research Center found that Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Jains agreed it is important to stop marriages outside of their religious group.\n\nIshan Singh, a student at USC, comes from the Bhumihar Brahmin caste in Bihar and his family practices Hinduism. Bhumihars are known as the caste group that owns most Indian land. Singh said, while he has plenty of friends from other religious groups, he wants to follow his family\u2019s desire for him to marry a Hindu girl.\n\n\u201cIn India, a house is a house because a woman makes it a house,\u201d Singh said. \u201cOtherwise men are just lazy creatures. So it\u2019s very important for a mother to get a daughter-in-law who keeps the family together, who\u2019s the binding strength, who\u2019s the glue to the family. And she thinks that if she gets someone from her caste, [the daughter-in-law] would at least know better.\u201d\n\nOther Indians living in the U.S. have more lenient attitudes toward interfaith dating and marriage. Dr. Jayesh Shah, the president of the Jain Center of Southern California, came to the U.S. in 1982 and has two children who are both in their thirties. Dr. Shah describes his family as originally being \u201cvery orthodox\u201d regarding Jainism, but they did not pressure their children to adhere to strict religious rules. His daughter chose to marry another Jain man, but the son of his wife\u2019s brother dated several Jains and Hindus before finally marrying a Hindu woman.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to keep harmony in the family and unity in the family was more important than the one aspect of just the religion,\u201d Dr. Shah said.\n\nSatpute and Duran-Lemos were married in 2022 on Halloween. At the end of this year, they will fly to India and marry in a Hindu ceremony with her parents present. Since her marriage, Satpute has attempted to reconnect with her Hindu culture. She brought home an idol of Ganesh, a Hindu deity with an elephant\u2019s head and four arms. Her mother has given her advice on how to pray and perform rituals. Last November, Satpute and her roommate invited friends \u2014 both Indian and non-Indian \u2014 to their apartment for a Diwali celebration.\n\nNow, years after the pandemic and the alienation she felt from her old self and her new identity, Satpute is celebrating Hindu festivals again. This period in her life coincided with the time she met Duran-Lemos \u2014 someone she could share her childhood religious experiences with, and all the movies based on mythology that she used to watch as a kid.\n\n\u201cI made him ask for my hand in marriage to my parents in my mother tongue,\u201d Satpute said. \u201cSo he had to learn how to say things in my mother tongue. And it went really great, and they were very happy, and my dad was like, \u2018how\u2019s he saying all this? Who taught him all that?\u2019 I did. So they are over the moon with having him as their son-in-law.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/23/sports-mythbusters-no-2-the-athletes-strength-is-the-heart-not-the-height/", "response": "```\n\u201cSports Mythbusters\u201d is a column by Sammie Yen about common stereotypes in and around sports culture. Nike co-founder and Division I track-and-field coach Bill Bowerman once said, \u201c If you have a body, you are an athlete .\u201d Soon after, the athletic apparel conglomerate adopted this very phrase into their mission statement to inspire millions globally. However, the public generally boxes athletes into certain body standards; the people believe basketball players must be tall and fast. Gymnasts must be short. Just take a look at some of the dominating forces in these respective fields. Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo towers over most of his teammates at 6-foot-11. Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles is the most decorated American gymnast in history at 4-foot-8. But can other athletes with an atypical physicality attain success? If so, how do they compete against their opponents that fit the sport\u2019s physical stereotype?\n\nTake basketball, for example. First, it\u2019s important to define success. With a sport like basketball, there are numerous variables that contribute to the final score, such as points, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals. Of these individual stats, height does lend an advantage to rebounding and blocking, in particular. Naturally, taller players do not have to jump as high or reach as far to retrieve a missed shot or prevent their opponent from shooting. But how do you measure the value of rebounds against, say, the value of assists, a statistic that is not impacted by height? You could argue rebounds are more important since the possession is definitively in your favor. Offensive rebounds could mean you have a second chance for a basket, while defensive rebounds could mean that your opponents are missing shots. But one could also argue that assists mean points guaranteed. Frequent assists often denote a well-developed, cohesive offense. In looking at the value of one assist versus one rebound, you always want the one assist, since it literally is points. In this respect, \u201csuccess\u201d in basketball is cumulatively dependent on both a plethora of factors and a team that can wholly function with certain responsibilities and varying abilities. It\u2019s not enough to be tall and excel only in rebounding. It\u2019s skill set, mental fortitude and team chemistry, among several other things.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about some players who have proved that size doesn\u2019t matter in the NBA. The shortest player to ever play in the NBA was Muggsy Bogues, who was the 12th draft pick in 1987. Keep in mind that the average player height during his season was 6-foot-7, well over a foot above Bogues\u2019s mere 5-foot-3. He was even below the average male American height of that year, which was 5-foot-8. Bogues spent the golden years of his 14-year long NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets, bringing them up from mediocrity to taking them to the playoffs three times. In his 1993-1994 season, Bogues averaged a double-double and ranked second-highest in assists in the league. Bogues was a giant in spirit, if not size.\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t mention a short man with a colossal impact without shouting out the winner of the  1986 Slam Dunk Contest : the one and only Spud Webb. At just 5-foot-6, he shocked the nation with his astounding vertical. By scoring perfectly in the final rounds, Webb beat his teammate and defending champion, Dominique Wilkins. Similar to Bogues, Webb had a decade-long NBA career, boasting a longevity that exceeds the average NBA career length of four and a half years.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine the success of another atypical type of player: Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic, who recently posted 41 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds to lead  the Mavs to victory over the Phoenix Suns . A guard on the heavier side at 230 pounds, Doncic almost appears to play in slow motion. You can\u2019t help but wonder, dumbfounded, at how he jogs down the court and hoists up an effortless bucket against his lean, speedier opponents or even slow, skyscraper bigs. Doncic isn\u2019t a particularly fast guard compared to Kyrie Irving or Ja Morant, but he knows how to use acceleration and deceleration to his benefit. Coming off a screen, the Mavericks guard will keep his defender behind him to control the pace of the play. If a quicker defender tries to get in front of him early, Doncic will merely slow down even further and step back for an open look. This technique works specifically for Doncic as a bigger guard with a high shooting release. He is acutely aware of knowing when to step on the brakes and when to explode. Doncic turns his lack of traditional guard speed into a multifaceted weapon, which puts him consistently high on the stat charts.\n\nHeight does not automatically qualify you for a spot in professional basketball, let alone a spot in any sport. This misconception overlooks the range of skills and attributes possible to perform well. There is no \u201cright\u201d way an athlete should look because an athlete\u2019s strength is not dependent on inherent and uncontrollable advantages or disadvantages. It\u2019s how they use the traits they have. \u201cSports Mythbusters\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

(AP/Michael Dwyer)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner February 23, 2024 at 1:41 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 After spending time between the American Hockey League and the NHL this season, defenseman Brandt Clarke achieved something that all newcomers dream of last Saturday, scoring his first career goal in the pros. It wasn\u2019t just any old goal, though. Clarke\u2019s\u2014the breakaway overtime winner\u2014sealed the Kings\u2019 crucial road victory over the best team in the league, the Boston Bruins.\n\nClarke played in nine games for Los Angeles last season, tallying two assists in limited action. He started this season with the Kings\u2019 AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign, before receiving the callup in early January to Los Angeles to make his season debut against the Capitals. The No. 8 overall pick in the 2021 draft tallied his first point of the season, a power-play helper, on Jan. 24 against the Sabres.\n\nThen, L.A. wisely sent him back to the AHL on Feb. 1 to allow him to appear in more action, as the NHL held its All-Star break. Clarke was recalled to the Kings on Feb. 8 as he was one of the top rookie defensemen in the AHL this season, playing in 32 games with Ontario. Clarke\u2019s 33 points only trail San Diego\u2019s Olen Zellweger and Laval\u2019s Logan Mailloux for the rookie defenseman lead.\n\nSince being recalled, though, Clarke has shown serious promise. He\u2019s tallied four points in five games since coming back to the big leagues. The Ottawa native\u2019s overtime winner against the Bruins was magical; after serving two minutes for hooking, Clarke exited the penalty box at just the right time. As soon as Kings center Phillip Danault intercepted a pass from Boston\u2019s winger David Pastrnak, Danault sent the puck to a wide-open Clarke, who turned on the jets.\n\nLeft all alone, Clarke dangled the puck to beat Bruins goaltender Linus Ullmark at the right side of the net for the goal with just 27 seconds remaining in overtime.\n\nBRANDT CLARKE. GAME-WINNING GOAL. FIRST NHL GOAL. Can you name a better way to record your first career goal than an overtime winner on a breakaway?\n\nEven as a defenseman, Clarke\u2019s offensive ability shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. He\u2019s always been advertised as an offensive-minded blueliner since being drafted, which will give L.A. a consistent point producer from the blue line, something they haven\u2019t always had this season, for hopefully years to come.\n\nClarke is ambitious; his ability to read the ice and develop plays on the spot allows for him to take chances and be the difference maker. Like many offensively strong blueliners, Clarke could ramp up his defensive solidity a bit to make him more well-rounded at the position. His offensive ambition sometimes makes him impulsive with the puck when under pressure.\n\nNonetheless, at 6-foot-2 and 200 pounds, Clarke\u2019s frame and elite skating ability give him the tools to be a force in all three zones. Earlier in his career, Clarke played two spectacular seasons with the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s Barrie Colts, where he further proved his two-way talent. In 2022-23, Clarke posted a whopping 61 points in 31 games, plus 23 additional points in the playoffs, giving excitement to Kings fans about his brewing potential.\n\nUnlike other top draft picks from the 2021 class such as Owen Power, Matty Beniers and Mason McTavish, Clarke hasn\u2019t had lengthy NHL time yet, but his thorough development at the minor-league level will surely be beneficial in the long term.\n\nClarke has future star potential written all over him, projecting as a team-first player who is not afraid to take initiative. As Los Angeles prepares to make a push for a top-three spot in the Pacific Division, Clarke will hope to continue making game-changing plays like his game-winning goal in Boston. L.A. trails the Edmonton Oilers by just two points and will need to continue playing at its peak if the team wants to forgo the Wild Card drama.\n\nClarke\u2019s Hollywood dream is only just beginning as the determined Kings make their bid for a trip to the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n```"}

LA\u2019s first game out of the All-Star break was a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder, one of the teams the Clippers are competing against in a close-fought race for western conference supremacy. The last time these two teams matched up, it was Paul George who stole the show with 38 points and the Clippers won the game 128-117. The Thunder returned the favor this time around and in the final regular season meeting between these two teams, Oklahoma City claimed both the victory and the season series against the Clippers in a 129-107 home win.\n\nIn a game that featured former Thunder players Russell Westbrook, George and James Harden, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander \u2014 who started his NBA career as a Clipper \u2014 was the best player on the court, pouring in 31 points on 12-19 shooting from the field. On a night where the Clippers\u2019 leading scorer was Kawhi Leonard with 20 points, LA\u2019s stars could not keep up with Oklahoma City offensively in the second half.\n\nIt was a back and forward first half between the two teams, as the Clippers entered the locker room down 61-59. However, Oklahoma City began to separate themselves from the Clippers in the third quarter. Late in that period, the Thunder secured a defensive stand on a Terrence Mann layup attempt and Oklahoma City pushed the ball down the court to convert that stop into a Josh Giddey three-pointer. From there, the Thunder increased their lead to 12 and the Clippers found themselves trailing 91-79.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 deficit remained at 12 entering the fourth quarter and Oklahoma City only saw their lead grow to close out the game, ending with a 33-25 run to seal the victory. The Thunder ended up out-shooting the Clippers from the perimeter, an area where Los Angeles has usually excelled all season. Oklahoma City now leads the league in three-point percentage at 39.5% and against the Clippers, the Thunder shot 48.6% from three against the Clippers, making 17 out of 35 attempts.\n\nBeing second in three point percentage currently, the Clippers did not have a bad three-point shooting night themselves, going 12-32 from distance, good for 37.5%. If the Clippers are going to fulfill their championship-or-bust expectations this season, their stars will have to play much better than they did against the Thunder. Particularly, they are going to need more consistent performances from George and Westbrook. The pair shot a combined 7-25 from the floor and George\u2019s shooting woes have been a theme recently.\n\nIn the month of February, George has shot just 42.1% from the field and is averaging 19 points per game, well below his All-Star expectations. In January, George shot 49.3% from the field and averaged 23.4 points per game. With the loss, the Clippers remain third in the Western Conference standings. Oklahoma City\u2019s young guns ran the Clippers off the floor and next game, the Clippers will stay on the road and take on a scrappy Memphis Grizzlies team with players who can get up and down the floor.\n\nIf the Clippers don\u2019t want to suffer a similar fate to the Milwaukee Bucks, who underestimated this severely depleted Grizzlies squad, they will need to be locked in and ready to go for Friday\u2019s 5 p.m. tip off.\n```"}

(AP/Lindsey Wasson)\n\nBy Nicci Barron February 23, 2024 at 12:20 pm PST\n\nThis week witnessed the beginning of spring training for the 2024 season, and with that comes an influx of trade rumors, injury reports and remaining free agents discourse. As to the latter, who knows where Cody Bellinger and Matt Chapman will end up, as there is seemingly little interest in both players despite their strong resumes. Bellinger\u2019s only suitor is the Chicago Cubs, but he and his agent, the infamous Scott Boras, are still holding out. On Monday, Cubs owner Tom Ricketts said the team is waiting on Boras and the 2023 Comeback Player of the Year to begin negotiations. As for Chapman, there aren\u2019t many teams in the market for a third baseman, and those that are cannot afford what\u2019s on the price tag.\n\nEnough of the free agency talk, let\u2019s return to the real baseball conversations surrounding spring training: predictions for how pre-season will play out. Will Glasnow and Yamamoto prove they were worth the price? Will Juan Soto become a true star for the Yankees? We all know the Dodgers won just about every bid they placed this offseason. From a 10-year, $700 million contract with double threat Shohei Ohtani to a 12-year, $325 million contract with ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Dodgers did not mess around. They also traded with the Tampa Bay Rays for right-hander Tyler Glasnow who will be a great addition to the bullpen. In December, he signed a 5-year, $135 million extension with the Dodgers following his trade to Los Angeles. But wait, there\u2019s more. They also signed All-Star outfielder Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez to a 1-year, $23.5 million deal. He finished the 2023 regular season with a .258 AVG, .305 OBP, 161 hits, and 26 home runs. Not nearly as impressive as Ohtani\u2014who had a .304 AVG, .412 OBP, 151 hits, and 44 home runs in the 2023 regular season\u2014but there\u2019s potential with Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\n\u201cYou can see in my numbers that there\u2019s a big gap between playing on the road and at home,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cIt was more getting confidence at home and trying to do the same things I do when we play on the road.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez may be inconsistent, but the Dodgers seem to think it\u2019s worth the risk. They are not alone; the Baltimore Orioles also took a risk when they bet their future on Jackson Holliday, the No. 1 pick in the 2022 MLB Draft. Holliday, the top prospect and son of seven-time All-Star Matt Holliday, signed a $8.19 million bonus with the Orioles but was not expected to even be in the top five first picks after a disappointing summer showcase. Once drafted, though, he quickly turned things around and earned the MLB Pipeline Prospect Hitter of the Year honors. The 20-year-old is ambitious in his hopes to make the Opening Day roster.\n\nHolliday quickly accelerated through the ranks during his time in the minor leagues. He broke the record for most runs scored in the minors with 113, which he accumulated as he progressed through each of the Orioles\u2019 top four minor-league affiliates during the 2023 season. Holliday kept his top-prospect status and still has more to offer. \u201cI\u2019m just getting stronger,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cThat\u2019s my goal for the offseason, to get stronger and be more physically ready for next year.\u201d\n\nThe Orioles should once again find themselves in the World Series discussion following their successful run last season. The team made their first appearance in the postseason since 2016 when they lost in the Wild Card round to the Toronto Blue Jays. Unfortunately for the Orioles, the result was the same in 2023 as they lost in three games to the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series. Perhaps, this year will be different.\n\nAnother exciting storyline to follow is that of the chemistry (or lack of) between outfielders Aaron Judge and Juan Soto of the New York Yankees. These two are sure to cause headaches to pitchers as two of the top offensive players in the league. Judge finished last season with a .267 AVG and 98 hits, while three-time All-Star Soto had a .275 AVG and 156 hits. But the latter outshined the 2022 AL MVP significantly. Careful here, this could either be what unites the two or causes tension between them\u2014there can only be one AL MVP.\n\nJudge missed several games after suffering a torn ligament in his right big toe. He joked about always getting hurt in right field and that being the reason for him getting switched to the center field position, which conveniently opened up the right slot for Soto. While speaking to the media, Judge commented that he envisions himself hitting third behind \u201ca little speedster,\u201d which is something he\u2019s long-awaited. General Manager Aaron Boone explained Judge filling in the third slot in the lineup has been discussed for a while now.\n\n\u201cEven in the year he hit 62 (home runs), when we were a little bit beat up there in the second half, I was leading him off,\u201d Boone said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so he could get the home run title; it was where we were lineup-wise and injury-wise with what made the most sense. But he always sneaks in a \u2018What about third?\u2019 quite a bit.\u201d He also mentioned that growing up he always saw the \u201cbest player\u201d hitting third and that the third and fourth slots on the lineup were run producers.\n\nIf the Yankees decide to place Judge at third on the lineup, that will leave Soto hitting second. It\u2019s possible the two might juggle around until Boone decides what works best for the team. Will Judge and Soto unite and take the Yankees to the World Series, or will they clash and burn? Soto, who will play alongside Judge and left fielder Alex Verdugo in the green, seems to be the missing puzzle piece to the Yankees\u2019 offense, but only time will tell.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nBy Angelina Hicks February 23, 2024 at 12:01 pm PST\n\nThere\u2019s one measure on the ballot for Los Angeles voters that could completely revamp city streets and create thousands of miles of street improvements. The Healthy Streets LA measure (Measure HLA) is not proposing anything new. It\u2019s not meant to create any new initiatives or use any additional taxpayer money to increase street safety. Instead, it\u2019s meant to hold city officials accountable for promises they\u2019ve already made.\n\nThe L.A. City Council approved a 20-year mobility plan in 2015 which laid out specific guidelines for street and transit improvements to be completed by 2035. The plan includes improvements like protected bike lanes, bus-only lanes, safer crosswalks, new street lighting and wider sidewalks. But in the nine years since, the city has completed only 5% of the mobility plan.\n\nIn response, Angelenos have spent several years working to get this initiative on the ballot to force the city to actually complete the mobility plan. Michael Schneider, the founder and CEO of Streets For All, created the measure with his organization and gathered over 100,000 signatures to get it on the ballot this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a vehicle-enhanced network, there\u2019s a bike-enhanced network, there\u2019s a transit-enhanced network for bus lanes, there are pedestrian-enhanced districts and there\u2019s a neighborhood-enhanced network,\u201d Schneider, a 2003 USC alumnus, said in a phone interview in late January. \u201cWhen you take all of that together \u2014 if it was actually implemented \u2014 our city would be so much safer [and] so much more multimodal. It would just be a different place to live.\u201d\n\nThe measure calls for the construction of various enhancements each time the city repaves at least one-eighth of a mile of a street. It would also require the city to create a tracking webpage that allows residents to view the progress of the Mobility Plan and see where and when improvements are being made.\n\nIt also comes at a time when L.A. is seeing an increasing number of motor-vehicle deaths. On January 24, the Los Angeles Police Department released the end-of-the-year report on crime statistics, which shows a significant increase in traffic fatalities, fatal hit-and-runs and fatal pedestrian and bicyclist collisions in 2023. For the first time in nine years, L.A. saw more deaths from traffic crashes than homicides. There were 336 fatal traffic crashes and 327 homicides in 2023, LAPD officials announced. From 2022 to 2023, felony hit-and-runs in L.A. increased 23% while DUI crashes increased 32%. Additionally, fatal crashes involving pedestrians increased by nearly 13% from 2022 to 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen I was collecting signatures, one of the biggest questions we would get from voters is: \u2018I don\u2019t understand. The city already adopted this plan. Why is this needed?\u2019\u201d Schneider said. \u201cBut they\u2019re just not getting it done. That\u2019s why this is needed.\u201d\n\nLauretta Hill, USC\u2019s new Chief of Public Safety, advised students to get off scooters or skateboards when crossing the street and remove headphones to stay alert and safe when walking near campus. \u201cTake at least one earbud out,\u201d Hill said in an interview last Wednesday. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to take out both of them, I understand. But take at least one out so you can hear because safety is hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling \u2014 it\u2019s all of those things. And if you\u2019re taking one of those away, then you\u2019re less safe.\u201d\n\nThe measure has been endorsed by the Los Angeles Times, the L.A. Unified School District Board of Education and the L.A. County Democratic Party. Additionally, Measure HLA has been endorsed by dozens and neighborhood organizations and nonprofits across the state, including the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike).\n\nKendra Ramsey, CalBike\u2019s executive director, said the most efficient way to address L.A.\u2019s street safety crisis is to improve roads. \u201cOne of the biggest reasons that there has been an increase in people biking and walking being seriously injured and killed by cars is that our transportation infrastructure is not set up in a way that facilitates safe and convenient movement for people outside of cars,\u201d Ramsey said in a phone interview earlier this month. \u201cOne of the best ways to solve that is by improving the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nShe said it\u2019s a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to require the city to complete the mobility plan since it\u2019s already been approved and the funding already exists, meaning the changes would be essentially free. \u201cWhen those repaving projects are happening, it\u2019s really simple,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cThe money is already being spent, and so it should be spent to update the roads in order to better meet the needs of people walking, biking, taking transit as well as driving.\u201d\n\nBeyond this measure, Ramsey said it\u2019s time for California to invest in new and improved methods of transportation to meet the state\u2019s climate change goals. \u201cIn the U.S., we invested heavily in the interstate highway system to facilitate the easy movement of cars throughout our communities and across the country,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cWe need a similar type of investment to make sure that in the next 100 years, we\u2019re set up for people to get places by means other than a private car.\u201d\n```"}

Starting this year the Marshall School of Business is working in collaboration with SCA to run the BCA program, which combines cinematic practice with crucial business skills. (Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Anusha\nFebruary 23, 2024 at 10:54 am PST\n\nMounting frustration over low wages versus high living costs in Los Angeles fueled labor activism at USC. In the past six months, both graduate student workers and adjunct faculty at the School of Cinematic Arts staged strikes and voted to unionize, highlighting the challenges faced by many university employees.\n\nThe adjunct faculty of SCA, a school that boasts popular entertainment industry alumni like Matt Reeves, Shonda Rhimes, America Ferrera and many others, is currently in the process of legitimizing a bargaining committee, in hopes of a contract that will address their concerns around pay and benefits. Strikes in November sparked the unionization drive. Ballots were mailed to the members on January 31 and the votings concluded on February 22.\n\nThe Adjunct Faculty Alliance is voting to join the largest union for higher education in the United States, the United Auto Workers (UAW). UAW was originally organized for auto workers, but has now grown to represent workers in other fields, including over 100,000 academic workers in NYU, The New School and Harvard among others.\n\nJoining the Adjunct Faculty Alliance-UAW through a majority vote would mean a unionized voice at the table, potentially addressing its core concerns: job security, compensation and benefits. Gregg Heschong, an adjunct professor at SCA, says the idea of unionizing floated among the professors for years and finally came to life.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re respected, I know we\u2019re valued,\u201d he said., \u201cBut in an arts program, the compensation and benefits [...] aren\u2019t commensurate with the value given.\u201d Heschong says the dependence on adjunct faculty to make a program successful is significant outside the United States.\n\nCommitments beyond work hours and low pay with no benefits, even parking costs have been issues discussed in these strikes, according to professors who spoke to Hollywood Reporter. A member of the Directors Guild of America, Heschong says, \u201cI\u2019ve been a lifelong supporter of union [organizations].\u201d\n\nBeing backed by a union would mean a representation to the collective demands, he emphasized. \u201cAs a union or a guild, you have a preponderance of voices then all expressing the same wishes and concerns,\u201d Heschong said.\n\nFebruary 17 was the last day to mail ballots to the National Labor Relations Board. The votes will be tallied live on Zoom Friday at 2 p.m. If the Adjunct Faculty Alliance (AFA-UAW) is certified by the National Labor Relations Board, a bargaining unit can be set up to represent the members and USC will be legally obligated to negotiate a contract.\n\nEducation strikes in California have been a common occurrence in the last few years. Last month, California State University reached a tentative deal with the union representing their faculty and academic workers on a wage hike and parental leave ending what was the largest strike by university faculty members in the U.S as per New York Times.\n\nSCA\u2019s unionization vote also closely follows the Graduate Student Workers Organizing Committee\u2019s (GSWOC-USC) strikes which started last October, landing them a victorious deal. Better compensation, appropriate training, travel reimbursement, parental leave and workplace protections were some of the numerous requests addressed in the tentative deal with GSWOC.\n\nThe agreement also includes a 12% raise of the USC Graduate School stipend from $35,700 to $40,000 alongside sick days and bereavement leave. GSWOC announced on December 7, after three days of voting, a majority (81.4%) voted \u2018yes\u2019 to ratify a contract with USC put forward by the bargaining committee.\n\nThe announcement read, \u201cover the past three years, consistent organizing and the efforts of thousands of workers made it possible for GSWs to win a first contract that secures significant wage gains, codifies new protections... and establishes new benefits... among many other big wins.\u201d\n\nThe association is currently working with its first draft of the bylaws for a new Local Union within the United Auto Workers. Between February 29 and March 7, an online vote will also be held to ratify bylaws.\n\nAccording to USC\u2019s financial statements, about 58% of the University\u2019s revenue was spent on salaries and benefits in the year ended June 30, 2023. The top earners among these were paid in millions of dollars, but others, like student workers, a minimum wage.\n\nThe highest paid person at USC is speculated to be the football team\u2019s head coach Lincoln Riley, earning about $11 million a year according to the L.A. Times. Which places him above USC President Carol Folt, whose salary was around $4 million in the most recent publicly available tax form 990 filed in 2022.\n\nThe numbers are not disclosed in the same manner as a public institution so it is difficult to assess salaries beyond the tax forms. Illustration demonstrating USC's financial distribution. (Photo by Anusha S)\n\nAn adjunct salary however, differs markedly from what full-time professors earn at USC. USC\u2019s adjunct faculty are offered between $7,000 to $14,500 per course \u2014 across different schools including Annenberg, Herman Ostrow, Marshall among others \u2014 as mentioned in the job listings on the university\u2019s website.\n\nThis rounds up to about $48.33 an hour for the same amount of time. Over three semesters, this number would add up to yearly salaries between $21,000 and $43,500. An average adjunct professor in L.A. makes about $76,717 a year according to Indeed. Glassdoor places the number between $81,000 to $135,000 a year.\n\nThis estimates the average adjunct salary between $6,000 to $11,000 a month. In comparison with other universities, USC fares better. A bar graph illustrating the adjunct faculty pay scale across different universities. (Photo by Anusha S)\n\nFor most adjunct faculty, a work week is considered 20 hours or less. According to information provided to Annenberg Media by a former adjunct at UCLA who did not wish to be identified, in 2021 the monthly salary was about $9,770.56, making the hourly rate of about $122.13.\n\nTeaching one Computer Science course in the regular session (not including summer or extension) between April 1 and June 30, 2021, the total compensation for the job was $11,138.43.\n\nFrancois Bar, Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs at USC, says adjunct positions are intended to be filled by industry professionals who take up teaching roles to connect with the university and students. Apart from some extra hours (for training/service) which is required, benefits like healthcare, dental insurance, retirement savings and others are expected to be covered by their full-time jobs.\n\n\u201cOne way to think about it is adjunct salaried people [...] have a real job somewhere else,\u201d Bar explained, \u201cand they\u2019re doing [this] on the side so they don\u2019t really need benefits [here].\u201d\n\nTypically adjunct faculty teach one course per year which is less than half-time, leaving them in a sticky position \u2014 only USC employees working more than half-time qualify for benefits. This puts those whose primary source of income is teaching under pressure trying to keep up with the high living costs without being backed by an institution.\n\nThe roles are also hired for on a single-term basis with no guaranteed pathway into full-time roles. The adjunct faculty, that were about 70% of all teaching members at SCA in Fall 2023, hope to have their pay and benefit concerns addressed through this voting.\n\nAdjunct faculty across other universities in the country like New York University and The New School have also previously demonstrated the power of unionization in negotiating to have their voices heard.\n```"}

But another lesser-known LSU wideout is also on many teams\u2019 first round boards.\n\nBy Felipe Londo\u00f1o February 22, 2024 at 6:24 pm PST\n\nTape Talk is a column by Felipe Londo\u00f1o, Talk of Troy\u2019s Head NFL Draft Scout, providing analysis and film review on a new draft prospect each week. The NFL season is now over, but the football calendar is never empty. As the sun sets on regular and postseason play, it rises on the NFL draft, with it finally being time to talk about the collegiate superstars who could be lighting it up on Sundays this fall.\n\nWe\u2019ve already heard much about the bigger names, such as receivers like Ohio State phenom Marvin Harrison Jr., Washington weapon and CFP finalist Rome Odunze, and LSU speedster Malik Nabers, yet there\u2019s another name among that group who was gone under the radar: Brian Thomas Jr, another LSU Tiger who, with his rare blend of size and athleticism could have a fast rise on draft boards before and earn an early first-round selection come the big event.\n\nTape Talk is back! We\u2019ll be going over top prospects in the NFL draft over the coming months, and in this week\u2019s edition, we\u2019re talking Brian Thomas Jr. I must admit, I first stumbled upon Thomas studying LSU tape for Malik Nabers, a phenomenal prospect in his own right who will likely also go early in this year\u2019s draft.\n\nI sat down and turned on the Florida State versus LSU opener, yet as I watched Nabers play after play, I noticed my attention repeatedly drifting to Thomas, who, at six-foot-four and 205 pounds, looked like an NFL X receiver who decided to return to school and play college ball. Then one play I focused solely on him: a garbage time play in the fourth quarter where running a vertical, he found a soft spot in zone coverage down the left sideline and, in the middle of two defenders closing in on him, sunk his weight like an All-Pro running back and wove through them with a tremendous elusiveness, then exploding out of his break and turning on the jets for a house call.\n\nThat was the end of my Nabers evaluation, and I turned my focus over to Brian Thomas Jr. Brian Thomas Jr. finding a soft spot down the field on a vertical, with tremendous flexibility and body control to sink his weight and weave through two incoming defenders, then showing the rare acceleration and foot speed to finish.\n\nThe blend of athleticism and size that you just saw on that play makes sense when you delve into Thomas\u2019 background; a two-sport standout at Walker High School in Louisiana, he excelled both as a wide receiver and power forward and turned down Division One basketball opportunities to play football at LSU.\n\nThomas was as productive on the gridiron as he was on the hardcourt throughout high school, finishing with over 1250 yards and 17 touchdowns in his last full football season in 2019, and it was that blend of production and athleticism that got the LSU coaches so intrigued they featured him regularly during his first season in Baton Rouge.\n\nHe started nine games as a freshman in 2021, finishing with a respectable 359 yards and two touchdowns on 28 receptions. Thomas failed to build on his impressive freshman campaign in 2022, posting similar numbers to the year before, yet burst onto the season this past fall in LSU\u2019s box score offense, finishing with 1177 yards and a whopping 17 touchdowns on 68 receptions.\n\nAs we saw in the first clip, the first thing that catches your eye when you study Thomas is his field-stretching ability due to his rare athleticism for his size. With very good burst, foot quickness, and long speed, he\u2019s a threat to stack corners both in press and off on any given play.\n\nWatch this compilation of just his deep touchdowns, for example, where he shows foot quickness and lateral agility in his releases and tremendous long speed to dominate corners on vertical routes. Brian Thomas Jr. repeatedly dominating SEC corners deep, both in off and press, with very good foot quickness, long speed, and ball tracking ability.\n\nHe shows good ball skills, too, able to repeatedly adjust to the football on inaccurate balls and win with tremendous body control and play strength to moss corners on contested catches downfield. Watch him on this crucial fourth-quarter play versus Texas A&M, where he shows the speed to stack a corner from an off-alignment, and then displays the body control and ball tracking to contort himself for the catch, finishing with the dexterity to extend and come down with the touchdown to give the Tigers the lead.\n\nIn addition to stretching the field, Thomas is also a tremendous YAC threat at the underneath level, showing good elusiveness and body control in the open field for his size to evade defenders. Let\u2019s again return to the fourth quarter of the Texas A&M game. Watch him sink his weight and elude an incoming linebacker with very good body control and lateral agility, and then display the urgency and burst to turn upfield and get vertical for the extra seven yards.\n\nThomas isn\u2019t just all athleticism, though; he also shows very good football IQ and awareness when running routes against zone coverage. Watch him on this second-quarter play in the ReliaQuest bowl against Wisconsin, for example. The Badgers show a cover two-man look early pre-snap before rotating a safety down to the box, indicating cover-one. Yet post-snap, they change the coverage again, with the nickel defender to the strong side bailing to cover his deep half and the safety now dropping deep to cover his vacated zone, revealing an inverted cover-two coverage.\n\nThomas easily processes these three shifts and, noticing the safety darting downfield to cover the nickel\u2019s zone, adjusts his route toward the middle of the field to take advantage of the empty space and get open for an 18-yard gain.\n\nHe also shows the instincts and awareness to help out his QB on broken plays, as seen in Week 8\u2032s matchup against Army. Thomas runs a hitch against off-man coverage and quickly notices Jayden Daniels scrambling, so he adjusts the stem of his route upfield to get open. He then shows tremendous ball tracking and length to haul the ball in and then the rare burst and long speed to finish for the touchdown.\n\nTo me, the play truly epitomizes everything that makes Brian Thomas Jr. special: rare athleticism, ball skills, and football instincts.\n\nThomas isn\u2019t a perfect prospect, however, and there\u2019s a reason why, as of right now, he\u2019s the consensus fourth-best receiver in the class: his route running needs polishing, he struggles to beat physical, No.1 corners, and teams have to be comfortable with the fact that he was never the No.1 option in Baton Rouge, had only one stellar season, and his production this season was boosted by Heisman quarterback Jayden Daniels and Biletnikoff finalist Malik Nabers\u2019 play.\n\nLet me just say off the bat that I don\u2019t think Thomas is a bad route runner. In fact, I think he\u2019s a solid one, and projects to improve at the next level due to his football IQ and tremendous lower body flexibility and balance, which allows him to get low and cut well on routes and then maintain acceleration throughout his cuts.\n\nHowever, he ran a very limited route tree in college, being limited to leveraging the underneath and deep areas of the field, and showed below-average creativity through his stems, rarely using position or jerk steps or stemming into leverage, which will be an issue at the next level where he won\u2019t be able to beat corners primarily with his athleticism play in and play out.\n\nFurthermore, he projects to struggle against physical, athletic corners that can trail him at the hip at the next level due to his somewhat average upper body strength. Watch him on these two plays during his Week 10 matchup against Alabama, which had a strong case for having the best DB room in college football this last season.\n\nWhen pressed by long, physical corners with the athleticism to trail him, such as prospective first-rounder Kool-Aid McKinstrey and senior Trey Amos, Thomas struggled to separate, failing to shake them off with physicality.\n\nUltimately, this combination of adequate creativity in his routes and play strength when manned up by physical DBs is concerning, particularly if he\u2019s drafted by a team expecting him to be the number one option. And that leads us to our final concern, which is that, at LSU, Thomas was never relied upon to be the number one option.\n\nHe caught passes from a Heisman winner, and was second to a receiver so good it changed the way defenses played LSU, both of which no doubt helped his production. For one, defenses were so locked in on stopping Nabers they often pressed and doubled him on one side with their best defensive backs, leaving Thomas on the other with a favorable matchup.\n\nTeams also often played soft zone with two high coverage shells above it against LSU to account for Daniels\u2019 vertical throwing prowess, giving Thomas a ton of room to work on underneath. This was primarily where he was asked to win in the LSU system, alongside his field-stretching duties.\n\nThis first-quarter play in the season opener against FSU is a prime example of how Thomas benefitted both from the gravity of both Nabers\u2019 speed and Daniels\u2019 deep throw. Watch how deep of a defense FSU runs, and how many defenders Nabers takes with him as he runs his vertical, allowing Thomas to run a shallow crosser virtually untouched.\n\nMuch of Thomas\u2019 production was like this, where he\u2019d take advantage of favorable matchups and soft coverages generated by Nabers and the threat of Daniels\u2019 deep ball. This is why he likely won\u2019t be one of the first receivers taken, and could even drop toward the end of the first round.\n\nAs intriguing as his skillset is, he won\u2019t be a No. 1 right away, as he needs to get stronger and polish his route running. He\u2019ll more likely start his career as a high-end two, similar to DeVonta Smith or Tee Higgins.\n\nWhen it comes to predicting where he will land come April, this is why I like him going to a team with an already established WR1 whom he can learn behind and then take over for in a few seasons if needed. With his size, speed, and ball skills, Thomas has all the traits to be a dominant first option down the line, but would be best served learning under a player who\u2019s already there as he polishes his route running and gets stronger.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals at 18th overall are a great fit if the team parts ways with Tee Higgins; the franchise has a proven track record of developing wide receivers, and Thomas would be able to fit Higgins\u2019 role perfectly while learning under Pro-Bowler and fellow LSU Tiger Ja\u2019Marr Chase. Dallas at 24, Tampa Bay at 27, and Buffalo at 28 also make a ton of sense for the same reasons, particularly with the futures of receivers like Mike Evans and Stefon Diggs up in the air.\n\nOverall, Thomas is an incredibly intriguing prospect who will likely go early if a team falls in love with his special athletic ability and upside. If he falls into a situation with stability and great coaching, don\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s the best receiver from this draft class four to five years from now.\n```"}

While some people started having issues much earlier, the highest number of people impacted was around 5 a.m. According to Downdetector, an online platform that provides real-time information about various online services, customers across carriers reported having issues, though AT&T customers seemed to be the most impacted. According to the platform, at the peak, T-Mobile had around 2,000 reports, Verizon had around 4,000 reports and Cricket Wireless (owned by AT&T) had around 13,000 reports, but AT&T had more than 73,000 reports.\n\nJes\u00fas E. Montoya, an educational leadership doctoral student at USC, said he was studying when his data and internet, both serviced by AT&T, stopped working at exactly one in the morning, forcing him to call it a night. \u201cI was hoping to go a little further, maybe until 1:30 [a.m.], so it allowed me to end my studies early,\u201d he said. \u201cI was very confused why there was no internet service both on my phone and my home internet.\u201d\n\nHours later, at 8:15 a.m., AT&T posted an update to its website, stating that the company was aware of the issues, but that \u201cthree-quarters of [the] network had been restored.\u201d Montoya said by the time he woke up in the morning, his service was restored, but he had no idea when it came back.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said that it was aware of the outages in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cWe are aware of the reported wireless outages, and our Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is actively investigating,\u201d the post said. \u201cWe are in touch with AT&T and public safety authorities, including FirstNet, as well as other providers.\u201d\n\nShy\u2019Ann Jones, a sophomore health promotion and disease prevention studies major with AT&T cell phone service, said she saw the \u201cSOS\u201d symbol on her iPhone last night when she was FaceTiming a sibling. \u201cI was confused,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no idea. I didn\u2019t hear anything about it [the outage.]\u201d Jones said she didn\u2019t feel like she was majorly impacted by it since her WiFi was still working and she was able to continue the video call.\n\nAt 12:10 p.m., AT&T reported that it had restored wireless to all impacted customers. \u201cWe sincerely apologize to them,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cKeeping our customers connected remains our top priority, and we are taking steps to ensure our customers do not experience this again in the future.\u201d\n\nOn its website, Cricket Wireless shared AT&T\u2019s statements. In contrast, Verizon and T-Mobile said that their networks were \u201cfully operational\u201d and \u201coperating normally,\u201d respectively. In the statements, the companies both suggested that issues reported on Downdetector were issues for people trying to \u201cconnect to users on other networks\u201d or \u201cthose served by another carrier.\u201d\n\nQuestions still remain as to whether this will significantly impact AT&T in the future, though Jones said she was \u201cnot really\u201d considering switching providers.\n\nAt 4:46 p.m., AT&T said the outage was most likely not due to an external attack on their services. \u201cBased on our initial review, we believe that today\u2019s outage was caused by the application and execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network, not a cyber attack,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are continuing our assessment of today\u2019s outage to ensure we keep delivering the service that our customers deserve.\u201d\n\nThe answer was one Montoya, the doctoral student, said he wanted to know more about. \u201cThis morning when I was reading reports, not even AT&T knows what happened,\u201d he said before the statement was released. \u201cThat\u2019s very concerning... [I] want to know exactly what happened.\u201d```"}

Should there be more options?\n\nMedical vending machines around USC contain Narcan for student-purchase. (Photo by Nolan Ezzet)\n\nBy Dash Chaiyasen, Tolu Okegbenro and Jake Petroff\nFebruary 22, 2024 at 6:04 pm PST\n\nEarlier this week, Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) submitted a request to the California Department of Public Health for the expansion of Food and Drug Administration-approved opioid overdose reversal agents. The request came about a year after the agency gave over-the-counter approval for the first and only time to an overdose-reversal drug: naloxone [Narcan] nasal spray.\n\n\"With different devices, some of them are easier to use. Some come with instructions, some of them are auto injectors. They\u2019re a little bit more expensive, but it makes it easier for labor,\" Jeremy Sharp, SSDP chapter development director, said. \"Having those options available for people, it just means that these institutions and students... can have greater access.\"\n\nSSDP, a grassroots nonprofit organization, is the largest youth-led network in the country with 12 active chapters in California devoted to ending what it calls the \u201cdisastrous war on drugs.\u201d Students across the country are often the frontline of campaigns to allow access to these medications via vending machines, health centers and student trainings at their universities.\n\n\"Through policy, we\u2019re trying to make systemic change,\" Sharp said. \"And you\u2019ll notice things like drug use affects everything: housing, employment, incarceration, food stamps.\"\n\nUSC has also made efforts to increase access to these life-saving medications. Ben Feldman, the current president of Sigma Chi Fraternity, Alpha Upsilon Chapter does biannual Narcan training with his chapter members. The fraternity collaborates with Team Awareness Combating Overdose (TACO), an organization with more than 200 chapters.\n\n\"Our chapter operates under the same model that TACO does,\" Feldman said. \"When you\u2019re dealing with potentially addictive drugs, the idea that ignorance is bliss is completely wrong. Knowledge is actually bliss. Having the training that we use comforts me a lot, because we know that every member has the training and the knowledge to be able to administer Narcan.\"\n\nIn the event of an overdose, Narcan can mitigate the impacts of an overdose, potentially saving someone\u2019s life. Terry Church, assistant professor of Regulatory and Quality Sciences at USC, said that people who use opioids may experience a reduced ability to breathe in oxygen, causing their bodies to go into what he described as a \u201cbrief hibernation.\u201d\n\n\"This drug [Narcan] actually reverses that effect,\" he said. \"And it can help individuals who are overdosing to be able to breathe until help arrives.\"\n\nChurch said that individuals administering Narcan should make sure the person experiencing an overdose is laying down with nothing in their mouth to ensure cleared airways. As for potential risks or side effects of using Narcan, Church said they are limited.\n\n\"The biggest one that you may have is a headache afterwards,\" he said. \"Think of the worst allergies you\u2019ve ever had and your nose just constantly runs.\"\n\nThere are two vending machines on USC\u2019s campus that have Narcan available: one is in the Village, and the other is in the Royal Parking Structure. SSDP\u2019s push for different opioid reversal medications to be made available to teachers and students is based on the increasing rate of drug overdoses in 10-19 year olds. In their letter to CDPH, the organization said \u201ca one-size-fits-all approach may not be sufficient\u201d to address the opioid crisis\u2019 impact on students.\n```"}

But in 2023, where jobs for diversity and inclusion hit an all-time high, many of those companies are backing off their vow of change.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) jobs have shrunk 8 percent so far in 2024 with some of the most recent cuts coming from Zoom. The video conference giant laid off its internal DEI team, however they were not the only ones to do so. Google, Meta and X were some of the few companies who made massive cuts to its DEI\u2019s budgets. According to an article written by CNBC, some companies cut DEI budgets by as much as 90% in 2023.\n\nSo what is the purpose of these mass layoffs? Many signs point to large changes within the tech industry, as well as the emergence of AI. When Elon Musk took over Twitter, some of his first actions were to lay off a large portion of the staff. The DEI team was one of the largest position groups hit percentage wise, as the staff was reduced from 30 to 2 members.\n\nThis trend of dissolving DEI programs is also due to the occasional economic downturn in tech that forces companies to make layoffs. Many however are more concerned that without proper representation, Artificial intelligence will not properly represent all people.\n\nIn an interview with NBC, Brenda Wilkerson, CEO of AnitaB.org, an organization aimed at uplifting and empowering women and non-binary individuals through tech. \u201cWe\u2019re in a big technology inflection point, and what happens is as AI begins to take off and if organizations are less inclusive, the product is not reflective of the users.\u201d\n\nWhile the future of AI is unclear, it is even gloomier for DEI.

The United States made a long-awaited return to the moon today in a historic first.\n\nBy Nathan Silva, Lily Coleman and Roman Marchetti\nFebruary 22, 2024 at 5:56 pm PST\n\nThe first touchdown of a US-made spacecraft on the moon in over fifty years landed today. The last American vessel to land on the moon was Apollo 17. However, this is the first ever soft landing on the moon by a private company. The Intuitive Machines lander is being launched aboard a SpaceX rocket. According to Intuitive Machines CEO Stephen Altemus, the spacecraft was estimated to have an 80% chance of safely landing on the moon.\n\nThe Odysseus lander is nicknamed \u201cOdie\u201d or IM-1 and is equipped with six NASA science instruments which are designed to test new technology and analyze the lunar environment. The spacecraft will not be able to offer live footage of the landing, but Intuitive Machines will share computer generated graphics based on data directly from the robotic explorer.\n\nIn the past six months, India and Japan have reached the moon with robotic vehicles.

Since USC is still test-optional, we asked students whether or not they decided to submit their scores. Among the USC students that were interviewed, there was roughly an even split of people who decided to include their SAT and ACT scores versus those who did not.\n\nStudents who chose not to submit their tests did so because they believed their scores were not an accurate reflection of their academic achievements. Arianna Lopez, a freshman American Studies major, said that she ultimately decided not to submit her scores when applying to USC.\n\n\"I just didn\u2019t really love my test scores. They weren\u2019t bad, but I didn\u2019t think that I should have submitted them. I thought my grades spoke for themselves.\"\n\nYale News wrote in their announcement that even when they were test optional, choosing not to submit scores would be disadvantageous to the applicant. On the other hand, USC has written in their test optional FAQ that not submitting scores would not affect their chances of admission.\n\nWhether test optional or not, Yale wants to see the standardized test scores of all of their applicants, claiming that it is a reflection of a student\u2019s academic preparedness for the university. Mia Moore, a sophomore studying human biology, would disagree with this statement.\n\n\"I just feel that it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not a good well rounded, you know, test to let someone know, if they\u2019re going to be successful for college. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s like people who score like 1500 1600 and are probably struggling right now. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good representation of how well you will do in school. And I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think it should be used as a definite say, of your success in a way in college.\"\n\nOne concern brought about by universities across the nation is the access to tutoring for these tests that people may or may not have. Lucy Westlake, a sophomore studying public policy, speaks about the financial disparities amongst test scores.\n\n\"I definitely was more confident and sought improved score after tutoring and obviously, people that that have more money are able to tutor to like get tutoring and people that don\u2019t might not have that luxury.\"\n\nAddressing this point, Yale states that they factor in all components of a student when considering their application. This is why submitting your score may be beneficial, even if it is below the average.\n\nYale\u2019s decision to bring back mandatory testing may cause other universities to follow suite. For now, USC is remaining test optional, and it seems that students would like to keep it that way.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Katie Havens.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/22/rookie-report-brandin-podziemski/", "response": "```\nRookie Report is a weekly column by Jack Hallinan focusing on NBA rookies making a name for themselves in the league. Like the NBA took a break from competitive action over the past week, I too took last week off from column writing, but we\u2019re back with a vengeance. The one thing the NBA seemed to prove over the All-Star break was that the showcase game itself has no real purpose or competitive drive. Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s exasperated  \u201cwell... congratulations\u201d  to the winning Eastern Conference proves it. Who knows if this year\u2019s PR disaster will lead to any real change in the weekend\u2019s format, but if Silver\u2019s office does decide to make any changes, one aspect should remain firmly in place: the Rising Stars challenge, the four-team mini-tournament between three squads of young NBA-ers and one G League crew.\n\nIn addition to fun moments like a  Jaime Jaquez Jr.-Victor Wembanyama pick and roll , we also saw some actual emotional investment. Bennedict Mathurin told Jaden Ivey, \u201ceven in the Rising Stars game, you can\u2019t guard me\u201d multiple times\u2014and it didn\u2019t seem like Ivey found it funny. Keep in mind, the Detroit Pistons selected Ivey fifth in the 2022 draft, just one spot ahead of Mathurin, who also plays guard. The Pacers player probably sees Ivey as a direct rival and used the Rising Stars games to establish his dominance, bringing home the tournament\u2019s MVP award after scoring 22 of Team Jalen\u2019s 66 points across the semifinal and final. NBA fans probably wish they could see that level of pettiness in the actual All-Star game.\n\nFor today\u2019s focus, though, we\u2019re taking a look at another player who featured in the Rising Stars showcase: Brandin Podziemski of the Golden State Warriors. While Podziemski only knocked down one three-pointer for Team Pau over the weekend, the former Santa Clara Bronco has become a key rotational piece for the Warriors in the middle of a critical stretch for the team. As James Wiseman and Moses Moody proved, just because you\u2019re a lottery pick does not mean Warriors head coach Steve Kerr will guarantee you minutes. Wiseman played just 12.5 minutes per game in the 2022-23 season before the organization traded him to Detroit and despite being the 14th overall pick in the 2021 draft, Moody has yet to eclipse an average minutes played of 18 per night.\n\nSo the fact that Podziemski already plays 26.4 minutes per game in a Warriors uniform is no small feat. It proves that he has the basketball IQ and qualities Kerr requires from a top-tier role player. Podziemski has even started a couple recent games, suggesting he may move into that role permanently if the team decides to move on from Klay Thompson or Andrew Wiggins in the summer. He\u2019s only averaging 9.9 points per game thus far in 2022-23, but Podziemski spaces the floor with his 38.5% accuracy from beyond the arc on 3.3 attempts per game. He also shares the rock exceptionally well, averaging 3.9 assists per game and even posting an absurd 14-assist game off the bench against the Grizzlies on Feb. 2.\n\nPodziemski\u2019s willingness to move the ball and create for teammates is probably what endeared him to Kerr so quickly, especially in sequences like this: In this clip from the aforementioned Grizzlies game, Podziemski cuts to the top of the arc to receive the ball in space and drives quickly to the hoop, galloping past the Grizzlies\u2019 Jacob Gilyard. He quickly realizes, though, that Jaren Jackson Jr.\u2014one of the league\u2019s elite shot blockers\u2014is sitting in the lane ahead of him. So as Podziemski leaps up to finish, he contorts his body smoothly to kick the ball out to a wide-open Jonathan Kuminga, who sinks the three. Kerr surely gave \u201cPodz\u201d a gold star for that one.\n\nHe\u2019s showered Podziemski with lavish praise, especially in this  recent profile  of the rookie by The Athletic. \u201cWhat this team has lacked, what it lacked last year, he gave us,\u201d Kerr told The Athletic\u2019s Anthony Slater. \u201cThe connection. The connector. The ball-mover. The cutter. There\u2019s a feel and a recognition of what\u2019s happening on the floor that makes him playable in any lineup. He enhances every lineup.\u201d Sheesh. We\u2019re talking about one of the NBA\u2019s two or three best coaches here, who just described his breakout rookie as basically the solution to every problem. But it doesn\u2019t seem like Kerr was hyperbolic in his praise; Podziemski really will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nIn a Dec. 17 game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Podziemski sealed the game by taking a charge from Shaedon Sharpe that gave the Warriors the ball with less than a second remaining: Podz saves the day with a heads-up play !!\ufe0f  The gutsy play finished off a well-rounded 10-point, 5-assist, 5-rebound performance. The latter of which\u2014also according to The Athletic\u2019s piece\u2014helped give him a much higher valuation in the Warriors analytics model while he played at Santa Clara, where his 8.8 rebounds per game led the Western Athletic Conference. That trait has popped in the NBA, too, where Podziemski has averaged 5.8 rebounds per game at 6-foot-4, 205 pounds.\n\nSo, how soon will we see Podziemski contribute to playoff basketball? Hopefully this season, but it\u2019s hard to know with the Warriors. The franchise occupies a strange place in the NBA landscape. They\u2019ve become one of the league\u2019s premier teams on the back of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green\u2019s success. Steve Kerr is an offensive mastermind of a coach. The ownership has an extremely high willingness to spend. And yet, they find themselves in 10th in the Western Conference as of Feb. 21, with 29 games left to play in the regular season. They could surge up to 5th or 6th or settle for a play-in place. But either way, the Warriors are not currently serious title contenders.\n\nDespite Curry\u2019s greatness, Thompson looks... shall we say, aged, while Green can\u2019t stay out of his own way when it comes to  suspension-worthy incidents . Even if these stars are shadows of their former selves, the Warriors have the ability to reload quickly due to Podziemski\u2019s immediate fit and potential to become a high-level starter alongside the Warriors\u2019 other studly youngster, Jonathan Kuminga, who\u2019s still just 21 and in his third NBA season. Whatever happens this season and beyond, Podziemski should give Warriors fans hope the team\u2019s future is bright.\n```"}

Current alternative options do exist \u2013 with the \u201cDodger Stadium Express,\u201d a bus ride for ticketed fans from Union Station, the most popular. However, ex-Dodgers owner Frank McCourt introduced a novel idea in 2018. One that has since blossomed into a fully developed project on the verge of being implemented.\n\nMcCourt\u2019s company has proposed a suspended aerial gondola system, which he says he would privately fund, that would connect Dodger Stadium to Union Station and Chinatown at Los Angeles State Historic Park. According to initial plans, the gondola would transport up to 5,000 people per hour in each direction on game days and take approximately seven minutes each way. Under the current plan, Metro Los Angeles would be in charge of the logistics.\n\nOn Thursday the Metro LA board voted to approve the environmental plans for the \u201cLos Angeles Aerial Rapid Transit Project,\u201d the official name for the proposed Dodger Stadium gondola, after receiving a report from the Planning and Programming Committee which did not recommend the project.\n\nThe project has caused much debate among the L.A, Chinatown and Dodger communities regarding its long-term viability. Critics question the potential source of funding (the project is estimated by some to cost upwards of $500 million), whether or not the gondola would actually decrease traffic congestion, environmental concerns and gentrification of low-income communities.\n\nConsidering the history of Dodger Stadium\u2019s development \u2014 thousands of Mexican Americans were displaced from their homes in the 50s to allow for the construction \u2014 many community members, including Lisa Hart, executive director of the Neighborhood Council Sustainability Alliance, are skeptical.\n\n\u201cFind out if it makes sense to proceed at all,\u201d Hart said at the meeting. \u201cTake a real look at the alternatives. A fair inclusive process is a good place to start. \u201cOtherwise, you are at risk of perpetuating another Bishop, La Loma and Palo Verde,\u201d she continued, referencing the communities impacted by the stadium\u2019s original construction.\n\nOther speakers focused on a report published by the UCLA Mobility Lab that found that the project would remove about 608 cars on sold-out game days: a \u201cvery limited\u201d impact.\n\n\u201cI feel for local residents who have been misled about the benefits of this project,\u201d UCLA professor Jon Christensen said at the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not a solution for traffic. The environmental review process has been inaccurate.\u201d\n\nAndy Wong, an LA resident and avid Dodger fan, voiced concerns with the approach that the gondola project was taking to reduce congestion.\n\n\u201cI would love wider sidewalks, increased pedestrian infrastructure,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the gondola is a solution. Many people, through a lot of dedication, made L.A. Historic Park what it is today. Residents of the local communities would be negatively impacted.\u201d\n\nHowever, not all speakers were opposed. Manuel Luna, who has lived in the William Mead public housing development in Chinatown for more than two decades, said he didn\u2019t understand why there was opposition to the project.\n\n\u201cI know the gondola will be passing through [my home], and I support it,\u201d Luna said.\n\nWhile the environmental approval was considered a big win for the project, it still needs a final sign-off from the Metro LA board, and further approval from the Los Angeles City Council, the California Department of Transportation and the California State Parks Department before work can begin.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of LAPD)\n\nBy Makenzi Johnson and Heli Ruiz\nFebruary 22, 2024 at 4:24 pm PST\n\nThe LAPD released images of four suspects behind an attack on Turkish Consulate members in hopes that the public may be able to help identify them. The attack occurred at an Armenian-led protest that took place on campus in September following an event hosted by USC at Annenberg Hall. The alleged attackers were shown in a video posted to X throwing water and shoving three Turkish Consulate members as they tried to leave campus before punching and kicking one victim near Grace Ford Salvatori Hall. According to the LAPD, the suspects fled the scene and were not apprehended by police.\n\nProtestors arrived the morning of September 29 in response to a conference at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism building featuring Turkish Ambassador Hasan Murat Mercan. \u201cI think it\u2019s more than expected that the LAPD is held responsible for finding the people who did this,\u201d Melis Olcay, a member of the Turkish Trojan Association, said. \u201cEspecially since the people who were actually responsible for the protest becoming violent and out of control weren\u2019t actual USC students, they were adult people who heard about this event and took advantage of it.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish Graduate Student Association at USC made a statement on Instagram following the alleged assault by protestors saying the \u201cincident has deeply affected our sense of security and belonging\u201d on campus. On September 19, after a nine-month blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh, a contested region within Azerbaijan with an ethnic Armenian majority, Azerbaijani forces launched a 24-hour military operation in the region. The attack led to the displacement of more than 90% of the region\u2019s Armenian population. Turkey, which borders Armenia, has pledged full support for Azerbaijan and its offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nUSC had already invited Mercan for its \u201cRole of Public Diplomacy in Turkish Foreign Policy\u201d conference before Azerbaijan launched its attack. After the event, the Armenian Student Association at USC released a statement also condemning the violence against the three diplomats and distancing the efforts of students who \u201cexercised exclusively peaceful tactics of civil disobedience\u201d from the four accused attackers. ASA also made it clear that USC\u2019s decision to go through with the event and deploy DPS officers, who the organization accused of excessive force, had \u201csubjected [the] Armenian student population to unimaginable cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cUSC made the decision to give genocide denial a platform on campus,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cHosting this event outweighed the emotional, mental and physical wellbeing of its students during this highly sensitive time.\u201d Armenian student and research organizations had publicly opposed the event prior to the protest and made efforts to either cancel Mercan\u2019s appearance or at least postpone it while the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh was underway.\n```"}

With one of Hollywood\u2019s largest award events on USC\u2019s doorsteps, preparations are underway\u2014but at the cost of sidewalk and traffic lane closures.\n\nJefferson Boulevard and 32nd Street, between Hoover and Figueroa, will both be fully closed and access to the USC Shrine Parking Structure and Royal Structures from those streets will be affected, as well. The impacts of the event, which started on Feb. 14, have some students making alternate plans for the weekend.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to go home this Saturday, but since I\u2019m worried about not being able to get back into the Shrine parking lot, I might wait until Sunday,\u201d said Faith Snyder, an undergraduate international relations major who parks at the Shrine structure. \u201cAlready, it\u2019s hard sometimes to find parking spaces.\u201d\n\nWhile the closures will peak on Saturday, some will remain in place until Feb. 27. An email sent out by USC Transportation to the USC community warned of \u201cadditional traffic and congestion in the area for the rest of this week.\u201d The department also provided students with a map of the closures.\n\n\u201cI think USC did a proper job in alerting us,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cI regularly check my emails so I was aware in advance about the street closing.\u201d\n\nPermit holders and USC Village employees are still allowed to use the Shrine parking structure, though they will have to use the 32nd Street entrance and be prepared to show identification to Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) officers who will be managing the parking lot Saturday and Sunday. At the Royal parking structure, permit holders must use the McClintock entrance.\n\nWith the expected overflow from the Shrine structure, USC Transportation said it would be offering parking to permit holders at the Figueroa Structure after 5 p.m. Friday and all day Saturday.\n\nBut the most impacted will be those who live adjacent to the event, such as residents of USC housing building Troy Hall and off-campus apartment complexes like The Shrine Collection, Gateway and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty annoying,\u201d said Quinn Chow, an undergraduate in Dornsife and Troy Hall resident. Chow said he would have to take a detour instead of his regular route to campus because of the 32nd Street sidewalk closures.\n\nFor senior accounting and business administration major Chloe LaBelle, who lives at one of the Shrine Collection properties, the impacts have also already started. She said her usual trek to campus, through the alley between the Shrine and Gateway, has been closed since Tuesday due to the event. In addition, sound from reversing event trucks and the noise of unloading heavy equipment have created even more disruption to her daily life.\n\n\u201cA lot of the times when the Shrine has events they\u2019re pretty loud anyway,\u201d LaBelle said. \u201cSo I think I\u2019m used to it at this point.\u201d\n\nWhile some students were inconvenienced by the SAG Awards, students like Chow did not even know what these awards were, let alone that they were happening in their backyard. As cones and blockades go up, students will continue to create their own detours and maybe even get a chance-encounter with the celebrities just across the street.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/22/bidens-12-billion-student-debt-forgiveness-casts-a-shallow-net/", "response": "```\nA new plan by President Joe Biden to cancel the debt of approximately 153,000 student loan borrowers has loan holders waiting in anticipation. At a campaign stop in Culver City on Wednesday, Biden announced his administration had approved a plan to cancel $1.2 billion of debt for certain borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan. The new program cancels the debt only if borrowers enrolled in the program, borrowed less than $12,000 and began paying off debt at least a decade ago. College students currently accruing debt on federal aid are not eligible for this forgiveness. Neither are a majority of the 43 million borrowers across the country.\n\n\u201cI was hopeful,\u201d said Kristen Zaleski, a clinical social worker at Kent Hospital in Rhode Island, who is still paying off about $190,000 in debt for her master\u2019s degree from the USC School of Social Work from 2011. \u201cBut not optimistic.\u201d\n\nThe latest round of loan forgiveness brings the total amount to about $138 billion, impacting close to 3.9 million student loan borrowers. But that\u2019s only a chip in the $1.6 trillion of federal loans owed. That debt makes up 92% of all student loans in the country.\n\nThe announcement comes at a critical time in Biden\u2019s re-election campaign with student loan forgiveness having been frequently mentioned by the administration throughout his term. In March 2020, he pledged to cancel at least $10,000 in federal student loan debt per borrower.\n\nThe SAVE repayment plan, like many before it, bases monthly payments on the income and family size of borrowers. The plan also has an added benefit for borrowers whose payments are less than the monthly interest accrued: The federal government will cover the cost of any unpaid interest so the loan amount doesn\u2019t continue to grow.\n\nBorrowers like Zaleski have opted for careers with forgiveness built into their contracts. Like many of her colleagues, she began paying off her debt as part of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan. By working at an eligible nonprofit, the federal government promised that her loans would be forgiven after she made the required payments.\n\n\u201cIf I worked in a nonprofit for 10 years, I\u2019d be forgiven,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I realized, if you miss a payment, it all resets. So I\u2019m just like: 10 years, 10 years, 10 years.\u201d\n\nAnd Zaleski is not alone. \u201cI have several classmates that are still trying to get them forgiven, too. All of us are social workers,\u201d she said.\n\nKaty Murphy, the director of college counseling at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, California, said she supports income-based loan forgiveness for people who choose to go into certain professions.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into teaching, social work and health services who are not making billions of dollars, and I wish that loan forgiveness could be pointed toward them,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cTheir loan payments are a larger part of their salary than somebody that\u2019s working on Wall Street.\u201d\n\nShe said she tells her students to be cautious about how much they are willing to take out in loans as they prepare for college.\n\n\u201cYou do not want to leave undergrad education with loans more than it would cost to buy a good Honda with a sunroof,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cNot a Tesla, not a Range Rover, not a Lexus. A good Honda with a sunroof. If you\u2019re gonna leave your undergraduate owing more than that, you should not do this.\u201d\n\nShe said rational loan borrowing is essential as student loan forgiveness plans stall. Last July, the Supreme Court blocked an executive order by the Biden administration from its initial plan to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt. The 6-3 decision was grounded in the \u201cmajor questions\u201d doctrine, which mandates executive decisions first be authorized by Congress.\n\nStill, the attention on student loan debt forgiveness will undoubtedly be on voters\u2019 minds this fall. Jon Knox, an enterprise account executive in Redondo Beach who graduated from USC in 2018, said he hopes Biden\u2019s plan inspires more voters his age.\n\n\u201cThere currently is not enough empathy for people in our age bracket. We\u2019re not being represented on the highest scale,\u201d Knox said. \u201cA lot of people who are in politics are older. They grew up in a different era, a different time, where things were much more affordable.\u201d\n\nThough he has paid off the majority of his $25,000 debt, Knox said he\u2019s glad to see an effort being made in the right direction for his friends who haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI just hope that this gets more people involved [in politics], especially people who are impacted,\u201d Knox continued. \u201cI hope it shows them a more opportune, optimistic view of politics.\u201d\n\nLindsey Miller contributed to this story.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/22/lakers-old-rivals-meet-again/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 After a lackluster showing by the West team in the NBA All-Star game this past weekend, only one of the Lakers\u2019 two All-Stars will be ready to battle their Pacific Division rivals. The Los Angeles Lakers will face the Golden State Warriors on Thursday at Chase Center in San Francisco. The most recent matchup between the teams ended in a thrilling 145-144 double overtime win for the Lakers. However, things will be different this week. Lebron James, who just participated in his record-breaking 20th All-Star weekend, is listed as out for Thursday\u2019s game. James missed the Lakers\u2019 last matchup against the Utah Jazz on Feb. 14 with an ankle injury, but did play limited minutes in the All-Star game, where the West lost to the East with an eyebrow-raising final score of 211-186. Lakers center and fellow 2024 All-Star Anthony Davis is listed as probable for tonight\u2019s game. Davis played 22 minutes during the All-Star game compared to James\u2019s 13. While the last Lakers-Warriors matchup was an electric win for the purple and gold, all of the Lakers\u2019 starters suited up and participated. James and Davis each playing more than 40 minutes. Thursday\u2019s matchup will mark the second occasion the Lakers have faced the Warriors in the 2023-2024 season. Both teams sit at the bottom of the play-in places, distant from the greatness both teams enjoyed at the height of their rivalry in second half of the 2010s and into 2020. A 30-26 record for the Lakers has them in the ninth spot in the Western Conference, while the Warriors are a place behind in 10th with a 27-26 record. Interestingly, the Lakers have a winning 20-17 Western Conference record, while the Warriors are 15-20 in the Western Conference. As things stand, the two teams would face each other in the first round of play-in games, which would make for an entertaining winner-takes-all match. The Warriors managed to secure a win over the Utah Jazz in their final game before the All-Star break. Previously, they had been on a five-game winning streak that ended with a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 14. In the win against Utah, Warriors guard Klay Thompson overcame his dip in form this season by coming off of the bench to score 35. He also scored 24 points in the last game against the Lakers. His fellow Warriors guard and 2024 All-Star Steph Curry scored a monster 46 points in the overtime loss. In the previous game between Golden State and the Lakers, only one Warriors player who came off the bench, guard Brandin Podziemski, scored in double figures. Warriors\u2019 starting center Draymond Green only scored eight points. However, Green did haul in the most rebounds for Golden State with 14 total. The Lakers\u2019 bench is the key if head coach Darvin Ham\u2019s team hopes to win. Lakers forwards Rui Hachimura and Jarred Vanderbilt contributed a total of 25 points off the bench during the last game against Golden State. Unfortunately for the Lakers, Vanderbilt is still listed as out along with several other players and wing Cam Reddish is questionable for the game. Without James and possibly without Davis, who contributed a combined 65 points in the last matchup against the Warriors, it will be up to guards D\u2019angelo Russell and Austin Reaves to lead the team as they have done so frequently this season. And it wouldn\u2019t hurt if Lakers forward Taurean Prince redeemed himself from his last outing against the Warriors, a 0-points, 3-rebounds and 4-personal fouls performance in 24 minutes of play. If the Lakers want to win again, this time without James, the bench will need to be able to hold things down. The Lakers vs. Warriors game will be broadcast on TNT at 7 p.m. Pacific Time.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/22/uta-leader-david-zedeck-shares-with-students-how-the-digital-age-has-globalized-music/", "response": "```\nUTA leader David Zedeck shares with students how the digital age has globalized music\n\nThe agency representative for The Jonas Brothers, Lil Nas X and many more stopped by Annenberg on Wednesday to have lunch with USC students and talk about the globalization of music.\n\nDavid Zedeck, partner and co-head of global music at the United Talent Agency (UTA), has spent his career focusing on the expansion of music internationally. From booking talent at pizza shops and small theaters at the start of his career, to now booking stadiums or even sold-out festivals for his clients, Zedeck has made a long-lasting impression on the music industry.\n\nAt just 21, Zedeck started his career as a secretary at Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and learned quickly that the people you meet in starting positions will be the executives you talk to 20 years down the road. \u201cPeople who answered phones, we are now running major record labels,\u201d Zedeck said. \u201cPeople who were assistants on the road \u2014 carrying clients\u2019 luggage \u2014 are now managing some of the finest clients. There is no job too big, no job too small.\u201d\n\nAfter spending five years at Live Nation, an American multinational entertainment company, Zedeck was recruited by UTA and said he found ways to revamp the department. According to UTA, the agency had 20% fewer festival bookings, fewer stadium and arena shows and 40% fewer hires and promotions prior to Zedeck\u2019s tenure.\n\nZedeck\u2019s talk drew in students from across campus, many of whom came in wanting to learn more about his career path and the inner workings of artist representation. Liana Stoll, an undergraduate music industry major at the Thornton School of Music, said Zedeck\u2019s comments made her mindful of the importance of every job in the industry. \u201cTake any opportunity that\u2019s handed to you,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s what you were looking for or not.\u201d\n\nZedeck also touched on the impact streaming has had on the music industry, with services like Spotify and Apple Music allowing music to be produced and released at a faster rate than ever, meaning charts are also moving up and down at a much faster pace than 10 or 15 years ago. \u201cThere\u2019s thousands of songs that get released every year,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you looked at an annual basis, there\u2019s probably no more than a couple hundred songs that make the Top 4, but now there\u2019s a couple thousand songs that people listen to on any of your devices.\u201d\n\nZedeck said this is the direct result of the globalization of music, which serves to decrease language and geographical barriers. \u201cThat\u2019s a beauty of technology \u2014 that it has increased accessibility,\u201d said Karnessia Georgetown, a master\u2019s student at the Marshall School of Business, who is a current UTA intern and is hopeful about the future of the music industry. \u201cBeing able to appreciate Afro beats or like Latin pop \u2014 knowing Karol G and Bad Bunny \u2014 I just think that that\u2019s a net good to come out of technology.\u201d\n\nTechnology has also allowed artists to create new opportunities and avenues for themselves. Through experimenting with new genres, Zedeck said artists can now manage their own narratives better, citing Beyonce\u2019s newly announced country album as an example of the evolution of genres. \u201cMusic is wider,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you can specialize in something or be genre agnostic. The only people that use the word genre are people in the music business,\u201d he continued. \u201cPut your thoughts on this world into a song, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just music.\u201d\n\nThe lunch ended with Zedeck highlighting the importance of collaboration in the industry, emphasizing that behind any given artist is a team of people. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that it\u2019s [one] person, right, it\u2019s always a team,\u201d he said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to correct an error about Zedeck\u2019s clients.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/22/the-silver-shield-vol-12-stardom-in-dallas/", "response": "```\nThe Silver Shield, Vol. 12: Stardom in Dallas\n\nA Star-studded cast\n\nIn recent years, the Dallas Stars are a team that consistently reaches the playoffs, but can\u2019t quite hoist the Stanley Cup. Coming off of a Western Conference Finals loss last season, the Stars are seeking their first title since 1999 this year with a deep, talented roster. Currently, Dallas narrowly leads the stacked Central Division with 76 points on a 34-15-8 record, with the Colorado Avalanche and Winnipeg Jets close in the rearview mirror.\n\nUnder the helm of head coach Peter DeBoer, the Stars operate differently than most premier NHL powerhouses. The Stars are the epitome of a team that doesn\u2019t need to have a bona fide \u201cface of the franchise\u201d superstar to be dominant. In fact, Dallas doesn\u2019t have a single player in the league\u2019s top-25 in points; depth is what is pushing the Stars to new galaxies. Nine players with at least 10 goals this season indicates the dynamic roster\u2019s depth that reigning General Manager of the Year Jim Nill is so proud of.\n\nLeft winger Jason Robertson is one clear example of a selfless player. He may not be having the same level of success he had last year when he posted a franchise record of 109 points and was an All-Star, but the 24-year-old still leads the team with 56 points, including 38 assists. While regression is frustrating for any player, the fact that the Stars are still leading the Central speaks a lot to the distribution of scoring across the entire roster, and Robertson is still an elite player nonetheless.\n\nIn November, I highlighted Joe Pavelski\u2019s ageless success, which is still holding up over halfway through the season. The first-line right winger started the season on a hot streak and has since slowed down a bit, but is still producing consistent points for Dallas. Centerman Matt Duchene has been vital on Dallas\u2019 second line. Duchene joined the Stars this past offseason on a one-year, $3 million deal, and his addition has turned the team\u2019s second unit into a goal-scoring juggernaut. A change of scenery is what Duchene needed; at 33 years old, he has 55 points and is bound to have one of the best seasons of his career.\n\nSecond-line left winger Mason Marchment leads the Stars with a plus-22 rating and has been versatile in the offensive zone. Marchment has recorded points in all but two games in February, and his aggressiveness and efficiency have contributed to his newfound dominance this season. Winger Tyler Seguin has also been a big part of the second line\u2019s success, with similar numbers to those of Marchment. Roope Hintz has thrived as Dallas\u2019 first-line center, and his team-leading 23 goals can back this up. Although February has been a rather low-key month for Hintz, he\u2019s still putting together a very solid season in his sixth with the Stars.\n\nGoaltender Jake Oettinger was Dallas\u2019 lone All-Star representative this season. Like Robertson, he\u2019s not having the same success as last year, but, if he\u2019s established one thing, it\u2019s that he\u2019s a pure winner. Oettinger is one of eight goalies to win 20 or more games this season, and he\u2019ll look to raise his .904 save percentage the rest of the way through. Defensemen Miro Heiskanen and Thomas Harley are a stout blueline pair and should continue to protect Oettinger at all costs.\n\nThe Stars most recently took a sip from the Clarence Campbell Bowl in 2020, but they had their Cup hopes shattered by the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games. But, with talent in all positions in 2023-24, Dallas is bound for a deep playoff run if it can keep up its winning ways. The Stars will attempt to create space in the Central standings when they take on the Ottawa Senators Thursday at 4 p.m. PST.\n\nThe 2024 NHL Stadium Series\n\nMetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, was the host site of the 2024 NHL Stadium Series. An annual tradition since 2014, the Stadium Series is always a colorful, jam-packed event that gives fans the unique opportunity to watch their teams skate outdoors. This year, MetLife hosted four Atlantic Division foes for two games: Devils vs. Flyers on February 17 and Islanders vs. Rangers on February 18. This year\u2019s edition of the Stadium Series featured two games for the first time since 2016.\n\nNew Jersey Devils vs. Philadelphia Flyers\n\nThe Flyers may have outshot the Devils 48-40, but New Jersey still found a way to win thanks to its scoring flurry. Devils captain Nico Hischier recorded three points on two goals and an assist in what was a dominant 6-3 victory for New Jersey. The 25-year-old center got things started less than a minute into the game, putting the Devils up 1-0 on a breakaway chance.\n\nNew Jersey doubled its advantage 13 minutes later when winger Tyler Toffoli tapped in a rebound off the faceoff. Each team added two goals in the second period, with Flyers winger Owen Tippett lighting the lamp on both occasions for Philadelphia. Up 4-2 in the third, Hischier scored his second goal of the game off a takeaway. Although Philly scored again, Devils winger Nathan Bastian put the nail in the coffin by scoring on the empty net for his second goal of the contest. Goaltender Nico Daws made 45 saves for his sixth win of the season. Six New Jersey skaters had at least two points in what was a slugfest for the largest crowd in Devils history.\n\nNew York Islanders vs. New York Rangers\n\nIn a game that averaged 1.6 million viewers, the New York rivals put on a show. The Rangers opened up scoring early in the first period on a slap shot from Erik Gustafsson from the point, but then proceeded to allow four unanswered Islanders goals. Down 4-1 early in the second, center Vincent Trocheck scored back-to-back goals to bring the Blueshirts within one. The Isles regained a two-goal lead early in the third thanks to a lucky bounce that allowed defenseman Alexander Romanov to tap the puck in with ease.\n\nThe Rangers, however, showed once again that they weren\u2019t going to quit. On a power play while their net was empty, winger Chris Kreider deflected in a pass from Artemi Panarin from near the blue line to bring the score within one. Next, on yet another power play with the net vacant, center Mika Zibanejad powerfully scored in a one-timer from the left side of the net to force overtime. The Rangers only needed 10 seconds of overtime before Panarin notched the game-winning goal off a costly Islanders turnover in their own zone. The goal posts were hit out of line during the play, but referees deemed the goal to be good, as the integrity of the net was not disturbed. Panarin earned his third point of the night on the play, with the final score being 6-5.\n\nHouston Rockets owner wants NHL franchise in Houston\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta reportedly has been in talks with the NHL to potentially bring a franchise to downtown Houston. The city is home to an NBA, NFL and MLB franchise, but has never hosted hockey at the NHL level. Fertitta reportedly said that he hopes to either own an expansion team or bring an existing team to Houston. Last month, the owners of the Utah Jazz made their pitch to the NHL about bringing a team to Salt Lake City, so it is clear that the league is open to the possibility of having more than 32 teams.\n\nWhile Fertitta added that his interest in bringing the NHL to Houston has spanned over seven years, recent discussions have become more serious. Texas has multiple teams in all major sports leagues except for the NHL, as the Stars are the lone franchise in the state. So, adding a team in Houston would make sense. The Coyotes have been the most obvious candidate for relocation in recent years, so Houston may try to lure them in if they can\u2019t get an arena deal done soon in Arizona.

She stars alongside actor and her former husband, Beno\u00eet Magimel, in their first film together in over 20 years. The two come together in a love story that is equally an ode to French cuisine. It is all about the senses and the way that they help us navigate the world around us; being conscious of all our sensations is being the most alive. It is directed by acclaimed French-Vietnamese filmmaker, Tr\u1ea7n Anh H\u00f9ng, who has made Japanese, English, Vietnamese and French films. Between both of his Academy Award-recognized titles, \u201cThe Taste of Things\u201d and his 1994 film \u201cThe Scent of Green Papaya,\u201d he communicates a vested interest in dwelling on the senses.\n\nWe find ourselves in the vast and flourishing countryside of Loire Valley in the Pays de la Loire region in late 1800s Western France. Eugenie and Dodin spend their days eating and cooking. Dodin is a gourmet and Eugenie is his chef; they work with two apprentices who help them to carry out meals. The young Bonnie Chagneau-Ravoire shines as Pauline, who shows exceptional promise as a young chef, displaying her ability to detect ingredients by taste early on.\n\nMuch of this movie is simply bearing witness to the heavenly display of garden-plucked vegetables, fresh fish, meats and desserts. Each more decadent than the one before, this film is responsible for the most audible gasps ever heard in a theater. A dollop of cream fresh from the stove was met with a frenzy of sounds typically associated with fornication. In other words, this film takes food porn and makes it art.\n\nHung takes great care to ensure that the audience is as invested in the process as the result. Each dish is prepared from scratch with the utmost precision and effort. We watch them delicately wash and chop, swirling oil over the large pans and placing bread into the wood-fired brick ovens. It is mesmerizing and sensual, helped by the arresting cinematography of Jonathan Ricquebourg, who captures the idyllic villa with elegant shots and rich lighting.\n\nOne of the film\u2019s previous titles, \u201cThe Passion of Dodin Bouffant,\u201d conveys the backbone of the story which is Dodin\u2019s unwavering love for Eugenie and food. For both, he exhibits great patience and consideration. The two have an unconventional arrangement for the time: she works for him, yet holds the power. She refuses to get married to maintain her freedom, which he accepts gladly, though proposes to her earnestly and often just to be sure. Each night he slips down the hallway and checks to see if her door is open. If it is, he comes in and stays with her. If it is not, that is okay, too.\n\nThe way the two understand each other is evident in all parts of their lives, never needing to explain themselves or explicitly communicate. There is an obvious intimacy between them and so much is transferred with looks or touch. And, often, with food.\n\n\u201cThe Taste of Things\u201d is an ode to pleasure. Through the camera work, the lingering stares or joyful consumption of every bite, that pleasure is magnified. It feels as though Hung decided that people don\u2019t relish enough. Modern society moves at an unromantic speed: fast food, the Internet, preservatives and microwaves. There isn\u2019t time in the day between appointments and errands to savor. As we move through the experience of watching the film, we settle into the indulgence of it. After first marveling at the sheer dedication these two put into making each meal, we start with impatience and eagerness, waiting for the final reveal and moving into a languid enjoyment of the expedition. From melting the butter to finding the perfect placement of the garnish on its way out the door, we learn to appreciate each moment.\n\n\"I didn't want to have a food stylist on the movie because I wanted everything to be real,\" says Tran in an interview with NPR.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Binoche delivers a performance that is completely captivating from start to finish. She brings to Eugenie such a strong internal presence and sense of self-assurance. This was my first experience watching Beno\u00eet Magimel, but he holds his own. As Dodin, his harsher exterior, necessary for a purist and regimented cook of his caliber, is softened by the gentleness he brings to each movement. Both performers convey a breadth of emotion and narrative with just a look.\n\nIt is an astounding, beautiful film. It feels like the kind of comfort movie that can be returned to time and time again with the same effectiveness. It is a literal feast for the senses: unapologetic in its decadence but has the depth in its storytelling to back it up. \u201cThe Taste of Things\u201d reflects on how we prepare food and consume it, and what those things mean about us. It calls into question the way that we respond to seasons, friendships, nature, and romance, and will have us thinking about those things differently. But most of all, it is a banquet meant to be enjoyed, one delicious bite at a time.\n\n\u201cThe Taste of Things\u201d was French\u2019s official submission for the Academy Awards and had its theatrical release on Feb 9, 2024.\n```"}

But can USC students name one song?\n\nBy Tomoki Chien February 21, 2024 at 6:00 pm PST\n\nBrace yourself for not one, two or three but four new Beatles biopics that are slated to come out in 2027. There\u2019s going to be one movie for each of the Fab Four -- that\u2019s John, Paul, George and Ringo -- all directed by Sam Mendes who\u2019s best known American Beauty, 1917, Skyfall and Jarhead. Now, this is the first time The Beatles have given any movie project full life and music rights, so expectations are going to be high. But it\u2019s also not entirely shocking that this is happening now: Music biopics are something of a trending thing. Movies about Queen and Elvis all saw box office success a few years ago. And just last week, a biopic about reggae pioneer and activist Bob Marley saw strong early success.\n\nBut on USC\u2019s campus, students didn\u2019t seem especially stoked. Most seemed to at least know about The Beatles but struggled to recall much else. Valeria Gomez: I don\u2019t know their names. Chien: Could you name one Beatles song for me? Gomez: Uh. \u201cImagine?\u201d No, that\u2019s John Lennon. Sorry. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m blanking. Antonia Mintcheva: Oh no. Um, no. I can\u2019t. Pass, pass. Wow, this is not good.

But, thankfully, not everybody was totally in the dark. Other students knew who The Beatles were, so I asked them which biopic they\u2019d watch if they could only watch one. Laz Pacheco: I\u2019d probably do Paul. Chien: Because he\u2019s the most famous? Pacheco: Yeah, I think so. Just the one I recognize the most. Keaton Orava: Probably Paul McCartney. Chien: No love for Ringo or George? Orava: I mean, there\u2019s some love but not two hours each of love.\n\nThat was third-year law student Laz Pacheco and freshman Keaton Orava.

According to members of the club tennis team and USC tennis professors, USC allegedly has plans to demolish the recreational tennis and pickleball courts as a part of the baseball stadium expansion and has yet to make plans for a replacement for fall 2024. Players of USC\u2019s Club Tennis Team, who use the courts for their practice, said they are concerned about whether they can play next year. \u201cWe aren\u2019t feeling super supported by the university right now,\u201d said Elizabeth Stuart-Chaffoo, the club team\u2019s co-president. \u201cThey\u2019re not giving us answers.\u201d According to a USC Recreational Sports statement, the existing recreational tennis and pickleball courts will be removed in May 2024 as part of the development of new Athletics facilities in that space. \u201cThe university is actively investigating options for replacement of these courts in order to continue providing access to recreational tennis and pickleball facilities for the USC community. Further information will be shared in the coming months as details become available on this initiative,\u201d the statement said. Khai-Ly Tran, the club team\u2019s vice president, started a petition on Feb. 12, which urges that \u201cUSC prioritizes the replacement of these tennis and pickleball courts elsewhere on campus by the start of the fall 2024 academic year or with the same urgency as the athletic expansion.\u201d The petition aims to show how many people care about these courts, according to Stuart-Chaffoo. It already has over 1,000 signatures, and the number continues to increase daily. Stuart-Chaffoo spoke highly of the team, explaining how it has given her some of her closest friends and a community outside of her classes. Her teammate, Hannah Jiang, who is a co-captain, conveyed a similar feeling of distress as if the courts are ripped up, the club team will have nowhere to practice. Jiang is a junior and hopes to have one more tennis season for her senior year. \u201cClub Tennis is my primary source of activity, getting outside, being active and staying healthy,\u201d Jiang said. But the benefits of tennis apply to a much broader crowd than just the Club Tennis Team. Timothy Burton has worked as a tennis professor at USC for about 18 years. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen those courts so busy my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen how this many people interacted, played and socialized.\u201d USC teaches about 15 tennis classes each semester, which all have about 20 students. The university also recently added pickleball classes. So, the tennis courts are a big part of the school\u2019s physical education department. Burton said he asked the athletics department about the possibility of using the David X. Marks Tennis Stadium, which is used for the Division I tennis team, for his tennis classes. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked the athletics department multiple times about availability, but we have no answer,\u201d Burton said. \u201cThey\u2019re really slow to get back to us.\u201d Even if the club team and tennis classes can use the tennis stadium, it may be more unlikely that recreational players will have that luxury. Jiang said she sees the demand for the courts among the USC community when \u201cpeople will literally line up outside the courts waiting to use the courts as soon as we\u2019re done with practice.\u201d Burton said he also often asks recreational players to leave as the courts are full when he needs to teach a class. Joshua Maya is a physical education professor who teaches both tennis and pickleball. After starting this position at USC in 2023, a colleague asked him whether he plans to teach other sports. Maya said he plans to teach golf and yoga if the courts are not replaced, but he said \u201cpickleball is a more special class to teach.\u201d Maya added that he likes how pickleball is a collaborative sport that forces his students to laugh and have fun with each other. \u201cPeople have the most fun in that class,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates these friendships and more of a connection.\u201d He also explained how pickleball is growing nationally and internationally as many universities add pickleball programs. \u201cThis is the time to get ahead of the game, not take a step backward,\u201d Maya said.\n```"}

Look at the job description. Now with Chad, it\u2019s so easy to rewrite everything. So use chat rewrite stuff makes your resumes tailored for the job\n\nJustin Nguyen, a sophomore studying business administration, had more advice.

It doesn\u2019t hurt to send a follow up message after you submit your application. But at the end of the day, there\u2019s a lot of other opportunities out there for you to pursue.

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Makai Singleton\nFebruary 21, 2024 at 5:40 pm PST\n\nThe DPS Chief of Public Safety, Lauretta Hill, discussed the increase in scooter thefts around campus, and how students can avoid becoming victims. \u201cScooter theft is the biggest crime because it impacts our students a lot,\u201d said Hill. \u201cWe want to continue to educate people on scooter thieves, and if we can get those numbers down it\u2019s not just helpful for us but also to the LAPD.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, there was a 481% increase in the theft of scooters, which are classified as motor vehicles due to state law. The 2023 annual Security and Fire Safety Report disclosed 322 cases of scooters reported stolen compared to the 67 cases that were reported in 2021.\n\nLaw enforcement has cracked down on rings of scooter thieves in the Los Angeles area, said Hill. \u201cThere\u2019s a market for people selling the stolen scooters somewhere. And, sometimes LAPD breaks up those rings and finds all kinds of scooters,\u201d said Hill.\n\nDPS continues to advocate for students to register their scooters and purchase locks to keep their scooters secure while they are in class and at home. \u201cJust like we register bikes, you can register the scooters or put something that is identifying so that when it is taken, we have an ability to match that back to the person,\u201d said Hill. \u201cAnd securing them is the biggest thing. A lot of scooters that are taken are not secured.\u201d\n\nAnd she is not wrong, some students say this is the crime that affects them the most and one that typically costs them an average of $300 to $600 to replace. \u201cUSC\u2019s campus is open to the public and people come on campus often looking for unlocked scooters,\u201d said Thaddeus Bernard, a junior business administration major. \u201cThey often steal the scooters, ride off on them and resell them.\u201d\n\nIn a situation where a scooter isn\u2019t registered, and it is stolen, Hill explains that DPS gets in touch with LAPD to track it down, but it\u2019s not hopeful. \u201cThe likelihood of us finding the scooter is zero,\u201d said Hill. \u201cUnless there is something identifying like an AirTag or it is registered we can\u2019t match the report of a stolen scooter with the scooter that was found.\u201d\n\nSome students say that the smart thing to do is have a registered scooter so you can have a chance at getting your property back. \u201cRegistering your scooter puts it in a DPS database and if it is ever found they are able to identify it is yours and return it,\u201d said Bernard. \u201cI just registered mine for extra protection. If it is stolen then DPS will care slightly more.\u201d\n\nOther students do not share the same sentiment about registering their scooters. \u201cI do not feel like registering my scooter helps that much and it is an inconvenience to take the time to go and register the scooter,\u201d said Brandon Barnes, a sophomore human biology major. \u201cI\u2019ve found that when people register their scooter they still do not have trust in DPS to retrieve it if it is stolen.\u201d\n\nAs a person who has had their locked scooter taken, Barnes agrees with DPS that there are other modes of keeping track of students\u2019 property.\u201dI feel AirTags are a better way to keep track of scooters, and keeping it in a safe location indoors is a better option than outside on a bike rack.\u201d\n\nBut the best option? Keep it locked, said Hill. Because \u201cwhen you lose it, it\u2019s usually gone.\u201d\n```"}

Her name is Mimi, and she is a Jack Russell-Pomeranian mix.\n\nMimi (center) posing for a photo with friends. (Photo courtesy of Taky Cheung)\n\n\u201cI saw the way a human father would put their daughter on his shoulders, so I tried it with Mimi. I used to hold her from behind to help her balance on my shoulders but noticed she would spread her legs and could balance herself,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nCheung immigrated from Hong Kong to America in 1997. He has no family in the United States and said Mimi brings him a lot of comfort.\n\n\u201cWith Mimi, I feel the love. I feel that she loves me, and all of my family members are in Hong Kong. So she is my only family member in America. She is like my daughter,\u201d he said.\n\nAs I walked through USC\u2019s campus with Cheung, he told me how he went from a dog hater to a dog trainer.\n\n\u201cI had a cat, but when my cat died, I was so devastated,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cI started to try to understand dogs. They love to be with humans, but they don\u2019t know what is acceptable in our world. I began to realize the reason I hated dogs was because of the dog owners.\u201d\n\nCheung adopted his first dog from a shelter and quickly learned he had a hidden talent for teaching dogs how to behave.\n\n\u201cI trained [my first dog] to do all kinds of stuff. She could skateboard, do handstands and catch treats,\u201d he said.\n\nMimi\u2019s balancing act proved to gain the attention of USC students.\n\n\u201cI saw a man with a bunch of dogs and a dog on his head.  It was really cute, and I took a photo,\u201d said Anne Fitzgerald, a sophomore media, arts and practice major at USC.\n\nCheung and Mimi\u2019s trick also proved to uplift the spirits of students on campus.\n\n\u201cMy dog just passed away last week. It made me happy to see so many dogs, especially the one on top of his head,\u201d said Victoria Martzloff, a junior theater major at USC.\n\nThe gang poses with Traveler the horse.

We live in a city, and there is no way to avoid crowded areas,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cThey don\u2019t react. We walk and just enjoy the nice weather.\u201d\n\nCheung has been training dogs full-time for eight years. Some of his current clients have been with him for more than four years.\n\nWhile many would love to play with dogs for a living, he said the lifestyle is not as glamorous as it seems.\n\n\u201cSometimes I find poop in my car, poop in my bed,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nEven through the bowel movements, Cheung considers dogs man\u2019s best friend.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider them pets. I will say that a cat, bunny or goldfish are pets. But dogs are more than pets,\u201d he said. \u201cbecause they understand you.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect a correction regarding where Cheung immigrated from.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Jason Wang)\n\nLast summer, the iconic game franchise made its return with \u201cStreet Fighter 6.\u201d Eight years after the last mainline release, the newest installment sought to revamp the entire game aesthetically. \u201cStreet Fighter 6\u2032\u2032 promoted itself with graffiti-style artwork, vibrant colors, and even new game mechanics that utilize paint splatter to accentuate movement. All of this fits within this new urban look to the game, really putting the \u201cstreet\u201d into \u201cStreet Fighter.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest shifts in terms of its creative design was its music, as the team worked to collaborate with American artists, specifically those working in the hip-hop space.

(Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nWhile the series is no stranger to the genre, with \u201cStreet Fighter III: Third Strike\u201d incorporating some of these music elements, the latest game took it to another level. Heavy beats coupled with rap sought to hype the player up for their next battle.\n\nA keyboard and a small mixer were set up on stage, as the lineup walked in. The first was  GRP , a producer and songwriter for \u201cStreet Fighter 6.\u201d As he began to play, the vocalists joined him.

That was something that [we] wanted to bring in,\u201d explained Nakayama, through a translator. Game producer Shuhei Matsumoto added that the international collaboration was key to developing a unique sound for this game.\n\n\u201cThe intent was to work with North American hip-hop artists who are ingrained in the culture, and [we] also wanted to incorporate different types of tastes and sounds to the game soundtrack,\u201d said Matsumoto. \u201c\u2018Street Fighter 6\u2032 is such a new challenging game that [we] wanted to collaborate and work with a lot of different people while leveraging different elements of hip-hop.\u201d\n\nLike with many fighting games such as \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d or \u201cTekken,\u201d they always sought to have global representation in terms of its characters. Developing unique themes for the entire roster serves as a heavy undertaking, but the team behind \u201cStreet Fighter 6\u2032\u2032 fit its unique musicality into this, combining electronic music with a global perspective on music. For example, the latest DLC character  Ed\u2019s theme  fits in line with the hip-hop feel of the rest of the soundtrack but incorporates German lyrics given his nationality and  Dee Jay\u2019s theme  has hints of reggaeton as an homage to his Jamaican background.\n\n\u201cStreet Fighter\u201d as a franchise continues to evolve. From the 8-bit melodies of the classic games, to the hard rock of \u201cStreet Fighter V,\u201d to the modern sensibilities of the latest game, there seems to be endless musical potential for this long running series.\n```"}

Maya Erskine  and  Donald Glover\u2019s  portrayal of Jane and John Smith explore the complexities in family and marital relationships across gender and race.\n\nIt\u2019s trouble in paradise in this Amazon Prime Video original when conflicts arise in the Smiths\u2019 new marriage. Matched by their secret organization, the couple ultimately brings out some of the best and much of the worst in one another. The couple decides to face their demons in the episode titled \u201cCouples Therapy.\u201d Here they attend sessions with  Sarah Paulson\u2019s  character week after week or better put, mission after mission.\n\nThe Smiths cloak their true occupations by saying they are software engineers and share many stories detailed in metaphors. They delve into the conflicts they harbor for one another from their missions. The issues that tower above the pair include how John thinks Jane is too controlling and that she\u2019s like a robot who pretends to care about people. Jane\u2019s reservations about her spouse are that he didn\u2019t sever his ties from his past and his insecurities of being jealous and feeling comfortable.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s family is the same, even though being family-oriented is one of the values placed on the highest pedestal in Asian communities. Unlike John, Jane followed the organization\u2019s instructions and cut ties and communication with anyone from her past, namely her father. The Smiths are written as two sides of the same coin\u2014in this instance, Jane only has her father as her remaining family while John only has his mother.\n\nThroughout the show, John\u2019s parental relationship is the root of many of the arguments with Jane, often onslaughts of lowly remarks. John also makes a few jabs at Jane about her nonexistent relationship with her dad. That is the reason why he criticizes her for pretending to care about people.\n\nDuring one of their sessions, John and Jane reflect on a mission where he goes undercover. This prompts discomfort for Jane because of John\u2019s behavior as he bonds with other Black men. She points out his banter through sexism and anti-Asian racism to connect with them, leading John to think that she\u2019s just jealous that she wouldn\u2019t be able to pull off a job like that.\n\nAlthough in the context of the show it all falls down to how their actions make each other feel, there is still the underlying racism and misogyny that are often used as the butt of jokes, reflecting the implicit biases of these protagonists.\n\nThemes of family are revisited by John and Jane when they discuss having kids: whether to have them or keep them out of their explosive world. On a mission in Italy, Jane thinks on her feet by lying to a couple that she is pregnant so they can loan them a boat to escape across Lake Como. After John has some lingering thoughts on the subject, he is enthusiastic about starting a family while Jane believes the opposite with how impractical it would be to have kids in their line of work.\n\nJane\u2019s unwillingness to have children, even if her stance is for the sake of their job and said-kid\u2019s safety, depicts another characterization of Asian women placed on its head. Her beliefs show how she tries not to be a model housewife, a box many women are placed in. However, when the duo rekindle their love for each other at the end of the season, she comes to an agreement with John negotiating that they can have only two children if they were to settle down. This could be controversial given her previous narrative, but perhaps it fits within the story of love the show seems to be focused on telling.\n\n\u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith\u201d is a breath of fresh air and new perspectives as a reboot allows it to stand alone from the  2005 movie . John and Jane face a plight of relational extremities as an interracial couple in addition to performing high-risk tasks. Their very identities and cultures are some of the challenges they must work as a unit to overcome.\n```"}

Ohtani is expected to make his Dodgers debut in Seoul next month. (AP/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Adam Bradford February 21, 2024 at 8:44 am PST\n\nMLB Opening Day will look a bit different than usual this year. For the first time ever, the highest level of professional baseball will be played across the Pacific Ocean in Seoul, South Korea. The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres will meet at Gocheok Sky Dome, home of the Korean Baseball League\u2019s Kiwoom Heroes, on March 20 and 21.\n\nFor MLB, it will be an opportunity to showcase some of its biggest stars to a new audience. The Dodgers and Padres boast some of the biggest names in baseball, and both franchises finished top three in attendance last season.\n\nThe biggest of those names will obviously be Shohei Ohtani. The two-way superstar from Japan has quickly established himself as not just a baseball phenomenon, but a global one. The Seoul Series will mark not only his debut in a Dodgers uniform, but also an opportunity to play an MLB game on his home continent. With flights from Tokyo to Seoul under three hours, you can bet that a lot of Japanese fans will make the short trip to watch Ohtani.\n\nBut Ohtani is not the only notable name who will be playing much closer to home than usual. There\u2019s also Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who signed with the Dodgers this offseason and will likely make his first MLB start in Seoul. Padres\u2019 utility player Ha-Seong Kim is from Bucheon, South Korea\u2014less than 20 miles from Seoul\u2014and played in the KBO for seven years. And although he is a U.S. citizen and spent the majority of his childhood in the United States, Dodgers\u2019 manager Dave Roberts was actually born in Naha, Japan.\n\nThere are also plenty of American and Latin American-born stars who will play across the Pacific Ocean for the first time. For the Dodgers, that group is highlighted by surefire future Hall of Famers Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. And San Diego is not lacking for stars either, with a lineup that includes Manny Machado, Fernando Tatis Jr., Juan Soto and Xander Bogaerts.\n\nThe players will not be the only thing MLB is bringing to Korea, however. They will also bring many popular concessions from Dodger Stadium and Petco Park to sell at the games. Those will include Dodger Dogs, the famous Dodger Stadium hot dogs that go all the way back to the team\u2019s time in Brooklyn.\n\nWhile the series is still more than a month away, the excitement is already building. With the Dodgers and Padres both beginning Spring Training workouts in Arizona this week, preparation is officially underway.\n```"}

(AP/Darron Cummings)\n\nBy Dylan Luden February 20, 2024 at  8:55 pm PST\n\nThe long, decorated career of LeBron James will surely be coming to an end soon, after 21 seasons, four NBA Championships, four regular season MVPs and four finals MVPs. There\u2019s no timetable for when that will be, but the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer would like to finish his career in a Lakers jersey.\n\nJames discussed his future during his 20th NBA All-Star weekend and mentioned that he would like to finish out his storied career with the Los Angeles Lakers as he tries to win his second championship with the franchise. \u201cI am a Laker and I\u2019ve been very happy being a Laker the last six years, and hopefully it stays that way, but I don\u2019t have the answer to how long it is or which uniform I\u2019ll be in,\u201d James said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s with the Lakers. It\u2019s a great organization and so many greats, but we\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to end, but it\u2019s coming for sure.\u201d\n\nLeBron\u2019s comments come a few weeks after reports claiming that the Golden State Warriors inquired about a trade after James tweeted a cryptic  hourglass emoji  right after their loss to the Atlanta Hawks. Before that tweet, James mentioned he was unhappy with the Lakers\u2019 performance as they sat around .500 in a crowded Western Conference. Since James\u2019 tweet, the Lakers went 6-1 before the All-Star break to enter the second half with a 30-26 record sitting ninth in the Western Conference.\n\nJames\u2019 future for next season is unclear, as he also stated he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll come back to Los Angeles as he hits free agency. He did mention in the past that he wants to play with his son, USC freshman guard Bronny James, but it\u2019s  unclear if he\u2019ll enter the draft  after spending one year on campus.\n\nOverall, James\u2019 comments about wanting to end his career in Los Angeles come as a sigh of relief for Laker fans after listening to rumors about him moving on to another team for weeks. The Lakers will begin their second half of the season on Thursday, February 22 at 7 p.m. against the Golden State Warriors in San Francisco.\n```"}

(AP/Ian Walton)\n\nBy Marco Haynes February 20, 2024 at 6:34 pm PST\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s three most consequential results.\n\nManchester City 1, Chelsea 1\n\nA fiercely contested encounter ended with Chelsea withstanding the Manchester City pressure and sharing a surprising point at Etihad Stadium. Before halftime, Chelsea\u2019s counterattack sent a low cross into the penalty box to winger Raheem Sterling and cut inside of defender Kyle Walker to curl a shot in the bottom right corner against his former team for a 1-0 lead.\n\nBoth sides created opportunities during the second half, especially Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, who tallied nine shots but couldn\u2019t find the back of the net. Defensive midfielder Rodri rescued a point for the home team by popping up at the edge of the penalty box and striking a volley that deflected off defender Trevor Chalobah, leveling the teams at 1-1.\n\nThe defending Premier League champions, Manchester City still sit within four points of first place in third after a few unexpectedly poor performances. The tie kept the Citizens unbeaten at home in their last 23 matches, and they haven\u2019t lost in their last nine league games, but still haven\u2019t caught up with Liverpool. Haaland\u2019s wasteful shooting marked the most shots he has missed in a single game for Man City in all competitions since he joined the club in 2022.\n\nManager Pep Guardiola will be focused on his team winning Tuesday\u2019s match against Brentford at Etihad Stadium. If they win, they will move into second, just one point behind first-place Liverpool and level in games played.\n\nChelsea was excellent in all areas around the pitch and will be happy with a point against a team they haven\u2019t defeated since the 2021 Champions League final. A draw keeps them in 10th place in the league and undefeated in their last three, winning the other two against Aston Villa and Crystal Palace.\n\nThe side will now be focused on Sunday, as they take on Liverpool in the EFL Cup final for a chance to win a trophy amid a turbulent season.\n\nLuton 1, Manchester United 2\n\nManchester United striker Rasmis Hojlund\u2019s two goals helped his team scrape together a 2-1 win over relegation candidates Luton Town at the latter\u2019s home ground, Kenilworth Road.\n\nAlmost seconds into the first half after kickoff, Hojlund intercepted Luton defender Amari\u2019i Bell\u2019s pass back at the halfway line, where the Dane then raced toward the goal and slotted it past goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski to go up 1-0.\n\nMinutes later, Hojlund earned his brace after the ball rebounded off his chest to the far right post from inside the 6-yard box off winger Alejandro Garnacho\u2019s volley.\n\nThe home side didn\u2019t give up its fight and was able to respond in the 14th minute with striker Carlton Morris\u2019 diving header in the penalty box off a fortunate deflection to pull one back\n\nIn the second half, United could\u2019ve put the game to bed, but both Garnacho and Hojilund missed great chances inside the 18-yard box. Luton kept pushing and came mere inches from tying the match, as a corner fell to the head of midfielder Ross Barkley, whose effort hit the crossbar.\n\nThe win makes it four in four games for United, who sits in sixth position \u2013 five points from a Champions League spot \u2014 are unbeaten in 2024. Hojlund now has seven goals in six games and became the youngest Premier League player to score in six straight matches.\n\nThis is the club\u2019s seventh win on the road and second most in the league behind Manchester City and Arsenal (who both have eight). United will return to Old Trafford to face Fulham over the weekend and look to extend their run of wins to five.\n\nLuton Town sits 18th in the league separated by a worse goal difference than Everton at 17th. This marks back-to-back losses for the Hatters, making it their ninth defeat by a one-goal margin this season.\n\nMorris bagged his seventh goal of the season, but couldn\u2019t find an equalizer during the game. Luton travels to Anfield to take on title-contender Liverpool Wednesday before returning home for a fifth-round FA Cup matchup against Manchester City.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 1, Wolverhampton 2\n\nWolves stunned Tottenham in the latter\u2019s top four pursuit of, falling 2-1 at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until minutes before halftime that Wolves found the opener from Pablo Sarabia\u2019s corner kick curling to the head of midfielder Joao Gomes from about eight yards out.\n\nLess than a minute into the second half, Spurs winger Dejan Kulusevski dribbled down the right sideline past defender Craig Dawson, nutmegging goalkeeper Jose Sa to tie it at 1-1.\n\nWolves\u2019 winner came in the 63rd minute on a counter-attack, with winger Pedro Neto pulling back a pass at the byline toward the penalty spot and finding Gomes to score again on a side-foot shot.\n\nThis season, Wolverhampton has beaten the Spurs both times they\u2019ve faced each other, winning at the Molineux Stadium 2-1 and staying in 11th position. They\u2019re now three points away from the seventh spot and have potential European qualification in the club\u2019s sights.\n\nIn their last four games, Wolves have won twice and lost twice and Gomes has scored two goals, both coming against Spurs in the same match.\n\nWolves will return to the Molineux Stadium against bottom-of-the-league Sheffield United.\n\nSpurs manager Ange Postecoglou will be agonizing over not picking up three points to step back into the top four, instead falling to fifth place.\n\nIn the match, Spurs dominated possession with 71%, but failed to achieve much with the ball, as their opponents had higher expected goals and big chances created.\n\nTottenham went into the game in good form, winning seven points from their last nine matches and not losing in the league since a 4-2 loss to Brighton on December 28.\n\nSpurs will get a week off until they return again at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a London Derby matchup against Crystal Palace.\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

Biden met with Israeli-American businessman Haim Saban at his L.A. residence on Tuesday afternoon alongside sports management executive Casey Wasserman. Tickets for the event were available via invite between $3,300 to $250,000, with the option of a photo with the president for roughly $25,000, according to Deadline. The donations will end up in the Biden Victory Fund, a combined fundraising campaign effort run by Biden for President, the Democratic National Committee and the state Democratic parties of all 50 states.\n\nConfirmed attendees include Eric Baker, co-founder of ticketing application StubHub, and John Emerson, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, according to the Los Angeles Times. Biden is making rounds to blue states like California to acquire funding for campaigns in more competitive states. The trip will grant him publicity and financial support, according to Kamy Akhavan, Executive Director of the USC Center for the Political Future.\n\n\u201cJust by showing at a celebrity\u2019s house, Biden will automatically appear in the newspapers.

The re-election bid raised around $130 million in cash by the end of January, according to the DNC. Officials said this is the highest amassed total by a Democratic candidate at this stage of a single campaign.\n\nThe leading Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has not released official fundraising numbers, but Akhavan says Trump and other Republican candidates are also seeking significant fundraising ahead of the November election. \u201cFor Californians who are Republicans, this can be a frustrating state to live in because they know they can\u2019t make big political impact unless they send their money out of state,\u201d said Akhavan. \u201c[Republican candidates] have a very motivated minority of our electorate who wants to influence national politics but can\u2019t because of where they live.\u201d\n\nTrump announced a brand new shoe line on Saturday aimed at raising money and elevating publicity for his campaign.

The POTUS is scheduled to address the public at an event in Culver City Wednesday. The rest of the fundraising campaign will extend out to San Francisco and Los Altos Hills after Biden\u2019s Southern California visit.\n```"}

Hopefully it doesn\u2019t rain,\u201d said Ava Poitras, a junior film and television production major. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy I didn\u2019t even know about it. They need to tell people.\u201d\n\nBefore this year\u2019s upcoming switch to Netflix, the award ceremony had aired on the channels TBS and TNT for over a quarter of a century. The live production will be produced by Silent Hill Productions in partnership with SAG-AFTRA.\n\nTickets for the show aren\u2019t open to the public, according to the SAG Awards website. In previous years, a limited number of seats were reserved for SAG-AFTRA members who could enter a ticket lottery to be given a chance to purchase a ticket to the awards. However, according to SAG, due to the Shrine Auditorium\u2019s reduced capacity as compared to prior venues, tickets are only open to nominees, their guests and select executives.\n\nThe winners of the SAG Awards are determined through two stages. The first stage decides the nominees, through which two committees, one for television and another for film, vote. The committees are comprised of 2,500 randomly selected active SAG-AFTRA members who have not served on either committee in the past eight years, according to the SAG Awards website.\n\nAfter the nominations balloting, final balloting is open to all eligible active SAG-AFTRA members who have until Feb. 23 at noon to cast their vote for the winners.\n\nThe guild\u2019s self-reported highest accolade, the SAG Life Achievement Award for career achievement and humanitarian accomplishment, will be given to Barbara Streisand, according to a SAG press release. Streisand will be the 59th recipient of the coveted award.\n\nUnlike their other categories, the SAG Lifetime Achievement Award is voted on by the SAG-AFTRA National Honors and Tributes Committee and doesn\u2019t follow the traditional voting format above.\n\n\u201cBarbra Streisand is an icon and unparalleled talent, a force of nature who has seamlessly woven her brilliance through the fabric of our industry,\u201d SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a press release from earlier this month.\n\nAmong the media companies represented in the nominees, Warner Bros. Discovery leads the pack getting 20 for its movies and TV with Netflix and Apple trailing behind with 12 and 11 nominations respectively.\n\nThree partially non-English language films were left out of the running for the SAG Awards. The Zone of Interest, Anatomy of a Fall and Past Lives received zero nominations despite the latter two being Oscar-nominated.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the approximately 160,000 person voting body of the SAG Awards tends to be \u201cmore populist and less international\u201d than the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences\u2019 voting body.\n\nThe nominees included Oscar overlaps like Jeffery Wright for American Fiction and Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon, and also surprises such as Willem Dafoe for his performance in Poor Things.\n\nThe full list of nominees is available on the SAG Awards website.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/20/why-developers-were-mad-at-the-game-awards-2023/", "response": "```\nThe Game Awards (TGA), also known as the Oscars of the gaming world, is generally seen as the most grandiose event in the gaming industry. However, last year, the event sparked widespread anger in the gaming community. Many game fans and developers noticed that, during the hours-long ceremony, the time allocated for award-winning game developers to speak was extremely limited.\n\nSpotlight vs Stopwatch Digital Trends and The Escapist highlighted a stark imbalance in the ceremony\u2019s proceedings, noting that acceptance speeches by award winners were brief, with developers often rushed off stage within 30 seconds to make way for lengthy presentations of upcoming games and celebrity-led segments. This stark contrast in airtime allocation, particularly the generous segments devoted to industry figures like Hideo Kojima, sparked significant dissatisfaction among viewers.\n\nThe frustration was palpable across social media platforms, where the phrase \u201cPlease Wrap It Up\u201d became emblematic of the night\u2019s rushed acknowledgments. This sentiment was widely shared among industry professionals and viewers, who felt that the achievements of game developers, especially those behind major titles such as Elden Ring, God of War Ragnarok, and Horizon Forbidden West, were overshadowed by a focus on commercial interests and the anticipation of future releases.\n\nAmidst the ceremony\u2019s commercial focus, moments like Neil Newbon\u2019s emotional win for Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 stood out, though they were cut short. A tweet from freelance journalist Hayley Elise indicated that less than 30 minutes of the three-and-a-half-hour broadcast were dedicated to developers\u2019 speeches for all 32 award categories.\n\nAccording to footage taken by audience members at The Game Awards (TGA) ceremony, when Swen Vincke, CEO of Larian Studios, dressed in armor, took the stage to deliver a speech for winning the Game of the Year award, a teleprompter screen placed in the middle of the audience began a countdown. After the timer ended, a message popped up saying \u201cPlease Wrap It Up.\u201d Under the pressure of the timer, after expressing gratitude to the players and commemorating a deceased colleague, the Larian team hurriedly left the stage amidst a round of enthusiastic applause. Swen Vincke\u2019s actual speech time was less than a minute.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the TGA ceremony, the phrase \u201cPlease Wrap It Up\u201d quickly spread across social media platforms, sparking widespread dissatisfaction. Many users began to voice their support for game developers.\n\nCommunity Outcry\n\nA viral tweet written by Meta employee Javiera Codero expressed anger: \u201cIf I won Game of the Year and was dedicating the award to a member of my team who had died during development and saw the words \u201cPlease wrap it up\u201d I\u2019d be f*king p*ssed\u201d\n\nSubsequently, JC Lau, a producer at ProbablyMonsters, revealed an internal schedule intended for the nominated developers that allotted only 30 seconds for each award-winning developer\u2019s acceptance speech, a decision that prioritized the event\u2019s schedule over meaningful recognition of developers\u2019 achievements.\n\nThe ceremony\u2019s emphasis on commercial value over creative recognition was stark. High-profile presentations, such as Hideo Kojima\u2019s new game \u201cOD\u201d revealed celebrity appearances that lasted for 6 minutes, and Hollywood actors like Simu Liu had solo performance times of over three minutes. This was significantly more time than was given to the award winners.\n\nThis disparity highlighted a growing concern within the community about the event\u2019s direction.\n\nTrailers over Tributes\n\nA large chunk of the TGA ceremony was devoted to playing trailers for new games. These trailers were not shown for free; they were part of paid promotions, with the game companies being charged a substantial fee per second of trailer time.\n\nThe public\u2019s reaction to The Game Awards (TGA) was one of palpable frustration, particularly evident in the gaming community\u2019s online hubs like Reddit. Users voiced their discontent, questioning the event\u2019s priorities and lamenting what they perceived as a disregard for the gaming industry\u2019s creative forces.\n\nThis sentiment was succinctly captured by comedian and writer Mike Drucker, who highlighted the disparity in recognition: \u201cIf you make games, you get 30 seconds to talk at the Game Awards. If you make movies, you get 5 minutes to talk at the Game Awards.\u201d\n\nJosh Sawyer, a producer at Obsidian Entertainment known for creating \u201cPentiment,\u201d expressed his views more bluntly: \u201cThis year\u2019s The Game Awards is an embarrassing indictment of a segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power with little respect for the devs it\u2019s supposedly honoring.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Balance: A Response from TGA\n\nFaced with mounting criticism, Geoff Keighley, the host and organizer of The Game Awards (TGA), offered a somewhat awkward defense on social media: \u201cBy the way - I do agree that the music was played too fast for award winners this year, and I asked our team to relax that rule as the show went on. While no one was actually cut off, it\u2019s something to address going forward.\u201d\n\nIt is important to consider the entertainment value for the live audience attending the event. Managing the expectations and interests of different stakeholders presents a complex challenge. Historical performances at The Game Awards have demonstrated the organizers\u2019 ability to deliver engaging shows for their audience.\n\nHowever, as Geoff Keighley has repeatedly emphasized in many past occasions, his core value for TGA is to make it a \u201cgrand celebration of the medium of video games and the gaming industry.\u201d Yet, by overlooking the creators of video games, the event\u2019s heavy commercial focus evidently detracted from this goal.\n\nWith over 3.6 million people tuning in across platforms, many felt The Game Awards missed a meaningful opportunity to focus its very large stage on developers, their work, and notable accomplishments that advanced the industry over a difficult year.\n\nReflecting on Recognition\n\nWhile flashy new game trailers can undoubtedly drive engagement and hype from fans, more balance was desired between that approach and heartfelt recognition of the talent behind gaming\u2019s current masterpieces.\n\nDespite The Game Awards succeeding in generating hype, it left a lot of passionate fans feeling like the artists and their accomplishments were disrespected in the process.\n\nGiven the feedback from players and industry peers this year, it remains to be seen if next year\u2019s event adjusts to a greater emphasis on celebrating the contributions of game developers within the industry. With the industry facing significant layoffs throughout the year, there was a missed opportunity to spotlight the developers as the stars of the show.\n```"}

The duo planned to address food insecurity, USG funding transparency, divestment and USC\u2019s role in the gentrification of the South Los Angeles community. They also had a staunch anti-Greek life stance.\n\nOne of the tenets of Dacity and Nunis\u2019 platform was that they would be \u201cuncompromisingly anti-Greek life.\u201d Many students believed that position entailed the abolition of Greek life entirely, although this was not outright stated during their campaign.\n\n\u201cSpeaking only for myself, I believe in restorative justice and reform for Greek life,\u201d Dacity, who was campaigning for USG president, said in a Zoom interview Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI want to acknowledge the fact that it\u2019s a racist and sexist institution, and nothing has really changed since the beginning and I stand by everything I said in the debate. You can\u2019t have things like D.E.I in the recruiting aspects of greek life without first acknowledging the aspect that this is a hub of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nDacity cited two key reasons in their decision to drop out: their safety and the backlash they received on social media, like the anonymous app Sidechat.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it for my mental health, but I looked on socials and Sidechat and there were hundreds of people saying the most transphobic things, giving me horrible nicknames or comparing me to things,\u201d said Dacity. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re Los Angeles, so I was just very surprised.\u201d\n\nIn an individual statement posted to the ticket\u2019s Instagram account, Nunis explained the decision to part ways in their campaign efforts.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I cannot endorse the abolition of Greek life, considering its harmful impact on the Divine Nine, Latinx and other communities, particularly amidst heightened LAPD surveillance stemming from recent disaffiliations,\u201d Nunis wrote in the statement.\n\nAnnenberg Media reached out to Nunis for an interview and did not receive a response.\n\nThe duo was able to disband their campaign in time for their names to be removed from the ballot, so students are not able to vote for them anymore. There are three presidential tickets left in the race.\n\nThis election cycle marks the first time that ranked-choice voting is used for both the president and senate elections. USG had to quickly pivot and move all their polling locations inside Tuesday due to the heavy rain.\n\nOriginally, the four polling locations for students were supposed to be: Tommy Trojan (moved to Ronald Tutor Campus Center), Alumni Park (moved to Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs), Pardee Lawn (moved to Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall) and Leavey Library (moved to Wallis Annenberg Hall).\n\n\u201cI think this is a good way for people to start learning about what it\u2019s like to research candidates or to cast a ballot as for a lot of people this might be their first time casting a ballot,\u201d said Alexa Dadson, a freshman majoring in philosophy.\n\nStudents can vote in-person from February 20 to February 23 from the hours of 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Weather permitting, the polling booth location will be moved back to the originally outside locations for the remaining three days of voting.\n\nStudents who show proof they\u2019ve voted can receive a ticket and redeem a treat courtesy of USG. The vendor for Tuesday was supposed to be Fluff Ice, but the rains prevented that from happening. Students can still hold onto their ticket and come back on Wednesday for food from Porto\u2019s Bakery and Thursday for treats from Dazzling Donuts.\n\n\u201cSome people have definitely [come] and been like, \u2018Where\u2019s the food?\u2019\u201d said Isabella Padilla, a junior majoring in biological sciences who manned the RCC polling location Tuesday. \u201cI feel like food is an incentive for people to come vote.\u201d\n\nThe rains and subsequent indoor voting locations may be limiting voter turnout. Last year, only about 20% of undergraduate students turned in a ballot, despite USG efforts to increase civic engagement.\n\nPadilla said the rain has negatively affected voter turnout on Tuesday.\n\nAmara Marrero, a junior majoring in environmental studies, said voting in every USG election is valuable as a part of every student\u2019s tuition is given to the organization.\n\n\u201cYour tuition money is going into this, so you should care about who is getting elected,\u201d said Marrero. \u201cAlthough USG isn\u2019t the dean, they have a lot of power into funding the [recognized student organizations], what they can do in student life ... electing people that you want to clearly represent your ideas, it\u2019s really important to so that there\u2019s no more misconceptions.\u201d```"}

Some, such as USC students Ellaree Colombus and Malaq Ali know Mendler best for her appearance in Disney Channel shows including Good Luck Charlie, Lemonade Mouth and Wizards of Waverly Place.\n\nCOLOMBUS: Good Luck Charlie was like one of my favorite shows. And yeah, hurricane and ready or not was like my vibe and like middle school.\nALI: I watched like Good Luck Charlie and like Lemonade Mouth...

I was doing the application all on my own. I think I like didn\u2019t really understand how it worked.

(Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy Sethan Perez, Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as, and Makena Arteaga\nFebruary 20, 2024, at 6:02 pm PST\n\nIn a place where earthquakes are often met with a shrug, the recent downpours have turned Southern California on its head. From unexpected power outages to endless lines of traffic, we\u2019re witnessing what\u2019s on track to be the wettest February in Los Angeles, according to CNN. Believe it or not, according to Captain Adam Vangerpen with the Los Angeles Fire Department, the heaviest showers are still on the horizon.\n\nVANGERPEN: The largest amount of rain has not yet hit. We are anticipating there to be some heavy rain coming in tonight. So we are in preparation, we are in standby for that. All the cities agencies right now are standing by and we do have our emergency operations center activated, where we have heads of every department who is here at the ready.\n\nSo what steps can drivers take to stay safe in these crazy weather conditions? Vangerpen shared his thoughts on how drivers can approach hitting the roads in the rain.\n\nVANGERPEN: Well, the number one thing is to slow down, make sure that you take preparations for wherever you\u2019re gonna be going. So give yourself some additional time to avoid hydroplaning. We\u2019re also trying to remind people to avoid the canyon areas, the canyon areas can be subject to flash flooding or some debris flows.\n\nYet, as we continue to navigate through these torrential downpours, the rain\u2019s toll on our roads and vehicles has become increasingly apparent. According to the City of LA, it has worked to repair over 4,000 potholes this rain season, turning our commutes into obstacle courses for drivers.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of vehicle maintenance and safety during such times, the American Automobile Association spokesperson Gianella Ghiglino shared her insight on Los Angeles\u2019 pothole crisis.\n\nGHIGLINO: Los Angeles actually has the worst potholes in the nation. So for a lot of drivers here in Southern California, potholes are a concern, and how do potholes get worse? With water and traffic, which is what we are experiencing right now. So first and foremost, it\u2019s so important that drivers are cautious. So the best way to avoid potholes is to drive slowly and be cautious with everything that\u2019s around you.\n\nIn highlighting these dangers, Ghiglino underscores the broader implications of rain on road safety, shedding light on why vigilance is so important.\n\nGHIGLINO: So every year, we\u2019re seeing about 1.2 million traffic crashes happen due to the rain. So those are traffic crashes that could have been prevented, all those crashes could have been prevented those 1.2 million traffic crashes that happened in the rain could have been prevented. So in times like this, it\u2019s so it\u2019s imperative that people really focus on the road and try to be more cautious than ever.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just our cars feeling the strain. The rain is reshaping our daily routines and even our willingness to venture out. USC student Zoe Hosley shared their perspective on how the weather is impacting student life and mobility.\n\nHOSLEY: I definitely think that Californians in general struggle with driving in the rain and I think that like I too get really scared when it\u2019s pouring down heavy and overall everyone just kind of drives a lot slower. And so obviously it\u2019s less efficient to get places and like I know a lot of my friends are less incentivized to go places when it\u2019s like so rainy and I think it\u2019s just like the nature of California.\n\nHosley\u2019s experience echoes a broader sentiment across Southern California. As we brace for more rainfall, the city\u2019s proactive measures, like the extensive pothole repairs, underscore the critical importance of preparedness and adaptability in the face of nature\u2019s forces.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sethan Perez, wishing you safe travels and dry days ahead.\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/02/20/swinging-solo-tiger-woods-departs-from-nike-and-sets-sights-on-new-brand-sun-day-red/", "response": "```\nThirty-one years after making his PGA Tour debut at The Riviera Country Club, Tiger Woods returned to where it all started, but this time for a different kind of debut. Being the host of the 2024 Genesis Invitational, Woods took the tournament as an opportunity to showcase his new clothing brand \u201cSun Day Red.\u201d \u201cI imagine that is all we\u2019re gonna see him wearing from now on,\u201d professional golfer Jordan Spieth said.\n\nThe brand stands on its own under the TaylorMade banner and Woods officially unveiled it last Monday at a press conference. According to TaylorMade CEO David Abeles, the name of the brand follows \u201cthe rule of threes,\u201d with the word \u201cSun\u201d representing the perfect weather for golfing, \u201cDay\u201d because golf can be played any day of the week, and, of course, \u201cRed\u201d being the color that Woods is famously known for wearing on Sundays. Having the zodiac sign of Capricorn, Woods\u2019 mother chose red to be a power color for her son and bring him good luck. With 15 majors under his belt, it is safe to say she made the right choice.\n\nSpeaking of majors, the Sun Day Red logo pays homage to them, as it features a tiger with 15 stripes, one for each major Woods has earned in his career. This new chapter in Woods\u2019 career is more than just a golf brand, as its products are being marketed as both lifestyle and athletic. The line will consist of everything from polos and hats to hoodies and shoes. While the majority of the first releases are meant for men, the brand hopes to soon include products for both women and children.\n\nEven though the brand seems to be more lifestyle-oriented, the brand is definitely keeping athletes in mind when developing its products. \u201cI have learned so much over the years and have a lifetime of experience adjusting my apparel and footwear to help me play better based on the way it was constructed. There are things I could tell you that no one knew I was doing over the years. I\u2019m ready to share those secrets with the world,\u201d Woods said in a news release. \u201cSun Day Red will embody a love of playing and competing, and we are for people that share those values, whether it\u2019s on the course, or in life. We will be anchored to putting the athlete first in the product decisions we make.\u201d\n\nWith a big-time athlete at the helm like Woods, it is safe to say that this line has potential to reach the heights of such beloved sports brands like Jordan. What started as a basketball line, Jordan quickly dominated the sports world and began to expand into other sports like football and soccer. If successful, who\u2019s to say Sun Day Red can\u2019t be more than a golf brand? \u201cTiger\u2019s name is obviously very powerful, not just in the game of golf, but in the sports world and outside of that, everyone knows who Tiger Woods is,\u201d professional golfer Rickie Fowler said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they are starting in the kinda golf space, see how it goes, and what it potentially could be.\u201d\n\nFollowing in Michael Jordan\u2019s footsteps, the brand may even decide to team up with other athletes to broaden its reach. Both NFL quarterback Josh Allen and NBA power forward Blake Griffin expressed their love for Woods and the brand, and said that they would be open to a possible collaboration. Even comedian Will Arnett wants in, saying \u201cI would do anything with that guy, it\u2019s Tiger Woods!\u201d\n\nWhile the creation of Sun Day Red marked a major achievement and milestone in Woods\u2019 historic career, it also marked the death of a successful 27-year partnership with Nike. The two announced the split in early January over social media and thanked each other for all the amazing memories over the years. \u201cEverything sort of has its lifecycle and runs its course,\u201d Nike golfer Rory McIlroy said.\n\nWoods has been with the popular sports clothing brand since the age of 20 and formed a close relationship with the company \u2013 so much so that when other sponsors like AT&T and Gatorade dropped Woods after his 2009 sex scandal, Nike remained loyal and stuck by his side. That decision seemed to pay off, as during his time with the company, Woods not only provided its golf line with a ton of exposure, but, according to Forbes, the relationship between the two was worth about $500 million.\n\nWhile the split between the two may come as a shock to many, the writing on the wall may have come as early as 2016, when Nike announced that it would stop manufacturing golf equipment altogether. It was soon after in 2017 that Woods started working with TaylorMade through a multi-year equipment endorsement. This decision by Nike may have been the first domino to fall that led to Woods\u2019 exit.\n\nAlthough Woods split from Nike, many fans hoped his TW line would continue on in some shape or form. But, Woods killed any chance of hope when he said he\u2019s moved on and does not want the logo back. \u201cIt\u2019s the right time in my life. It\u2019s transitional. I\u2019m not a kid anymore. I want to have a brand I\u2019m proud of going forward. Sun Day Red \u2014 it\u2019s me,\u201d Woods said in a press release.\n\nFor Woods, this new solo venture has unlimited potential and may not only conquer golf, but possible sports in general. Meanwhile, the future of Nike golf remains uncertain and fans of the TW line are left with broken tees and broken hearts. \u201cIt\u2019s probably more a loss for Nike than it is Tiger,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt will take a while to get used to not seeing him in the swoosh.\u201d Sun Day Red launches its first signature line May 1 in the United States and Canada.\n```"}

Drew McIntyre made his entrance first, then came the American Nightmare Cody Rhodes. While this match didn\u2019t have any special stipulations, the brutality in it could have convinced me otherwise. McIntyre seemed to have an answer for everything Rhodes tried, consistently pounding him with punches when he was down. McIntyre also hit Rhodes with devastating DDTs. However, the turning point came when Rhodes hit a suplex from the top rope on McIntyre. He followed this up with some Cody cutters and was ready to do his Cross Rhodes finisher until the Bloodline interfered. Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa distracted Rhodes from the match, and next thing you knew, McIntyre hit his own finisher, the claymore, to get the victory.\n\nChad Gable vs. Ivar (WWE Monday Night Raw, February 19)\n\nChad Gable is simply a beast, but I had forgotten how agile Ivar is for a heavyweight, and this match reminded me. While Gable was the shorter and smaller opponent, Ivar was more crafty. He often used Gable\u2019s momentum against him, throwing him into the ring apron monitor, jumping from the top rope on top of Gable multiple times and hitting kicks that weren\u2019t even part of his regular moveset. On Gable\u2019s side, he tried to suplex Ivar consistently throughout the match to no avail until the momentum shifted enough for him to do so. After the suplex, Gable took to the sky with a moonsault. Following that, he locked Ivar in an ankle lock submission hold, which earned him the win after Ivar tapped out.\n\nJey Uso vs. Gunther (WWE Monday Night Raw, February 19)\n\nBrutal matches must have been the theme for Monday, because the battle for the Intercontinental Championship between Jey Uso and Gunther was chaotic. Gunther is known for delivering some of the most sinister chest chops, and at one point it was too many to count. Jey\u2019s chest was red, but he still didn\u2019t slow down enough to lose. He gave some slaps of his own and got his momentum going with several spears and a splash. Just when it seemed Jey was ready to win, in came his brother Jimmy Uso and cousin Solo Sikoa to interrupt. In a similar fashion to the Rhodes match at the beginning of the night, the two Bloodline members cost Jey Uso the match. Jey tried to hit another splash from the top rope, but Gunther put his knees up to reverse it and get the 1, 2, 3. After the match, the Bloodline stayed to attack Jey until Rhodes came to his aid. While I would have liked Jey to win, it seems he has bigger fish to fry in the future.\n\nWhat was an amazing night turned even more amazing when CM Punk came out to address the crowd after the show went off the air. Even though he\u2019s injured right now, it was still great to see him live. The only thing missing from this show was Seth Rollins, but I\u2019ll see him next time.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\n\nBy Nathan Silva\nFebruary 20, 2024 at 1:13 pm PST\n\nDuring the Super Bowl LVIII, Beyonc\u00e9 partnered with Verizon to announce the drop of new music. After the Verizon commercial premiered, two singles titled \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em\u201d and \u201c16 Carriages\u201d were released. On an Instagram post at the same time, she announced her currently unnamed eighth studio album which will be \u201cAct ii\u201d and released on March 29.\n\n\u201cAct ii\u201d follows the commercial success of \u201cAct i: Renaissance,\u201d a house pop-inspired album crafted by Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Black artists Beam, Grace Jones and Tems. The album pays homage to Black and queer trailblazers within the genre of disco and house music. It celebrates themes of uniqueness, self-love and empowerment while embracing community.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's album pays tribute to her gay cousin \u201cUncle Johnny,\u201d who introduced her to the Black dance music and ball scene. He died during the AIDS epidemic, prompting Beyonc\u00e9 to release her documentary film, \u201cRenaissance: A Film By Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d on World AIDS Day, Dec. 1.\n\nThe album has been noted for its reclamation and celebration of unrecognized Black artists within dance music. Many of the songs on the album have used sampled sound recordings from unrecognized to well-known Black artists within the genre such as The Clark Sisters, Kevin Aviance, Kelis and Donna Summer.\n\n\u201cAct i\u201d was a wide success and was named best album of the year by publications like the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times. It pushed Beyonc\u00e9 to become the most-awarded artist in Grammys history.\n\nA booklet that accompanied the vinyl record for \u201cAct i\u201d included a note from Beyonce that said the project would be divided into three acts, which were recorded and produced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile Beyonc\u00e9 has yet to release a country-inspired album, this isn\u2019t her first rodeo producing a country track. On her sixth studio album, \u201cLemonade,\u201d a song titled \u201cDaddy Lessons\u201d had country-infused beats. It was about Beyonc\u00e9's upbringing in Houston as a young girl navigating life with the support of her father, Matthew Knowles.\n\nWhen the song was released, Slate music critic Carl Wilson said the song could be the country song of the year, comparing it to Nashville-esque ballads by Dolly Parton or Tom T. Hall.\n\nThe Houston native returned to her Texan roots with her new songs \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em\u201d and \u201c16 Carriages.\u201d Within the first week, Beyonc\u00e9 occupied all positions in the Top 5 on iTunes in the U.S.. The songs occupying those positions are the four versions of \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em,\u201d which are explicit, clean, acapella and instrumental, and \u201c16 Carriages.\u201d\n\nQueen Bey continues to explore the musical map, spanning multiple genres like R&B, pop, house, dance, hip-hop, trap, soul and now, country. The musical and vocal abilities of Beyonc\u00e9 range far and wide, making more room and shedding light on Black artists within these genres and beyond.\n\nHer impact is immense and spans through the artist\u2019s nearly three-decade-long music career.\n\nRhiannon Giddens, a multiracial descendant of African American tribes, played the banjo and viola for \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em.\u201d Giddens advocates for the reclamation of Black instruments within genres inspired by Black artists in American roots music such as bluegrass, folk and soul. After all, the banjo was introduced to America through the African slave trade.\n\nSucceeding the release of \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em,\u201d Black country artists like Adia Victoria, Mickey Guyton and Rissi Palmer began to trend across social media platforms.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize where music comes from, embrace it, and share it with others, and Beyonc\u00e9 highlights Black trailblazers, as seen in \u201cAct i,\u201d while making space for new Black artists.\n\nBlack artists are no strangers to reentering a space and reclaiming it as their own. Ray Charles was an innovator of soul music in the 1950s, as he contributed to the growth of what country music looks like now. In 1962, Charles released an album titled \u201cModern Sounds in Country and Western Music,\u201d which was his first album to top the Billboard 200. In 2021, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nLike Beyonc\u00e9, Charles wasn\u2019t a stranger to being musically adept across multiple genres including jazz, rock and roll, soul and R&B.\n\nWith the success of her previous album and the first two singles, the success of her upcoming album looks hopeful. However, the album has already sparked controversy. Some critics believe a pop artist shouldn\u2019t be performing or creating country music. This rhetoric continues and could impact the commercial success of Act ii.\n\nFollowing the release of both singles, they were sent to 150 country radio stations and only 8 stations played only one out of the two songs, \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em.\u201d On Feb. 12, a listener requested for an Oklahoma radio station, KYKC, to play \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em\u201d and received a reply from the station\u2019s general manager, Roger Harris, saying, \u201cWe do not play Beyonc\u00e9 on KYKC as we are a country music station.\u201d\n\nAfter facing racism and boycott accusations, a representative of the parent company of KYKC, S.C.O.R.E., said that they love Beyonc\u00e9 and weren\u2019t going to immediately play her just because the song just came out. Along with the statement, the song was added to the radio station rotation.\n\nFollowing the viral response on social media, CMT, also known as Country Music Television, added \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em\u201d to its streaming stations. Columbia Records, which works alongside Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Parkwood Entertainment, has also sent the song to country radio stations. Billboard mentioned that country stations typically don\u2019t play songs supported by the two labels.\n\nBlack artists deserve a spotlight within country music despite their musical credibility. With existing Black trailblazers in country music today like Darius Rucker and Jimmie Allen, it\u2019s important to recognize their efforts and promote their artistry so Black artists can thrive more in the country genre and any other musical space.\n\nDespite the backlash, the Beyhive has proven their support for Beyonc\u00e9 regardless of her musical endeavors. While it is currently unknown if the following two acts will also be referred to as \u201cRenaissance,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 and the musical renaissances of other Black artists showcase efforts to revive and surpass the ideas and accomplishments of musicality as we know it.\n```"}

The special edition returns to share thoughts on figure skating raising the minimum age for competing in senior competitions. Expand Gold medalist Mao Shimada of Japan is one of many junior skaters impacted by the rule changes made by the International Skating Union.\n\nBy Valerie Fang February 20, 2024 at 11:52 am PST\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. Welcome back to another special edition of \u201cIn the Loop\u201d, where the column answers a reader\u2019s question. After Kamila Valieva\u2019s doping scandal at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the International Skating Union (ISU) decided to raise the minimum age for competing in senior competitions from 15 to 17 years old. The minimum age has become 16 years old for this season and will continue increasing by one year to reach 17 years old for the upcoming 2024-25 season, just in time for the next Winter Olympics in Milan.\n\nQ: Following what transpired with Valieva, there was a committed push to age restrictions for skaters, which seem to be governance that could help some athletes, but also hinder others. Do you believe this measure is a temporary consideration for the sport, or a true future governance that will remain in place and become the norm as something that does stick for future generations of athletes who will have to measure the months of their ages to get the opportunity to compete?\n\nA: I believe this rule change is intended to be permanent and have a lasting impact on the sport. This measure was passed by the ISU Congress with overwhelming support, so I can\u2019t help but think this decision was a long time in the making. What happened with Kamila Valieva at the Beijing Winter Olympics was the perfect opportunity for the ISU officials to finally act on it. I completely agree with the idea that while raising the minimum age is helpful for some figure skaters, it also gives others and their fans frustrations.\n\nMy favorite junior skater is Mao Shimada. Personally, I think she is on the track to become another legend in the sport and definitely surpass her namesake senpai. Before the rule change, I was very much looking forward to seeing her at Milan 2026. But, obviously, this will not happen anymore, since she will be about four months away from turning 17 years old by the start date of that season. I know some skaters have already expressed disappointment regarding the delay in joining senior competitions. And at least for me, there will be some mixed feelings about missing the big showdown between Shimada and Shin Ji-a of South Korea at the next Winter Olympics.\n\nI thought a bit about how this measure can mean different things for different groups of skaters (on the premise of Russia\u2019s return by 2026 and only focusing on women\u2019s single events). In a sense, this is good news for some adult skaters. In a previous article, I mentioned how, in a way, junior competitions are more \u201cexciting\u201d to watch than senior ones because many junior skaters are attempting more challenging jumps. Shimada is now able to consistently land triple axel and quadruple toe loop, elements that few current adult skaters can master. Maybe delaying the entry of younger skaters is giving the current seniors just a few more years to dominate the rink. For the juniors, the challenge would be, as always, to get through growth spurts as they transition into senior events. The increased minimum age might have hindered them from getting those competition experiences, but they could use the extra time to better prepare for senior debuts.\n\nThe situation is perhaps most complicated for the Russians. Another reader messaged me that it would be interesting to see if Tutberidze could keep producing champions when the minimum age eventually reaches the \u201cEteri Expiration Date.\u201d Will she adjust her coaching methods to something healthier and more sustainable? At any rate, I still believe the benefits from increasing the minimum age outweigh the disappointments. We can all agree that it can reduce any abuse and exploitation of children athletes, both physically and mentally. I\u2019m glad that now it\u2019s clearer how the distinction between juniors and seniors is marked by differences in not only their techniques, but also their mental and emotional states. So, yeah, I think this new protection for adolescent athletes will stick around, and should stick around.\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Charlotta Bass Journalism and Justice Lab)\n\nBy Taylor Marie Contarino February 20, 2024 at 10:19 am PST\n\nIssa Rae, actress, writer and all-around entertainment creative, announced on January 18 that season two of her television series \u201cRap Sh!t\u201d would be its final season following its cancellation. On Jan. 29, Rae told Net-A-Porter: \u201cYou\u2019re seeing so many Black shows get canceled, you\u2019re seeing so many executives \u2013 especially on the DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] side \u2013 get canned. You\u2019re seeing very clearly now that our stories are less of a priority,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRap Sh!t\u2019s\u201d cancellation came as a surprise to many who\u2019ve been awaiting the announcement of season 3. Even KaMillion took to social media to voice her disappointment on the cancellation in a video she uploaded to X. \u201cI love this show and I am so proud of the work we\u2019ve done. We created something fun, raw, and original and we did it our way! I will forever be grateful to Issa, our incredible cast, the amazing writers and crew that made this show possible. And so grateful to Max for giving us the chance to bring \u2018Rap Sh!t\u2019 to the screen,\u201d said Syreeta Singleton to Variety.\n\n\u201cRap Sh!t\u201d wasn\u2019t just a fun, intriguing television show - the show shed light on some of the music industry\u2019s most \u201chush hush\u201d elements, from toxic masculinity to nepotism. In addition to highlighting such items, the show also gave more representation to Black women, making them the centerfold and the proponents of a \u201crags to riches\u201d story that was both exciting and suspenseful to follow.\n\nAnother thematic aspect of \u201cRap Sh!t\u201d was the multi-faceted representation it offered to women in rap: \u201cWhat I appreciated was the variety of mentalities that the women characters brought to the game of rap. Shawna considers rap an artform and a craft to cultivate and express her opinions on Black female identity and hip-hop consciousness. Mia embodies the free-spirited, fun and financial side of rap, seeing it predominantly as a come-up to get rich and an outlet to express her sexuality,\u201d said Deborah Jane Burke, a creative filmmaker, actress, musician, and graduate of Stanford University.\n\n\u201cRap Sh!t\u201d starred lead actresses Aida Osman and KaMillion, who played a pair of high school friends who reunited to make a rap group. The show was created by Rae alongside showrunner Syreeta Singleton, under Hoorae media, Rae\u2019s entertainment company. It first aired its first season in 2022, with its second season following in 2023: its second season was paused due to the SAG-AFTRA Strike.\n\nRepresentation\n\nWhen it comes to representation, the show offered a safe space for Black women in the music industry. \u201cAs a Black woman, I believe the representation displayed in the show was most important to me. Very few shows feature a majority black cast, especially on a prominent platform such as Max. I felt seen and that my culture and life was accurately portrayed through the screen,\u201d said Nya Hearn, a publicity rep at Universal Music Group.\n\nThe television show also did something that mainstream media doesn\u2019t always do - it gave representation to a new body type - women with \u201cnormal\u2019' bodies. Oftentimes in the mainstream media, only one beauty standard is perpetuated - actress Aida Osman represents beautiful, \u201cnormal\u201d bodies that society may deem as \u201caverage,\u201d giving a space to women all around the world who might feel from the lack of representation in the media.\n\n\u201cI loved that the show featured two Black female artists from Miami! Since the show revolved around the music industry, featured South Florida, which is where I\u2019m from, and had two black female leads, I believed I could relate greatly to Shawna and Mia,\u201d said Hearn.\n\nIn the show, KaMillion played Mia, and Aida Osman played Shawna, former high school friends from Miami who reunited and started their rap music careers together under the name Shawna & Mia. For viewers, \u201cRap Sh!t\u201d offers an array of relatable characters to resonate with - and even some not-so relatable characters. Reigna Reign, for example, is a white female rapper in the show whose character was there to highlight appropriation, drawing on prejudices and misconceptions that people may have about female rappers.\n\nDeborah Jane Burke, a filmmaker and graduate of Stanford University, found herself liking the character, Mia: \u201cThere is something very endearing about Mia. Perhaps it is her commitment to her daughter, her sincerity, desperation or her honesty. Whatever it is, and even though she is very rough around the edges, it feels like she is always coming from a place of truth. So, she is loveable,\u201d said Burke.\n\nBackground on \u201cRap Sh!t\u201d\n\n\u201cRap Sh!t\u201d is about more than just the music industry. The show offers representation to the perspective of women in rap - highlighting different factors like body positivity, a respect for lyricism, oversexualization, colorism, attention from the male gaze, and even perception. Loosely, the show is actually based on the careers of the City Girls, a duo composed of JT and Yung Miami, who actually served as co-executive producers of the show.\n\nIssa Rae is the creator of the series. Other producers included Montrel McKay, Jonathan Berry, Dave Becky, and Jim Kleverweis. Co-executive producers included Yung Miami and JT, along with Kevin \u201cCoach K\u201d Lee, Pierre \u201cP\u201d Thomas, Sara Rastogi, and Jax Clark.\n\nRae graduated from Stanford in 2007. She first gained attention for her Youtube series, \u201cAwkward Black Girl,\u201d Rae is known for her hit television show \u201cInsecure\u201d and she recently starred as President Barbie in Barbie (2023).\n\nThe show is known for its high-energy and animated cast, as well as its playlist and soundtrack that actually earned Guild of Music Supervisors Award nomination for the original track \u201cSeduce & Scheme\u201d by Shawna & Mia, which was created by Raedio, Issa Rae\u2019s music supervision arm of her media company.\n\n\u201cSince I want to pursue a career in the music industry, I really loved that this show examined the ins and outs of it and highlighted important issues such as artist-manager conflicts and label contracts,\u201d said Hearn.\n\nRae\u2019s entertainment company, Hoorae Media, looks to continue its entertainment legacy with endeavors including its music supervision/audio-centered arm, Raedio, and its management arm, Color Creative, which was founded by Issa Rae and Deniese Davis.\n\nThe entertainment mogul has been making multi-faceted moves across industries, most recently dropping her own prosecco brand, Viarae. In an interview with Net-A-Porter, Rae revealed, amidst this frustrating entertainment industry climate, that her expectations and ambitions for herself and her career extend far beyond Hollywood.\n\n\u201cI want, in 10 years\u2019 time, to be transitioning towards service,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is fun,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at some point, it\u2019ll feel like not enough \u2013 and I want to be able to do more.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/19/5-mlb-teams-close-to-the-world-series/", "response": "```\n5 MLB teams close to the World Series\n\nThese teams have quality pieces, but lack key factors that would otherwise make them true title challengers.\n\nToronto Blue Jays' Vladimir Guerrero Jr. reacts after being picked off second base during the fifth inning of Game 2 of an AL wild-card baseball playoff series against the Minnesota Twins Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2023, in Minneapolis. (AP/Bruce Kluckhohn)\n\nBy Matt Kim February 19, 2024 at 9:37 pm PST\n\nPlenty of teams have championship aspirations for the 2024 season, but not all of them have the depth and talent to propel them to an October push. Whether they\u2019re missing hitting or a rotation-anchoring ace, these teams will find success throughout 2024 but will ultimately miss out on a World Series title.\n\n#1: Toronto Blue Jays\n\nThe Blue Jays have had talented rosters in years past but always seem to fizzle out down the stretch. They\u2019ve clinched a wild card berth in three out of the past 4 seasons, but haven\u2019t won the division outright thanks to a powerhouse American League East. Toronto is home to household names including Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette. Guerrero Jr. is the heart of the Blue Jays offense but took a big step in the wrong direction in 2023 after a runner-up MVP season in 2021. After leading the American League in home runs, runs and OPS in 2021, his 2023 season looked like a shell of his former self. He only slugged 26 home runs with a .788 OPS as a first baseman. Although defense isn\u2019t as valuable a commodity at first, his -13 outs above average (OAA), which indicates his fielding range and runs saved, suggested he was a defensive liability. With Guerrero struggling, shortstop Bo Bichette picked up some of the slack, posting a near-5 wins-above-replacement (WAR) season. Bichette has cemented himself atop the Blue Jays lineup with his consistent contact and ability to get on base. His defense has plenty of room for improvement, but his bat makes up for his shortcomings on the diamond. The rest of the roster consists of a good mix of veterans like George Springer, Kevin Kiermaier and Kevin Gausman. All three have been mainstays in MLB for years now, specifically Gausman, who finished top-10 in Cy Young voting for the past three seasons. The postseason struggles that have haunted Toronto weren\u2019t due to lackluster teams, but rather a lack of clutch hitting. When you look at the Blue Jays offense, they were a top 10 team in notable offensive metrics but they couldn\u2019t drive in runs when it mattered most. They ranked 20th of all MLB clubs with runners in scoring position (RISP). Most concerningly, their power evaporated with RISP as they only slugged 34 home runs. For context, the Colorado Rockies, who finished dead last in the National League West, posted with the same number. They also hit into the third-most double plays in MLB with 49. Matt Chapman and Brandon Belt\u2014both key contributors in 2023\u2014seemingly have one foot out the door as free agency progresses. Guerrero Jr. is expected to rebound after a down year as his batted ball profile suggests he was still elite, but the Blue Jays have experienced a net loss in talent heading into 2024. Their only major free agent signing was a one-year, $13 million deal for a 39-year-old Justin Turner. The Blue Jays still have most of their key pieces and are expected to be a playoff team, but a lineup unable to consistently bat runners in will hinder them in 2024.\n\n#2: Tampa Bay Rays\n\nThe Rays have also been a steady force in the AL East, having not missed the playoffs since 2019 and falling just short of a World Series victory in 2020 to the Dodgers. They\u2019ve been a successful ball club in a highly competitive division but have been marred by postseason shortcomings. Not many teams can say they\u2019ve consistently made the playoffs with a bottom-10 payroll. Instead of chasing big free agent names, they develop their minor league prospects and trade for low-risk, high-reward players. Yandy Diaz, Randy Arozarena, Brandon Lowe and Isaac Paredes were all either prospects in the Rays farm system or traded for in less-noteworthy deals. Diaz and Arozarena were both acquired through trades that didn\u2019t exactly shock the baseball world. The Rays acquired Diaz from the Guardians in a three-team deal and was thought of more as a filler piece than an MLB-ready player. Arozarena was traded from the Cardinals alongside 1B Jose Martinez for prospects LHP Matthew Liberatore and C Edgardo Rodriguez. No one in that transaction has made significant contributions at the MLB level besides Arozarena. Diaz has been an on-base machine for the Rays, posting five consecutive seasons with a .340 OBP or better. In those five seasons, three of them had him above the .400 mark, showcasing his incredible eye and plate discipline. Arozarena on the other hand, has demonstrated an uncommon blend of power and speed, posting three consecutive 20-home run, 20-stolen base campaigns and served as the driving force behind the Rays\u2019 World Series push. But their starting rotation leaves something to be desired. They\u2019ve been plagued with injuries, as LHPs Shane McClanahan and Jeffrey Springs, alongside RHP Drew Rasmussen, have all undergone procedures to repair torn elbow ligaments. Rasmussen and Springs both started the 2023 season strongly and looked to be the future of the rotation but injuries will have them both out until at least the All-Star break in 2024. McClanahan recently finished in the top-10 of Cy Young voting in 2021 and is the ace of the Rays rotation, but he will miss the entirety of the 2024 season recovering from Tommy John surgery. Outside of RHP Zach Eflin, who knows who will fill the rest of the rotation. The Rays always manage to exceed expectations, as their talent development is second to none, but this hole may be too steep amidst a heated AL East featuring the Orioles and Yankees making blockbuster moves this offseason. Top prospect Junior Caminero is expected to make his debut in 2024, but it\u2019s unlikely that he can fully replace Wander Franco, who\u2019s battling legal trouble and may never play MLB baseball again.\n\n#3: Seattle Mariners\n\nUntil 2022, the Mariners hadn\u2019t won a playoff game since 2001. They\u2019ve since formed a new identity centered around CF Julio Rodriguez and possess a stellar starting rotation. But general manager Jerry Dipoto has shaken up the roster considerably after the Mariners narrowly missed out on the 2023 playoffs. He acquired 2B Jorge Polanco from the Twins to fill the gap at second base and also acquired INF Luke Raley from the Rays for another left-handed bat. Although they parted ways with 3B Eugenio Suarez, OF Jarred Kelenic and LHP Robbie Ray, their roster looks marginally better heading into 2024. The rotation\u2014consisting of Luis Castillo, George Kirby, Logan Gilbert, Bryce Miller and Bryan Woo\u2014 is one of baseball\u2019s best. Castillo, Kirby and Gilbert have all produced quality results at the MLB level, specifically Castillo, who sports a career 3.5 ERA in over 1,000 innings. Kirby and Gilbert are both only 26 years old, but appear to have the stuff and mentality of MLB veterans. The Mariners also reunited with OF Mitch Haniger, who was a part of the Robbie Ray deal with the Giants. In five years with the Mariners, Haniger mashed 107 home runs while missing time due to injury. He\u2019ll add some much needed power to a lineup that also saw OF Teoscar Hernandez leave in free agency. The roster looks enticing on paper, but some concerns regarding the infield may arise as the M\u2019s hope to make it back to the postseason. First baseman Ty France endured a down 2023 that saw him hit for a paltry .703 OPS. France has been working to improve his power, as his journey with Driveline, a player development facility this offseason has highlighted an increase in exit velocity and contact quality. But France also doesn\u2019t provide much defensive versatility and isn\u2019t a threat on the bases, so he needs power to justify his spot in the lineup. If he doesn\u2019t return to form in 2024, the Mariners may have to look elsewhere for offensive production. With Eugenio Suarez out at third base, the Mariners will turn to a mix of Josh Rojas and Luis Urias. Rojas, who was acquired from the Diamondbacks during last summer\u2019s trade deadline, impressed after a rough start with the D-Backs. Rojas won\u2019t hit 20-plus home runs in a season, but he\u2019s found success with his gap-to-gap power as he combined for 57 doubles between 2022 and 2023. Outside of a productive 2021 season, Urias has struggled to find consistency in the big leagues and was thus non-tendered by the Red Sox following the 2023 season. Shortstop J.P. Crawford had a revelation with the bat in 2023 as he hit 19 home runs compared to his previous season-high of nine. While his offense took a leap in the right direction, the question of whether that\u2019s repeatable ties into the expectations for 2024. The Mariners will be in the thick of the playoff hunt but the lack of a true star on the infield might prevent a deep October run. Jerry Dipoto might not be done with his offseason additions, but as it stands, the Mariners aren\u2019t quite there yet to be a true title contender.\n\n#4: Philadelphia Phillies\n\nSeeing the Phillies on this list might be surprising considering their 2022 trip to the Fall Classic and an NLCS appearance in 2023. Their roster is loaded with star power, from Bryce Harper and Trea Turner, to Zach Wheeler and Aaron Nola. They won 92 games in 2023 and finished second behind the Braves in the NL East. But the problem isn\u2019t so much about their roster as much as the Phillies\u2019 ability to compete in a top-heavy national league. The Phillies started off slow in 2023 due to the newly-signed Turner\u2019s early struggles, Harper recovering from Tommy John surgery and JT Realmuto just having a down season overall. But when Turner\u2014whom Phillies fans rallied around\u2014returned to form and Harper returned from injury, the Phillies turned their season around. Realmuto is one of a few five-tool, do-it-all catchers, but last season saw all of his numbers head in the wrong direction. He posted a .762 OPS, his lowest mark since his rookie season in 2015. Analysts regard Realmuto as one of the premier defensive catchers in baseball, but his defensive metrics plummeted last season as well. Framing runs measures how well catchers can make borderline pitches look like strikes, which is valuable in preventing baserunners. Anything above 0 is above average and anything below is below average. Realmuto\u2019s 2021 mark of 8.6 framing runs was elite, and in 2022, although it dropped to 1.1, it was still above average. Last year, that figure dropped all the way to minus-12.2\u2014the bottom of qualified catchers in baseball. If Realmuto continues to trend in the wrong direction on both sides of the ball, it won\u2019t only slow down the Phillies offense, but will negatively impact his management of the pitching staff. With the departure of Rhys Hoskins and potential elbow concerns with Harper post-Tommy John, the former National has now moved to first base full-time. While Harper is one of the best hitters in baseball and showed he can handle the position, the question of who takes over for him in the outfield should concern fans. Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos have cemented their roles as fearsome sluggers in the heart of the Phillies lineup, and while they can certainly hit, they are atrocious in the outfield grass, simply put. Schwarber has never been known for his defense\u2014he was originally a catcher but moved to left field just to keep his bat in the lineup. Last season saw him post a negative-21 defensive runs saved (DRS) and a negative-19 outs above average (OAA). Those figures led to him being one of the worst defensive left fielders in baseball. While the Phillies can deploy him at DH, they\u2019ll have to rotate him into the field throughout the season. With Harper at first, Castellanos will be expected to play more right field as the Phillies can\u2019t have Schwarber and Castellanos both DH. While it wasn\u2019t as horrific as Schwarber\u2019s, his negative-9 DRS -7 OAA were both well-below average. While the Phillies pitching staff was efficient in preventing runs, they don\u2019t match up well with the powerhouses of the National League. The Dodgers and Braves are teams with virtually no holes on their roster that\u2019ll be a challenge for this rotation, especially after Zach Wheeler and Aaron Nola have already pitched; the Phillies bullpen just isn\u2019t as deep.\n\n#5: Milwaukee Brewers\n\nThe Brewers have dominated a relatively weak NL Central in past years, winning three division titles since 2018 and only missing the playoffs once in that span. The Brewers have been headed by strong starting rotations but 2024 is the first time in years that the rotation is the biggest question mark. One of the biggest moves of the offseason was the Brewers shipping three-time All-Star and Cy Young award-winner Corbin Burnes to the Orioles for a package of prospects. Burnes had had a three year stretch from 2021 to 2023 that featured a league best 2.43 ERA in 2021 and a league-leading 243 strikeouts in 2022. 2023 was a bit of a down year in his standards but he still posted an above average 3.39 ERA and finished in the top 10 of Cy Young voting. The Brewers also non-tendered Brandon Woodruff as he\u2019s expected to miss the entire 2024 season after shoulder surgery. The Brewers opted to let him walk instead of paying him for 2024 as he\u2019d be a free agent at the season\u2019s end anyway. Woodruff was close behind Burnes when it came to his success, as his career 3.1 ERA over 680 innings played a pivotal role for the Brewers. That leaves Freddy Peralta and a mix of DL Hall\u2014who was a top prospect acquired in the Burnes trade\u2014Aaron Ashby, Wade Miley and newly-signed Jakob Junis for the rotation. Peralta has been a mainstay in the rotation for the Brewers but injuries have limited his contributions. While this rotation could find success in 2024, there will be growing pains and constant tinkering as they replace the one-two punch of Burnes and Woodruff. The Brewers offense has plenty of young talent, including top OF prospect Jackson Chourio, who\u2019s expected to make his MLB debut in 2024. William Contreras, the younger brother of catcher Willson Contreras, broke out in 2023 after being traded from the Braves. He posted an .824 OPS as a catcher and his defense, which was seen as a liability in Atlanta, turned into his core asset. He accumulated 14.4 framing runs and 5 DRS, making him one of the best catchers in baseball. Their lineup still has 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich and power hitting SS Willy Adames. Although both have regressed offensively, they\u2019re still above average hitters, especially Yelich who posted an OPS above .800 for the first time since his MVP season. While the NL Central remains one of the weaker divisions in baseball, the Brewers will find ways to stay competitive and develop their pitching staff. Their bullpen, headed by star closer Devin Williams, will win them plenty of close contests and a trip to the postseason could be within reach. However, Milwaukee hasn\u2019t reached the World Series in any of their numerous postseason berths and this roster in particular is one of their weaker ones in recent memory. They\u2019ll compete until the final days of the season and potentially sneak in but they\u2019re far from contending for a championship.\n```"}

(AP/Tony Gutierrez)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner February 19, 2024 at 9:18 pm PST\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 The Ducks\u2019 deep prospect pool contains a mix of promising forwards and blueliners, and Olen Zellweger is one up-and-coming player who looks to be a blue-chip defenseman for Anaheim. Zellweger has thrived at every level, and is now on track to be a household Duck sooner rather than later. The Ducks selected the Alberta native early in the second round of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft and he\u2019s only made consistent progress since.\n\nZellweger\u2019s 32 points with Anaheim\u2019s minor-league affiliate, the San Diego Gulls, place him third in the American Hockey League in points for all rookie defensemen. The Ducks called him up for a brief stint toward the end of January and he even tallied an assist in his NHL debut, and he played in four games total before being sent back down to the AHL. His AHL success earned him an invite to the AHL All-Star Classic, where he notched three assists in the Challenge against the league\u2019s best.\n\nZellweger previously played in the Western Hockey League with both the Everett Silvertips and Kamloops Blazers. Last season with both teams, he led all defensemen with 32 goals and was awarded the Bill Hunter Memorial Trophy, given to the WHL\u2019s best defenseman, for the second consecutive time. He was also named Canadian Hockey League\u2014of which the WHL is a part\u2014Defenseman of the Year and was a key contributor for Kamloops\u2019 league title run. He notched 29 points in the WHL Playoffs, which was tied for second in the league.\n\nZellweger also represented Team Canada in the 2022 and 2023 World Junior Championships, winning gold in both tournaments.\n\nZellweger thrives as a two-way defenseman. The 20-year-old skates with sheer confidence and his neutral zone playmaking generates chances for himself and his teammates. He also has a phenomenal shot, and his mobility allows him to make plays anywhere on the ice. At just 5-foot-9, he would have a smaller frame for an NHL defenseman, but if he can continue to create offensive chances while also playing sufficient defense, he still has the potential to be elite at the NHL level.\n\nHis first and only career assist with the Ducks displayed his accurate shooting ability, as he wristed a shot from the point right to Sabres netminder Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, allowing center Sam Carrick to tip in the batted-up puck for the score.\n\nOlen Zellweger records his first NHL point in his debut on an assist to a Sam Carrick goal!\n\nBy acquiring star forward prospect Cutter Gauthier, Anaheim had to part ways with another highly touted prospect: defenseman Jamie Drysdale. Although sending Drysdale away may have seemed detrimental to the Ducks\u2019 blueliner pipeline, Zellweger\u2019s steep upward trajectory should make the front office confident in the team\u2019s defensive future. The Ducks could be in for long-term success at the defenseman position when Zellweger joins Pavel Mintyukov full-time at the NHL level.\n\nZellweger\u2019s hockey sense is exceedingly polished for such a young player, and if his talent, skill and durability can translate to the pros, Anaheim can expect him to be a point-producing, top-four blueliner. Anaheim\u2019s prospect pipeline is one of the league\u2019s deepest. Had the Gauthier trade never happened, Drysdale would\u2019ve likely been the headlining defenseman prospect for the Ducks, but now, Zellweger has the open stage. His path to the NHL will be as clear as day if he can continue playing at this elite level.\n```"}

Expand Kansas is one of most volatile teams in men's basketball. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Garett Fisbeck)\n\nBy Terence Holton February 19, 2024 at 3:51 pm PST\n\nSelection Sunday is a month away, and while excitement grows every day, the following teams have been slowly dropping down the boards. These teams may be ranked and projected to make deep runs into March Madness, but there\u2019s a good chance they will be first- or second-round exits.\n\nThe Losers from Lawrence\nLet me make things very clear; Kansas is one of the greatest basketball programs of all time and head coach Bill Self will become a hall of famer... But Kansas has been too inconsistent for a rational person to bet on this year. That inconsistency has been showcased on a national stage. Nearly three weeks ago Kansas throttled No. 3 Houston 78-65 in Lawrence, yet this week the Jayhawks lost by 29 to now-No. 23 Texas Tech. Inconsistency is a recipe for disaster come the month of March. It means a team could beat a No. 1 seed, but also could fall to a No. 14 seed. Kansas has the tools to be great with players such as graduate senior guard Kevin McCullar Jr. and senior center Hunter Dickinson, who are both averaging about 19 points per game. However, they are incredibly thin on talent across the board. The Jayhawks run only about seven guys a game and the scoring practically only comes from McCullar Jr. and Dickinson. If one of these two disappears on the big stage, there is practically no one else to add scoring for Kansas.\n\nPrediction: While it is possible that the Jayhawks make a deep run, it is much more likely that Kansas is upset by someone like Yale or Eastern Washington.\n\nGamecocks losing grasp\nSouth Carolina quickly climbed up to No. 11 in the country after being 9-2 in conference play entering this week with wins over Kentucky and Tennessee. However, this past week has been atrocious for South Carolina. First, the Gamecocks were slaughtered by Auburn, losing 101-61 (apparently both the USC\u2019s like losing by more than 30), then they dropped a game to a less than mediocre LSU squad. Earlier this season, the Gamecocks also narrowly escaped the likes of Charleston Southern, East Carolina, Grand Canyon and, arguably the worst team in college basketball, DePaul. I realize discussing games from November and December that South Carolina barely won is redundant, as they are a completely different team; however, this past week shows the Gamecocks have some big holes on their team that could be exploited.\n\nPrediction: Unlike Kansas, they do not have the potential to win a championship, so the Gamecocks will likely lose in the first round come March.\n\nSaint Mary\u2019s sorrows\nThe Gaels are No. 18 in the country, and there is no good explanation why. While Saint Mary\u2019s has some wins over decent Mountain West teams who deserve some praise, the Gaels do not have a single win over a Power Six team. Saint Mary\u2019s plays in what can best be described as a cupcake conference \u2014 the West Coast Conference \u2014 which is usually dominated by Gonzaga, but the Bulldogs are a shell of their former selves, so who have the Gaels beaten to deserve a high ranking? No one is the simple answer. Realistically, unranked Gonzaga is Saint Mary\u2019s best win, which is pathetic.\n\nPrediction: The Gaels are a well-coached team, but since they have quite literally played no one good the entire season, they will likely bow out of the tournament early.\n\nAll three of these teams have promise, but a whole lot of problems and will likely disappoint fans and bettors alike.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Joel Robles\nFebruary 19, 2024 at 2:41 pm PST\n\nAfter going 34-23-1 overall and 17-13 in conference play last year, USC baseball started its new season in the three-game MLB Desert Invitational in Arizona. This three-day series served as an opportunity for players to compete on diamonds that they may call home down the road, with the games at Major League Baseball spring training stadiums Sloan Park and Salt River Fields. The Trojans could not capitalize on the opportunity of playing on MLB.tv and MLB Network, going winless in three games across the weekend.\n\nUSC\u2019s Friday night matchup against BYU was just the first of a disappointing set of games, as the Cougars took the first game of the season with a final score of 8-1. The last time the Trojans were held to one run was on April 30 of last season at Washington. Junior pitcher Caden Aoki started the game and tossed five innings, recording six strikeouts, three walks, and three earned runs. Aoki led the Pac-12 in ERA last season (2.98) and was an All-Pac-12 selection, but could not find his way on the mound against BYU.\n\nA three-run second inning and a four-run sixth inning helped BYU rally, while the USC batters managed to only record three hits and left nine on base. Senior infielder Ryan Jackson recorded the only RBI for the Trojans with a fifth-inning sacrifice fly.\n\nHead coach Andy Stankiewicz said this wasn\u2019t the weekend USC hoped for. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play what I like to describe Trojan baseball,\u201d Stankiewicz said in an interview with USC Athletics. \u201cWe came in a little hesitant, not trusting our training. ... I\u2019m a little frustrated obviously, but I know we\u2019re a much better team than what we\u2019ve shown here.\u201d\n\nThe second game also didn\u2019t go according to plan. USC faced Grand Canyon University on Saturday and lost 8-1 once again. Senior pitcher Tyler Stromsborg \u2014 whose 75.2 innings pitched last season led the team \u2014 started and managed to play through four innings, so USC had to use a total of six pitchers against the Lopes. Stromsborg recorded five strikeouts, two walks and three runs, all coming in the opening frame to force the Trojans to dig back from that deficit.\n\nSophomore catcher Jacob Galloway and sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges both recorded two hits while Galloway recorded the only USC RBI of the game off of a fifth-inning home run. Both accounted for the team\u2019s only hits of the night.\n\nAfter being held to one run only once last season, USC has now surpassed that mark two games in. Stankiewicz said playing in a major league park made a difference. \u201cThis is a big yard. We hit some balls, but when we\u2019re playing in a big league ballpark ... those become fly balls to the warning track,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cSome of our guys are trying to be someone they\u2019re not. ... We got to get these young men to understand that it\u2019s not just about offense but playing good defense, baserunning, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe last game was not much different from the first two. The Trojans lost to the Ohio State Buckeyes Sunday afternoon 5-2. At this same point last season, USC baseball was 3-0 to start, as opposed to now 0-3. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Eric Hammond started and tossed four innings, managing four strikeouts, two walks, and three earned runs.\n\nUSC was the first to break through on the scorecard with two runs in the fourth frame. But Ohio State answered back with a run of their own in the bottom half of the inning. The Buckeyes combined for three runs across the fifth and sixth to flip the lead, and USC wasn\u2019t able to dig out of the hole. In total, the Trojans left four runners on base.\n\nGalloway was feeling it at the plate for the second straight game, with two doubles and a single. Sophomore outfielder Luca DiPaolo contributed the lone USC RBI, as the other Trojan run came around on a throwing error.\n\nStankiewicz said this weekend will be a learning lesson for the team. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have success this weekend but, learning from this, I told the guys, \u2018If you continue to do what you\u2019ve always done and you continue to have the same results, then that\u2019s not real smart,\u2019\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good baseball in front of us, I just want them to relax and just play the way we know they\u2019re capable of playing.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will host UC San Diego at Loyola Marymount\u2019s Page Stadium on Tuesday looking for their first win of the new season.\n```"}

(Photo by Justin Li)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino\nFebruary 19, 2024 at 12:18 pm PST\n\nThe Riviera Country Club is known for being a highly sought-after course, and why wouldn\u2019t it be? Situated in the heart of the beautiful Pacific Palisades, it\u2019s lined with spectacular houses, boasts a great clubhouse and features a course that is second to none. The famous course is renowned for many things, such as being the host for The Genesis Invitational, but it is also home to what may be one of the trickiest holes in all of the PGA Tour. The 10th hole defines what professional golf is all about.\n\nAt first glance, it seems simple. The golfer walks up to the tee and sees a perfectly maintained fairway, green and rough, which appears to offer a fresh start to the back nine. A par-4 hole of only 315 yards, seemingly light work for someone on the PGA Tour. On the contrary, the 10th hole puts someone\u2019s golfing knowledge and capability to the test like no other hole at the club does. This is the part of the course where the mental game comes into play.\n\nThe fairway is littered with hills and a large sand trap right in the middle. The fairway then leads into a slight slope up to a firm green, which is also surrounded by bunkers. Some players take the approach of trying to drive onto the green, but a bad swing can be disastrous, as it is very easy to land either in the rough or in an unfavorable position.\n\nA diagram of the 10th hole at The Genesis Invitational during the fourth round. (Photo courtesy of PGA Tour)\n\nAnd that\u2019s only getting onto the green. Once the ball is close to the pin, it\u2019s one of the most confusing putts a player will face. Despite the challenge, some golfers embrace it for being one of the most unique holes on the tour.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a great hole because the green complex is off the charts. It\u2019s important to get a good tee shot there because if you\u2019re in the wrong position, you\u2019re chipping sideways to the middle of the green,\u201d Jason Day said. \u201cWhen you have that massive variance of shots over a really small hole, that\u2019s what\u2019s so unique and great about that hole.\u201d\n\nThe pros go into the tournament expecting a tough matchup here, and, in the final round on Sunday, golfers either figured out its complexities, or crashed and burned. The crowd surrounding the hole was in for a show, as they saw players struggle to figure out how to attack it. All day, cheers or sorrows rang across the grass from the back of the course over someone\u2019s miraculous birdie, or disappointing pars and bogeys.\n\nNot only that, but arguably the most important birdie of the entire tournament happened on the 10th hole. Genesis Invitational winner Hideki Matsuyama started his back-nine hot streak on this exact hole. Matsuyama played one of the best rounds in tournament history, achieving a final-round record score of 62, and his wave of momentum started with his birdie at the 10th.\n\nOriginally Matsuyama ball was behind the pin and he seemed destined for a bogey. But after a few days of learning how the ball breaks on the green he was able to navigate the ball into the hole. This momentum-building shot led to five more birdies in the back half of the court. If he hadn\u2019t made that happen, things could have been very different. Momentum would not have been as strong, and confidence could have been weakened.\n\nOn the other side of things, the 10th hole is where things went downhill for Luke List, who couldn\u2019t seem to work out the kinks here. After a stellar front nine to put him in first place, the rest of the round went downhill when he approached the most difficult hole on the course. List\u2019s tee off went wrong, going far right into the rough. Then it was left up to his putting. However, he failed to learn from previous rounds, leading to a bogey-filled second half and losing the tournament victory.\n\n\u201cThe cardinal sin on 10 is missing right, and I did that yesterday and unfortunately did that again today,\u201d List said. \u201cThat bogey really kind of stung a little bit. Unfortunately, I left myself in some bad positions.\u201d\n\nTwo other stars who underperformed at this crucial hole were Will Zalatoris and Patrick Cantlay. Zalatoris, who finished the event tied for second, started off with an unfavorable tee shot, landing in the rough, albeit close to the green. After a phenomenal chip, he seemed destined to conquer the difficult hole with a birdie. Unfortunately for Zalatoris, a misread on the speed of the green cost him a pivotal birdie.\n\nAs for Cantlay, who finished tied for fourth, he simply couldn\u2019t find his way around the hole. He started off his first two shots going bunker to bunker, with neither chip out ending up promising. Derailing his momentum, it started a string of three bogeys on the back nine.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all hardships and defeats, though. In fact, many of the top players were able to figure out their perfect strategy to tackle this hole. Several golfers were still able to secure birdies, including top-10 finisher Xander Schauffele.\n\n\u201cYou [have to] hit a really good shot off the tee. If you have the right club to hit it, sort of like just over that left bunker, you can open up the hole,\u201d Schauffele said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have enough spin and if you hit it in the wrong spot, [you have to] try to execute your shot. So I think reasons like that make it a fun hole.\u201d\n\nOne of the most entertaining holes in all of golf saw another historic day of action. After the week at the Genesis Invitational, it retains its legacy as one of the most difficult, yet fun holes to watch on the PGA Tour.\n```"}

This win puts Matsuyama ahead of K.J. Choi for the most PGA Tour wins by an Asian-born golfer.\n\n\u201cReaching nine wins was one of my big goals, passing K.J. Choi,\u201d Matsuyama said through his agent-interpreter, Ken Hirai. \u201cThere were a lot of times where I felt, you know, I was never going to win again. I struggled reaching the top 10, but I\u2019m really happy that I was able to win today.\u201d\n\nThe 2021 Masters champion trailed 54-hole leader Patrick Cantlay by six shots going into the final round. He quickly made up that ground and was in a five-way tie for first place on the back nine with Will Zalatoris, Luke List, Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele at 14 under.\n\nMatsuyama explained that going into the final round he did not think he could win. \u201cI was not feeling comfortable with my ball-striking, so I was kind of thinking, hey, I\u2019m going to have a couple missed shots today, but maybe that kind of worked out,\u201d he said.\n\nSecuring birdies on holes 15, 16 and 17 changed the narrative for Matsuyama. On the 15th hole, he hit a 6-iron 189 yards that landed eight inches from the hole for a birdie. \u201cOn 15, tee shot, second shot, perfect shot. So I had a great momentum right there,\u201d Matsuyama said.\n\nAt the 16th, he landed his 160-yard tee shot just 6 inches from the cup, where he tapped in another birdie and gained a one-stroke lead. His birdie on the 17th brought his lead to two. A Zalatoris bogey brought Matsuyama\u2019s lead to three as Matsuyama approached the final hole.\n\nThe new Genesis champion two-putted for par on the 18th to shoot 17 under for the tournament and 9 under on Sunday \u2013 just one stroke higher than Riviera\u2019s course record of 61.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw Hideki finishing at 17 under, it was a bit of a deflator, I\u2019m sure for the rest of the field,\u201d Xander Schauffele, who finished tied for fourth, said. \u201cBut hats off to him, it\u2019s incredible. He\u2019s done it a few times now, shooting lights out on Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe tournament concluded with Zalatoris and List three strokes behind at 14 under, as well as Adam Hadwin, Cantlay and Schauffele at 13 under. Cantlay led the field by five shots after the first two rounds but had his worst round on Sunday. He shot 72, only hitting four fairways and not getting a birdie until the 11th hole. Schauffele tied his worst score of the tournament with 70.\n\nIn the pair\u2019s large gallery was USC football coach Lincoln Riley. This was Zalatoris\u2019 fifth second-place finish in 69 career tournaments and his second consecutive top-five finish. Zalatoris was runner-up to Matsuyama, and Schauffele finished tied for third back at the 2021 Masters.\n\nZalatoris underwent back surgery last spring and had a hole-in-one during the second round of the tournament. He also shared that he unexpectedly lost a family member on Thursday and said that the whole tournament was for her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of silver in my house so getting another second place doesn\u2019t really sit that well,\u201d Zalatoris said, \u201cbut obviously coming back from what I had to go through physically, you know, we\u2019re in the right direction.\u201d\n\nIt was List\u2019s first top-10 finish out of nine starts at The Genesis Invitational. Matsuyama had not had a top-10 finish in 20 straight tournaments, the longest he had gone without one in his PGA career.\n\n\u201cTo win in this tournament was one of my goals ever since I became pro,\u201d Matsuyama said. \u201c[With] Tiger being the host, that goal became a lot bigger.\u201d```"}

USC students explain their feelings and understanding of what Black History Month means in 2024.\n\nBy Spartacus Smith Jr., Cierra Morgan, Daphne Yaman, and Maya Broomfield\nFebruary 19, 2024, at 8:00 am PST\n\nIt\u2019s that time of the year again when we celebrate the rich, inspiring and soul-shaking history of the Black Americans. It has been 47 years since this month was officially recognized by then-President Gerald R. Ford to \u201chonor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.\u201d However, in those 47 years, systematic racism, homophobia, and prejudice remain prevalent issues facing the Black community.\n\nThree USC students take a moment to explore and discuss the state of Black History Month in 2024 \u2013 its value, its impact and its potential for the future.\n\n\u201cOn July 2, 1964, almost 60 years ago, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, outlawing discriminatory hiring practices and outlawing segregation in establishments and public areas like libraries and schools. And now, four years ago in 2020, the public eye was brought to the conversation about police brutality with George Floyd through the rise of mobile phones with cameras, capable of capturing instances of systemic racism once hidden for decades. Yet, despite the openness of racism seen over the last few years, there is a question of why Black History Month should exist.\u201d\n\n- Spartacus Smith\n\n\u201cThe unanimous answer is yes, Black History Month is still relevant, but those who agree that Black History Month is still relevant also unanimously answer no to whether Black History Month is enough to celebrate Black excellence in the current climate of the nation. Individuals who are in an educational setting are surrounded by opportunities to learn about Black History and understand the importance of celebrating Black History during February and beyond, but when you take Black History out of an educational setting, the real meaning of the month becomes blurred by society as they fail to see the importance of actually spreading the accomplishments made and continuing to be made by the Black community. Black author Esau McCaulley wrote Black History Month Is About Seeing America Clearly for the New York Times, emphasizing the switch of Black History celebration that happened as he got older. \u2018I was exposed to a second form of Black History Month when I got older: Black history as corrective. In this version, we learned about Black achievement that had been erased from the historical record,\u2019 said McCaulley.\u201d\n\n- Cierra Morgan\n\n\u201cI feel like there needs to be recognition for history and what\u2019s happened in history,\u201d said USC health student, Alice Gibson. \u2018To erase it completely would be disrespectful. It would be like erasing what\u2019s happened in history.\u2019 As of 2024, over 200 books have been banned in the United States, many of them being authentically Black and LGBTQ+. Other students at USC believe Black History month is tied to a level of fairness in regards to the culture of other communities. \u2018We\u2019ve not achieved equality yet in any sense of the word,\u2019 said USC student, Alex Ushyiama. \u201cThere needs to be some form of respect paid for what\u2019s happened in history, and some form of celebration.\u201d\n\n- Spartacus Smith\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot that Black History Month does to shed light on the intersections of the modern Black community as well, as pointed out by Izzy Batiste, a culture ambassador from the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs\u2019 (CBCSA). \u2018Now we\u2019re starting to dive more into disabled individuals who are Black ..., and queer people who have also helped us... non-binary individuals, [too].\u2019 According to Batiste, this intersectionality is what makes up the \u201cBlack Rainbow,\u201d and although there are spaces like the CBCSA to engender conversation and connection with the Black community at USC, there is still more that USC could be doing, especially as its status as a PWI (predominantly white institution).\u201d\n\n- Daphne Yaman\n\n\u201cAcross the country, Black History Month is a mixture of appreciating Black culture and learning about the lives of Black people, past and present. But what must be on the minds of those who celebrate should be the future. Instances of normalized racism are not created by obvious racial federal laws but by local policies that target minorities disproportionately. Acknowledge what happened, despite ego or ignorance. Think about ways in which what happened to Black people altered the stigma or systemic acceptance of them today.\u201d\n\n- Spartacus Smith\n\nTo delve deeper into the significance of Black History Month for the students at USC, we invite you to listen to our podcast \u201cThe Black View\u201d and to follow us on Tik Tok.```"}

She watched winding canals and historic architecture fly by her window as butterflies fluttered in her stomach. Arriving at the unassuming building of Nederlands Dans Theater (NDT), Lummis Eddy hesitantly rang the bell. Just three days earlier, her mentor had called her at her parent\u2019s home in Camberley, England with the news of an impending audition at NDT. Though she didn\u2019t know what to expect, the English-born dancer boarded a plane.\n\nAn energetic woman answered the door of NDT and warmly welcomed her inside. After a brief tour where she pointed out empty dance studios, she escorted Lummis Eddy to the Park Central Hotel near the studio. Sitting alone in her hotel room, it all felt like a dream. The next morning, Lummis Eddy stood behind the NDT company dancers at the ballet barre and marveled at their facilities and talent. Inspired by the tall men and elegant women, Lummis Eddy did what she did best. She danced.\n\nThe following few days were a whirlwind. Taking more classes and observing rehearsals, Lummis Eddy was struck by the welcoming work environment. Although the company was full of world-renowned dancers, they didn\u2019t take themselves too seriously and kept a non-judgmental atmosphere. Near the end of her trip, she was suddenly ushered into an upstairs office with NDT\u2019s general manager, Carel Birnie. He swiftly slid papers across a table toward Lummis Eddy and handed her a pen: \u201cWe would like to offer you a contract with NDT.\u201d Muttering words of gratitude, Lummis Eddy turned her attention to the contract. As she glanced over it, her smile dropped; it was written completely in Dutch. Her dad\u2019s voice rang through her head, \u201cFiona, remember don\u2019t sign anything you don\u2019t understand.\u201d She flipped through the pages before building up the courage to say, \u201cWell, thank you, but can I take this home?\u201d The room fell silent and Birnie\u2019s face twitched, his smile disappearing for half a second. Lummis Eddy didn\u2019t know this at the time, but Birnie had a reputation for persistence. He assured her that he could explain what was written, but Lummis Eddy repeated that she would rather look over it in English first. Even with an offer from one of the most acclaimed dance companies in the world, she listened to her gut and negotiated. She took the contract home to England, translated it and signed it, kicking off her career with NDT as a principal that would go on for the next 20 years.\n\nKnown for her wild and powerful performance quality, Lummis Eddy stands out as one of the longest-tenured members in the history of NDT: an internationally famed company celebrated for its groundbreaking contributions to the realm of contemporary dance. During her tenure, Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n, then Artistic Director of NDT and resident choreographer, was instrumental in shaping the company\u2019s repertoire. His world-renowned choreography holds a significant place in the contemporary ballet canon. Lummis Eddy\u2019s extensive collaboration with Kyli\u00e1n resulted in the creation of new roles in an impressive 15 in of his ballets, a feat that it is practically unheard of in the dance industry. These roles are now performed by different companies worldwide.\n\nAfter her performance career, Lummis Eddy moved to South Pasadena, California with her family. She now serves on faculty at both the Los Angeles County School for the Performing Arts. She is an Artist in Residence at the University of Southern California\u2019s Glorya Kaufman School of Dance. She also stages Kyli\u00e1n\u2019s works internationally.\n\nSitting in an empty office of the Kaufman Dance Center, Lummis Eddy brushes her brown hair away from her eyes and flashes an affectionate smile. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll start from the beginning and just keep talking,\u201d she says with the touch of a British accent that\u2019s survived her years in the U.S. Born in 1963, Lummis Eddy grew up in a warm and supportive family with her parents and three older siblings. \u201cBeing the youngest, by quite a lot, I always felt loved,\u201d she said. Her father served in the British army, so the family moved frequently. But when Lummis Eddy was four, they settled near the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. It was there that Lummis Eddy began taking dance classes, encouraged by her older sister. By age nine, she enrolled at Elmhurst Ballet School in Sandhurst, where she studied dance and other art forms such as theater, art and music.\n\nDespite her training, Lummis Eddy wasn\u2019t initially interested in pursuing dance. Instead, she envisioned a path in theater. \u201cI knew I could be an actress,\u201d she said with a soft laugh. However, as she progressed through school, Lummis Eddy found herself portraying characters through her dancing, and she welcomed the idea of dancing professionally. When she turned 16, Lummis Eddy began auditioning for different college preparatory schools where she could continue her dance education. Choosing Rambert Academy, which had been founded that year (1979), she studied under the artistic direction of Christopher Bruce.\n\nIn the intimate cohort of dancers at Rambert, she was encouraged to explore different facets of her identity, apart from her naturally outgoing side. \u201cWith dancing, I could hide in the silence, which I love,\u201d said Lummis Eddy \u201cI can be silent, but expressive.\u201d Bruce\u2019s connections in the dance world paved Lummis Eddy\u2019s way to NDT, where she spent the bulk of her performance career. After receiving an offer from them unexpectedly at the age of 18, she moved to the Netherlands to be a part of their second company. In just a year, Lummis Eddy was promoted to the main company.\n\nIn addition to her hard work, she attributed this move to her choreographic compatibility with Kyli\u00e1n. Their strong working relationship was further bolstered by their shared love of music and dedication to the choreography, all while being able to laugh and have fun in the studio. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s that sort of silent communication,\u201d Lummis Eddy said about her time with Kyli\u00e1n, \u201cwithout saying anything, you\u2019re saying everything when you understand the work at hand.\u201d\n\nOver her two decades with NDT, Lummis Eddy said she couldn\u2019t recall a difficult experience working with Kyli\u00e1n \u2013 a testament not only to his leadership but also to her adaptability and calming presence. A significant moment in Lummis Eddy\u2019s career was when she took on the lead role in Kyli\u00e1n\u2019s two-act ballet, \u201cKaguyahime: The Moon Princess.\u201d This ballet, an abstract interpretation of an ancient Japanese fairytale, involved close collaboration between Lummis Eddy and Kyli\u00e1n throughout the preparation process.\n\nIn one memorable gala performance at the famed Paris Opera Garnier, both the late Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and President Mitterand of France attended as part of a special diplomatic event. When the ballet finished, Lummis Eddy felt a rare and gratifying sense of relief and happiness from her performance, uncommon emotions for dancers who often serve as their own harshest critics. As Lummis Eddy and the company took their bows amidst the resounding applause, she beamed with a wide smile just before the heavy red curtain dropped. But as they stood behind it, the clapping continued. The backstage crew motioned for Lummis Eddy to return to the stage alongside Kyli\u00e1n for another bow. Unaccustomed to this attention, she shook her head no, but Kyli\u00e1n beckoned her forward. As Lummis Eddy peered out with one foot extended forward, she realized that the audience wasn\u2019t applauding her but the Queen and she and Kyli\u00e1n retreated in a fit of laughter.\n\nAs Lummis Eddy settled into her life in the quaint city of The Hague, she grew close to another company dancer, Glen Eddy. Fiona met Glen at her first audition when she was 18, standing unknowingly behind the man who would later become her husband. While their relationship started professionally, they eventually became friends, always finding ways to make one another laugh. \u201cWe are both Pisces and we used to organize Pisces parties together in February,\u201d Fiona said. While the pair danced together extensively, Fiona said that their spark didn\u2019t come from partnering but from the congruity of their personalities. They married in 1996, 15 years after they met. Fiona became pregnant and had their son, Jack, in 2000 while still at NDT. She returned to the stage for one more year before formally retiring from NDT in 2001.\n\nThe Eddys relocated to South Pasadena, Glen\u2019s hometown and had their second son, Gus. As she entered motherhood, Fiona shifted to teaching and staging Kyli\u00e1n\u2019s ballets for companies and schools worldwide. Hope Patterson is one of Fiona\u2019s students at the Kaufman School of Dance. Now in her fourth year of the program, Patterson considers Fiona a formative mentor. \u201cShe creates an environment that is both productive yet also warm, lighthearted and incredibly personal,\u201d she said. Before beginning her ballet classes every morning, Fiona checks in with each of her students, walking around the room offering hugs and advice. When in rehearsal, Fiona commands the room with ease despite being soft-spoken and serene. \u201cShe goes beyond just teaching dance steps,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut she has reminded me of the importance of being an individual and feeling confident in the way I can uniquely dance a role.\u201d\n\nFiona enjoys passing down Kyli\u00e1n\u2019s legacy and movement. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not even that Ji\u0159\u00ed needs us to keep his work alive,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s really important for other people to look at history in that way.\u201d Learning and performing Kyli\u00e1n\u2019s choreography was instrumental in Fiona\u2019s development as a dancer, shaping her artistic expression and contributing significantly to her growth. Reflecting on the experience, she emphasized the special significance of teaching the repertoire to younger dancers: \u201cIt\u2019s like musicians learning existing pieces of music to find your way as an artist.\u201d\n\nImmersed in the world of dance for the better part of her life, Fiona wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. She continues to teach because she finds a profound connection with people through the silent communication of dance. \u201cYou reach a point in dance where you say very little, and it\u2019s glorious,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s all say less and dance more.\u201d```"}

USC women's basketball defeated Oregon State 58-50 at Gill Coliseum Sunday. (Photo by Shantala Muruganujan)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson February 18, 2024 at  4:19 pm PST\n\nGill Coliseum seeped with anticipation as the Oregon State band rang Paramore\u2019s \u201cMisery Business\u201d through the rafters heading into a top-11 women\u2019s basketball matchup. The Beavers were coming off a magical buzzer-beater win heading into their matchup with the Trojans. The magic wore off for the No. 11 Beavers though, and the No. 10 Trojans capitalized, making enough shots and playing tough defense to beat Oregon State 58-50 at Gill Coliseum.\n\n\u201cI like it when it\u2019s pretty. But I really, really respect it when it\u2019s gritty,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said postgame. \u201cWe had a really meaningful game here on a Sunday afternoon. Our kids had to scrap and fight, so [I\u2019m] super proud of the effort.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans never trailed, knocking down the first points of the game more than two minutes into the opening period and snatching the air out of Beaver fans.\n\n\u201cIt was a great feeling,\u201d junior center Rayah Marshall said. \u201cAs an athlete, when you\u2019re out there on the court and you see the ball going through the net like that \u2014 especially when you have a lead on a great team at home \u2014 it brought us a ton of momentum.\u201d\n\nOregon State never truly fell out of it though, as the 8,210-person crowd helped energize the Beavers to keep it close. USC was able to keep the crowd quiet, returning to the roots of the Gottlieb era and playing stifling defense, holding Oregon State to 32.8% shooting from the field.\n\nThat defensive intensity was on point across the opening 10 minutes in particular. Despite the momentum of three-straight ranked wins and a six-game winning streak, the Beavers came out flat in the first quarter without their leading scorer, sophomore forward Raegan Beers. USC held Oregon State to eight points in the opening frame as the Trojans mustered a six-point lead after one.\n\n\u201cThe first thing was the mentality. Our players have really bought into that in February, teams elevate or they kind of fall apart,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taking steps in the right direction. [It] wasn\u2019t hard to get us up for such a big game because Oregon State was literally the hottest team in the conference, maybe the country. So we love the challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans needed to play tough defense, as it was a tough shooting afternoon for them as well. USC shot a season-low 31% from the field, but still found a way to beat the No. 11 team in the country, making the shots when it mattered most.\n\nMarshall helped turn up the heat out of halftime, scoring six of her 11 points while also bringing down seven rebounds in the third period alone. Graduate guard McKenzie Forbes continued to prove herself as the second-best scoring option for USC, scoring all of her 13 points in the last two quarters.\n\n\u201c[Forbes] is just a big shot-maker,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cShe\u2019s really calm. She\u2019s like another coach on the floor. She can pick apart some mismatches. And she\u2019s just unafraid. She\u2019s unafraid to take a big shot, no matter if the one before has gone in or not.\u201d\n\nMarshall and Forbes were so vital to the win, as freshman guard JuJu Watkins went 6-for-32, with 20 of the shots coming in the first half. Watkins still made her presence felt despite the off shooting night, finishing with 11 rebounds to complete the double-double and a team-best plus/minus of 15.\n\nUSC has now won six straight conference games \u2014 four of those coming on the road \u2014 after starting out Pac-12 play with a 4-4 record, 0-3 in that stretch. The Trojans have now swept back-to-back Pac-12 road trips for the first time since the 2017-18 season.\n\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019m most proud of is the upward trajectory,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe continual growth trajectory has been big, and we\u2019re really locked in. Now, we get to come back home against the same two teams that swept us and they haven\u2019t gotten any worse; they\u2019re really good. We have to see how much we\u2019ve improved.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans return to Galen Center this week, facing off against No. 8 Colorado on Friday night, then Utah on Sunday as they look for revenge over the Rocky Mountain teams.\n```"}

The Trojans fell by three in double overtime Saturday at Galen Center. (Photo by Marcus Heatherly)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nFebruary 18, 2024 at 11:16 am PST\n\nAn acrobatic and-one layup by freshman guard Bronny James might have extended USC men\u2019s basketball\u2019s lead to 16 over Colorado halfway through the second frame, but the Buffaloes weren\u2019t going to let the Trojans have a cakewalk to the finish line. USC\u2019s (10-16, 4-11 Pac-12) rebounding woes and foul trouble contributed to Colorado\u2019s (17-9, 8-7) eventual comeback, capped off by a game-tying dunk from senior guard Luke O\u2019Brien with four seconds remaining in regulation. Both teams traded makes in the first overtime to set up a second, when the Buffaloes\u2019 free throws allowed them to only need one field goal to edge the Trojans. Colorado prevailed 92-89, as senior forward Tristan da Silva blocked fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis\u2019 3-point prayer attempt to tie the game, stunning the hopeful Galen Center crowd.\n\n\u201cOur guys played hard, we just couldn\u2019t get enough defensive stops or rebound the ball in the last 10 minutes of the game,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cJust one possession here and there is the difference.\u201d\n\nEllis posted a season-high 30 points and gave it all he had on the floor, playing in 47 of the game\u2019s 50 minutes. He notched five 3-pointers while also adding five assists and four rebounds; he hit some big shots down the stretch, too.\n\n\u201cThe effort and energy that we played with tonight is what we should look like,\u201d Ellis said, \u201cbut moving forward, we just have got to come out with a win.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 main kryptonite was the Buffaloes\u2019 junior guard, KJ Simpson. He was nearly unstoppable from downtown, connecting from long range six times. He also went to the free throw line eight times, hitting six of his attempts, totalling his points at 30 on the night. His two makes from the charity stripe with 1:10 remaining in double overtime put Colorado up three, which proved to be enough to hold off USC.\n\nColorado\u2019s starting forward duo of da Silva and freshman forward Cody Williams was also one of the Buffs\u2019 main catalysts, with da Silva scoring 18 points and Williams putting up 14. While USC generated 21 turnovers when defending the Buffs, it only scored 15 points off takeaways. Colorado, while only generating just nine turnovers on the other hand, was able to score a much more efficient 14 points off them.\n\nFreshman guard Isaiah Collier tallied 25 points, his highest amount since he scored 26 on January 6 against Stanford. Collier connected with his teammates with ease, posting nine assists \u2014 including some flashy alley-oops. He also generated five Colorado turnovers, blocking two shots and recording three steals. Collier was also responsible for forcing the second overtime, as his layup with five seconds remaining in the first extra frame knotted the game at 83 apiece.\n\nRedshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan feasted on the defensive end, blocking five shots before fouling out in the first overtime. The Trojans could\u2019ve used his ability down the stretch, as USC\u2019s other big men didn\u2019t contribute nearly as much. The Trojans\u2019 bench only mustered six points the entire game, putting pressure on an already tired starting lineup to carry the load.\n\n\u201cWe gave up too many second shots, too many second chance points,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey made their run, and then we missed a few layups. When the other team goes on a run you\u2019ve got to score the ball at some point.\u201d\n\nJunior guard Kobe Johnson put together a solid game on both ends of the floor, scoring 14 points and pickpocketing the Buffaloes on four occasions. Despite leading for more than 35 minutes, the Trojans showed, once again, that they are no strangers to blowing leads \u2014 in USC\u2019s last bout with the Buffaloes in Boulder, the Trojans led by 13 points at halftime before Colorado went on a scoring flurry in the second half to win the game, 68-58.\n\nComing off a thrilling win against Utah on Thursday night, USC couldn\u2019t carry over its late-game winning mentality to Saturday.\n\n\u201cAs frustrating as this loss was, as much as we wanted it, we\u2019ve got to move on,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put this one in our back pocket, use this as ammo.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will attempt to get back on the horse against archrival UCLA (14-11, 9-5) next Saturday at 7 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion. USC fell to the Bruins last matchup at Galen Center, so it\u2019ll hope to avoid the sweep as the season winds down.\n```"}

USC just seemed to want it more, as every player who recorded more than six minutes of playing time brought down a board. \u201c[Associated head coach Beth Burns] said, \u2018This is the time of the season where good teams turn great,\u2019\u201d graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis said on the heels of a double-double. \u201cOr they can turn bad, and I think, as a team, we really want to wrap it up in a sweep this weekend.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans showed that fight not against a top-10 team in the country, but an Oregon team with a losing record and a mere two wins in conference play. They could have coasted to a win on skill alone, or taken the gas off the pedal after they secured a 36-point halftime lead. But USC kept up the effort in the second half, fighting on the boards like it was a two-point game in the NCAA tournament, not against a team now on an eight-game losing streak.\n\nAt the forefront of that mentality is, of course, the best player on the court. Watkins has shown time and time again that she will work harder than anyone. \u201cThe way she comes out as a freshman, it just pushes you even harder,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just a testament to her and her mentality.\u201d Even as a freshman, Watkins is pushing a lineup full of graduates to put in that much more work because of her mindset, not just her skill. That mentality and effort makes it tough to take her off the floor, even when she\u2019s hurting.\n\nAfter getting hit in the face and falling hard to the court in the third quarter, she had to go back to the locker room two different times. Watkins, in obvious pain on the bench, could have sat out the rest of the game with her team up by double-digit points, but she came back in to eclipse 30 points for the 10th time this season. \u201cJuJu is one of the toughest players I\u2019ve ever played with mentally, physically,\u201d Davis said. \u201cShe\u2019s always gonna give us 100%. Even in games like this, she\u2019s still in there until the fourth quarter with three minutes left. She\u2019s giving it her all, so it just makes the rest of us want to give our all.\u201d\n\nShortly after a 10-0 Oregon run in the third quarter, Watkins and USC put up their most impressive series of effort plays. Graduate guard Kayla Padilla was wide open in the corner but missed the shot. Davis reached over a shorter player to secure the board, then kicked it out to Forbes, who proceeded to miss her own downtown shot. That is where the effort showed up. The other four players on the court made their way to the basket \u2014 even 5-foot-9 Padilla, who would have to get around Oregon\u2019s 6-foot-8 junior center Phillipina Kyei. When the ball bounced off the side of the rim, Watkins sprinted from the middle of the paint to save the ball from going out of bounds with Davis on her heels, while no Oregon player was even making an attempt at the ball. Watkins took it herself, but missed the jumper. Davis worked her way into position as the ball caromed off the rim and outmuscled Oregon\u2019s 6-foot-7 sophomore forward Kennedy Basham to bring it down. The ball finally found the net, as Davis got it out to Forbes to knock down the triple.\n\nA series of high-level effort plays from #USC women's basketball last night against #Oregon. Story to come tomorrow morning discussing the Trojans' effort: pic.twitter.com/4nyxIiZhgT \u2014 Thomas Johnson (@ThomasJ40800586) February 18, 2024\n\nPut aside the missed shots \u2014 the Trojans still shot 47.9% from the field against Oregon \u2014 and consider how easy it would have been for USC to give up on that possession. The team was up by 27, that one 3-pointer did not affect the game as a whole. But that possession did prove that USC is not simply a 13-person roster going out on the court. The Trojans are a team, striving for something better than just winning games. They want to dominate.\n\nThe team they did dominate Friday night was, albeit, the team now in sole possession of last place in the Pac-12. But that game was just a microcosm of what USC has been doing all season. Against Stanford \u2014 the same game where Watkins dropped 51 \u2014 the Trojans outrebounded the Cardinal on the offensive glass, a team that has senior forward Cameron Brink. It was not as if Marshall \u2014 who leads the team in offensive rebounds \u2014 put on a clinic; she only brought down two of USC\u2019s 14 boards in the offensive end. The Trojans are, seemingly, putting in the same effort against the top teams in the country as they are against middling conference opponents, which is the highest effort possible.\n\nAnd, at least at some level, Watkins can be thanked for USC\u2019s effort and team mentality. Watkins isn\u2019t a player like Anthony-Towns. While Anthony-Towns scored 62 points in that loss to the Hornets, he went 2-for-10 in the fourth quarter. He had the hot hand in the first half, but it was not his game to win in the closing frame. Since he kept the ball in his hands rather than make the extra pass, he and his team allowed the Hornets to come back from a 15-point deficit.\n\nUSC\u2019s star freshman does not exhibit similar issues. Against Arizona State on February 9, Watkins quickly realized it wasn\u2019t her night \u2014 going 3-for-12 from the field across the first 20 minutes \u2014 and ceded the ball to her teammates, recording four assists to allow the Trojans to build a 10-point halftime lead over the Sun Devils and win the game by 18. \u201cShe just contributes to winning,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said of Watkins after the Oregon game.\n\nIt is hard to predict winning down the line, especially with the madness of March. Through this point of the season, though, the Trojans seem to have all the pieces coming together at the right time. They have consistent effort across all of their games, no matter the opponent, which could go a long way to preventing an upset loss like they had against Oregon State in the 2023 Pac-12 tournament. They have the skill to make shots and shut down other teams defensively. Maybe most importantly, they have a young, unselfish star who can carry her team to victory.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling where this team is heading, no one can predict that. But they have the pieces to play at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland come early April. USC continues its journey against the dangerous No. 11 Oregon State Beavers at Gill Coliseum Sunday at noon. The No. 10 Trojans are higher up in the rankings, but are likely coming in as underdogs, playing on the road against one of the hottest squads in the country.\n```"}

(AP/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington February 17, 2024 at 11:47 pm PST\n\nThis week\u2019s slate didn\u2019t feature many ranked matchups, but teams are still molding their identities in preparation for the NCAA Tournament. The No. 1 Connecticut Huskies continued to dominate their Big East opponents while the South Carolina Gamecocks got blown out by the Auburn Tigers. Meanwhile, the Samford Bulldogs are on the verge of setting a new school record for wins in a single season and are looking to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in over two decades. Let\u2019s break down college basketball\u2019s latest happenings.\n\nTeam of the Week: Connecticut\n\nFor the last five weeks, the same team has been ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll: the Connecticut Huskies. Coming off a national championship, the Huskies haven\u2019t spent any time outside of the top six, and they are 3-1 against ranked opponents this season. This week, they won their nation-leading thirteenth straight game. The kicker? Out of the eight players with minutes in last year\u2019s championship game, only three returned to Connecticut to try and defend their title.\n\nHow have the Huskies remained successful? Their three returning contributors, Donovan Clingan, Alex Karaban, and Tristen Newton are three of the team\u2019s top four leading scorers. The trifecta\u2019s championship DNA is key for this year\u2019s Huskies team, as they are averaging a combined 42 points and 8.7 assists per game, whereas the rest of the Huskies (eleven players) average 47.6 points and 10.9 assists per game. However, the team\u2019s leading scorer this season is senior guard transfer Cam Spencer. Connecticut is 23-2, and in their two losses, the Rutgers product has put up only five and six points, respectively, which illustrates his importance to the Huskies\u2019 dominance.\n\nOn Saturday, Connecticut faced off against the Georgetown Hoyas on the road. Georgetown is only 1-5 at home against Big East opponents, and the Huskies are the consensus best team in the conference. After a 52-28 halftime deficit, the Hoyas were never able to gain momentum, and Connecticut cruised to a 89-64 victory. Their opponent Wednesday night, the DePaul Blue Demons, are the only team in the Big East worse than Georgetown. After taking a 4-3 lead in the game\u2019s opening minutes, the Huskies led for the rest of the contest and finished with a 101-65 blowout. Every Huskie starter scored in double figures, with Karaban scoring 21 to lead the way.\n\nBut Connecticut doesn\u2019t just beat up on bad teams. Out of their 23 wins, six have been decided by fewer than ten points. Only three of those were separated by five or less points. Connecticut has been a juggernaut, and there is no sign of a championship hangover. Now that they are all but guaranteed one of the four No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament, there is a chance that the Huskies will be the first back-to-back national champions since the Florida Gators in 2007.\n\nHow real is South Carolina?\n\nEven after a 17-3 start, the South Carolina Gamecocks were not ranked in the AP Poll throughout January. Finally, after a road win against No. 5 Tennessee two weeks ago, the Gamecocks joined the poll at No. 15 and have climbed up to No. 11 since. More importantly, the battle for first place in the SEC is tight, with Alabama, South Carolina, and the Auburn Tigers all within one game of each other before last week\u2019s results.\n\nOn Wednesday night, in what ended up being a battle for second place, the Gamecocks went to Neville Arena for a tough road test against Auburn. Before the game, South Carolina head coach Lamont Paris said, \u201cAuburn\u2019s gonna play incredibly hard because that\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s a home game for them... they\u2019re in a race... we\u2019re a team that\u2019s also in the race.\u201d If Wednesday night\u2019s game was a race, the Gamecocks were riding a slower horse. By halftime, Auburn took a 50-28 lead, completely dominating South Carolina on both ends of the floor. The Gamecock offense couldn\u2019t convert on any looks, shooting less than 35% from the field, whereas Auburn was north of a bloodthirsty 60% on the night.\n\nAfter the 101-61 blowout, Paris said, \u201cStuff happens. Sometimes you get the bull; sometimes the bull gets you.\u201d In his 57 games as South Carolina\u2019s head coach, the Gamecocks have now lost by 40 or more points four times. However, Wednesday night was the first time it has happened this season. The Gamecocks are still 21-4 and in third place in the Southeastern Conference standings. Four of their remaining six games are Quad 1 contests, which will give both the committee and fans a better idea of how South Carolina will fare against NCAA Tournament opponents.\n\nMid-Major Spotlight: Samford\n\nWho are the Samford Bulldogs? College basketball fans who only watch March Madness probably won\u2019t know, as the Bulldogs haven\u2019t played a game in the NCAA Tournament since March 16, 2000 as the postseason\u2019s sole representative of the Trans America Athletic Conference, which dissolved over 20 years ago. Since then, the Bulldogs have a 324-380 record and haven\u2019t won more than 21 games in a single season. That is, until this week, when Samford got their 22nd and 23rd wins with at least six more opportunities to add to their total.\n\nLike most mid-major schools, Samford will almost certainly have to win their conference tournament to show up on brackets, but their 23-3 record indicates that they could be this year\u2019s Cinderella story if they get the opportunity. As of today, the Bulldogs are one of five teams in the nation shooting over 40% on 3-pointers. The others? No. 2 ranked Purdue, No. 12 Baylor, No. 22 Kentucky, and projected Southland Conference champions McNeese State. Samford is in good 3-point shooting company, but they don\u2019t rely on threes. In fact, more than 100 teams take a higher proportion of shots behind the arc. The team\u2019s leading scorer, junior forward Achor Achor, takes less than two 3-pointers per game.\n\nOn Wednesday night against the Western Carolina Catamounts, Achor didn\u2019t make a single three, but still led the Bulldogs in scoring with 18 points. Samford won 88-62 and led for the entire second half. With one more win this season, the Bulldogs would tie their school record from 1999 of 24 single-season wins. However, no wins will matter until the Southern Conference Tournament, where every game will be a must-win if Samford wants to bust brackets in March.\n```"}

(Photo by James Bao)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino February 17, 2024 at 9:39 pm PST\n\nThe clouds may have been out at The Riviera Country Club for the third round of the PGA Tour\u2019s Genesis Invitational, but that didn\u2019t stop golf\u2019s top players from playing their best game. At the start of the day, it seemed world No. 7 Patrick Cantlay, a Long Beach native, was going to run away with the win, but things quickly turned around. After a less-than-stellar day for Cantlay, he is now at risk of losing the tournament as his five-stroke lead was cut down to two.\n\nCantlay, who played at Riviera multiple times while at UCLA, sits 14 under par and seemed to have a sort of home-field advantage the first two days, but that wasn\u2019t the case Saturday. In the first round, he finished 7 under par; he was 6 under in the second. Today, Cantlay barely broke par, totaling a 1-under 70. His ultimate downfall came down to his approaches Cantlay struggled to get in a good position to knock the ball in the cup from short range, which led to only three birdies and the most bogeys he\u2019s had in any round of this tournament.\n\nDespite underperforming compared to the last two rounds, Cantlay doesn\u2019t seem concerned and is still confident he can take home the win. \u201cI had a year not too long ago where it felt like every close call went my way, and lately it hasn\u2019t been like that the last year or so,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cI played solid golf today; I didn\u2019t make any long putts or anything. Didn\u2019t really give myself too many chances. All in all, a solid day and in a good position for tomorrow,\u201d\n\nCantlay has the mindset to win in familiar territory, but he will also be facing off against a familiar foe, as he is paired with good friend and world No. 5, Xander Schauffele. The two know each other\u2019s game very well, as they often practice and play together in addition to getting dinner together. They are also no strangers to finishing tournaments together, as this is the third time Cantlay and Schauffele will face off against each other in a tournament final round. Their record against each other is currently 1-1 in those matchups, but Cantlay hopes tomorrow he will take the advantage in their rivalry.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be anything out of the usual,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few final rounds together, so should be a comfortable pairing, I\u2019m looking forward to it. So, hopefully I can get the edge tomorrow.\u201d\n\nCantlay has the lead against his close friend, but the momentum has certainly shifted into Schauffele\u2019s favor, who ended the day 12 strokes under par. The two had nearly opposite rounds on their path to the final day. Cantlay\u2019s worst round was Schauffele\u2019s best, and vice versa. Today, Schauffele\u2019s comeback started right away by eagleing the first hole. The rest of the front nine saw only pars, but in the back nine, he made his move. Schauffele sank two birdies on the 10th and 11th holes, then closed the round with two more birdies in a row.\n\nThe rivalry match will come down to putting, as both men are superb with drivers and irons. Schauffele will need to play some catch-up though, as he still sits two strokes behind Cantlay. Luckily for Schauffele, that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue. He has gone 36 holes without a bogey, while Cantlay leads the tournament in strokes gained. Even with momentum on his side, Schauffele knows Sunday will still be a tough day, but he believes he can still get the win.\n\n\u201cI feel like if I can just keep doing what I\u2019m doing, get some pressure on Pat, that is the most important thing. There\u2019s just going to be a certain amount of self-belief that needs to go in,\u201d Schauffele said. \u201cThe beautiful thing about the PGA Tour, anyone can win any week, and there\u2019s a lot of stories that go around. People love the Cinderella story.\u201d\n\nCantlay against Schauffele may be the biggest story going into Sunday, but it\u2019s important not to exclude a wild card in Will Zalatoris, also in second place at 12 under par. Zalatoris won\u2019t be playing in the same group as Cantlay and Schauffele, but he could play spoiler in their big rivalry match. Zalatoris wasn\u2019t able to replicate his ace from Friday, but he still had a stellar day on the greens and fairways. He knocked in birdies left and right, finishing the day 6 under par with a total of seven birdies. Not to mention, Zalatoris is currently tied for the most birdies and tops the field in strokes gained approaching the green.\n\nZalatoris looks to complete a comeback story and win his first tournament since his April 2023 back surgery. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve missed. ... Enjoy being at one of my favorite golf courses we play on tour,\u201d Zalatoris said. \u201cIf anything, whatever happens tomorrow, it is what it is, but I\u2019m really excited of where I\u2019m trending. We don\u2019t need to overwork or overthink things; it\u2019s just commit to what we\u2019re doing and see what it adds up to.\u201d\n\nCantlay aims to take home his first win this season at the Genesis Invitational, but Schauffele and Zalatoris are right on his tail, only two strokes behind. The three will end the tournament Sunday with the final tee times at 11:04 and 11:15 a.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Hayes Flanagan)\n\nBy James Bao\nFebruary 17, 2024 at 11:33 am PST\n\nPGA fans went on a roller-coaster ride through two rounds of the 2024 Genesis Invitational. Host Tiger Woods withdrew, world No. 12 Jordan Spieth was disqualified and Will Zalatoris won new cars with a hole-in-one.\n\nAfter finishing at 1 over par on Thursday, Woods ended his Riviera run for the 16th time without a win. The 48-year-old requested to withdraw after teeing-off on the seventh hole due to a flu-like illness, according to TGR Ventures EVP Rob McNamara.\n\nFollowing a less than desirable first round performance, the second round proved no easier for the 82-time PGA Tour winner. Despite birdieing his first hole, Woods soon found himself carding two consecutive bogeys on the par-3 fourth and the par-4 fifth holes at Riviera Country Club. This put the tournament\u2019s host outside of the top 50 and more than 10 strokes behind solo leader Patrick Cantlay \u2014 as well as below the projected cut line at 1 over par.\n\nAnother twist occurred when the PGA Tour announced Spieth\u2019s disqualification just four hours later. Spieth incorrectly signed a scorecard on the par-3 fourth hole, where the Dallas native mistakenly marked himself down for a par, despite actually carding a bogey after missing a five-foot putt.\n\nSpieth went to X later that day to address the error. \u201cToday, I signed for an incorrect scorecard and stepped out of the scoring area, after thinking I went through all procedures to make sure it was correct,\u201d Spieth wrote. \u201cRules are rules, and I take full responsibility. I love this tournament and golf course as much as any on @PGATOUR so it hurts to not have a run at the weekend. Really appreciated the support in LA.\u201d\n\nSpieth had a strong opening round at 5 under par but couldn\u2019t maintain the momentum, as he picked up four bogeys and a double-bogey before the disqualification. Friday\u2019s round of 73 marked Spieth\u2019s worst score of the season so far, and only the second time this year he finished a round with a score in the 70s.\n\nThis is the first disqualification for the 30-year-old in 263 PGA Tour events he\u2019s played in.\n\nFinally, Zalatoris and his caddie Joel Stock have already secured new Genesis cars regardless of tournament results. The 27-year-old golfer couldn\u2019t have asked for a better par-3 14th hole. His tee shot landed on the front edge of the green from 184 yards out and approached the hole at a perfect speed before rolling in for an ace.\n\nZalatoris\u2019 hole-in-one brought him back under par for the round. He finished the day at 1 under, bringing his overall score to 6 under par. This is the second ace of Zalatoris\u2019 career; the first was at the 2020 U.S. Open at Winged Foot.\n\n\u201cI think it was 180 pin back into the wind, and we were just trying to hit it kind of right in the middle of that gap between the two bunkers,\u201d Zalatoris said. \u201cI just pulled it about 10 feet, and it landed perfectly on the fringe and killed it. Lucky to go in. It was a nice little bonus.\u201d\n\nWitnessing a hole-in-one is a thrill for any PGA enthusiast, and Stock\u2019s reaction perfectly captured that excitement as he caught his partner in mid-air to celebrate.\n\n\u201cWhen the crowd went crazy, we went crazy too,\u201d Stock said.\n\nThe first player to card an ace on the 14th hole was set to be awarded a Genesis GV80, and their caddie a Genesis Electrified GV70.\n\nAside from the drama of the first two rounds, the Genesis Invitational continues to host the best talents in golf. Cantlay sits atop the standings with a five-stroke lead, while other players like Luke List and Jason Day are hot on his heels. With two rounds remaining, the tournament promises an intense battle for the coveted title and $4 million in prize money to the winner.\n```"}

Los Angeles is 2-1-0 since coming off the All-Star break under interim head coach Jim Hiller. With 31 games remaining on the schedule, every one matters, as L.A. is tied with the St. Louis Blues with 60 points, and four other teams trail by five or less points in the race.\n\nThe Kings came out of the All-Star break looking like a revamped, energized team, shutting out the Edmonton Oilers 4-0 to kick off the second half of the season. Los Angeles lost to Edmonton earlier in the season, and the Oilers also sit just one place ahead in the Pacific standings, making the victory a statement win for the Kings.\n\nCenter Pierre-Luc Dubois, who has been pretty disappointing this year, opened up scoring on a Kings power play where he was left alone on the nearside circle and lasered in a wrister. Winger Quinton Byfield generated the Kings\u2019 next score about a minute later when he poke-checked Connor McDavid and turned on the jets to the offensive zone. Byfield dished a beautiful pass to center Trevor Lewis who tapped in the puck to double Los Angeles\u2019 lead. Byfield scored the Kings\u2019 next two goals in the third period to put the nail in the coffin. His three-point performance extended his point streak to five games.\n\nGoaltender David Rittich earned his first shutout of the year with some fantastic saves. Los Angeles couldn\u2019t carry over the momentum to the next game, as the Kings were routed by the Buffalo Sabres, 7-0, in a horrific defensive meltdown. L.A. allowed three goals in the first period and couldn\u2019t recover. Sabres goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen saved 33 shots and left winger Jordan Greenway scored twice.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 defense appeared tired and sloppy, allowing Buffalo to defeat them for the second time this season. The Kings headed to New Jersey next to face the Devils in a hard-fought special teams battle. Center An\u017ee Kopitar got Los Angeles on the board, scoring on a second-period shorthanded chance. The play started with Adrian Kempe evading defenders to set up an inside-slot opportunity that was blocked by Devils goaltender Nico Daws. Right there to backhand the rebound was Kopitar, giving the Kings a 1-0 lead.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s Tyler Toffoli evened the game minutes later on a Devils power play. Both Rittich and Daws made some incredible saves in net to set up a third-period-deciding game. With five minutes and 37 seconds left in regulation, Byfield tapped in the game-winner in the slot following a shot from Brandt Clarke. Los Angeles\u2019 defense held the fort down for the remainder of the game to earn a crucial win.\n\nByfield has undoubtedly been the Kings\u2019 best player following the All-Star break. The 21-year-old now has 39 points and a plus-16 rating, helping his team in all facets of the game. This week, the Kings will play the Bruins, Penguins, Blue Jackets and Predators. Boston will be a tough task, holding 74 points and playing consistent winning hockey all year. However, the Bruins are also on a three-game skid, so the Kings might be able to take advantage of their recent woes. Columbus and Pittsburgh have struggled lately. Nashville only trails Los Angeles by four points in the Wild Card race, so Thursday\u2019s game will be a crucial matchup.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 first three games coming out of the All-Star break showed mixed results, but both wins were extremely vital. In a chaotic Western Conference, the Kings will need to stay resilient and repair defensive woes if they want to make the playoffs. Forgoing the Wild Card and finishing top-three in the Pacific is not out of the question either, but L.A. must be on the top of its game if it wants to jump the Oilers in the division. The Kings will take on the Bruins on Saturday at 9:30 a.m. PST at TD Garden.\n```"}

(Photo by Shantala Muruganujan)\n\nBy Ethan Galbraith\nFebruary 16, 2024 at 10:37 pm PST\n\nThe No. 10 Trojans started the Oregon road trip off strong with a 88-51 victory over the Oregon Ducks on Friday night at Matthew Knight Arena. USC wasted no time proving why they\u2019re a top-10 team in the nation, jumping out to a 15-2 lead before the Ducks called their first timeout. The Trojans continued the impressive shooting to a 29-7 lead after one quarter, punctuated by freshman guard Juju Watkins\u2019 14 points in the opening frame.\n\n\u201cWe just all had confidence in each other to make the right play, and then just take what they gave us,\u201d graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis said. \u201cSo it was really just a team effort and knowing what we did the first time and adjusting to the second game.\u201d\n\nThe second quarter was more of the same and culminated in a Watkins buzzer beater to give the Trojans a 57-21 lead going into the half.\n\nJUJU BUZZER BEATER TO  CLOSE OUT THE FIRST HALF!!! \n\u2014 USC Women's Basketball (@USCWBB)  February 17, 2024\n\nThe Ducks did not let the first half discourage them, as they went on a 10-0 run in the third quarter. However, the bigger story was Watkins taking a hard fall and quickly exiting the game before heading to the locker room. The Trojans maintained their composure despite Watkins\u2019 brief absence and kept the Ducks at arm\u2019s length, boasting a 70-42 lead going into the final quarter.\n\nWatkins returned in the fourth quarter and reached a total of 33 points, her 10th 30-point game of the season to tie USC legend Cheryl Miller for the most 30-point games in a season in Trojan history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be impressive to break a record as a freshman with X number of games left, but when you say \u2018broke Cheryl Miller\u2019s record,\u2019 it just speaks to the gravity of it,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about our young superstar, she just keeps getting better. She\u2019s coachable. She learns from the film.\u201d\n\nThe effort was apparent all game long and the stat sheet reflected it, as the Trojans outrebounded a Ducks team with a noticeable size advantage in 6-foot-7 sophomore forward Kennedy Basham and 6-foot-8 junior center Phillipina Kyei.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a testament to all of us. It\u2019s a team effort,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe have to box out the bigs, our guards [are behind] and we know they have our back and we have theirs.\u201d\n\nDavis in particular was a standout on the glass, as she finished with her first double-double in a Trojan uniform to go along with five assists.\n\n\u201cShe was complete. She\u2019s an X-factor for us,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI know she doesn\u2019t maybe get as much attention as our top scorers. But for us to be as good as we want to be, she\u2019s gotta be really good and she was.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will play No. 11 Oregon State in Corvallis on Sunday, a team coming off three straight ranked wins.\n```"}

Long Beach native and UCLA graduate Patrick Cantlay continued to hold onto his lead in the Genesis Invitational with a five-stroke advantage, while Burbank native Max Homa shot up the leaderboard 49 spots to finish the day tied for 11th.\n\nAfter finishing Thursday with eight birdies and holding a one-shot lead, Cantlay opened up his day with an eagle on the par-5 first hole. He continued his consistent form onto the back nine, where he upped his score from a 2-under to a 6-under-par 65, tied for the lowest total score of the day. Cantlay\u2019s five-stroke lead after the second round ties the tournament record for the largest lead after two days of play. Cantlay heads into Saturday at 13 under par.\n\n\u201cPutting great and leaving the golf ball in the right spot is really key around here,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cIt\u2019s a golf course I\u2019m really comfortable on, and it\u2019s in the best shape I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Cantlay noted that his experience at the Riviera Country Club really helps, as UCLA is only 5 miles away from the course. He says he\u2019s played on the course roughly 20-25 times, and during his sophomore season with the Bruins, he competed in the NCAA Championships held at Riviera.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a home game, because it\u2019s a golf course I played so many times and I feel comfortable,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have a bunch of guys from Virginia Country Club \u2014 where I grew up just down the road \u2014 come visit.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Homa had a dreadful start in Thursday\u2019s first round. He finished with a score of 73, good for 2 over par, which included two bogeys and a double bogey. The poor performance was unusual for Homa, who has had plenty of success at Riviera in the past. The Burbank native grew up 23 miles away from the course and attended the Genesis Invitational as a kid. After playing his college ball at Cal Berkeley, Homa moved to Valencia and became a hometown hero by winning the tournament in 2021.\n\n\u201cI love it here,\u201d Homa said. \u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t for the fans, which is an amazing added bonus, just getting to play this golf course is a true treat. Then to get to do it in front of my friends and family, and then a lot of people I don\u2019t know who are quite kind, it\u2019s a pleasure for me.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Homa played remarkably well. He also finished with a score of 65, tying Cantlay, Mackenzie Hughes and Corey Connors for the hot round. Homa had a similar day to Cantlay\u2019s first round, collecting eight birdies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been really waiting for the last few months to make a couple putts and just make things a shade easier on myself,\u201d Homa said. \u201cI hit my irons better than yesterday, but just yesterday, if you can\u2019t make anything, it makes you feel like you\u2019ve got to play too perfect.\u201d\n\nHeading into the third round on Saturday, Homa will look to continue his scorching momentum as the current hottest golfer in the tournament, while Cantlay will try to improve upon his already substantial lead. Homa will tee off with Mission Viejo native Beau Hossler at 10:30 a.m. Cantlay will go last, starting his day at 11:40 a.m. with Luke List, who\u2019s currently in second place at 8 under par.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Reza Allah-Bakhshi/Capture Imaging)\n\nBy Sara Balanta and Kailee Bryant\nFebruary 16, 2024 at 5:51 pm PST\n\nWhen America Ferrera began her studies as an international relations major at USC, one question continuously plagued her: \u201cHow can you exist in a world this messed up and go pursue art?\u201d With a desire to uplift underrepresented voices, Ferrera believed sacrificing her professional acting career was necessary to initiate social justice advocacy. From launching \u201cShe Se Puede\u201d Latino voting campaigns to highlighting gender inequity through her role in \u201cBarbie,\u201d Ferrera has since then found her dueling pathways converging into her own multidisciplinary medium: storytelling.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the USC School of Dramatic Arts honored Ferrera with their second annual Multihyphenate Award, a recognition that celebrates versatility and innovation in the entertainment industry. SDA Dean Emily Roxworthy opened the ceremony, commemorating Ferrera\u2019s iconic roles in \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d \u201cReal Women Have Curves,\u201d \u201cUgly Betty,\u201d \u201cSuperStore\u201d and \u201cBarbie.\u201d\n\nAs USC students anticipated the appearance of the Oscar nominee, a sea of applause shocked the Bing Theatre with a surprise entrance by USC President Carol Folt. \u201cAcross our campuses, people are really doing this interdisciplinary work, but to be multi-hyphenated means you need to take it even deeper into these different parts,\u201d Folt said when she presented the award. \u201cA real multi-hyphenate like America Ferrara meets this challenge with boldness, and with immense versatility, but also with humanity. And I think that\u2019s what touches us all. Seeing that limitless potential for storytelling in every single form.\u201d\n\nChicano playwright and SDA faculty member Luis Alfaro joined Ferrera onstage, in conversation on the essential nature of multidisciplinary artistry. The pair created an intimate environment, chronicling Ferrera\u2019s journey from L.A. theater programs to USC and her artistic position as a \u201cmessenger of culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got so emotional when I learned that the award that you all wanted to give me was the multihyphenate award because that is the essence of my story in my life, but absolutely the essence of the struggle that I had here when I was at USC,\u201d Ferrera said. \u201cAt the time, I felt the pressure that every choice that I made was going to define the rest of my life and that I had to choose right.\u201d\n\nFrom a young age, Ferrera desired to not only be an actress but also a human rights lawyer. At just five years old, she knew \u201cthere was more than just one lane, one path, one title.\u201d Although struck with limited resources, she continued her pursuit of acting, taking three-hour bus rides to local playhouses and seizing every chance in sight to express her love for acting.\n\n\u201cI was raised by a single immigrant mother who struggled to keep the lights on and hot water coming out of the sink and I had this insane dream, and nobody thought it was possible...the odds were insane that someone like me would build this career,\u201d Ferrera said.\n\nAt 17, Ferrera made her dynamic film debut with her leading role in \u201cReal Women Have Curves,\u201d a movie that navigates a high school girl\u2019s complicated relationship with her body, womanhood and her Mexican American family. Assuming more senior production roles, Ferrera\u2019s involvements continue to elevate marginalized narratives. Most recently, in her upcoming directorial debut for the adaptation of the best-selling novel, \u201cI Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,\u201d Ferrera opens the door for authentic Latino representation on screen.\n\n\u201cNow as a [director and] producer, because of the access that I managed to get...I know and assume that a big part of my job is to create opportunity and to create access for others in spaces where if I was not there knocking down that door, no one would be knocking\u201d Ferrera said.\n\nLuis Alfaro guided the conversation with America Ferrera on Sunday. (Photo courtesy of Reza Allah-Bakhshi/Capture Imaging)\n\nEnsuring that pipelines of opportunity are available to other creatives of color is central to Ferrera\u2019s mission. Alfaro described that Ferrra\u2019s work enables students to feel their aspirations are never too out of reach.\n\n\u201cThere is so much hope and dreams in the idea that us people of color and women, anybody in this room, we can project something onto you which is: there is a future and there is a possibility for all of us. Not only in the arts but in the expression of our world,\u201d Alfaro said to Ferrera.\n\nSophomore BFA Acting student Kal\u0101lapa Winters said Ferrera\u2019s mission of representing communities that are often overlooked in the media resonated with her.\n\n\u201cMy entire goal in life is to bring authentic representation to Hawaiian women on screen, but I also have, [for] my entire life, been a huge activist,\u201d Winters said. \u201cI have felt multiple times in my life and in my career the same way [Ferrera] has about having to choose something, and stick to it...I felt really seen and heard by what she was saying.\u201d\n\nFerrera concluded the conversation with what she noted as the most important moment during her time at USC. While she questioned the trajectory of her career, the late international relations professor, Dr. David Andrus revealed his struggle of connecting with one of his mentees, a Latina high school student in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to understand what I\u2019m up against, then come watch this movie with me,\u201d she told him. The film she took him to see was Ferrara\u2019s \u201cReal Women Have Curves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to say that to every single kid in this room...what you have to contribute to the world uniquely will come from embracing all of the things you love. All of them. And not deciding that that doesn\u2019t have a place in the story of your career or the story of your legacy,\u201d Ferrera said. \u201cI do believe that if you follow that passion, all of them, you will get to the place where you are bringing through the thing that no one else in this world can.\u201d```"}

Photo Courtesy of Sideshow / Janus Films.\n\nBy Jaelyn Gonzalez February 16, 2024 at 5:07 pm PST\n\nIn the recently limited release, \u201cT\u00f3tem,\u201d noise is comfort. Lila Avil\u00e9s designs a busy nature and chaos that never becomes distracting. The film is set on Sol (Na\u00edma Sent\u00edes), a 7-year-old girl in a typically large and connected family. Dog barks, chatter on the phone and music is the score for 95 minutes. It\u2019s Avil\u00e9s\u2019 way to connect you closer to Sol and inside this Mexican family\u2019s home.\n\nSol and her mother Luc\u00eda (Iazua Larios) exchange laughs before the girl brings up her dying father Tona (Mateo Garc\u00eda Elizondo). When she arrives at her grandfather\u2019s house she is greeted by the rest of her family as they prepare for Tona\u2019s birthday party. As time grows, more traffic arrives in the home, yet Sol isolates herself and squeezes the feelings of being alone.\n\nEarly in the film, Sol is curious about her father as he is kept away from her upstairs. Tensions rise as conversations about money for treatment and other bills arise in the background. As Sol is trying to figure out what is happening to her father and family, so is the audience \u2014 it is a careful unraveling.\n\nDespite its naturally devastating plot, the tone of the film is distracted by a comforting family dynamic. The playful teasing of cousins and bantering between sisters are gestures that feel close and relatable. Most notably, the film is a slice of Mexican life; a bustling home, the newspaper cone used to heal an earache, the crowded walls, the women ruling the home, endearing names and notes of spirituality. It is immersive and is as if you are at Tona\u2019s party with the family.\n\nIts familiarity is a double-edged sword, as these shots taking up screentime will either connect with audiences or be left unappreciated. What makes the connection so intimate is the camera work by Diego Tenorio. Tenorio leaves you craving to see more and more. But, its focus on characters and expression is what creates harmony on screen. Most notably when Sol is allowed to see her father.\n\nThe intimacy within these moments becomes tearful. Previously, all the shots of ill Tona were cold and colored in greys and blues. When Tona is around his daughter and family, the lights glimmer with warmth \u2014 symbolizing the last embrace. Mateo Garc\u00eda Elizondo meets Na\u00edma Sent\u00edes with an equally warm-hearted performance, creating a clasp and visual bond within the film.\n\nThe contrast of Tona alone is paralleled by the reunion with Sol makes for a teary moment. Every breathing second with the two is gentle. Their loving caress is one you can experience yourself.\n\nBut what the film does best is understand what it means to experience grief as a child. Sol is experiencing the loss of her childhood, constantly being reminded by her family. She is given gifts and hears pity from her tios. In frustration with her emotions, she becomes \u201crebellious\u201d as her family has labeled her. Sol is the picture of grief. Her questions about her father and wishes for his health to become better position her in situations of denial and bargaining. Her avoidance is a representation of all who become submerged in loss.\n\nIt is a stomach-turning feeling to watch a girl become forced to grow up. What filmmakers often forget about creating a movie about grief is life before death. To see a loved one slipping away might even be more painful than the process after. The days before the passing are the ones you remember more than the days after.\n\nAvil\u00e9s\u2019 direction and the performances by this cast, take this sentiment to life on screen. Nuri (Montserrat Mara\u00f1on) on the floor in T\u00f3tem. Photo Courtesy of Sideshow / Janus Films.\n\nAvil\u00e9s and Tenorio create a picture of pain outside of Sol within the women of the film. It is a typical matriarchal structure in the house as the sisters attempt to manage their feelings. At the same time, they are figuring out finances and tending to the children of the house while pretending everything is alright. A moment of weakness is shown as Nuri (Montserrat Mara\u00f1on), Tona\u2019s sister, falls to the floor of desperation.\n\nThe moments mean even more with performances that drive the film forward and pull the entire cast together. What will displease some viewers is its visual reliance. Avil\u00e9s\u2019 screenplay is a light stack of pages and emphasizes \u201cshow not tell.\u201d It is expected to see \u201cT\u00f3tem\u201d face criticisms of \u201clack of plot,\u201d due to its limited screenplay and a day\u2019s timeline. It is unfortunate the film was only shortlisted for Best International Feature at the Oscars, as its emotional density is one of the best from this year\u2019s list.\n```"}

With the NBA All-Star weekend coming up, some of these former Trojans have been performing at All-Star caliber levels recently, even if they didn\u2019t make the game itself. In the past seven days, six Trojans have suited up on NBA hardwood. This week, we\u2019ll call attention to two Los Angeles natives and former lottery selections, both on teams competing for playoff spots in the Eastern Conference.\n\nOnyeka Okongwu\nOnyeka Okongwu has made a remarkable contribution for the Atlanta Hawks as a starter. Since replacing starting center Clint Capela, the former Chino Hills High School star and California Mr. Basketball has averaged around 33 minutes a night and made leaps offensively, scoring in double digits in his previous nine consecutive games. The former No. 6 pick from the 2020 Draft began his week with one of his most efficient nights of the season. Okongwu and the Hawks faced the Philadelphia 76ers on Feb. 9, where Okongwu scored 21 and with hyper-efficient 75/50/100 splits in a crucial victory against the Embiid-less Sixers.\n\nOkongwu followed that up with a defensively solid game against the Houston Rockets. On the second night of a back-to-back, the 23-year-old notched just 11 points but added three blocks in the Hawks\u2019 second win in as many games. It marked the fourth time this season that Okongwu has blocked three shots or more in a game.\n\nTwo nights later, in a matchup of play-in tournament contenders, the Hawks and the Chicago Bulls, the former First Team All-Pac-12 big man racked up a double-double against the Bulls. He chalked up 11 points and 12 boards in a critical loss. However, it would go from bad to worse for the Hawks, as their part-time starting center was ruled out in their Valentine\u2019s Day matchup against the Charlotte Hornets. It was revealed that Okongwu will be out for at least a week with a toe injury, but the Hawks are optimistic that his return will be imminent after All-Star weekend, and they\u2019ll need him back soon to continue their playoff push.\n\nDeMar DeRozan\nDeebo has been scorching hot since the start of the month. In his last six games, he has scored 20-plus points, averaging 28 points per game, officially proving himself an All-Star snub. The Compton native began last week in the midst of a four-game away trip southeast against the Orlando Magic. The 14-year veteran notched 28 points with only one made three-pointer in a six-point loss in Florida.\n\nThe 34-year-old continued his scoring rampage against Okongwu\u2019s Hawks two nights later. In a matchup featuring three former Trojans, including Nikola Vucevic. DeRozan proved that he is still the alpha in a long-standing line of USC men\u2019s basketball in the pros. The former No. 10 pick in the 2009 NBA draft scored 29 points on 59% shooting en route to a double-digit victory between two current play-in teams.\n\nIn his last matchup prior to the All-Star break, the six-time NBA All-Star continued his insane scoring streak against the division rival Cleveland Cavaliers and another former Trojan in Evan Mobley. DeRozan tallied 24 points and six dimes in a single-possession loss on Valentine\u2019s Day. The two-time All-NBA forward has been excellent at drawing fouls during his scoring run, averaging eight free throws in his last three matchups. He and the Bulls will hope he keeps his form past the All-Star break.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Cover by Jillian Adel and courtesy of The Criterion Collection.\n\nBy Lyla Bhalla-Ladd February 16, 2024 at 4:48 pm PST\n\nWhen the Czechoslovakian Government banned \u201cDaisies\u201d (1966) for \u201cdepicting the wanton,\u201d they produced the most succinct, accurate film review of it thus far. In a new form of recklessness, of true promiscuity, \u201cDaisies\u201d lets all desires run free and embraces vices without inhibition. For women in the 1960\u2032s, it was a daring fantasy.\n\nIn Vera Chytilov\u00e1's avant-garde, surrealist film, which features two friends both named Marie who con the world around them for food, drinks and entertainment, it\u2019s easy to slap on a \u201cfeminist film\u201d label. But as the girl\u2019s tricks and foolishness push the boundaries of societal norms, a more complex, universal sentiment of dissatisfaction summates the resulting radical social rebellion.\n\nThe film opens with a summer scene of the Maries declaring, \u201cWhen everything is being spoiled, we\u2019ll be spoiled, too.\u201d The film follows the girls through a fragmented timeline of dinner dates and mornings in their shared apartment. Each night, one Marie secures a date with a different older man. The other Marie then joins the dinner to exhaust the men and the dinner tab. Afterward, the girls trick the men into thinking they will follow them on a train out of town. But each time, at the last minute, they hop off the moving car and return home.\n\nWildly amused by their scheme, the girls continue this every day. When they are not out on their routine, they are lounging in their apartment eating, drinking and bathing. The girls indulge in bourgeois pleasures and spoil their lives. Their opulent escapades leave them each day full, drunk and giggling at each other.\n\nMany critiques of this film have interpreted the girls as a feminist statement of unapologetic girlhood, but such an analysis is too shallow. The Maries take their gleeful revenge on gullible men, standards of formality, the prioritization of images, their apartment and even at times, each other. Their indulgent lives read better as an experiment in consumerist, post-industrial life in which the surrounding world is at war and exploitative.\n\nThe Maries react to this Nietzschean desert by abusing the same world that abuses them. These ideals did not go over well with Czechoslovakian authorities at first. Chytilov\u00e1 was banned from filmmaking for seven years after \u201cDaisies\u201d premiered in 1966 in Paris. She was only permitted to return to work on the terms that her films be more \u201crealistic,\u201d fittingly two years before the Prague Spring.\n\nMany journalists have called Chytilov\u00e1 a feminist filmmaker, as her films always almost center on female narratives. However, she repeatedly rejected the feminist label and protested that she was an individualist and that \u201cseeking messages of feminism in her films is the shallowest possible way to interpret their meaning.\u201d\n\nThe Maries lay in bed all day, eat like animals whenever they could and roll in the filth of their apartment. Yet, they eat their food with rollers in their hair, in anticipation of their later games with men. They\u2019re penniless ladies. They take their a-line dresses and kitten heels to smuggle wine bottles into bars for cheap drinks. They leave the phone ringing until their attention is free. They gaze innocently into their lovers\u2019 eyes, getting more naked to elicit more meaningless love and then forget their names.\n\nPerhaps the feminist wave which Chytilov\u00e1 was referring to \u2013 one which encouraged women to become men to conquer and usurp them \u2013 was unfit to claim \u201cDaisies\u201d. Images of drowning a man\u2019s likeness in a bathtub of milk, grossly chomping on phallic foods while a lover professes his love over the phone, or forgetting that same lover\u2019s name might remind an audience of a past-wave feminist mindset. But truly, this is seen through the man-hating stereotypes of feminism and does not touch the larger point of nihilism and bliss that the girls truly experience.\n\nThe cons they construct are for their pleasure. The girls torment the world with their girlish playfulness, refusing to conform or act in expectation. The girls gain power over others not by becoming men, but by being women \u2014 and radical women at that. Toying with men\u2019s feelings is their fun, but they\u2019re not heroes to women either. They gawk at, embarrass, and steal from other women in the film as well, perhaps in Chytilov\u00e1's attempt to steer the movie from the feminist label slapped onto any film starring two women.\n\nNonetheless, distinctly female patterns emerge out of the character\u2019s impressive and poignant development. Each night that the Marie\u2019s go out for their charade to trap a man into their dinner bill, they make their pilgrimage to a women\u2019s restroom, where they visit their older friend. She sings to them and begs them to stay with her. She advises them and sews their dresses when they tear. Their daily routine includes a check-in with their local elder.\n\nDespite their rejection of the world, its values and its failures, they maintain a relationship with their maternal friend. In a welcome tangent from the girl\u2019s routine, they accidentally push their lunch date off the train and carry on to its destination themselves. They are dismayed to find that their tricks only work in the city. Out in the country, the girls lose all sense of self when they are ignored by the local farmers and workers. \u201cI thought we\u2019d disappeared,\u201d says one Marie to the other.\n\nIt is only when they see the mess they made on their way through town, throwing corn husks around in the street, that they are reminded of their being. \u201cWe are, we are, we are,\u201d they chant to themselves in happy witnessing of their chaos. They wreck, therefore they are. Their nihilist ways escape them in the country. The men there do not fall for their tricks and they lose their self-conception.\n\nChytilov\u00e1 asks us, in the city, what do we consider sacrosanct behavior and norms and outside of our industrial, consumerist land, what nonconformists are without their mocking of it? The girls find a grand dining room and an accompanying feast in their final act. They indulge and play among the spoils of meats and cakes and liquor until eventually descending into pure gluttony.\n\nIn this scene, the girls progress around the setting until they have taken every seat at the table. In the following food fight and chandelier swing, the girls have their first and only moral \u201cteaching\u201d of the film. Upon falling from the chandelier, the girls fall into a river. The text over the scene proclaims \u201cThat was the only way for them to end up.\u201d When they call themselves spoiled, help from a nearby ship is rejected and it is assumed that the girls drown in their ways.\n\nDaisies (1966) Courtesy of The Criterion Collection.\n\nWith an unorthodox narrative choice, however, Chytilov\u00e1 explores an alternative ending. The text proclaims \u201cand even if they were given a chance,\u201d and the audience is afforded the hypothetical redemption for the girls. Following, the girls return to the dining room, wrapped in the news of the world (thus aware) and promptly begin to make amends \u2014 placing the broken plates back on their settings, three wine glass stems in position, too. The girls scoop the muddled cakes and foods back onto their silver platters and hang the stained drapes back up. The girls lie amongst their repentance and affirm \u201cWe\u2019re so happy\u201d until the chandelier finally falls on them.\n\nChytilov\u00e1 ultimately punishes the girls for their Sardanapalian debauchery. Although the girls comedically embrace the pleasures of their world as protagonists, they are ultimately a cautionary tale in the fruitless labor of trading one extreme for another. In the Czechoslovakian age of socialism and strict values of \u2018realism,\u2019 Chytilov\u00e1's wisdom in \u201cDaisies\u201d lets us see the consequences of what many demanded in reaction to the political climate.\n\nThe exempt character of \u201cDaisies\u201d, the woman whom they visit in the bathroom, represents a passive stance in Chytilov\u00e1's world as she cares for the girls and wishes for them to stay with her rather than engage in their sprees. She may be the more accurate alternate ending. We are warned to either be consumed by our extreme (one or the other) or to fall back and watch others along the same path.\n\n\u201cDaisies\u201d reminds us to indulge slightly in our fleeting time, but not attempt to take back from the world what it takes from us, a parable in moderation and patience and one we still need 60 years later.\n```"}

Woods was also limping throughout the start of the second round. \u201cI was so disappointed to see Tiger struggling to walk on hole 3, he looked miserable and very uncomfortable,\u201d longtime PGA spectator Glen Davidson said. It has not been released whether Woods will make an appearance as the host of the tournament on Saturday or Sunday. For Woods, the beginning of the second round ran similarly to the first. Despite birdieing the first hole two days in a row, Woods\u2019 game became weaker as the day went on. Woods had two bogeys in a row and finished hole 6 with a par before calling it quits at 2 over par for the tournament and 1 over on the day. At the time, Woods was fighting to stay in the tournament, with the projected cut line currently at 1 over. Woods has yet to comment on his illness.\n```"}

Department of Public Safety (DPS) officers patrolling the area witnessed the scene and responded immediately. \u201cOur officers came across a three car collision where one vehicle had spun out of control, crashed and severed a city light pole and the collision caused the pole to fall and there were exposed live power wires on the sidewalk,\u201d said DPS Chief Assistant David Carlisle. DPS officers immediately contacted the Los Angeles Police Department to investigate the accident. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were also asked to visit the scene due to the downed power lines. Carlisle also spoke on how DPS was able to provide their services during this incident. \u201cAs a result of that collision, westbound traffic on Jefferson from McClintock was blocked, so we issued a USCTrojansAlert to let people know to seek an alternate route in case they had to pass by that location,\u201d Carlisle said. DPS alerted USC students three times through email and once by text to let them know that there was an accident around campus. In addition to updates as the situation was ongoing, they sent out a final update to let students know that the area was cleared as safe to enter. LADWP also sent out three alerts addressing the power lines being down after the accident took place. Despite the crashing of the power lines, there was no indication that power went out on that street for any USC buildings. Melissa Gutierrez, a student majoring in health promotions, has lived in the area where the collision happened for a year. She mentioned how it seems that accidents on those streets occur frequently. \u201cIt\u2019s almost been a year and I can almost count at least four accidents that have happened just at the intersection,\u201d Gutierrez said. Jefferson Boulevard, between McClintock Avenue and Orchard Avenue is a busy intersection on campus where many students cross daily. The accident occurred right near popular areas at University Park Campus, such as the USC Village and the Lyon Recreational Center. The accident also affected transportation; it blocked off the primary route the shuttles for the Lorenzo take when picking up USC students, as well as one of the L.A. Metro bus stops. Carlisle also mentioned how DPS managed the area after the collision, \u201cWe kept the destructions away from where the damaged pole had fallen because there potentially were hotwires on the roadway, so we assisted in this situation by keeping traffic and pedestrians from moving into the area where the collision occurred and where the wires were at.\u201d Significant damage was done to the vehicles as they were towed from the scene. Carlisle mentioned that despite this accident occurring in USC\u2019s vicinity, there were no USC students involved in this accident. The north side of Jefferson Boulevard was closed for approximately two hours after the incident and reopened later that night.\n```"}

But due to strategic misfires and an inability to push back against the presidents and chancellors of the remaining Pac-12 schools, the conference ultimately collapsed, leaving Oregon State and Washington State as the lone remaining universities.\n\nAfter serving as the president of entertainment and sports for MGM International, Kliavkoff was hired on July 1, 2021, signing a five-year contract and replacing outgoing commissioner Larry Scott. At the time, he was highly regarded by the presidents and chancellors. Former Oregon President Michael Schill, who was the chair of the search committee that landed Kliavkoff and also the former chair of the conference\u2019s board of directors prior to his departure to Northwestern, praised Kliavkoff and his past experiences in media and professional sports.\n\nPrior to MGM, Kliavkoff\u2019s past employers include Hearst, the MLB, the Las Vegas Aces, the WNBA, and NBCUniversal. Schill described him as a  \u201cvisionary leader with an extraordinary background as a pioneering sports, entertainment and digital media executive.\u201d\n\nDespite the praise that he received when he was appointed commissioner, Kliavkoff\u2019s tenure would become defined by his inability to secure a satisfactory media deal after USC and UCLA decided to leave. At one point during the negotiations, ESPN offered $300 million per year for the Pac-12,  according to John Canzano. But Utah President Taylor Randall, with the help of a professor at his school, suggested Kliavkoff counter with $500 million, to which ESPN refused to entertain,  according to Canzano.  After that, deadlines came and went, and eventually, after losing patience with the process, Colorado decided to return to the Big 12 Conference on July 27, 2023.\n\nOn August 1, Kliavkoff presented an all-in streaming deal with Apple, worth $23 million per school annually, with incentives to increase financial distributions should certain streaming quotas be met,  according to ESPN . This deal was not well-received, prompting Oregon and Washington to accept membership in the Big Ten on August 4. Later that day, Utah, Arizona and Arizona State announced that they would join Colorado in the Big 12.\n\nWith four members left in the Pac-12 at the time, Stanford and California began looking for an exit out of the conference. On September 1, after weeks of speculation and controversy, the Cardinal and Golden Bears were accepted by the ACC along with SMU, leaving Oregon State and Washington State as the lone remaining Pac-12 members after the 2023-24 college sports season ends.\n\nWorried that their outgoing members might try to dissolve the conference after Kliavkoff called a meeting on September 13, the Beavers and Cougars sued the Pac-12 and Kliavkoff over control of the board of directors on September 8. The two schools ultimately prevailed, settling the case with the 10 outgoing schools on December 21 and taking full control over the conference.\n\nWith Kliavkoff gone in less than two weeks and the outgoing members out the door this summer, Oregon State and Washington State plan to compete as a two-team league. They will take advantage of the NCAA\u2019s two-year grace period to rebuild the Pac-12 back up to the minimum eight teams required for collegiate sports conferences.\n\nIn order to schedule games, the Beavers and Cougars have entered into a scheduling partnership with the Mountain West Conference for football, and have announced plans to join the West Coast Conference for the majority of their other sports teams as affiliate members.\n```"}

Nicky Taylor, Co-President of Fourth Quarter All-Stars expressed their enthusiasm for the different performers, personalities and types of sketches set to take the stage. \u201cI think it\u2019s something really, really special and I\u2019m really happy that we get to host that,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe troupes will perform a total of six hours over the two-day festival at the Massman Theatre, just across the way from Cap and Gown on USC\u2019s University Park campus, with 30-minute long back-to-back sets. Friday\u2019s performances are set to start at 8:30 pm while Saturday\u2019s show will begin at 5:00pm.\n\nUSC-based sketch comedy groups, Fourth Quarter All-Stars (4QAS) and The Suspenders will perform. In addition to writing their own original material and performing, 4QAS founded and will host Sketchella. The festival also includes improv troupes, welcoming Second Nature, Merry Men, Spoiler Alert, Commedus Interruptus and Ludus Remedium to the show. The latter two also perform sketch comedy.\n\nThey will hold a moderated Q&A event with a \u201cspecial\u201d guest speaker from the comedy and TV world. Past guest speakers have included Jess Dweck, who worked on Big Mouth, Harley Quinn and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Falon, and Nick Adams, who has written for BoJack Horseman and Black-ish, according to the Sketchella website.\n\nSecond Nature and Merry Men will open the festival tomorrow night as a joint-show, performing a combination of short form improv games and a longform improv format known as \u201cArmando.\u201d \u201cThis is our first Sketchella,\u201d Maddy Curry, a senior theater major and Merry Men co-president, said. \u201cI\u2019ve known about it forever, but this is the first one the Merry Men are participating in.\u201d\n\nSecond Nature discussed what rehearsing with the Merry Men looked like. \u201cIt was lots of fun. We love them and like all the troops and rehearsing with them was a blast, so we\u2019re excited to perform with them.\u201d states Liam Stephenson, the social media manager for Second Nature.\n\nAfterwards, the newest mix-form comedy troupe, Ludus Remedium, will perform before the night ends with performances from The Suspenders and 4QAS, the longest running groups. Aside from the USC troupes, Sketchella will also host returning collegiate comedians from across the country, from Phoenix to Boston.\n\nSpoiler Alert and Commedus Interruptus kick off the second night of the festival followed by visiting troupes and ending once again with a performance from 4QAS. In regards to what 4QAS wants the audience to take away from the festival Co-President Taylor said, \u201cMainly, I think I would like them to take away all of the different ways and different forms that sketch comedy can take, and just theater can take.\u201d\n\nSketchella may be the Massman Theatre\u2019s last performance due to USC demolishing it next month to make room for new athletic renovations. Member of The Suspenders Vincent Demonte is set to perform at Sketchella, something they say is bittersweet. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history that goes on in that place, and I know for a lot of student organizations, they will have to start fighting for space,\u201d Demonte said.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: A previous version of this article misspelled two names.

I\u2019m an excellent rapper so long as the song I\u2019m rapping is \u201cLazy Sunday\u201d by Lonely Island. I once accurately defined \u201chasenpfeffer\u201d while watching \u201cJeopardy!\u201d with my dad. These are fun facts! I\u2019m a cool person! Given that everything I just shared barely scratches the surface of my life, I\u2019m absolutely certain that the most interesting thing about me is not that I will often choose to drink a mocktail over a cocktail. So, why is it that friends, family and people I\u2019ve just met disagree?\n\nI\u2019ve long grappled with my dislike of most alcoholic beverages. For the most part, I used to play along and drink whatever nasty concoction sloshed around in my Solo Cup just to fit in, but never with the same gusto as my peers. In high school, I attempted to hide this weird personality quirk by volunteering to be the designated driver as often as I could. On those nights, my friends praised me instead of punishing me for not drinking with them. In college, I lost that ready-made excuse, so I tried a little harder to be like everyone else around me. I drank what my friends drank, ordered cocktails at dinner and even pretended to like red wine before finally deciding the charade was unnecessary. It was getting exhausting. And expensive.\n\nBeing surrounded by the heavy drinking of my peers throughout my formative years, I was led to believe that I was alone in my dislike. Born in 1995, I\u2019m just barely considered a millennial, but for the Gen Zers who came after me, the glamorous world of projectile vomiting and debilitating hangovers has become less appealing. A report published in 2018 by Berenberg Research found that each subsequent generation consumes less alcohol than the previous generation, with Gen Z drinking about 20 percent less per capita than my millennial cohort.\n\nThis decrease in popularity could be attributed to the permanence of the internet and social media. Idiocy isn\u2019t as easily forgiven or forgotten with the advent of TikTok and Instagram. It could also be that we\u2019re more conscious of our health as a society. In 2023, we\u2019re smoking fewer cigarettes, adding Sea Moss gel to our smoothies and walking, hotly. Maybe it\u2019s because of the legalization of marijuana and the decriminalization of psychedelics in states like Colorado and Oregon. In the wake of these legal reforms, more people are turning to the \u201cCalifornia Sober\u201d lifestyle in which they eschew booze in favor of weed (and sometimes magic mushrooms). Or it could be that pop culture has shied away from glorifying binge drinking. TV shows like \u201cSex Education\u201d and the revamped \u201cGossip Girl\u201d place a stronger emphasis on the value of establishing clear boundaries, all while hammering home the negative effects of overconsumption.\n\nWhatever the reason, this trend is, well, trending. And I, for one, am ecstatic. Upon moving to Los Angeles, I found myself in the midst of a zero-proof revolution. The city is rife with opportunities to participate in social events that celebrate sobriety and is home to expertly curated non-alcoholic bottle shops in neighborhoods like Silver Lake, Brentwood, Studio City and Venice. Angelenos are embracing temperance and making it look cool.\n\nNewcomers to the L.A. teetotaler scene are sisters Priyanka and Chirasmita Kompella. They co-founded Zero Proofed in 2022, a pop-up that hosts booze-free events up and down the Westside, with the intention of reclaiming the word \u201cdrink.\u201d \u201cWe actually drink a lot of beverages throughout the day that aren\u2019t alcoholic, but for some reason we only say we\u2019re drinking when we\u2019re drinking alcoholic beverages,\u201d says the duo. \u201cAnd we want to take the word back.\u201d\n\nAt some point in time, a word that used to apply to any and all libations took on a life of its own, so much so that it now carries the weight of the entire alcohol industry. Just in this article, I\u2019ve already used the word at least seven times without clarifying what I was drinking. The ethanol is implicit. By stripping the implication of alcohol from the word, it normalizes sobriety and is a step toward inclusivity and destigmatization. This is the motivation behind Zero Proofed.\n\nThe events, from Halloween parties in Venice to pop-up speakeasies in Culver City, make it possible for sober and sober-curious people to engage with bar culture in a judgment-free space. Priyanka and Chirasmita Kompella of Zero Proofed. Photo courtesy of Zero Proofed. \u201cI want the option to have a sophisticated cocktail after a crazy day of work and just have that ritual of drinking something,\u201d says Priyanka, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to alter my mental state.\u201d \u201cEveryone is allowed to have a night off. It\u2019s about grabbing a nice drink, meeting people, and talking about your day,\u201d adds Chirasmita.\n\nBrianda Gonzalez is likewise interested in making a booze-free existence fun with her bottle shop, The New Bar. She opened her store in Venice in 2022 as a way of connecting with her bartender father after he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that precludes him from drinking alcohol. In opening The New Bar, she discovered an entire community of people who were also eager to engage in a semi-sober lifestyle for a multitude of reasons. Brianna Gonzalez outside of The New Bar. Photo courtesy of Nihal Shaikh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having a more thoughtful and mindful relationship with alcohol, and choosing when you want to participate in it rather than drinking it by default because it\u2019s the only option or because it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been conditioned to do,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cIn the United States, and I think even internationally, the conversation has shifted so much around where these drinks might belong, who drinks them and how they can be incorporated into everybody\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nGonzalez still drinks alcohol, albeit way less often, which is representative of the typical consumer in this category. Courtney Balzer, Chief Marketing Officer of Boisson\u2014a non-alcoholic bottle shop with eight stores across New York, L.A. and San Francisco\u2014describes their typical consumer as someone fairly young (between the ages of 28 and 45) with a household income of about $250,000 per year. In general, more women shop in their stores than men (60/40 split) and they live in large metropolitan cities. Following the same trend, most people who shop with them also drink alcohol.\n\nOn a national level, only 14 percent of people who engage with non-alcoholic spirits fully abstain from drinking alcohol, while the remainder are dabbling in moderation as a way of practicing mindfulness and prioritizing health. Finding opportunities to drink less is easier said than done for many people. By and large, these bottle shops have been marketed to wealthier individuals who have the means and social capital to experiment with sobriety. In the Latine community where drinking mezcal, tequila, rum, and beer can often be viewed as part of the culture, not participating can be alienating.\n\nPablo Murillo and Morris Ellis founded the pop-up Bar Nuda as a way of shifting this mindset. They want to foster inclusion and promote sober fun by serving mocktails infused with the flavors of Mexico. Bryant Orozco, Bar Nuda\u2019s resident bartender, told the \u201cLos Angeles Times\u201d: \u201cFor me, it\u2019s very important we have a space for people who either identify as Hispanic or Latino. [These mocktails] represent our culture with our herbs or spices that I\u2019m bringing from Mexico. It\u2019s a way to say, \u2018Hey, we can enjoy, we can have fun and create these spaces and environments.\u201d\n\nThe Zero Proofed Speakeasy in the Culver Hotel Velvet Lounge. Photo courtesy of Brian Ho\n\nIn this new world of non-alcoholic spirits and events, where do people under the age of 21 fit in? The short answer is that they don\u2019t. The long answer is that these pop-ups and bottle shops exist as an alternative for people who can legally engage with alcohol. For the Kompella sisters, their events are designed for working professionals to let loose and socialize. They want to capture the sophistication of a bar and demonstrate the potential of non-alcoholic mixology. The desired vibe doesn\u2019t leave room for a younger generation that hasn\u2019t developed an appreciation for alcohol beyond its ABV.\n\nPsychology, it seems, would agree that this space isn\u2019t meant for people under the legal drinking age. Dr. Adam Leventhal, director of the Institute for Addiction Science at the University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, says, \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting question for a young person. You can, of course, see the risks if it\u2019s acclimating them to a culture of drinking at an earlier age. In general, when you expose something to someone at a younger age, the worse it can become for them.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re all still trying to navigate this completely novel industry. As with anything new, there\u2019s a learning curve as consumers adjust. When I attended Zero Proofed\u2019s one-year anniversary party at Alana\u2019s Coffee Roasters at the end of September, I noticed that people are still figuring out what tastes good to them and how much they\u2019re willing to spend on mocktails. Zero Proofed one-year anniversary party. Photo by Liv Dansky of Ampersand LA.\n\nSober September brought Suzannah Nabers, 30, to the event. Like most in the category, she occasionally takes breaks from drinking alcohol, but isn\u2019t committed to a sober lifestyle. Manda Morrissey, 28, takes the same approach. When she\u2019s flirting with sobriety, Morrissey enjoys crafting her own non-alcoholic cocktails. She said, \u201cI think it\u2019s really fun making non-alcoholic drinks. There\u2019s more of a ritualistic aspect to making these drinks, and I can get more creative with them.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if they would spend the same amount of money on a mocktail as they would on a cocktail, both women said they wouldn\u2019t. \u201cIf the presentation is great and the quality of ingredients are really good, I would be willing to spend a little less than I would on a typical alcoholic drink,\u201d said Nabers, \u201cbut I expect them to be less expensive.\u201d\n\nThis idea that non-alcoholic cocktails aren\u2019t worth as much as their alcoholic counterparts is one of the major hurdles companies within this space have to overcome. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown accustomed to basically seeing the inherent value of a drink as so closely connected to the ethanol within it, right?\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m buying this drink to get drunk\u2019 and that\u2019s the value of the drink. If you start to think about the flavor and the complexity and the beauty of the liquid in your glass, you realize it\u2019s more about your ability to practice that kind of mindfulness. So, for me, I\u2019ve been able to see the value of a drink as much more than that.\u201d\n\nA similar emphasis on mindfulness and education is echoed by the Kompella sisters. Priyanka notes that the price of a beverage is impacted by more than its ingredients. Staff wages, rent, electricity, and all of the other costs that go into running a business contribute to what a customer pays for a drink (with or without alcohol) at a restaurant or bar. Chirasmita adds that non-alcoholic spirit companies \u201care coming up with these non-existent flavor profiles that represent an entirely new idea. The amount of capital that\u2019s involved in just creating the spirits before they even come to our bar is at a premium.\u201d\n\nBusinesses such as Zero Proofed, Bar Nuda, and The New Bar are slowly chipping away at the mystique that accompanies getting drunk and the palpable stigma that surrounds young people who choose not to imbibe. Personally, I\u2019m just looking forward to the day when I can order a drink, regardless of its alcohol content, at dinner without comment. There will be no explanations or justifications when I ask for the same seasonal shrub as my 12-year-old cousin. Likewise, there will be no shock or praise when I finish all of my spicy Bloody Mary because, yes, I\u2019ve discovered that some alcoholic drinks actually taste good to me. My order won\u2019t even register as something worth commenting on because it\u2019s really not all that interesting. Wouldn\u2019t our time be better spent betting on how many quarters I can fit in my belly button?\n```"}

The Trojans are shaping up for what could be their most successful season in years.\n\nEric Hammond returns for his third year in the cardinal and gold. (Photo by Bryson Nihipali)\n\nBy Riley Sager\nFebruary 16, 2024 at 8:30 am PST\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual time for USC baseball. With the renovation of Dedeaux Field just now starting, the Trojans will seek a second straight winning season without the comfort of home. Aside from hours of infamous L.A. traffic, construction presents other obstacles for the Trojans. Despite a 26-6 home record last year, USC struggled on the road, only winning six of their 22 true road games.\n\n\u201cWe have to learn to be mentally strong enough,\u201d head coach Andy Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe proved we weren\u2019t very good on the road last year, and now we\u2019re challenged to be on the road every game. We have no choice but to figure this thing out as a team.\u201d\n\nStankiewicz had an immediate impact on the program during his first year as head coach in 2023, leading the Trojans to their first winning season since 2015. USC has seen its lows in recent years, but Stankiewicz\u2019s extensive collegiate coaching experience has been a glimmer of faith for the Trojans. He won five regular-season Western Athletic Conference titles during his 11 years coaching at Grand Canyon and played seven seasons in MLB.\n\n\u201cThis year has a really good chance to be special,\u201d junior pitcher Caden Aoki said. \u201cThe way Coach Stankiewicz and the rest of the coaching staff are running this, I can only see it going up from here. They have an extreme desire to win, and I know they\u2019re going to do everything in their power to win.\u201d\n\nAoki, a 2023 transfer from Notre Dame, made last season\u2019s All-Pac-12 conference team as his 2.98 ERA led the Pac-12. While he focused the previous year on his transition from the ACC conference, Aoki\u2019s heading into this season feeling more confident in his performance on the field and leadership skills off the field.\n\n\u201cBeing a freshman [at Notre Dame] I had to work and prove myself just to play innings at all,\u201d Aoki said. \u201cComing to \u2018SC as a sophomore, I proved to myself that I was able to hang with a College World Series-caliber team.\u201d\n\nUSC relies heavily on new players to elevate the team. With this year\u2019s freshmen and incoming transfers accounting for 24 of the team\u2019s 40 players, Stankiewicz recognizes the pressure on the older guys to elevate their game. Freshman left-handed pitcher Mason Edwards and sophomore transfer right-handed pitcher Brock Blatter are two of the young players already making their powerful presence known on the mound.\n\nStankiewicz believes Edwards, who came to USC ranked the No. 6 left-handed pitcher in California and pitched a 1.15 ERA his 2023 senior season of high school, has already proved himself to be a potential starter. Aoki couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201c[Edwards] is incredible,\u201d Aoki said. \u201cThe way he is right now as a freshman, to be able to go out and do what he does every single week is remarkable. He has so much potential. ... I think he could be a first-rounder.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s 2024 season begins on the road in the Arizona-based MLB Desert Invitational. The Trojans take on Brigham Young on Friday at 4 p.m., followed by Saturday\u2019s 5 p.m. game against Grand Canyon, Stankiewicz\u2019s former team.

The Utes failed to hit double digits until there were about nine minutes remaining in the period.\n\nHead coach Andy Enfield started a \u201csmall ball\u201d lineup with three guards \u2014 freshman Isaiah Collier, senior Boogie Ellis and junior Kobe Johnson \u2014 alongside the positionally undersized Rodman and Morgan at the four and five spots. His lineup decision provided an interesting stylistic matchup with Utah, who went with a two-big starting five built around sophomore center Keba Keita and the team\u2019s leading scorer this season, senior center Branden Carlson.\n\nGoing into Thursday night, Utah ranked 22nd among all Division I programs in assists per game, which manifested in the Utes\u2019 desire to work the ball around the perimeter and create openings inside for Carlson and their other big men. Conventional wisdom would\u2019ve had Enfield match size with size, but USC\u2019s smaller lineups actually prevented Utah\u2019s bigs from finding momentum.\n\nCollier and Ellis, in particular, played aggressive perimeter defense on the opposing ball-handlers and forced plenty of early-possession steals. The Trojans finished with 10 steals, including four by Ellis.\n\nThe defensive effort was especially important for Ellis, who has struggled to find his shooting touch all season and especially of late; he went cold from beyond the arc again versus Utah. The Pac-12 Preseason First Team selection went 1-for-9 from distance on Thursday and scored 11 points \u2014 only his second game in double-digits since returning from injury against UCLA.\n\nAnd when it came to team basketball on the offensive end, USC\u2019s playmaking efforts were more effective than Utah\u2019s. The Trojans posted 20 assists on 26 buckets, compared to Utah\u2019s 14 assists to 22 made shots. The Trojans\u2019 ball security pleased their coach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to cut our turnovers down,\u201d Enfield said postgame. \u201cI thought our guys did a good job \u2014 when they didn\u2019t have [a shot], they didn\u2019t force it. They just moved it, they cut, set ball screens and worked pretty well to get good shots.\u201d\n\nEnfield also pointed out USC didn\u2019t even make that many of their open shots, going 5-for-25 from 3-point range on the night.\n\nIn his postgame press conference, Enfield lamented Ellis\u2019 untimely hamstring injury and how it has affected the final stretch of his college career.\n\n\u201cHe had a severe hamstring injury,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWhen he came back, you could see he was just not himself ... and tonight was his best game, just because of his energy and his effort.\u201d\n\nEnfield implied that Ellis still has a higher level to return to this season.\n\n\u201cHe had his two best practices this week in a month and a half, just because of his injuries, and so I can tell the way he\u2019s moving on both sides of the ball, that he\u2019s close to 100%,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nThe Trojans will host Colorado at Galen Center on Saturday, surely hoping to exact revenge for the Buffaloes\u2019 comeback win in Boulder, when USC held a 13-point lead going into the half and ended up losing by 10.\n```"}

(Photo by Hayes Flanagan)  By   Makena Arteaga February 15, 2024 at  9:47 pm PST \n \n \nFrom birdieing his first hole to bludgeoning his last, Tiger Woods made his debut of the 2024 PGA Tour season in the first round of the Genesis Invitational with a performance that left much to be desired. Woods ended Thursday tied for 49th at 1 over par, hitting eight of 14 fairways. \u201c[Today] was one of those days,\u201d Woods said after the round. \u201cJust never really got anything consistently going, and hopefully tomorrow I can clean it up.\u201d Filling his scorecard with seven pars, six bogeys and five birdies, Woods\u2019 strokes were sporadic. Although his five birdies were over his 2022-23 season average at 3.7 birdies per round, it was not enough to save Woods from the hits of the six bogeys. Even still, his longest drive reached 332 yards despite his myriad of recent injuries. Woods struggled at the last hole, surprising everyone by shanking one far into the crowd and then missing the par putt. \u201cI have traditionally not putted well here. This is a fader\u2019s delight \u2014 most of the holes, for a righty, run left to right,\u201d Woods said before the tournament. \u201cI\u2019ve driven it well here. There are small greens, and traditionally throughout my entire career, my iron game has been pretty good, but I have never really gotten hot with the putter at this course.\u201d Unfortunately for Woods, his suspicions became reality as he struggled to sink a putt on a majority of the holes Thursday. Regardless, Woods had a significant mass of fans following him to every hole. Despite playing in the invitational since 1992, Woods has never won it. \u201cA nice W would be nice, right?,\u201d Woods said. \u201cHopefully, I can figure something out and get myself in there in contention and maybe get a W at the end of the week.\u201d As the host of the event held at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, California, a win would be monumental for Woods. In last year\u2019s appearance at the Genesis Invitational, Woods finished 45th with a score of 1 under par, similar to his performance today. The opening round went just as strangely for the rest of the field, with players who have been doing well shooting a poor performance and vice versa. Top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler needed three putts on the 11th hole, causing him to hurl a ball into the bushes out of frustration. Right behind him was No. 2-ranked Rory McIlroy, who made back-to-back sixes on the back nine, had a three-putt from 8 feet and finished at T-64 at 3 over par. Justin Thomas was forced to play a shot off the concrete boundary wall, which went right back into the rough; he shot a 1-over-par 72. On the other hand, Jason Day and Luke List both finished round one bogey-free. The star of the first round was Patrick Cantlay, coming in with a 7-under-par 64. The Southern California native\u2019s performance was one to watch, with a variety of shots that ranged from world class to woeful. Cantlay started off strong, shooting 8 under par through the 14th hole, but started to lose momentum when he hit multiple gallery members and got stuck behind a sycamore tree. This was not enough to lose the top spot, but if Cantlay wants to keep the lead, a change will have to be made. \u201cOur group had good momentum, Jordan [Spieth] and I were a bunch under on the front nine,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cI putted really, really well, made every putt I should have and a couple longer ones. It was a good start.\u201d After Cantlay, the top five leaderboard currently consists of Cam Davis, Luke List and Jason Day tied for second at 6 under par, with Tom Hoge, Jordan Spieth and Will Zalatoris T-5 at 5 under par. Max Homa, who won the event in 2021, came in T-60 at 2 over par. During last year\u2019s tournament, Homa missed another win by just two strokes. \u201cIt felt like I was really trying to do my best in front of my friends and family, although I know they don\u2019t care,\u201d Homa said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why last year was hard, just because I felt like I was finally playing well. I had everybody out and didn\u2019t quite finish it. So I\u2019ve gotten kind of past the trying hard part.\u201d Defending champion Jon Rahm did not play due to his new contract with LIV Golf. As the players prepare for the second round on Friday, the Genesis stands to be a tournament to watch, whether the PGA\u2019s leaders start playing as such or not.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Paulena Edelman February 15, 2024 at 8:31 pm PST\n\nAs USC football prepares for spring ball, the team held a media availability session Thursday with head coach Lincoln Riley and the four newcomers \u2014 D\u2019Anton Lynn, Eric Henderson, Matt Entz and Doug Belk \u2014 to his defensive staff. It\u2019s a big offseason for USC as it prepares to enter a new conference.\n\n\u201cI can just tell [Riley] is determined to change that narrative needed to jump in the defense by staff and all the players,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cWe want to see what hasn\u2019t been.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have challenging games on the schedule. USC will open the season against LSU in Las Vegas. The team will then travel to Michigan about three weeks later for the first away game. Additionally, Penn State and Wisconsin, two historically strong programs, will play at the Coliseum, among other big games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving into a different phase at a different time for USC football, and we need to be both physically and mentally prepared for [that],\u201d Entz said. He was hired in December as USC\u2019s new linebackers coach and assistant head coach for defense after five seasons leading North Dakota State, where he won two FCS-level national championships.\n\nEveryone knows that USC\u2019s issue has never been its ability to score. The challenge in recent years has been having a good enough defense to stop the opposing team from doing the same.\n\n\u201cThe way the game is played is getting harder and harder on us for defense,\u201d defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn said. Last year, Lynn entered the college football scene as a coach for the first time and served as the defensive coordinator for UCLA. He transferred to USC because of \u201cthe history, the tradition, the great players and coaches.\u201d\n\nLynn intends to use a similar approach to coaching USC as he did with UCLA, by starting with building a strong foundation and introducing core concepts. \u201cWe want to make a little look like a lot. We move very, very slowly in the spring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe probably get half the playbook in the spring.\u201d\n\nLynn emphasized the need to move slowly in order to enhance future play. \u201cIt\u2019s about, in my opinion, just getting the basic fundamental foundation from a schematic standpoint, that way it\u2019s easier to add on to the bricks in the fall,\u201d he said. Lynn plans to adapt the scheme for his new players and to take it week-by-week.\n\nHenderson will be the co-defensive coordinator, run game coordinator and defensive line coach, and Belk will oversee the USC secondary. Both coaches have similar approaches toward challenging the players and pushing them to be the best versions of themselves.\n\nHenderson\u2019s coaching style is aggressive, focusing on a gritty mindset, because \u201cthose guys feed off me.\u201d His dedication to the players also stems from a need to help them through challenges and develop from the process. Henderson comes to USC after five seasons with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some type of impact you can have in a young person\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I look forward to.\u201d\n\nA large part of a successful defensive line is being able to rely on reactions and clear communication. Having clarity will allow USC to operate more effectively as a team and improve reaction times. \u201cWe can be reactive versus having to be process-oriented,\u201d Entz said.\n\nBelk, previously the defensive coordinator for the University of Houston, plans to focus on strengthening different communication aspects in order to give the team the greatest chance of success. His strategy for the upcoming season will also include challenging the players individually and altering teaching methods depending on their response.\n\nEntz brings yet another unique perspective to the game, talking about the power behind the USC logo, being attached to Riley and the importance of executing plays. \u201cYou\u2019re only as good as your players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I know, or what Coach Lynn knows. It\u2019s what they can understand and then regurgitate.\u201d\n\nAs the college football landscape has greatly changed over the past couple of years, Entz had numerous opportunities to continue elsewhere as a head coach. However, he was drawn to USC because of the numerous opportunities and agreed with Riley\u2019s vision.\n\nWhile working with Riley and the rest of the defensive staff, Entz has come to \u201cenjoy the camaraderie, the cohesiveness and the development that goes on in a position room.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s 2024 class saw the addition of players from the Midwest and Entz anticipates recruiting more players from there in the future because \u201cour footprint was relatively big throughout the Midwest\u201d when he coached at NDSU.\n\n\u201cThat excitement right off the bat is going to be tremendous,\u201d he said.\n\nEntrance into the new conference means significant road travel for the Trojans this season. Games will be played across the country, deviating from the West Coast to the East.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about tremendous travel,\u201d Entz said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing in Maryland. All of a sudden, a five-hour flight and a three-hour time change. There\u2019s a lot of uniqueness to the schedule this year.\u201d\n\nOverall, the initial approach seems to consist of assessing the Trojans\u2019 football IQ, establishing a baseline for training and holding the players accountable to the USC football standards on and off the field.\n\nBetween the almost completely new defensive coaching staff, the Trojans\u2019 move into the Big Ten and the big expectations of the USC fan base, it should make for an exciting season.\n\nSpring practice will begin on March 19, with the spring football game taking place on April 20 at noon at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum.\n```"}

Students can cast their vote in the upcoming week in support of their electoral candidates. USG\u2019s ballot will be both online and in-person, featuring a new change that includes a ranked-choice format. Students will be able to vote for a new USG president and vice president duo, as well as new senatorial candidates. Voting will begin this Tuesday and last until midnight Friday.\n\nThe ballots for the Presidential elections will be in ranked-choice format. This allows voters to list their first-choice option, second-choice option and so on. This change was petitioned by the Chief Justice, Nivea Krishnan.\n\nKrishnan: So the benefit with rank choice voting is that you actually get someone winning that gets the majority of the votes based on the way that rank choice voting is tabulated.\n\nWhile voting numbers have trended low in previous years, Chief Justice Krishnan believes students should get their money's worth for this election.\n\nKrishnan: The number that they need to remember it\u2019s $64. That is the amount from their tuition that they paid to the school that goes to funding student government. So regardless of your opinions on USG, the reality is you\u2019re paying for us to do this. That means that you should take a vested interest in ensuring that the people you elect are people that are going to be representing your interests and what you want to see at school.\n\nStudents can choose to vote in person at polling places on campus or online through USG\u2019s election platform. USG will update its website with an election form when polls open. Online voting will be available at all times of the day when the polls open. But, students can only vote in person at the polling places from 11:00 am until 4:00 p.m. Tuesday through Friday.\n\nIf students choose to vote in person, they can cast their vote at one of the booths on campus. The locations include Tommy Trojan, Alumni Park, Pardee Lawn, Leavey Library and SEIP Center.\n\nDuring voting week, there will be three vendors available Tuesday through Friday to award those who participate in the USG election. Once students submit their ballot, they can screenshot their voting confirmation to earn a free meal ticket for the day\u2019s designated vendor. On Tuesday, the vendor will be Fluff Ice, on Wednesday it will be Porto\u2019s and on Thursday it will be Dazzling Donuts.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Becca Speier.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story said that the new ranked choice voting system was used for both the presidential and senate races.

The recent trend of corporations raising prices has drawn attention to the history of Valentine\u2019s Day. Despite the stigma that college couples in the United States face immense pressure to overspend, some students argue that the experience is worthwhile.\n\n\u201cIt hurt the wallet very badly. I\u2019m a little broke but that\u2019s okay,\u201d Adam Rasland, a junior studying computer science said. \u201cI feel pressure to spend on Valentine\u2019s Day, but it\u2019s worth it to celebrate the day with her. It would also be a little weird asking her to split the check.\u201d\n\nAccording to a National Retail Federation study, Americans were expected to spend a record $14.2 billion on their partners during the holiday this year, or a little over $100 per person. The study also found that people between the ages of 18 and 24 typically spend around $97 on their valentine, a hefty price for a college student.\n\nEven with a high price range for students, many felt the price shouldn\u2019t matter when you are celebrating each other\u2019s love. \u201cI like to go fancy, not saying you have to go all out, but you have to spend a little bit of money,\u201d senior Marcelino Martinez, studying computer science, said. \u201cIn theory, you should be doing this everyday, not spending the money, but showing this amount of love to your partner everyday.\u201d\n\nEven couples who have only been together for a few months felt it was important to do something special to mark the day. \u201cWe\u2019ve been officially together for three months, but I wanted to give her a good night,\u201d Mitch Kirby, a sophomore studying mechanical engineering said. \u201cWe went out to Nobu in West Hollywood. It was definitely a big cash out day, but I feel like it\u2019s something I should be doing for her.\u201d\n\nFor plenty of USC students who use the day to shower their significant other with gifts and a fancy dinner, they definitely felt the pressure. However, there might be even more Trojans who don\u2019t have someone to share the day with. \u201cI went out to dinner with some of my friends for our own Galentine\u2019s Day,\u201d freshman Angie Lopez studying international relations said. \u201cI also gave some valentines to my roommate and friends.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to those who aren\u2019t in a relationship, they felt if they were, they would also participate in celebrating love with their partners. \u201cIf I was in a relationship, I would plan to spend some money,\u201d Elijah Velarde, a junior studying communications, said. \u201cI feel that just naturally you want to make your partner feel appreciated. Have them feel like you are spoiling them a little bit on special occasions.\u201d\n\nTrojans may be picking up some extra shifts in work this week but it appears not many people are regretting spending the money. Valentine\u2019s Day may be over, but love is still certainly flowing through the USC campus.\n```"}

So we\u2019re trying to tell that story and and do it justice.\u201d\n\nLA\u2019s original Chinatown carries a lot of history and dates all the way back to the 19th century. It was once an extremely bustling and vibrant community filled with families, businesses and associations.\n\nMayen Alcantara, the senior manager of transportation planning and arts and community enrichment for Metro Art shared more about just how meaningful the exhibition will be for the Los Angeles community, especially those with families connected to the original Chinatown.\n\nMayen Alcantara: One of the really special things about the event that we have tonight is the multi generational connection, that is subtly highlighted. We have students from the East Wind Foundation, and we have living members of the descendants of the families whose stories are associated with exhibition.

Today, a hearing was held in Fulton County, Georgia to see whether District Attorney Fani Willis and her lead prosecutor against Trump, Nathan Wade, should be allowed to remain on the case.\n\nAfter the 2020 election, then President Donald Trump and his allies refused to accept that he lost the state of Georgia. They are accused of violating The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO Act, by knowingly and willingly conspiring to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump.\n\nThe person who filed this case was Fulton Country District Attorney, Fani Willis. Her job is to investigate and prosecute criminal offenses on behalf of the people in Georgia. But today, Willis took the stand at a hearing to investigate whether there was any misconduct in her office while prosecuting Trump.\n\nSpecifically, the hearing looked at whether the lead prosecutor, who was also her lover, financially benefited Willis. She took the stand unexpectedly today, and started out combative, as reported by CNN.\n\nFani Willis: I object to you getting records. You\u2019ve been intrusive into people\u2019s personal lives, you\u2019re confused, you think I\u2019m on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. I\u2019m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.\n\nBoth Willis and the lead prosecutor Nathan Wade claim that their romantic relationship started in early 2022 after he was hired for the case against Trump. However, at today\u2019s hearing an ex-friend of Willis, Robin Bryant-Yeartie, testified that they were together before the Trump case began.\n\nDuring their relationship, the couple went on trips to Belize, Aruba, and Napa Valley. Willis and Wade say she paid him back for the trips, which denies the beneficiary claims. Today Willis said, as reported by CNN:\n\nWillis: I don\u2019t need anything from a man -- a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don\u2019t need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who\u2019s ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.\n\nSo what does all of this mean for the Trump case? If the court decides that misconduct occurred in the District Attorney\u2019s office, it could disqualify Willis and her team from the case against Trump. It usually takes months to create a new prosecution team. And this delay could harm their goal of prosecuting Trump before the 2024 election.\n\nThe case will resume tomorrow morning at 9am Eastern Time.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Susan Nyirenda.\n```"}

This album is more than a musical experiment for Beyonc\u00e9, it\u2019s a chance to promote, embrace, and reclaim country music\u2019s culturally diverse history.\n\nRobert Randolph plays rock and folk steel guitar on \u201c16 Carriages.\u201d He described Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cAct II\u201d vision to Rolling Stone by saying... \u201cIt almost seemed like it was supposed to be out of left field when a Black artist says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to do a country record.\u2019 It\u2019s crazy that the whole world doesn\u2019t understand the history of country music.\u201d\n\nCountry music originated in the southern United States and tends to focus on working class Americans and blue-collar American life. But it\u2019s always been a diverse genre coming from a wide variety of cultures. The music combines white, Black, and Native American cultures among many others. These have all contributed to the sounds and singing styles we associate with country music today.\n\n\u201cQueen Bey\u201d has been trying to spotlight American Black cowboys for years now. In an interview with Harper\u2019s Bazaar for her Ivy Park Rodeo fashion line, she said her inspiration was Black rodeos she attended growing up that helped Black people reclaim their place in western history and culture. Beyonce\u2019s goal now is to erase the stereotypes and reclaim Black artistry in the world of music.\n\nAct i of her three part project also recognized past Black musicians while also paving the way for new Black artists. Ashley Ware is a video game design major at USC. Ashley Ware: I know her last album, Renaissance, it set like a theme for her next two albums, which is the reclamation of historically black music. So, I think because I don\u2019t really normally listen to country music, but like Beyonc\u00e9, making country music. I\u2019m gonna, I\u2019m gonna take a listen.\n\nSophomore Mariele Manzella studies public relations. Mariele Manzella: Music is just art, and I don\u2019t think there should be any kind of stereotype or label for people who listen to specific genres of music.\n\nBlack artists like Charley Pride, Linda Martell and Ray Charles have made major contributions to country and paved the way for the future of the genre. Garth White is a senior studying economics. He argues that music is a versatile art with no limits on who can create what. Garth White: Good music is good music, no matter who sings it and I support any good music, you know, whatever walks of life, they come from whatever religion whatever, gender, race, religious belief, anything like that\n\nThe most awarded Grammy winner, Beyonc\u00e9, continues to embrace Black artists of the past while making big strides for Black artists of the future.

(Photo courtesy of Panic Studio L.A.)\n\nBy Jake Petroff and Zainab Malik\nFebruary 15, 2024 at 6:04 pm PST\n\nNestled in the heart of downtown Los Angeles stands Union Station. Often referred to as the \u201clast of the great train stations,\u201d the Art Deco building not only serves as a bustling transportation hub, but also as a vibrant symbol of the city\u2019s cultural richness. Looking to continue its excellence, the station is set to commemorate its 85th anniversary Thursday evening, inviting residents and visitors to join in on celebrating the past as they journey through an exhibit of cultural fusion and artistic expression.\n\nOne of the main attractions of this celebration is the exhibition \u201cWhere You Stand: Chinatown 1880 to 1939,\u201d which not only pays homage to the station\u2019s historical roots but also sheds light on the vibrant culture and heritage of Los Angeles\u2019 original Chinatown. The launch event for the exhibition is set to feature a dynamic performance of a traditional lion dance by local students from the East Wind Foundation, followed by an exhibition walk-through led by representatives from Metro Art, The Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West, the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California, USC Cinema, and the Huntington Library. Visitors will hear personal stories from descendants of families connected to the exhibition, as well as view various art pieces that pay homage to the theme.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s different ways to experience the exhibitions,\u201d said Mayen Alcantara, the senior manager for transportation at L.A. Metro who focuses on art and community enrichment. \u201cThere\u2019s the visual material, which is photographs and recorded ephemera, like old menus and family stories; there are QR codes, which will bring you to the oral histories; and a QR code that will introduce you to a portal for augmented reality.\u201d\n\nFor aspiring artists, the iconic station holds a profound significance. Through various exhibitions, performances and events, Union Station has served as a platform for artists to showcase their talents and for visitors to immerse themselves in a variety of cultural experiences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to us to be welcoming to everyone, and that includes young people,\u201d said Heidi Zeller, senior manager for cultural programming and communications at L.A. Metro. \u201cAnd as a public state, our programming, we want it to be easy for anyone to participate, whether it\u2019s just being an observer of whatever the program is, or a participant in a more active way.\u201d\n\nThe station\u2019s anniversary celebration will continue later this month with a free screening of \u201cGeoff McFetridge: Drawing a Life,\u201d followed by a conversation between the artist and L.A.-based writer, Alissa Walker, on Feb. 23.

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Lachlan Cunningham)\n\nBy Dylan Luden February 15, 2024 at  5:34 pm PST\n\nUSC baseball took a huge first step back to prominence last season under first-year head coach Andy Stankiewicz, going 34-23-1 but missing out on the NCAA tournament. Stankiewicz brought in a lot of impact players last year through the transfer portal and the incoming freshman class. For example, now-sophomore outfielder Austin Overn led the country in triples with 14 and shattered USC\u2019s single-season triples record. Junior right-handed pitcher Caden Aoki transferred from Notre Dame and led the Pac-12 with a 2.98 ERA. Besides Overn, sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway and sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges both batted above .300 and will look to improve upon their great freshman campaigns. Infielders senior Ryan Jackson and redshirt sophomore Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek found their way into the starting lineup and had successful seasons after transferring from Nevada and UCLA, respectively.\n\nSeeing the impact these new players had in the team\u2019s success last year, it\u2019s hard not to imagine the possibilities of what the Trojans\u2019 24 new incoming freshmen and transfers could bring to the table. USC benefitted more at the plate from last season\u2019s newcomers, but this season could have some impact transfers and freshman from a pitching perspective. Stankiewicz, in an interview with Annenberg Media\u2019s Riley Sager, mentioned that the Trojans have more depth this season \u2014 particularly on the mound \u2014 and really likes what he sees so far from junior Cal State Northridge transfer Xavier Martinez, sophomore Alabama transfer Brock Blatter and graduate Santa Clara transfer Jared Feikes. Martinez has the best track record out of those three pitchers, leading Northridge last year with a 2.29 ERA while notching 45 strikeouts in 35.1 innings. The junior should challenge for a spot in the rotation this year or at least provide quality innings out of the bullpen. As a sophomore, Blatter may have the most potential out of the group. The 6-foot-6 right-handed pitcher from Montana struck out 12 in eight innings of work last year and was drafted in the 19th round of the 2022 MLB draft, but opted to sign with Alabama instead. Stankiewicz said that he\u2019s been improving during every scrimmage and will be a valuable asset in the bullpen. Feikes, a graduate student, will be leaned on as a veteran leader for this pitching staff; he\u2019s the only player on the roster with postseason experience after Santa Clara made the NCAA Tournament last season. His 69 innings pitched was second on the Broncos, and he will be able to eat up innings for the Trojans.\n\nOne freshman who could make waves in the rotation is Mason Edwards, a 6-foot-2 lefty from Palisades High School. Stankiewicz believes Edwards can pitch well enough this season to make his way into being that fourth or fifth starter for the Trojans, pitching during the midweek games. At the plate, graduate transfer Chris Brown should provide some power for USC\u2019s lineup. The 6-foot-4 corner infielder from UConn looks to slot into first base for the Trojans and can also provide at-bats as a designated hitter. Overall, Stankiewicz loves that this group of freshmen has been pushing the older players for competition to make every day a challenge. Infielder Abbrie Covarrubias and utility player Kevin Takeuchi are two position players who could wiggle their way into the lineup with their preseason play. According to Stankiewicz, Covarrubias possesses a high baseball IQ and could see some game time early on because of that. The infielder from Cypress High School was the Empire League MVP last season and is smooth with the glove. Takeuchi can make an immediate impact with his bat after hitting .520 with 13 home runs his senior year at Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego. He has versatility to play both the infield and outfield.\n\nUSC baseball will travel to Arizona this weekend to play in the MLB Desert Invitational, where the Trojans will face Brigham Young on Friday at 4 p.m. to kick off the season.\n```"}

The team went 6-1 in February heading into the All-Star break. Most recently, the Lakers took down the Utah Jazz on the road 138-122 with Rui Hachimura scoring a career-high 36 points and Anthony Davis putting up 37 of his own. It\u2019s the first time that a pair of Lakers teammates have scored 35+ in a game since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal did it in 2003.\n\nEver since the metaphorical trade deadline rumor demon passed, this Lakers team has turned into the Showtime Lakers tribute act, with Austin Reaves and LeBron James setting each other up with silky dimes and bringing the Lakers back to a winning 30-26 record. The offensive transformation in February for the Lakers has been remarkable. They\u2019re averaging around 123 points per game\u2014significantly over their season average of 117. For reference, the Indiana Pacers, who lead the league in per-game scoring, currently post an average of 123.7 points per outing. It just seems the starting lineup\u2019s offense has clicked.\n\nDuring the Lakers\u2019 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday, the starters lineup combined for 119 points and perhaps even more impressively, each starter scored over 20 points. In fact, it was the highest points total a Lakers starting lineup has contributed since those Showtime Lakers in 1985. In addition to the team\u2019s stars peaking, Hachimura has been the most surprising and helpful addition to the starting lineup. During this three-game winning streak, Hachimura has averaged 24 points per game, soaring above his regular season average of 11.4. In each of those games he\u2019s shot around 68% from field goal range and went 6-8 from three against the Jazz.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how head coach Darvin Ham incorporates Spencer Dinwiddie into the offense. The guard, who played basketball at Taft Charter High School in Woodland Hills, just joined the Lakers after the Brooklyn Nets bought him out. His efficiency from the field and the three have dropped this year, but he provides a veteran presence off the bench that can play defense at both guard positions.\n\nThis break definitely comes at the worst time for the Lakers just as they\u2019re gelling and finding a rhythm. After the All-Star break, the Lakers schedule has a mix of interesting games on slate for the rest of the month. They\u2019ll face three teams in their division in the Golden State Warriors, Phoenix Suns, and rivals Los Angeles Clippers. The Lakers have winning records this season against all three teams, but have to play all of them on the road this month. Then, they\u2019ll play the feeble San Antonio Spurs and Washington Wizards.\n\nThe Lakers still have a way to go in climbing into one of the automatic playoff spots as they\u2019re in ninth, four and a half games behind the sixth-place Pelicans. But if they have a winning record through the rest of February, the Lakers could jump a few places and put themselves in a much more comfortable position. After the break, the Lakers first game will be against the Warriors on Thursday, Feb. 22 at 7 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Sundance Institute)\n\nNot nearly the first attempt to tell American televangelist superstar Tammy Faye Messner\u2019s story, director Dana Adam Shapiro (\u201cMurderball\u201d) has breathed some life into what certainly had infinite potential to be a highly repetitive story. Even for those like myself with little knowledge of Messner\u2019s life, the style and content of the film represent something much larger than her role as a television personality.\n\nThe infamous story is largely told by Jay Bakker, son of Messner and her first husband, Jim Bakker, the televangelist preacher whose name is attached to a multifaceted scandal that included financial and sexual scandals. The narrative, while fascinating, takes an incredibly long buildup. In fact, by the time the second episode of the four-part series wrapped (only the first two episodes screened at Sundance), we had barely scratched the surface of their eventual demise. In fact, the slower buildup to the salacious circumstances that the audience is expecting is likely a nod to Shapiro\u2019s intent to be better than the snappy headlines that reduced Messner to her scandal.\n\n\u201cBetter Angels\u201d is absolutely successful in humanizing the woman involved in one of the most titillating phenomena the world has ever seen. Behind the iconic makeup look that drag queens would envy and eventually mimic, the series provides the audience with ample opportunity to feel as though we really do know Tammy\u2019s heart behind the lashes. Hearing from Jay Bakker connects us to her in a more personal way than has been previously done. Their relationship is a lifeline through a film that otherwise might have fallen victim to being just another story repeat.\n\nThe word \u201cconventional\u201d comes to mind in terms of the documentary\u2019s format itself; it certainly abides by a classic streaming-style. The film is predominantly heavy in archival \u2014 which can be fun when there is so much to choose from, thanks to the countless hours of TV footage that exists \u2014 and we find ourselves immersed in the three-dimensional movement of old photographs. Additionally, it relies on talking heads to take us through the events, including a brief few frames of Jessica Chastain, who played Messner in the 2021 drama, \u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye.\u201d\n\nMessner\u2019s interaction with Rev. Stephen Pieters, who has since passed, is undoubtedly the most emotional takeaway from the episodes. At the time of their 1985 interview on live television, Pieters was HIV-positive, and Messner advocated for less judgment against the gay community. Her empathy and concern for the issue, at such a crucial time to do so, absolutely evoked a feeling of hope for the world that I carried out of the theater with me.\n\nDespite its imperfections, this take on older events is hugely relevant for a new generation to watch. At a time of such political polarization in America, much of it affiliated with Christianity, it is a necessary time for individuals on each side to reflect upon themselves and their relationship \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with faith of any kind. \u201cBetter Angels\u201d truly nudges audiences to find humanity in one another despite appearances \u2014 and that reminder is never untimely.\n```"}

(Photo by Aditya Thiyag)\n\nBy Sophie Sullivan February 15, 2024 at 3:42 pm PST\n\nThis spring, voting for student body representatives is a whole lot sweeter. Students can cast their ballot for Undergraduate Student Government (USG) candidates starting next Tuesday. Four slates are seeking the presidential and vice presidential seat and 12 candidates seeking a senate seat. Students can either vote online on the USG website or at four in-person polling locations \u2014 Tommy Trojan, Leavey Library, Alumni Park or Pardee Lawn \u2014 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. through Feb. 23.\n\nAfter casting their ballot, students can show poll workers a screenshot of their confirmation page in exchange for a voucher for a free treat from Fluff Ice on Tuesday, Porto\u2019s on Wednesday and Dazzling Donuts on Thursday. Nivea Krishnan, USG chief justice and a senior double majoring in public policy and economics, said they are bringing the vendors to campus in hopes of increasing voter turnout.\n\n\u201cHaving food is such a large incentive for college students in general,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cI know I\u2019d be more likely to vote if I had that.\u201d\n\nLast year, fewer than 20% of eligible students cast a ballot for USG elections. But the low voter turnout goes beyond voter apathy for many students.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to vote or hear the speeches,\u201d said Kyle Lotke, a freshman studying artificial intelligence for business. \u201cBut it is something I want to give back to my university.\u201d\n\nJonathan Choi, a junior studying psychology, echoed Lotke\u2019s sentiments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in voting. I just didn\u2019t really know it was happening,\u201d Choi said. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten emails about it, and I don\u2019t really check my email too much. And I haven\u2019t seen anything on social media yet.\u201d\n\nSome seniors expressed a lack of interest in voting for candidates who would not take office until after they\u2019ve graduated, while others mentioned the \u201cGreek vote\u201d \u2014 votes from those in fraternities and sororities \u2014 as a dilution to their own ballot.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think voting really makes that big of a difference in these elections, because major populations choose essentially who wins,\u201d said Taylor Clanton, a senior studying public policy. \u201cGreek life has such a large vote.\u201d\n\nKrishnan said the nature of single-candidate voting when there are multiple candidates on the ballot means few students end up voting for the elected representatives.\n\n\u201cWith plurality voting, you get winners that don\u2019t actually win the majority of voting, but who won the most votes in comparison to everyone else,\u201d Krishnan said.\n\nBecause of this problem, USG adapted the voting system to follow a ranked-choice voting model, which Krishnan said should provide a more equitable representation of the student body.\n\nThe conversation about revamping the voting system began in 2022. In addition to switching to a new voting platform, Qualtrics, Krishnan also held focus groups with students to ensure they understood the ranked-choice system.\n\nAhead of the voting period, Krishnan said she wants students to know one number this week: $64. That\u2019s how much comes out of every student\u2019s tuition every year for the USG budget\u2014which sits at $2.5 million.\n\n\u201cRegardless of your opinions on USG, the reality is you\u2019re paying for us to do this,\u201d Krishnan said.\n\nKrishnan also spoke about the impact elected USG officials have in liaising with the university.\n\n\u201cThe first people that administrators go to are the President and Vice President of Student Government.\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cFrom their perspective, they are the student representatives.\u201d\n\nShe continued, noting the weight elected students have in calling the university\u2019s attention to social, cultural or academic issues.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that that body has a lot more influence and a lot of other student groups on campus just by nature of being the governing body of all students.\u201d\n\nCandidate platforms can be found on the USG website under the Elections 2024 tab along with information about how to vote.\n```"}

One of these things might seem out of place most days, but not on Thursday morning.\n\nBehind the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine at USC Keck, the Well-being team from the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and the Humane Society of USC organized a mindfulness event including sweet treats, a photoshoot opportunity and, most importantly, a handful of bright-eyed and tail-wagging friends.\n\n\u201cDr. [Francesca] Mariani, the director of well-being here at the stem cell laboratory of USC, reached out to me and asked if we can host a wellbeing event for them in hopes of allowing the students and staff of the hospital to de-stress during these trying times,\u201d said Skyler Nahouray, founder and president of the Humane Society of USC.\n\nThe board of the Humane Society at USC, (from left to right) Andrew Bui, Skyler Nahouray and Ellie Bridges Greenfield posed with April at the event. (Photo by Krystle Ehara)\n\nThe collaboration brought four therapy dogs to the lawn outside of the stem lab, two in the morning and two later in the afternoon. April and Maya, 3 and 5 years old respectively, took the morning shift, while 4-year-old Indy and 6-year-old Valentina wrapped up the party.\n\nOne of the attendees was graduate student Christian Chung, pursuing his Master\u2019s in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. Surrounded by both friends and strangers, Chung eagerly shook April\u2019s paw, sharing a laugh with those around him.\n\n\u201cFrom a short-term perspective, you can view it as taking a break during your day, but also, if you view it from a long-term perspective, it\u2019s a reminder that we do need to take breaks,\u201d Chung said. \u201cAnd that you do need to take time to detach away from work and school.\u201d\n\nFor Nahouray, that was exactly what he was hoping the students would get out of the event.\n\n\u201cThese people are all working countless hours,\u201d he said. \u201c[Now] they\u2019re able to truly let their work step aside for a quick second and enjoy the bidirectional relationship between animals and humans we should all be experiencing.\u201d\n\nHosting this event at the stem cell labs was critical for Nahouray, and being able to provide a space for students to have a moment of peace amidst the chaos of classes, labs and experiments was hugely important.\n\n\u201cI think that this event, in particular, is extremely meaningful because these individuals are the future of our technological advancements,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing how we\u2019re giving back to them because they do so much for us.\u201d\n\nTherapy dog Maya was eager to meet students. (Photo by Krystle Ehara)\n\nMariani said she was \u201cthrilled that there\u2019s an organization that could help\u201d bring her vision of a relaxing event to life, especially from an organization within the university. She said fostering community with events like this is her ultimate goal, especially following the lack of human interaction as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cBringing people out of the woodwork and interacting with each other, I think, is really important for wellbeing and to be happy at your job and to be happy doing your research,\u201d Mariani said.\n\nFor seventh-year Ph.D. student in developmental stem cell and regenerative medicine Claire Arata, Mariani\u2019s initiative worked.\n\n\u201cEveryone loves dogs. Clearly there\u2019s a good amount of people that came out promptly at 10 a.m,\u201d Arata said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to just be able to take it easy for a morning and just hang out with everyone, not even necessarily to be with the dog, but to have a bit more of a community in the department.\u201d\n\nFor those of you jealous of being able to hand out treats and rub furry bellies, the next USC Humane Society event is set for March 21, on the University Park campus at Founders Park.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nFebruary 15, 2024 at 2:29 pm PST\n\nIn what could be a make or break year for head coach Lincoln Riley, the USC football defensive staff has been completely revamped for the move to the Big Ten. Lincoln Riley spoke to the media Thursday, mostly regarding the new defensive staff hires. Riley mentioned how this was the staff he wanted all along, and commented on what he was looking for in new coaches for last season\u2019s struggling defensive side.\n\n\u201cWe want to have the best developers of defensive talent, culture,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe ended up with seven names on the board and it was the dream list, it was if you can get anybody, who can it be? And we ended up hiring four of the seven.\u201d\n\nRiley spoke of the impact the new staff had on him and how they have been tirelessly recruiting. \u201cYou can feel the impact. When you go hire guys like this, people take notice. Recruits take notice, our current players take notice,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you could feel the shot of momentum in a lot of ways that I think is exciting for everybody following this football program.\u201d\n\nThe new defensive staff has been exciting fans, recruits and players alike. One of the most exciting of those hires is new co-defensive coordinator and defensive line coach, Eric Henderson. \u201cBringing in someone of Eric\u2019s caliber, it would be crazy to not lean on him and his experience,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHis track record speaks for itself, we certainly felt he was deserving of that title and we\u2019re going to lean on him just like we\u2019re going to lean on the rest of the guys in the room.\u201d\n\nWhile Henderson may be one of the shinier new hires, Riley says new defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn is excited about everyone and the level of experience they bring to the table. \u201cIf you look in that room, you add a defensive coordinator in Doug Belk, a head coach in Matt Entz, you add somebody with Eric\u2019s experience and obviously bring back Shaun Nua who we all think about,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of really good minds and a lot of guys who have seen a lot, who are responsible for a lot.\u201d\n\nNua was the only coach retained from Riley\u2019s staff last season where he will now be the defensive ends coach. Riley spoke of how important it was to keep him and how he is excited to pair him with Eric Henderson. \u201cIt felt like the tandem we could create with those two would be really formidable,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe had some great discussions and it just fit. I know Shaun\u2019s excited, energized and it\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\nEarly last season, rumors of a possible move to the NFL emerged for Riley, however, Riley stated that he was eager to stay with the Trojans and uphold that he will build something special in Southern California. \u201cI want to get it right here, I really do. I want to do it for the current team, the current players, the former players, the former coaches, the fans and the university,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe still have a tremendous product, there\u2019s a lot that can happen and I\u2019m in the place I want to be.\u201d\n\nRiley emphasized that he plans on building a national championship-level defense and it starts with the defensive line under Henderson. \u201cWe want to build a defensive line that is worthy of being a College Football Playoff-level defensive line,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt takes that energy and confidence to recruit, develop and do all of it. He \u2014 Eric Henderson \u2014 just has that. He has a great gift of connecting with people. He\u2019s been a great boost of energy and confidence just all throughout the building.\n\nAfter USC\u2019s abysmal defensive performance in 2023, there is nowhere to go except up. The Trojans open up spring ball March 19 with their spring game on April 20 as they prepare to improve their defense and transcend into the top of the Big Ten in 2024.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/15/the-silver-shield-vol-11-the-five-most-disappointing-players-this-season/", "response": "```\nThe Silver Shield, Vol. 11: The 5 most disappointing players this season\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nFebruary 15, 2024 at 12:43 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League.\n\nPlayers that haven\u2019t reached expectations\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy to thrive in the NHL for a long period of time by any means. However, established players are expected to continue to produce year-in and year-out, especially if getting paid a pretty penny. Inevitably, though, every season sees a handful of highly touted players decline to some degree. Whether it be battling injuries, having trouble adjusting to new scenery or just simply slumping, I\u2019ve chosen five skaters that have been disappointing this season.\n\n5. Connor Brown\n\nRight winger Connor Brown has never been a superstar or a household name, but when the Edmonton Oilers signed him to a one-year contract valued at up to $4 million last offseason, they at least expected him to produce consistent points. It\u2019s been a much different story, though. Coming off an injury-ridden 2022-23 campaign when he only suited up in four games because of an ACL tear, Brown is yet to score a goal in 2023-24. He\u2019s played in 42 of Edmonton\u2019s 49 games so far, and his measly four points just aren\u2019t cutting it. Just two seasons ago, as a member of the Ottawa Senators, Brown posted 39 points and was also a key defensive piece. Now, he sits on the fourth line and hardly adds to the statsheet. However, as the Oilers sit in the thick of the playoff race after starting the season off on the wrong foot, it\u2019s safe to say that Edmonton will be just fine with or without production from the 30-year-old.\n\n4. Jonathan Huberdeau\n\nOnce a 115-point generating Hart Trophy candidate in Florida, Jonathan Huberdeau\u2019s career has taken a turn for the worse with the Flames. Last season, in his first year in Calgary, Huberdeau\u2019s point total plummeted by 60 from the previous season, down to 55. While slack could be cut for the center\u2019s disappointing 2022-23 season as it was a drastic change of scenery, Huberdeau isn\u2019t helping his newcomer-slump case in 2023-24. This season, Huberdeau\u2019s minus-16 plus/minus is not only the worst on the Flames, but also the lowest of his 12-year career. He\u2019s also only tallied 31 points in 52 games. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that the 30-year-old signed a hefty eight-year, $84 million deal with Calgary during the 2022 offseason, which could make trading him impossible considering his subpar play. The Flames are a dark-horse playoff team, so they\u2019ll want Huberdeau to step up his game to help Calgary return to the postseason.\n\n3. Erik Karlsson\n\nErik Karlsson was undisputedly the NHL\u2019s best defenseman in 2022-23, taking home the Norris Trophy and recording a whopping 101 points. While he\u2019s not having a particularly bad first season with the Pittsburgh Penguins, considering his high value, he hasn\u2019t lived up to the predictably tall expectations this year. Pittsburgh missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006 last season, which sparked a desire for Karlsson. The Penguins landed him in a massive three-team trade with the Sharks and Canadiens last August and despite the buzz surrounding the Swede\u2019s expected impact, Pittsburgh stands seven points out of the Eastern Conference\u2019s second Wild Card spot and is currently 3-5-2 in its last 10 games. Karlsson has 37 points which, again, isn\u2019t shabby by any means, but going from the best scoring defenseman last season to No. 13 on the points leaderboard for blueliners in 2023-24 is a pretty steep fall.\n\n2. Matty Beniers\n\nMatty Beniers is only 21 years old, so it wouldn\u2019t be fair to totally knock on his game. But, after winning the Calder Memorial Trophy last season, Beniers hasn\u2019t helped the shaky Seattle Kraken the way he used to. The center\u2019s minus-11 rating is one of the worst on the team, and he\u2019s only scoring a point once every 42 minutes and 36 seconds of gameplay, nearly double what it was last year. The Kraken\u2019s center position could really use some help, and Beniers was expected to be the one to lead the charge this season. Following a storybook 2022-23 campaign, Seattle hasn\u2019t been nearly as exciting and currently sits on the outside of the playoff picture. The Kraken also have one of the worst offenses in the league, only averaging 2.70 goals per game. On the bright side for Beniers, his defensive game is nothing short of solid, and there will be plenty of time for him to turn things around as his young career progresses.\n\n1. Pierre-Luc Dubois\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings made a statement trade when they acquired Winnipeg\u2019s Pierre-Luc Dubois last offseason, who was advertised as an elusive, two-way forward. This season, though, he has completely fallen off. Following back-to-back seasons with 60 or more points, Dubois only has 21 through 50 games, along with a minus-16 rating. Dubois was supposed to be the missing piece to help bring the Kings from good to great, but he\u2019s spent time on the bottom lines and has been a non-factor for Los Angeles. To add insult to injury, Gabriel Vilardi and Alex Iafallo, the main pieces that the Kings sent to the Jets in the trade, are showing flashes of greatness for playoff-bound Winnipeg. Add in former first-rounder Rasmus Kupari and Los Angeles\u2019 second-round pick this year, and this trade was a total fleece. Dubois shouldn\u2019t be considered a lost cause yet at 25 years old, but he\u2019s most definitely a shell of his former self. The Kings have struggled recently after starting the season hot, so Dubois\u2019 lack of production hasn\u2019t been timely by any means.\n\nMorgan Rielly suspended five games\n\nMaple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly\u2019s attempt to salvage his team\u2019s pride while losing to its Ontario rival, the Ottawa Senators, resulted in a five-game suspension. Rielly aggressively reacted to Senators forward Ridly Greig slapping the puck into Toronto\u2019s empty net, which resulted in Rielly cross-checking Greig\u2019s head. The suspension has sparked controversy across the NHL. Although some deem Greig\u2019s slapshot on the open net to be disrespectful and warranted of an altercation, others see Rielly\u2019s incident as a major, dangerous overreaction. Given the context of the game, with Toronto\u2019s hopes to tie the contest washed down the drain with the empty netter, it makes sense that Rielly would be frustrated. But a forceful strike to the head after the play was over drove the NHL to sideline Rielly for five games.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

The nominations came out on Nov. 10 of 2023, with categories including \u201cBest New Artist,\u201d \u201cSong of the Year,\u201d and \u201cAlbum of the Year.\u201d This year, Black women shone in their light at the Grammys, standing out across a multitude of categories.\n\nVictoria Mon\u00e9t received her long-awaited flowers, winning in the \u201cBest New Artist\u201d category - after being in the music industry for fifteen years. \u201cThis award was a 15-year pursuit,\u201d referenced Mon\u00e9t. Mon\u00e9t\u2019s backstory is one to be admired, and one she referenced in her acceptance speech which you can find here. Victoria\u2019s manager, Rachelle Jean-Louis, actually took a chance and left her former label position to come be by her side as her manager. \u201cThere was a binder that I made to take this really important meeting at a label, and I thought I was going to be signed and I was an independent artist with no team, and I just thought, \u2018Maybe my music would stand for itself.\u2019 But that binder left collecting dust in her office and a label, and Rachelle found that binder and she decided to take a chance, leave that label and be my manager. So thank you so much for seeing me,\u201d finished Mon\u00e9t.\n\nCoco Jones had previously thought the industry had abandoned her, after a \u2018career stall\u2019 she referenced in the aftermath of her breakout role in Disney\u2019s \u201cLet It Shine,\u201d until her second chance came around in the form of her viral track \u201cICU.\u201d Jones is now signed to Def Jam Recordings and is set to release her official debut album later this year.\n\nSZA ended up being the 2024 Grammys\u2019 most-nominated artist. She was nominated for nine, and took home three awards in the following categories: \u201cR&B Song,\u201d \u201cPop Duo/Group Performance,\u201d and \u201cUrban Contemporary Album.\u201d\n\nIce Spice was nominated for four awards in the following categories: \u201cNew Artist,\u201d \u201cPop Duo/Group Performance,\u201d \u201cRap Song,\u201d and \u201cSong Written for Visual Media.\u201d\n\nNotably, Shawn \u201cJAY-Z\u201d Carter gave a speech as he accepted his Lifetime Achievement Award, and he brought up important topics related to the categories, and to the winners. During his speech, he highlighted Beyonce, referring to the fact that she is the most decorated Grammy winner in history, but has never won Album of The Year. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s subjective because, you know, it\u2019s music and it\u2019s opinion-based,\u201d he said,\u201dI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won Album of the Year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys; [and she] never won album of the year, that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love y\u2019all. We want y\u2019all to get it right, at least get it close to right,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that although this evening was an incredible and long-awaited spotlight moment for Black women, there were also a couple moments and winners that could have received more recognition, as some awards were given out before the broadcast even began.\n\nSome awards handed out before the live broadcast: Coco Jones took home her first Grammy for Best R&B Performance for her song ICU, Former First Lady Michelle Obama won her second Grammy award for Best Audiobook, narration and Storytelling Album for The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, Meshell Ndegecello\u2019s The Omnicord Real Book for Best Alternative Jazz album. Best Jazz Performance was given to Samara Joy for Tight, and Allison Russell\u2019s Eve Was Black won for Best American Roots Performance.

Several student clubs and organizations were selling Valentine\u2019s themed goods, but most importantly, promoting their Registered Student Organizations (RSOs).\n\nHAUTE Magazine is a student-run fashion and culture publication that was also out on Trousdale. Member Zaina Dabbous said, \u201cWe\u2019re just selling cards, flowers and candy to fundraise and raise awareness for our organization.\u201d Dabbous expressed how fundraising on campus is a form of self-promotion for clubs on campus. \u201cSales are going well, but I think all these types of fundraisers are more for awareness than making profit\u201d.\n\nSome RSOs used this as an opportunity to fundraise so that they can expand their operations. Crystal Chavez from Hermanas Unidas de USC said, \u201cWe\u2019re a club that focuses on community service, socializing, a place for Latinas to feel a sense of community on campus and professionalism.\u201d Chavez expressed gratitude for the opportunity: \u201cWe feel really lucky to be out here and not only fundraise for the club, but also just represent a minority on campus. We\u2019re Latina women, and we want to invest in ourselves to give back to the community.\u201d\n\nBesides student clubs, many local businesses were also connecting with students to promote their businesses. Olivia Mercado, owner of Pearl Thorns floral shop in Downtown L.A. said, \u201cI love Valentine\u2019s Day, so today I just wanted to monopolize on that.\u201d Mercado emphasized the importance of supporting small businesses: \u201cYou\u2019re supporting local businesses, people that are trying to grow, like myself. You\u2019re investing in the community and in the people around you.\u201d\n\nUSC students showed support for the clubs and small businesses in attendance by filling out surveys, interacting with vendors and shopping. Health and Human Science major Jasmine Ahdoot said, \u201cIt\u2019s so much nicer to support either students or small businesses, just to show some local support. All these big businesses like Trader Joe\u2019s, they make enough. Buying from a big store, you\u2019re probably also paying more for the roses and it\u2019s just going to a big corporation.

At issue: low wages and lack of transparency for how the company pays their drivers.\n\nNicole Moore: You know, so often you have to decide whether you\u2019re going to spend that little, you know, 50 bucks, that you just got to put gas in your car, so you can work some more, or whether you need to buy a sandwich, you know. Nicole Moore is the president of Rideshare Drivers United, the 20,000-member Los Angeles group coordinating local gig drivers.\n\nNicole Moore: those are not the kinds of choices that that anybody should have to make.\n\nProtestors walked up and down the side of the streets chanting into megaphones... as cars honked their horns in support.\n\nNicole Moore: We\u2019re fighting for $1.75 per mile and 60 cents per minute. Many of us used to make that when we started on the app back in 2016 2017. You know, nobody\u2019s making that anymore. I mean, we\u2019re seeing less than 50 cents a mile.\n\nProtestors say Prop 22, California\u2019s gig law that went into effect 2020, has actually hurt drivers. The law was supposed to guarantee some benefits like, minimum earnings and healthcare reimbursement. But Moore says those guarantees are anything but guaranteed.\n\nNicole Moore: Right now we\u2019re making less than federal minimum wage, which is 7.75. After you take out our expenses and the extra taxes we have to pay. But in addition to that, we\u2019re fighting for dignity on the job, we\u2019re fighting for a voice on the job. We really want Sacramento lawmakers to hear us and to know what these companies are doing.\n\nEsterphanie St Juste was one of the speakers at the protest. She\u2019s been a driver for nearly 10 years. She says, after Prop 22 was enacted, things changed.\n\nEsterphanie St Juste: The way it works, is basically we provide the car, we will provide the maintenance for the car, we would get the gasoline for the car, and the insurance for the car. And Lyft and Uber would provide the app, which is basically handles dispatch, you know, and they would take 20%, you know, a small percentage.\n\nSt Juste says that was fair.\n\nEsterphanie St Juste: Afterwards, from talking to each other, that they were, they were pricing the customers at one price and giving us another price. So it was like, so we were just like we couldn\u2019t believe it. So they were stealing from us. And that\u2019s how the group leading the protest was formed.\n\nWe reached out to both Uber and Lyft. In a statement sent to us, Uber said that basically the vast majority of drivers are satisfied and drivers in the U.S. were making about $33 an hour. And Lyft said they recently released a series of new offers and commitments aimed at increasing driver pay and transparency.\n\nEven so Moore says real change won\u2019t come until lawmakers step in.\n\nNicole Moore: Sometimes it costs us more to operate our vehicle than it does to take you on a ride for what we\u2019re paid. So we call those charity rides. We\u2019re not here for charity. We\u2019re trying to actually have our family supported have a roof over our heads. So we\u2019re fighting for basic dignity and fair pay.\n\nThe protest in Los Angeles was just one of many being held today in the nation.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Aerianne Collantes.\n```"}

Jonathan Handel, an entertainment and tech attorney and Lecturer in Law at the USC Gould School of Law, explains that the way the characters look is not always how they really feel.\n\nJonathan Handel: Well, it\u2019s important to remember that although the characters look like they\u2019re always smiling, work is work. And the work that these character actors, these actor characters do with us, the word for it is difficult work, they are not paid a lot.\n\nNow calling themselves \u201cMagic United,\u201d the cast members began distributing union authorization cards to those who are not under a union. They plan to seek voluntary recognition from Disney Resort Entertainment once a majority of their workers have signed.\n\nHandel: And if they\u2019re not voluntarily recognized by management by Disney, then the National Labor Relations Board conducts a representation election where all of the people who would be within the union group, the so-called bargaining unit, have the right and the opportunity to vote on whether they want to be represented by a union or not.\n\nMore than 35,000 workers at the Disneyland Resort are already a part of labor unions, but the character and parade performers, also known as cast members, are not under any union at all.\n\nHandel: Well, unions in effect are non-governmental regulatory agencies, they set wages and working conditions and related issues above where the marketplace may be driving them.\n\nThese workers have a number of demands that they want Disney to meet to create a better work environment for their cast members. These are their demands.\n\nHandel: what we\u2019re hearing is, is three issues, wages, number one, scheduling, number two, in terms of flexibility and, and respect for people\u2019s, you know, time and, and advanced notice of schedule changes and things of that sort. And then finally, safe and sanitary working conditions.\n\nThe hope is that unionizing will help lead to a more productive conversation between the company and its workers.\n\nDisney provided the following statement: \u201cWe believe that our Cast Members deserve to have all the facts and the right to a confidential vote that recognizes their individual choices.\u201d\n```"}

Held in the Roski Studios building just off of campus, exhibits were open to the public on February 1 from 6-8 pm. However, a reservation is required with the artists in order to view the art pieces starting February 2 through 16.\n\nJunior Xyla Abella studies Fine Art and has created an exhibit called \u201cBecause I was Flesh,\u201d which features a seven-foot sculpture of Eve as a snake. Inspired by her catholic upbringing, she wanted to create a piece that was a culmination of her experiences, feminism and religion.\n\nAbella: I grew up in the church and that was a part of me that I couldn\u2019t really separate from I just didn\u2019t, I no longer felt like I was supposed to be part of it. I didn\u2019t know who I was without the church. But I also didn\u2019t want to be a part of it. So that I was like this internal conflict that was really interesting to me.\n\nAbella continues about the inspiration for her art.\n\nAbella: In church there was this gesture that I was that I had as a child of like looking and then feeling it was as like the cyclical idea, the cyclical gesture of looking and then feeling something and I wanted to do kind of the same thing.\n\nAbella said that though the story of Eve might be old, there are still parallels to modernity.\n\nAbella: This idea of like the woman being blamed and the woman being hunted, there was like, really strong correlations to just how women are treated today.\n\nIsa Perez\u2019s exhibit, called \u201cEnamorado Con lo Divino\u201d also looked at Catholicism, but Perez focused on exploring tension between identity, Latinidad and religion. The exhibit features photographs of Perez\u2019s subjects expressing their personal and cultural identities.\n\nPerez: The tension between like the expectations of where queer bodies are thought to or supposed to be found and where they\u2019re not supposed to be. It\u2019s just really important to prove that wrong.\n\nPerez drew inspiration from their lived experience and childhood, experiencing the conflict between aspects of their identity.\n\nPerez: It felt really restricting, and kind of like, I had to choose all the time between one of the three, or that I couldn\u2019t really express myself to the fullest.\n\nPerez said being able to show their work at USC was freeing for themselves, and hopefully for the people who see it.\n\nPerez: It kind of feels like I\u2019m just taking back a part of myself that was always suppressed, whether it was by other people and outside forces, or by myself when I was still dealing with how to accept myself. And so it\u2019s just a really big validation, and just to know that I\u2019m helping other people feel seen just means a lot to me.\n\nPerez acknowledged that not everyone will relate to their photographs, saying they had two goals with the exhibit.\n\nPerez: Those who come in and see my work and don\u2019t resonate with it, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t expect everybody to but I definitely want them to know that people like this, people like me exist and that we\u2019re able to express ourselves in any way possible. And for those who do understand what they are trying to do with their work, this is what they had to say.\n\nPerez: I hope that they see themselves in it and they feel represented and I hope it gives them the power to like just be themselves and express themselves fully.\n\nFriday is the last day to see these exhibits with a reservation.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Isaiah Alwin.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Lindsey Miller and Quincy Bowie Jr.\nFebruary 14, 2024 at 6:14 pm PST\n\nUSG presidential and vice presidential candidates went toe-to-toe Tuesday night in a debate which gave students a peek into the potential future of Greek life at USC. This year\u2019s debate featured four tickets: Dacity and Abitha Nunis, Julianna Melendez and Klarissa Palacios, Sam Stack and Christian Shaw, and Bryan Fernandez and Brianna Sanchez. Each speaker began with opening statements encapsulating their views on the issues that define their campaign.\n\nThe four pairs debated free speech, campus safety, student wellness, and other issues, each making their case for the candidacy. Though many topics were debated, the issue of policy around Greek life received the most varied answers among the tickets. Some were in support of the activities of Greek life, some were opposed, and some wanted to shift the conversation to different topics entirely.\n\nGreek life at USC has been a popular talking point since 2022, a year that saw the number of USC-affiliated fraternities drop from 15 to four, according to USC Greek Life. Moderators asked what the university\u2019s relationship with Greek Life should be, sparking polarizing responses from the tickets and showcasing what is perhaps the greatest policy gap between the tickets. It also highlighted the issue\u2019s potential to be a deciding factor in the executive race.\n\n\u201cTo put any on-campus group at risk of being abolished is insensitive,\u201d said Shaw, a vice-presidential candidate and the first to respond. He advocated for the creation of a liaison between USG and IFC/USC Panhellenic to improve lines of communication between the two entities. \u201cTo say that the issues found in Greek life are found only in Greek life is insensitive, and claiming that sexual assault happens only to women is insensitive.\u201d\n\nDacity, USC\u2019s first candidate running in drag, seemed to hold the opposite view, saying Greek life at USC is a net negative. \u201cThe Greek life system institutionally is having people get assaulted and hazed,\u201d said Dacity, who responded to Shaw\u2019s commentary on the issue. \u201cTo say that it is the option of socializing within Greek life or to not socialize at all, is undermining the fact that we have a thousand RSOs on campus that are actually focused, passionate, specific, and don\u2019t share an origin that is made for the white man.\u201d\n\nDespite clearly having an opposing view, Dacity, unlike Shaw, did not share any policy recommendations regarding this issue.

Rather than comment on the state of Greek life at USC, she focused on transitioning the conversation to one around the availability and quality of university support for those who have experienced assault.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to evaluate our RSVP sexual assault online platform for students in need. We know that it\u2019s not the most transparent and supportive process that it needs to be,\u201d said Palacios. \u201cRather than focusing on Greek life, let\u2019s pivot towards the resources available and the DEI positions in Greek life we can improve.\u201d\n\nFernandez, representing the Bryan Fernandez and Brianna Sanchez pair, campaigning as B&B, concluded the discussion on the relationship between USC administration and Greek life by issuing a broader statement about his beliefs regarding the responsibility of the presidential role.\n\n\u201cAll of these people are still part of USC,\u201d said Fernandez. \u201cWhen you take this role, you are talking about representing every single USC student despite their interests and despite what they are joining.\u201d Fernandez wrapped up his statement with a comment USC students may want to keep in mind when selecting a candidate as voting begins February 20.\n\n\u201cOur job is to be collaborative and proactive.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misidentified Christian Shaw as a presidential candidate. He is running for vice-president on a ticket with Sam Stack as a presidential nominee. Bryan Fernandez, a presidential candidate, was also erroneously referred to as Ryan Fernandez in one instance.

Clayton discussed the evolution of AI since its inception, and how Microsoft plans to get involved with the creation of their Microsoft Copilot. Copilot is a chatbot software that can do a range of things on request.\n\n\u201cWhen we brought these products to market, there really was this notion that this technology is here to assist us to augment our work not to replace our work,\u201d said Clayton in the sit-down discussion. \u201cWe don\u2019t want technology to replace our work, and I really believe that we don\u2019t want technology to replace the people that work.\u201d\n\nClayton also said AI at Microsoft is not allowed to run rampant without human oversight. \u201cWe still require human intervention,\u201d said Clayton. \u201cRelatively quickly we saw examples of so-called \u2018hallucination\u2019 where [when] the AI didn\u2019t have an answer, it would just make up things...and so things are changing, it\u2019s going to get better, faster and more accurate as technology advances.\n\nAs Clayton did his live demonstration, he used the voice feature to find the definition of a word, ask what nearby record stores sell a record he was looking for and tell the audience how many calories were in a Snickers bar he took a picture of and uploaded to the software.\n\nWhile the live demonstration got lively reactions from the crowd, Clayton also discussed the real world implications of AI. \u201cI think we can look back at the journey of any technology, and any big technology has many forms of disruption,\u201d said Clayton. \u201cWhen large technology shifts, some jobs are impacted and go away, but entirely new jobs that often we\u2019ve never even dreamt of will get created. So, I think, we\u2019ll definitely see that dynamic play out because that\u2019s always been true.\u201d\n\nSome students agree that AI is useful. \u201cThe communications industry is so vast and AI will change it, but it will change it differently for different fields,\u201d said Victoria Frey, a junior communications and English creative writing major. \u201cCommunication as a field is very broad, especially here at USC.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, some students still have doubts about the regulations and implications of AI. \u201cI would say they are overly optimistic. They talk a lot about the need for safety regulations and things of that matter, but we have yet to really see much of that,\u201d said Ian Cabeen, a senior psychology major. \u201cFrom a legal standpoint from any country, as well as most companies, it\u2019ll be interesting to see where that goes in the future and if it develops in a safe way.\u201d\n\nWith doubts arising from students in the crowd, Clayton offered his advice. \u201cThe first job is to get out there and use the technology to become familiar with it,\u201d said Clayton. \u201cThe second piece of advice is to cherish this profession. Cherish the discipline of writing, reading and all the things that you get from that as communicators. There\u2019s a cultural shift that we will need to acknowledge is going to happen.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Cam Kauffman)\n\nBy Makai Singleton February 14, 2024 at 4:54 pm PST\n\nWith nine games of 30 or more points as a true freshman, JuJu Watkins has broken a USC record set by Cherie Nelson back in the 1988-89 season. Watkins scored a career-high 51 points against No. 4 Stanford on their home court. She followed this career night by dropping 29 against unranked Cal. The next game against Arizona, Watkins dropped 32 points. These are three games out of the many in which Watkins showed her scoring ability. Watkins was the nationally ranked No. 1 recruit and high school player of the year. Coming into USC, she faced high expectations.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a freshman in college doing what other players in women\u2019s college basketball just don\u2019t do at all, like breaking the Pac-12 records, USC records,\u201d said Titus Ervin, a sophomore USC student studying human biology and manager for the USC men\u2019s basketball team. \u201cThere are expectations coming into the season, but to see her exceed these expectations already \u2014 it\u2019s crazy to see.\u201d\n\nDuring her freshman season, Watkins is averaging 27.7 points, 6.9 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.7 steals per game. Watkins has taken the USC community and the nation by storm, and students are excited about having Watkins for more than one year.\n\n\u201cI feel like the time that this is all happening is important because most people associate USC sports with the men\u2019s sports, so to have a strong women\u2019s athlete, it shows how good our women\u2019s team is,\u201d Nia Mitchell, a USC senior communications major, said. \u201cIt is impressive and fun to watch, and more people should come out to support.\u201d\n\nSome students want to see Watkins marketed more and pushed out more like they do the male athletes.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing is to continue to promote the games,\u201d Kameron Lewis, a USC master\u2019s student studying marketing, said. \u201cGoing into next year, continue to put her on the big stage and hopefully go every year into March Madness.\u201d\n\nWatkins isn\u2019t the only women\u2019s basketball star gaining national media attention now. Iowa\u2019s Caitlin Clark, who is on pace to break Kelsey Plum\u2019s NCAA Division I scoring record of 3,527 career points, has also obtained national attention. Teams with multiple stars like LSU and South Carolina are also a part of the movement to uplift women\u2019s college basketball.\n\n\u201cCaitlin Clark has been a magical figure in attracting attention across sports,\u201d said Jeff Fellenzer, a professor of professional practice teaching sports, business and media at USC. \u201cPeople have just been caught up in watching her game since the 2023 Final Four.\u201d\n\nCollege women\u2019s basketball is the hot commodity right now in sports. The mid-regular season game between South Carolina and LSU brought in 1.6 million viewers on ESPN. There were two NBA primetime games on that night, and the college game topped both. It wasn\u2019t even the most-viewed women\u2019s basketball game this season; the mid-January Ohio State-Iowa game brought in 1.9 million viewers on NBC.\n\n\u201cThese numbers are a result of the excitement that was created during the 2023 women\u2019s NCAA tournament with Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. That really helped things take off and catch fire,\u201d Fellenzer said. \u201cNationally there has never been more interest, and it looks like a pretty balanced field around the country. There\u2019s a lot of teams that potentially could play well in the tournament this season.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, there are other players and teams out there that would love to show off their skills as well on all levels of women\u2019s college basketball.\n\n\u201cThe amount of coverage we are now getting should have been here a long time ago. It could be improved by including coverage of women\u2019s basketball at all college levels, not just the high-major schools,\u201d said Whitney Dunn, a sophomore guard at the Historically Black Alabama State University. \u201cBetween performing on the court skillswise and showing attitude and passion for the game, I think the stars have truly helped to expand women\u2019s basketball coverage.\u201d\n\nAs a player in a lower division that doesn\u2019t catch too much attention, Dunn says there\u2019s hidden gems of talent there too.\n\n\u201cThere are so many talented women on this level that are often taken for granted because of this being the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC),\u201d said Dunn. \u201cIf we had more camera time like bigger schools, people would see.\u201d```"}

(Image by Qiuya Chen)\n\nBy Lyla Bhalla-Ladd, Kaleef Starks, Brent Yoo, Spartacus Smith Jr., Monique Davis, Peter Makk, Myriam Alcala, Daphne Yaman, and Cierra Morgan\n\nFebruary 14, 2024, at 4:13 pm PST\n\nLyla Bhalla-Ladd: Valentine\u2019s Day\n\nMy dreams kept me in bed longer than usual, so I sleep in. The sun is shining in Paris, and I think of you. I\u2019ll have a small breakfast and plan for a brisk walk to school. It\u2019s still cold enough to wear my trench coat, my local-passing uniform. Donning a pink bow in my hair, I play coy and pet my flowers before I leave. I have today to finish a midterm for my art history course, so I camp out in a caf\u00e9 before my classes and try to write. I\u2019m distracted. The words don\u2019t flow so I decide to take some in instead. I read my Donna Tartt and wait for the hour to pass. My professors charm me in their lectures, and I participate as I should. One of my friends joins me for our final class of the day. We laugh in the back and hide our phones behind our computer screens. I skipped the Apollo and Daphne reading last night, and so I am thankful for the girl who sits in front of me in class. The room always shifts away from her after she\u2019s finished talking, and I enjoy the shield. Right as class ends, I walk my friend to her metro stop before continuing on home. We\u2019ve got similar schedules. When I get back to my apartment, I have forgotten to defrost my chicken, so I set my timer for a couple hours and drink an espresso to hold me over. I\u2019m not too worried. I refresh the day\u2019s makeup and bundle up for the basement. I make my way down to the freezing, metal kitchen and prop up my phone on a spice cabinet. I hoist myself onto the counter and cover my ankles back up when they feel the cold air. I set in for the next few hours, and I have been waiting all day.\n\n***\n\nI woke up late, which always makes me feel like I am late all day. I remember that I did not finish my reading or my midterm and for no good reason. I hate it when it is chilly but sunny and I sweat underneath my layers that I would freeze without. How is everyone else finding the balance? I give into my morning hunger at a caf\u00e9, which I am not supposed to spend money on on Mondays. Even after my almond-milk-guilt latte, I cannot write. I should have woken up earlier. My jitters compound themselves. Having nothing to say about this art boils in me. I try to read, to inspire myself, but I cannot make myself care. I scroll endlessly before I decide it is not the day for social media. I should have known that. Each one slower than the last, my classes drudge on. The girl next to me in my last class represents all the worst characters in Gender Studies seminars. She shops online while occasionally hopping into the class discussion to virtue signal her Classics background. No one here did the reading. I will make myself do it tonight. My walk home is cold. Frozen chicken was all I had to make for dinner, so I am up for another couple hours. I did not want to stay up late today. My sister says everything seems worse at night. She is right. It is bleak, waiting.\n\nKaleef Starks: A Valentine\u2019s Day reflection\n\nI\u2019ve never had a Valentine. A day during which couples are googly-eyed, cheesy, and emotionally open. A day of expectation ... Will the cute guy or gal you\u2019ve been talking to make that move? Will they take the few months of dating to the next level? As a 31-year-old Black transgender woman, I\u2019m used to not experiencing love. This is a tough life to live due to my intersecting identities; it comes with a lot of rejection in dating. Despite the difficulty I have with dating, I have been practicing loving myself. It is a challenge because sometimes I struggle with wondering if my identity is the cause of the constant romantic rejection. The hopeless romantic in me would love to celebrate the holiday, but every time I find a guy, it doesn\u2019t last long. I get insecure and sad, often reflecting on my transgender identity as one of the main reasons why I\u2019ve never had a healthy romantic relationship. As a trans woman, my love life has been quite difficult. Most men simply do not take me seriously as a romantic partner. The stereotype of trans women being sex workers has been a go-to in most of my past dating experiences. They see how hard I work, how well I take care of myself and think I have a sugar daddy. I do not frown upon women who are sex workers; I am not. They think I\u2019m easy for sex because I\u2019m trans, and they don\u2019t have to put in the work that they would for the heart of a cisgender woman. I\u2019ve only been in one relationship that lasted for one and a half months because he had issues with my gender. I hope that one day I can receive a bouquet of roses, a box of gourmet chocolates and a giant plush teddy bear. I usually celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day by myself or with friends. I refer to the holiday as Singles\u2019 Awareness Day. If I am not out and about with fellow single friends, I buy myself a nice wine, dinner and watch a good rom-com. It gives me cheesy hope that maybe one day I\u2019ll experience a love story. I\u2019ve gotten to the point as a single person where some years it makes me sad that I\u2019ve never had a Valentine and sometimes I\u2019m not sad at all. I do have a dream for Valentine\u2019s Day, though. It would simply be a day in which I do a simple and romantic activity with someone I\u2019m deeply in love with. I\u2019m not that hard to please, but a person who makes an effort means a lot to me. For example, if I had a lover who took me to my favorite restaurant and we did a shared couples\u2019 activity that we loved, I would be head over heels. My heart would flutter as the hopeless romantic in me would be so satisfied. So, is Valentine\u2019s Day still necessary? Yes. A day that celebrates love should exist. The world is not a good place, and we are bombarded with news and negativity on a daily basis. It\u2019s nice for love to be seen and recognized. I also think that Valentine\u2019s Day should be less about lovers in a romantic sense and more about all forms of love. They say that there are three types of love: universal love, romantic love and self-love. All forms of love should be celebrated and highlighted on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nBrent Yoo: Valentine\u2019s Day in Korea\n\nValentine\u2019s Day was never really a big deal in Korea. While Americans swooned over candlelit dinners and rose-strewn bedsheets, the \u201cspecial\u201d day was nothing more than a carnival of commercialism and chocolate-fueled marketing shenanigans. Convenience stores transformed into chocolate wonderlands, each shelf boasting extravagant displays and themed packaging that resembled that of makeup and the most premium of beauty products. My favorite of the bunch still remains the Ferrero Rocher which was packaged in the shape of a heat with fake rose petals stashed neatly next to each chocolate ball. In Korea, Valentine\u2019s Day was the first of three chocolate-themed festive days. There was White Day on Mar. 14, when men were expected to gift chocolate to the women, and Pepero on Nov. 11. Pepero is a popular chocolate-dipped snack that people buy in bulk and give out to loved ones, friends and family. But when I moved to the US for college, I was immediately thrust into the American whirlwind of Valentine\u2019s Day fascination. At the start of February, every frat party and event came packaged in bright pink ornaments and red roses \u2014 instead of Korea\u2019s modern convenience stores, the February festivities would come mostly in the stuffy, sweat-infused, alcohol-reeking basement of frat houses. When the clock hit 10 p.m., herds of perfume-dipped girls would walk around in red dresses and clicking heels, chased by a bigger herd of suit-donning men. And outside of the parties, every partner-less friend stayed stressed about their plans on Feb. 14. But despite me coming to understand and even appreciate all the nuts and bolts of Valentine\u2019s Day, I thought the day was stupid. Why do people need a particular day to treat their partner on a romantic date or garner the courage to ask their crush out? And especially with birthdays, anniversaries and holidays, why have another set date for everyone and their partners to try to do something they should already be doing? A big part of the reason behind my loathing is that my girlfriend and I haven\u2019t been able to celebrate properly for the last two years. Ariel, whom I dated for over two and a half years, studies across the country at UC Berkeley. So despite being in a relationship, I never even thought twice about the day. Trust me, it wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t really love each other or weren\u2019t the romantic kind of people. We\u2019re the kind of couple to get matching superhero outfits at Disneyland and celebrate every 100 days of dating. We obviously still did call each other and try to watch a movie during the day. And as embarrassing as it is to put down on paper, there was a heightened sense of emotion in our text messages and calls. But not once did we consider sending over flowers or shipping a box of chocolate. There are other, more important days to spend $20 for express shipping, in my opinion. I did recently find out that one of my friends, who lives in Los Angeles and his girlfriend in Europe, booked a table for one at a fancy restaurant. He told me he was going to bring his computer and call his partner while his girlfriend sat at a different restaurant on the other side of the world as they enjoyed a Valentine\u2019s Day meal \u201ctogether.\u201d Cute when you think about it, but to do it is a whole different level of embarrassment when you\u2019re the one doing it. So take it from a Korean who has yet to spend a proper Valentine\u2019s Day with his girlfriend: Valentine\u2019s Day is nothing greater than an excuse for people to wear revealing clothes, get confidence to ask people out and splurge on meals that they might end up eating in front of a computer screen.\n\nSpartacus Smith: The week before\n\nUsually around this time, I mess up. And it\u2019s always a week before. I make one too many jokes with him. I invest too much attention. I let my imagination run of what the two of us could be. I listen to the wrong people or social media posts and overthink my entire relationship. I apply this surface level pressure that numbs the rationale, convincing myself that deciding to be with this guy was the wrong decision from the start. All of this usually occurs just before the crimson and pink designed holiday of Valentine\u2019s Day. Three years ago, I decorated my bedroom wall with a large vivid red heart made of Christmas lights. Adding flavor to my bed with a bouquet of roses waiting for him, he didn\u2019t show up. This was with my ex-boyfriend during the COVID-19 era, and I, along with other people, hoped that the fascination of love would get me through. He wanted to smoke \u2018forbidden green\u2019 with his friends instead. Was I defeated? Yeah. However, believe me when I say this: two hours later, I realized he was obsessed with smoking weed, and then the next day we agreed to break up (a day before Valentine\u2019s Day). However, this year, it\u2019s a week before Valentine\u2019s Day, and I\u2019m still with my boyfriend. What does this mean? I don\u2019t know yet. Will I mess this up? Nothing but time will tell. Can I be pessimistic and assume the worst? Absolutely. Will it help? No... But this leads to more questions. What is it about myself that derives this fate? Am I the same person as before who questions my relationship because of the fear of what the holiday of love should be like? A metaphorical thought of romance tightens around the bands of my relationship, suffocating the future out of fear. Is this how things should be? Is love, or rather the symbolism of what I am experiencing, supposed to be like this? Flowers. Letters. One-on-one dinners in high-end restaurants. Rose petals to the bedroom. The ceremony of chocolates in heart-shaped boxes. To a lot of people, these expressions of admiration for a person are about the fantasy of romance rather than what the relationship actually is before the holiday. The holiday represents a mold of outward expression, whether romantic, platonic, sexual, or even casual forms of love, but more than ever, Valentine\u2019s Day has become a day of introspection and appreciation for yourself as well as the people you care about. It could be argued that there is no way to \u201cmess up\u201d Valentine\u2019s Day, but within the concept of desire lies the possibility of dissatisfaction. While I do not know what this year\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day will hold for me, may a thought go through your head if you have suffered like I have. All of this is temporary. It\u2019s the holiday. Enjoy the day for what it is. Love in itself should be appreciated, celebrated, and valued every day like a lot of other holidays in the United States, but let\u2019s be honest with ourselves. It\u2019s not. When it comes to Valentine\u2019s Day, a lot of us are stuck in our own heads, egos and fascinations. Know this, and take a step back. If you\u2019re happy, whether that status be single, in a complicated relationship, or with a mutually decided and faithful partner, moments are something worth celebrating. Worry about what could happen afterwards. Enjoy whatever becomes of your Valentine\u2019s Day. Wishing you the best. Good luck, Spartacus <3\n\nMonique Davis: Valentine\u2019s Day\n\nAs Valentine\u2019s Day rolls around in just a few days, a part of me is scared that I\u2019ll be overwhelmed with sadness as soon as I open my eyes. The other part of me is grateful for the type of parents I have. As the month of January hits the midway point, global brands roll out their Valentine\u2019s Day decor, social media erupts in gift wish lists, and debates on the holiday\u2019s relevancy fill the timeline, especially if you\u2019re single. Exactly a year ago, I was in a loving relationship with a man who I was convinced would walk me down the aisle in a few years. Only having been with one other person previously, I felt like I was experiencing my first adult relationship. At the time, as a 24-year-old woman dating a man seven years older, I felt like I was experiencing a love that I was longing for. In my first relationship, it was a constant cycle of begging this person to treat me right. There were many nights of crying and many holidays, like Valentine\u2019s Day, where I would pour my heart into my gifts and receive nothing in return. But with the older man, it felt like he knew what I wanted without me uttering a word. I felt seen, protected, and soft in a way that made me feel as if I were floating every time his name crossed my mind. On Valentine\u2019s Day, there was a knock on the door, and a sweet lady asked if I was Monique Davis. Confused yet eager to know why, I said yes, and she handed me an edible arrangement with a card that contained an explicit inside joke. A few days later, I was taken on an intimate date to the movies and dinner immediately after. He was proud to stand next to me and tell everyone that I was his girlfriend. All of my closest friends witnessed the way he loved me out loud, especially around the holidays, and made bets that he would propose by the time I finished graduate school in 2024. I was deeply in love and excited to spend the rest of my life with him because he blatantly said that he would marry me one day. That confident dream came to an end on Aug. 14, 2023. Out of the blue, on a warm Monday night, he coldly uttered the words \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore\u201d over FaceTime. I felt like my entire life flashed before my eyes. How could a man who planned out the groomsmen he would pair with my bridesmaids a week prior just end our relationship? How could a man who raved about me to our mutual friends, about how much they loved me in my absence, just give up on what we had? This was one week before the start of my second semester, the hardest semester of my program. As I navigated, figuring out how to cope, my parents were right there to catch me when I was too weak to move from the couch. The strong hugs and constant sayings of \u201cit\u2019s gonna be okay, mama,\u201d reassurance that I would bounce back from my dad to my mom laying in bed with me for a week straight are the reasons why I refuse to be sad this Valentine\u2019s Day. As a young girl, my parents ensured that I felt special on each holiday, especially Valentine\u2019s Day. I could always expect my mom to decorate our kitchen table with cute decorations, balloons and gifts. My dad would come from work with more gifts and our special Valentine\u2019s Day dinner. We would eat as a family, and the feeling of love would radiate throughout the entire room. Years ago, when I was away for undergrad, my parents packed all that love in a care package and shipped it to my dorm room. This type of love made me appreciate not only the concept of Valentine\u2019s Day but also seeing other people being loved out loud by their significant others and whoever they considered family. Valentine\u2019s Day brings me joy because I get to celebrate the love that was instilled in me and spread it to the people around me. It taught me that heartbreak could never make me lose the love in my heart, seeing other people happy and being surrounded by people who pour that same love back into me.\n\nPeter Makk: Valentine\u2019s Day: A love-hate relationship\n\nValentine\u2019s Day: the one day a year where couples showcase their affection in the most cringe-worthy ways possible. Is it worth the hype, or is it just a holiday designed to guilt-trip the romantically challenged into spending their hard-earned money on overpriced chocolates and cheesy gifts? Valentine\u2019s Day is essentially a disguised celebration of love. Florists pump up the prices of roses, restaurants offer multiple course menus at extremely high prices, and the greeting card industry has one of its best days yearly at this time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not completely against Valentine\u2019s Day. There\u2019s something very charming about seeing the heart-shaped balloons and teddy bears holding tiny plush hearts at a lot of places around the city, But I think love should not be confined to a single day on the calendar. If you need a specific date to express your love for your partner, you might want to reevaluate your relationship. Let\u2019s talk about my best and worst Valentine\u2019s Day experiences. My best Valentine\u2019s Day was two years ago. It was the first date with my now ex-girlfriend. To be exact the date was on the 13th, after having to reschedule three times due to covid and my athletic activities. We went to an arcade, where we got to know each other, and we went"}

A California property manager was sentenced, Friday, Oct. 20, 2023, to a year in federal prison for sending more than 200 vile online messages to the father of a teenage girl who died in the 2018 massacre at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)\n\nBy Laya Albert February 14, 2024 at 4:03 pm PST\n\nVictoria Ortiz remembers the mass shooting like it was yesterday, but it was actually six years ago today at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \u201cI remember the day very vividly,\u201d she said. On Feb. 14, 2018, 17 people were killed and 17 more were injured when an active shooter opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Ortiz is now a freshman at USC, but six years ago today, she was a middle school student in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, about a 45-minute drive away from the shooting.\n\nArielle Tylim, a USC alum who graduated in 2019, also lived locally during the shooting. Her cousins attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The day of the shooting, her cousin was making up a missed test in a classroom that wasn\u2019t attached to the main school. \u201c[My cousin] happened to be out of the building when the shooter came in. He killed this beautiful young girl who sat in front of her, who sat in front of her in class, and the girl behind her,\u201d Tylim said. When her cousin heard the gunshots while walking back to class, she and other students hopped the school fence and ran to a nearby Walmart.\n\nThe amount of mass shootings in the United States has only increased since the Parkland shooting, with 329 in 2018 and over 600 in 2021 and 2022, according to Everytown Research, America\u2019s largest gun violence prevention organization. As of July 1, 2023, new Florida legislation authorized residents over 18 to carry a concealed weapon or firearm without a concealed weapons license.\n\nOn the same date of the Parkland shooting, there was a shooting in Kansas City, Missouri at a rally celebrating the Chiefs Super Bowl victory. At least one person was killed and 15 have been injured, authorities said. Just hours later on the same day, gunshots were heard at the Gardens Mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. \u2014 just an hour drive from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The mall was on lockdown, and police were investigating the situation as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI feel like any time I\u2019m on a campus or in a movie theater or a mall, I am way more aware of my surroundings,\u201d Tylim said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so horrific that our government hasn\u2019t been able to recognize the epidemic that is mass shootings in the United States.\u201d\n\nCarly Gottlieb is a USC student who also had cousins at Marjory Stoneman Douglas on Feb. 14, 2018. Originally from Miami, she is now a junior studying law, history and culture. Her cousin was home sick on the day of the shooting. \u201cI was like, \u2018f\u2014, Julia goes to that school,\u2019\u201d said Gottlieb before finding out that her cousin happened to be home that day. Gottlieb also attended the trial of the shooter, but after two days, she \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle it anymore.\u201d She witnessed all of the impacted family members sobbing and in distress, as well as the details about how the people were shot and what the forensic examiner had to present.\n\n\u201cIt was the worst thing I\u2019ve ever watched,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that society needs for people to have such easy access to AR-15s, especially without a serious psychological examination.\u201d\n\nOrtiz also said she was disappointed by Florida\u2019s current gun laws, mentioning Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as part of the problem. \u201cThey\u2019re implementing even more laws that are the opposite of gun safety,\u201d she said.\n\nOrtiz, Tylim and Gottlieb are having a very different Valentine\u2019s Day than most, alongside the other hundreds of victims and families affected by gun violence and the many currently advocating for legislation to help reduce mass shootings.\n```"}

After battling some of the best college golfers in the country, Ffrench finished tied for 13th at six strokes above par.\n\nBeing a collegiate athlete is not an easy task. They are up early in the morning for weight and conditioning training before classes. After a class session, they continue to spend hours practicing afterward, while still having the academic responsibilities like the rest of USC students do. For Ffrench, that pressure is even heavier on him, as he is about to reach the end of his collegiate career.\n\nLike any sport, becoming a PGA Tour golfer is an extremely challenging task. Only one golfer each year gets to make it to the PGA Tour directly from college.\n\nPrior to the Collegiate Showcase, Ffrench talked with Annenberg Media about his preparation before the game, balance with school and his favorite Tiger Woods moment. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ. Walk me through how you felt when you heard the news about participating in the showcase?\nI was really, really excited. I\u2019ve watched the upperclassmen get to do it in front of me for the last three years, and so when [head] coach [Mark Hankins] told me that I was given his spot, I was really excited. That\u2019s an incredible opportunity.\n\nQ. Tiger Woods is the host of the Genesis Invitational, can you share with us your first Tiger moment?\nI went to the 2008 US Open in San Diego when he won the playoff against Rocco Mediate. I was just a little kid, I think I was six. So, I got to see him win his last major before he won again in 2019.\n\nQ. Walk us to your preparation before the event, specifically this one?\nJust making sure that I treat it like a normal week. Obviously, it\u2019s a big deal, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m doing the same thing that I do any other time I tee it up. So just trying to focus on my routine and make sure that it stays constant with how it would be for anything else.\n\nQ. How do you keep yourself on top of both school and golf?\nI wasn\u2019t very good at allocating my time and wasn\u2019t giving enough time towards school and studying. As I realized that [school work] is why we are in college and it\u2019s a huge priority, making sure that I study hard enough and spend enough time with school instead of just putting everything into golf, which is kind of how it was my first two years.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Riot Games)\n\nBy Tino Garcia Gross February 14, 2024 at 2:48 pm PST\n\nThe League Championship Series (LCS) has been North America\u2019s premiere League of Legends Esports organization since 2013. Riot Games, the developer behind League of Legends, has been cultivating the games competitive scene since its first World Championship in 2011, and the LCS has been an important part of that journey.\n\nIn more recent history, however, doom-speak has been permeating the LCS. Worries have been rising that Riot is moving on from their game to Valorant \u2013 the trendier, newer game that is way too cool for the practically ancient League of Legends community. However, with the LCS 2024 Spring season, a new era of League of Legends could be upon us \u2013 and it all points back to one man.\n\nMarkZ: A new commissioner with a new vision\n\nOn December 12th, 2023, the LCS announced that Mark Zimmerman, long time competitive League of Legends community member, better known as Markz, was to become their new Commissioner\u2013 in short, Markz now runs the whole operation.\n\nNow, make no mistake. In the LCS\u2019 current state, the job of Commissioner could be considered more of a burden than an honor. After a historically terrible season in 2023 \u2013 a decline in viewership that signaled an inability to retain the affluence that came from the pandemic, the loss of two of its formerly ten franchises due to financial instability, and a near cancelation of the Summer split after a misguided attempt to support said franchises which led to a player walkout\u2013 the future of the Championship Series seemed anything but bright.\n\nWith growing skepticism from investors about whether all the hype around Esports can actually translate into long term financial success, Riot has a lot to prove, and MarkZ has a lot of eyes on him. But despite the pressure, the newly appointed commissioner is eager to prove himself.\n\nSince his hiring, Zimmerman has been promising fans a reimagined league, publicly promoting some exciting changes to the leagues format in what seems to be an effort to throw new ideas at the wall, and see what sticks. While the LCS may be on thin ice with its audience after the 2023 season, Zimmerman is not afraid to keep skating, and make bold strokes for the league\u2019s future.\n\nThe weekend of January 20th was the first trial run of these changes, and his new vision.\n\nOpening week: Welcome to the new LCS\n\nNo good remodelling is complete without a new coat of paint, and the changes to LCS\u2019 brand were some of the first of the changes shown off. Aesthetically, the LCS has gotten rid of the purple coloring that had been synonymous with its brand for the past couple of years, and moved to a more minimalist black and white scheme, in what league officials say is part of their initiative to leave room for the personalities of teams and their players.\n\nEven looking at the LCS 2024 Spring Split Promotional video \u2013 which shows zero League of Legends footage, instead focusing on the real-life stories and rivalries that make the tournament interesting on a personal level \u2013 this new emphasis on player narratives shines through.\n\nThis new look for the league, along with sponsorships from recognizable corporations like KIA and RedBull, make it seem more professional than ever. This is key in an industry like Esports, which has historically struggled with legitimacy in the public eye.\n\nBut more than just the LCS\u2019 image, there were also a number of changes made to the event itself. For one, the LCS 2024 Winter Split is the first season to run on a live patch system, meaning that as soon as Riot publishes a new patch for the game, the pros will be playing on it for their matches. There were also changes made to the way days are scheduled, in order to mitigate downtime between matches.\n\nWhile you could make a case for or against these changes, it is too early in the season to decisively measure their impact. Zimmerman has continually made it clear that his goal with the league is to continually experiment with new features, and slowly gain a sense for what sticks with the community.\n\nIt is possible that next year the LCS will go back to a static patch approach, as much as it is possible that in ten years, the LCS community might not be able to remember a time before live patch. Only time will tell what resonates.\n\nHowever, one has to wonder how much more \u201ctime\u201d Riot can afford to give Zimmerman.\n\nThe Ticking Clock - if it even exists\n\nLooking at raw hours of viewership, LCS 2024\u2032s first week fared worse than 2023\u2032s, showing that this methodical experimentation of the league\u2019s format does not translate to instant success.\n\nBetween the loss of programming hours due to two fewer teams to broadcast, the fact that the LCS winter split historically pulls in less viewers than the summer split, and many other factors, it seems it is gonna be a while before Riot sees any profit from their premiere NA league.\n\nYet, Riot shows no sign of cutting off the LCS any time soon. Just to reiterate \u2013 the LCS does not make money for Riot. It never has. What it has done however is foster a community of passionate League of Legends fans, and helped cement Riot\u2019s place in the competitive gaming world.\n\nBoth Zimmerman and higher ups at Riot proper are publicly adamant that Esports as a medium is in its infancy. For them, what we are seeing now is not the end of a short lived fad, but the growing pains of what will one day be an institutional juggernaut just like \u201creal\u201d sports.\n\nFrom this perspective it makes perfect sense that Riot would spare no expense in innovating and refining the science that is Esports, establishing themselves as the juggernaut in an industry that they see as destined to take off.\n\nNow, whether or not this plan actually comes to fruition is yet to be determined, but if it does, the LCS, one of Riot\u2019s biggest deficit makers, might just become their greatest asset.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Becca Tapert)\n\nBy Lindsey Miller February 13, 2024 at 10:35 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again, the season of love, Valentine\u2019s Day, where people find respite from the holiday drought of the spring season. Gifts of cards and chocolates celebrate the beauty of love in all forms. But what is far less beautiful is the waste this holiday leaves behind, millions upon millions of dead rotting flowers, and mountains of plastic wrap from various candies and sweets.\n\n\u201cI never thought about how it might impact the environment,\u201d said Mark Kemper, a Computer Science student. \u201cIf I was celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day in a way that I learned was environmentally unsustainable then I would absolutely prioritize this, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing so currently.\u201d\n\nStudents like Kemper would make educated decisions about celebrating sustainably, but either don\u2019t know they are making unsustainable choices or do not stop to think of how Valentine\u2019s Day may impact the environment. The answer is to provide alternatives for the campus community so they can pursue their already-existing desire to make more sustainable choices.\n\nTo do that, look at two of the most commonly given Valentine\u2019s gifts, flowers and chocolate. Giving flowers is a practice synonymous with Valentine\u2019s Day. However, what the majority of flower givers don\u2019t think about is how giving flowers negatively affects the environment. Long stem roses, the most commonly given flower on Valentine\u2019s Day according to Town & Country Magazine, are out of season in the U.S. during February.\n\nAccording to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, three of every four flowers sold in the U.S. are grown in Columbia. The International Council on Clean Transportation found in 2017, that nearly 360,000 metric tons of carbon emission are produced due to the international transportation of roses to the United States from Columbia in the weeks leading up to Valentine\u2019s Day. Additionally, these flowers are packaged in non-recyclable cellophane, the production of which requires toxic carbon disulfide according to the Sierra Club.\n\nA few sustainable options for members of the USC community are to diversify from long stem roses, choose to give other types of flowers or buy from local flower shops which tend to source their flowers locally. Shops such as Flowers by Frank & Elaine, Magic Flower Shop, and AAA Petal Pushers, are a few locally owned flower shops near USC. USC is also located just 4 miles away from the Los Angeles flower district which is home to dozens of small locally run flower shops.\n\nFor those looking to send flowers to loved ones, try utilizing sustainable flower delivery sources, such as The Bouqs Co. and other delivery services that can be found here. Another option is to give living plants that will not create waste, instead of cut flowers which will wilt and rot within a week or two.\n\n\u201cI prefer to give plants rather than flowers,\u201d says Ashley Diamond, a senior at USC. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of giving gifts that are personal and long-lasting.\u201d\n\nAnother common Valentine\u2019s gift in the United States is chocolate. Over 58 million pounds of chocolate was bought in the week leading up to Valentine\u2019s Day in 2023 according to Daily Meal. Cocoa farms account for nearly 70% of deforestation on the Ivory Coast according to The World Wildlife Foundation, with farmers clearing large areas of tropical forest to plant new trees.\n\nAccording to the DBG Group, deforestation on the Ivory Coast is especially dangerous because it increases water pollution from soil runoff, increases carbon emissions which contribute to global climate change, and threatens the natural wildlife that rely on forests to maintain their ecosystems. Additionally, Cocoa farms in West Africa which supply a majority of raw chocolate to American companies, are known to use child labor to help grow, and harvest cocoa beans. During the 2023 growing season, an estimated 1.56 million children worked on cacao farms according to Proxy Preview.\n\nA simple way to ensure the chocolate you buy is not contributing to deforestation or child labor practices is to buy fairly traded chocolate this Valentine\u2019s Day. Fair Trade chocolates come from farms certified by Fairtrade America. These farms practice sustainable chocolate harvesting techniques and ensure proper compensation for their workers.\n\nTo verify whether a chocolate brand is Fair Trade, check for the Fairtrade label on its packaging, or visit the Fairtrade America website for certification details.\n\nWhile embracing the season of love, it is crucial to recognize the environmental impact of giving gifts. By opting for locally sourced flowers, supporting fair trade chocolate, and choosing sustainable alternatives such as living plants, we can transform our expressions of love into gestures that contribute to a healthier planet. Unwrap a greener love this Valentine\u2019s Day, that resonates with a commitment to both our loved ones and the environment.\n```"}

This is the second year in a row that USC was listed as a top producer for Fulbright Students. For the 2023-2024 cycle, 17 recent graduates and alumni from USC were selected as Fulbright Students, and 14 accepted their grants. USC also produced nine Fulbright Scholars, six of whom (five faculty members and one doctoral candidate) accepted their grant.\n\nThe Fulbright U.S. Student Program is dedicated to graduating students, recent graduates and others beginning their research careers. Recipients are provided grants to pursue graduate studies, conduct research and teach English abroad. The Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program similarly provides grants, but is geared toward faculty members and researchers who are further into their careers. Grantees are provided opportunities to teach, conduct research and pursue professional projects abroad. Artists and doctoral candidates can apply to either program.\n\nThe program, run by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, provides students and faculty with opportunities to participate in cross-cultural exchanges through research and education. Recipients can use their grants to go abroad to various countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia and the Americas.\n\n\u201cI think we have a super diverse set of students who are really passionate about what they do,\u201d said Nayanika Kapoor, a USC alumnus and 2020 Fulbright grantee. \u201cI\u2019ve had pre-med friends do Fulbright, alongside music majors, alongside English majors, alongside political science students \u2014 and USC makes the Fulbright process accessible to people from all different departments.\u201d\n\nPart of USC\u2019s success can be attributed to its Fulbright factory mentors who assist students and faculty through the application process. \u201cUSC does so well because of the strong mentors along the way; [because] students choose to apply early to opt into the campus process which entails meeting faculty going over drafts, being in like a mock interview kind of setting \u2014 a feedback committee,\u201d Katie Capra, manager, Academic Honors and Fellowships said.\n\nThe Fulbright process at USC starts with information sessions. In April, students have the opportunity to participate in writing workshops and Trojan Fulbright alumnus share their experiences with students. \u201cThe kinds of opportunities that Fulbright gives people to be immersed in another culture and do it for a whole year \u2014 and they pay you \u2014 is so crazy. And that just sounded really cool to me,\u201d Trinity Yang, a recent USC graduate and current Fulbright Student who teaches English to elementary schoolers in Taiwan, said. \u201cAnd I hope that more people can do stuff like this too. And I think the USC fellowships office is super, super, super helpful. For anybody who\u2019s interested.\u201d\n\nCapra said that students typically begin writing their application essays during their junior year, producing multiple drafts with the help of the writing workshops. In the fall of a student\u2019s senior year, they meet with a faculty committee that provides feedback on their application. \u201cI kind of call it the Fulbright train. It\u2019s always moving, and wherever a student is ready to hop on, they\u2019re welcome to,\u201d Capra said.\n\nFor Yang, Fulbright\u2019s cross-cultural mission has provided an opportunity to reconnect with her roots in Asia. \u201c[Fulbright has] been especially amazing for me personally because Taiwan is where my mom grew up and, also, my dad is from China,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI feel very culturally close to where I am right now. And I\u2019ve been really able to connect with the people around me, the culture, the food and other things have been really cool, too, like developing my own connection to Taiwan while learning about the world overall.\u201d\n\nWhile the 2024-2025 Fulbright cycle has closed, students interested in applying for the 2025-2026 cycle can register for a presentation session on March 26 to learn more about the different programs, the application process and more.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Fulbright named USC as a top-producing institution for students and scholars for a second year in a row, when it is the second year in a row only for Fulbright students. USC received this distinction for students and scholars only this year. These errors in the headline and body were on the part of the editors and this information was corrected on Feb. 14, 2024.\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/02/13/lakers-the-right-move-was-no-move/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Rob Pelinka has decided to go down with his ship. The NBA\u2019s Feb. 8 trade deadline has come and gone and with it, the Lakers roster remains the same. While other teams like the Brooklyn Nets, Milwaukee Bucks and the Philadelphia 76ers made notable trades, the Lakers kept things as is. They made the right decision.\n\nNotable names were floating around as potential options: guard Dejounte Murray from the Atlanta Hawks, Chicago Bulls guard and beloved former Laker Alex Caruso and Washington Wizards guard Tyus Jones. In return, fans and media speculated that D\u2019Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves might be on their way out of town. The Lakers did eventually acquire Spencer Dinwiddie after the Toronto Raptors waived the guard, but compared to what was tossed around the rumor mill, this was a minor move.\n\nAt 28-26, the Lakers sit in ninth in the Western Conference, currently positioned to compete in the play-in tournament that begins on April 16. Unfortunately for them, The Lakers have 13 away games left on their schedule and have unquestionably struggled on the road, as they have a 10-17 record away from home. With all this in mind, it\u2019s in the organization\u2019s best interest to be realistic about the rest of the season. Even if they pass the eighth-ranked Dallas Mavericks and the seventh-place Sacramento Kings, they\u2019re still a play-in team, not an outright playoff qualifier.\n\nWhoever the Lakers could have brought to the team, it likely wouldn\u2019t have had a drastic impact on their title aspirations. Dejounte Murray would be the best hope to spark change, as Murray has had a solid statistical year for the Hawks, averaging 21.7 points per game. Scoring isn\u2019t an area where Lakers need help, though. The Lakers have the seventh-highest field goal percentage in the league at 49.2% and have a points per game average of 116.5, the 14th highest in the league. While the Lakers three-point percentage isn\u2019t the greatest, they\u2019re still ranked 16th overall in the league, far from the worst.\n\nSome in favor of a Lakers trade pointed to the need for a stronger three-point shooter on the team. But Reaves has a solid three-point percentage of 35% this year and Russell sinks 41% of his distance shots. Sure, Caruso, Jones and Murray all have a higher percentage than Reaves, but only Jones has a higher percentage than Russell with 42%. Besides, Reaves\u2019 defense and ball-handling are even more important qualities to this team than his still-reliable shot. And Russell attempts almost double the three-point shots that Jones does.\n\nWhile some say Lakers\u2019 defense is weak, their team and individual efforts point elsewhere. As a team, the Lakers are in the top ten teams for steals and blocks per game. Center Anthony Davis has the fifth most blocks in the league this season and the fourth most rebounds as well. Caruso, Murray and Jones don\u2019t appear in the top 20 of either category, however, Murray is ranked 14th and Caruso is tied at 16th in most overall steals for the season. Who is Caruso tied for 16th with? Lakers guard Lebron James.\n\nIf one assumes that the Lakers were not serious title contenders, there simply was not an immediate need for the Lakers to make a splashy trade. Their season will most likely end in the play-in or a first round series.\n\nMarissa\u2019s Take: As a Lakers and Lebron James fan, it\u2019s almost impossible to bring myself to say that a championship is 100% out of the picture. But I also have to live in reality. The best result for this team is a play-in tournament and a lucky playoff run. Any player that could have changed that fate is either named Lebron James or would have cost too much (money and player-wise) to acquire. I don\u2019t think it would be worth breaking up the current group\u2019s established chemistry. Next year, when the season is fresh, will be the time to introduce new players into the purple and gold system. If we really want to look far ahead, James hasn\u2019t withheld his desire to play with his son Bronny James, a current freshman guard at USC. Lebron James has the potential to be a free agent next summer, while Davis is locked in through 2028. Most likely, wherever Bronny ends up in the NBA, his father will follow. Even if Lebron exits, they can still build a core around Davis. With LeBron gone, it would only be fitting for Davis \u2014 also a key part of the team\u2019s 2020 title \u2014 to take the central role. At the deadline, Pelinka accepted the reality of a post-LeBron future and chose to stay the current course. They don\u2019t need to win right now; James and Davis already gave them a championship. For now, they can enjoy the extra revenue and hype that the LeBron and Davis combination currently provides.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ian Walton)\n\nBy Marco Haynes\nFebruary 13, 2024 at 9:33 pm PST\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s three most consequential results.\n\nAston Villa 1, Manchester United 2\n\nSome late drama occurred at Villa Park on Sunday, as Manchester United scored a dramatic winner to take all three points against Aston Villa. United substitute Scott McTominay\u2019s header to win the match closed the gap between United and Villa in the table to a mere five points in the top-four race.\n\nIn-form striker Rasmus Hojlund gave United the perfect start to the match with a tap-in to go up 1-0. The away side defended stoutly for the remainder of the first half and Villa could hardly find a way through.\n\nThe Aston Villa players were finally able to score in the second half, equalizing via midfielder Douglas Luiz, who rebounded a shot into the top right corner from 8 yards out. The remainder of the match was tightly balanced as both sides missed chances.\n\nIn the 86th minute, United\u2019s McTominay made a run in the box to put his head on the end of right-back Diogo Dalot\u2019s cross to seal the 2-1 victory.\n\nFor the first time this season, Manchester United has managed to win four matches in a row in all competitions and manager Erik ten Hag secured his first away win over a side in the top eight of the league table.\n\nHojlund now has five goals and two assists in his last five appearances for the club, while McTominay celebrated his fourth goal of the season as well.\n\nUnited will travel to Luton Town on Sunday in its hunt for a Champions League spot.\n\nManager Unai Emery and Aston Villa will be left wondering how they didn\u2019t come away with a point from the match after dominating the big chances created, two of which striker Olli Watkins missed.\n\nVilla now falls to fifth place behind Tottenham in the league, having only won once in its last five matches in all competitions.\n\nAston Villa will face off against Fulham next in a league match.\n\nWest Ham 0, Arsenal 6\n\nArsenal thrashed West Ham at London Stadium to keep the title race close. This was the third time the two teams had faced each other this season, with West Ham winning the first two.\n\nBut, on Sunday, Arsenal stepped up and had its revenge in a 6-0 demolition.\n\nThe London Derby began as many expected, with the Gunners controlling the ball and trying to break down the West Ham defense.\n\nIn the 31st minute, Arsenal center-back William Saliba was at the far post to head in the ex-Hammer Declan Rice\u2019s set piece.\n\nArsenal winger Bukayo Saka scored a penalty kick, and minutes later Gunners center-back Gabriel made a near-post run to head in a third goal.\n\nArsenal winger Leandro Trossard made it 4-0 before the end of the first half, curling in a right-footed shot from the left side of the penalty box that nestled in the far corner of the net.\n\nIn the second half, Saka earned his brace, weaving past West Ham center-back Nayef Aguerd in the penalty box to find a gap at the near post.\n\nArsenal\u2019s final goal came from Rice\u2019s beautiful 30-yard strike against his former side, putting an exclamation point on the game, but he didn\u2019t celebrate out of respect.\n\nRice was the difference maker in the game, scoring one goal and two assists from set-pieces to finally secure a win over his former team after completing the transfer to North London over the summer for an Arsenal record fee of $138 million.\n\nThe victory puts Arsenal two points behind first-place Liverpool and made it four wins on the bounce.\n\nArsenal will continue its title charge away to Burnley.\n\nWest Ham will be embarrassed about its performance and are now winless in its last five matches.\n\nSince Brazilian playmaker Lucas Paqueta suffered an injury against Bristol City in the FA Cup, the Hammers have scored just three goals and conceded 12 goals in their last four league games, dropping to eighth place.\n\nWest Ham will look to turn its poor form around against Nottingham Forest at the weekend.\n\nLuton Town 1, Sheffield United 3\n\nLuton Town faced off against Sheffield United in a potential relegation decider at Kenilworth Road with both teams fighting desperately to stay in the Premier League.\n\nIn the match, two VAR decisions were made, but the Blades came out on top, winning 3-1, and sit seven points away from safety.\n\nIn the first half, Sheffield United forward Cameron Archer dribbled the ball down the left flank, bursting past Luton defender Gabriel Osho, entering the penalty box and finishing at the near post prior to missing a great chance seconds earlier, aiming his shot wide of the goal.\n\nBefore halftime, a handball decision by VAR gave the Blades a penalty and attacking midfielder James McAtee slotted the spot kick to put Sheffield United up 2-0 going into halftime.\n\nDuring the second half, a penalty kick taken by captain Carlton Morris finished in the bottom right corner and got Luton back into the game at 2-1.\n\nFor the remainder of the game, Sheffield United stood strong and Souza secured his brace from a counterattack, shooting from the right-hand side of the penalty box and all but wrapping up the win.\n\nLuton Town will be desperate to return back to its winning ways and earn as many points as possible to drift away from the relegation zone.\n\nThe Hatters have only won once in their previous five games.\n\nLuton will return home again against Manchester United.\n\nAfter losing 5-0 at home to Aston Villa, the Blades will surely feel relieved to get the three points in such an important game.\n\nSheffield United now sits seven points from safety but remain 20th out of 20 teams, with only one win in their previous four matches.\n\nThe club\u2019s push to survival now turns to a home game against Brighton on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/13/clippers-los-angeles-comes-out-on-wrong-side-of-top-matchup/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 With just over two seconds left before halftime in the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night, Russell Westbrook found himself trapped underneath the basket, frantically scanning the court to find an open man. After a quick peek over his right shoulder, he found a wide-open James Harden, who sailed the ball over the hands of a soaring Jaden McDaniel, and nailed a three-pointer to end the half, triggering an eruption from the crowd.\n\nHarden\u2019s three-pointer capped off an 8-0 Clippers run and put them up 53-49 going into halftime. But the momentum quickly faded on the other side of the break. The Timberwolves came out hot in the second half and regained the lead in fewer than two minutes. LA kept the game close throughout the middle of the quarter, but as the buzzer sounded at the end of the third, the Clippers found themselves down 89-72 after getting outscored 40-19 in those 12 minutes. The Clippers would eventually fall 121-100.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 downfall ultimately came from the Timberwolves\u2019 biggest strengths: size and defense. Clipper starting center Ivica Zubac, who recently returned from a calf strain, received just 23 minutes in this game. Those minutes, however, were often when the game was closest, including when the Clippers stormed back from 10-down late in the second quarter, a testament to how desperately this team needs Zubac to be fully healthy again. In the stretches where Zubac was on the bench, the Timberwolves utilized their size advantage on the interior, which allowed them to build their lead.\n\nMuch like the first matchup between these two teams\u2014when the Timberwolves came out on top in a tighter 109-105 game\u2014the Clippers\u2019 failed to match the Timberwolves\u2019 aggression and interior play. In that game, The Timberwolves dominated the Clippers on the inside and outscored them 64-42 in the paint. Timberwolves\u2019 guard Anthony Edwards was especially assertive in the second half, where he scored 17 of his 23 total points and created several trips to the free-throw line for himself.\n\n\u201cIn the first half I thought we did a good job blitzing him, taking it out of [Edwards\u2019] hands early,\u201d Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cThen in the second half, they adjusted and played more one-on-one, they kept him out of the pick-and-roll, he attacked us on a one-on-one point of attack and we weren\u2019t able to slow him down.\u201d\n\nThe Timberwolves\u2019 offensive adjustments gave them the boost they needed in the second half, but the Clippers\u2019 inability to find good matchups on all areas of the court throughout proved even more detrimental. When the Clippers play teams that have both size and solid perimeter defenders, such as when they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers, they have struggled to find multiple ways to score, despite having some success with a \u201csmall ball\u201d lineup. This trend continued against the Timberwolves.\n\n\u201cThe first half wasn\u2019t any better [than the second],\u201d said Lue. \u201cWe just got lucky and went on a little run at the end of the second quarter, but, just attention to detail. I thought our physicality wasn\u2019t there, and they played better than we did. \"\n\nIt was also an off-night for the Clippers\u2019 stars. As a team, the Clippers barely shot above 40% from the field and the T\u2019wolves held usual contributors like Paul George and James Harden to fewer than 20 points. Even Kawhi Leonard, who has been practically unstoppable as of late, shot under 50% from the field and scored only 18 points. Those numbers aren\u2019t enough to beat a team like the Timberwolves.\n\nWhile the loss was disappointing for the Clippers, they can at least leave with clear schematic problems to fix moving forward. Lue and his coaching staff need to find a solution for the team\u2019s struggles in the interior if they hope to make a deep run in the playoffs. Additionally, the Clippers need to find a more consistent way of creating better scoring opportunities against good defensive teams like the Timberwolves and Cavaliers, especially when their stars are having off-nights.\n\nDespite the loss, Clippers players remain hopeful for the rest of the season and a trip to the championship remains in their minds. \u201cWe\u2019re right there,\u201d said Leonard in a press conference Monday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve been winning games, as everybody\u2019s seen, and like I said before there\u2019s a way for us to get better and that\u2019s what\u2019s scary. We start[ed] gelling a little late, and now\u2019s the time to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Clippers will have a much-needed break with the All-Star weekend coming up, they\u2019ll first have to travel to San Francisco to take on Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night.\n```"}

I didn\u2019t want to write this column, but deep down I knew it was something I had to do. I couldn\u2019t stay silent knowing there were millions of people around the world suffering just like me.\n\nI lived the past 20 years of my life as an optimist, trying to look on the bright side of things, especially when it comes to sports. No matter how hopeless things appear or how slim the odds are, I went into every single Laker game over the course of the last few seasons as optimistic as ever. But little did I know, these would be some of the most challenging years of my entire life.\n\nLet me paint a scene that will resonate beyond the realm of sports. For this example I\u2019ll model the NBA season after a rigorous climbing expedition. It\u2019s the middle of October and you\u2019ve spent months trying to scale the tallest mountain in the world. You built upon the trials and tribulations of your last attempt, and you told yourself this is going to be the year that all of your hard work and dedication pay off. You are more prepared than you ever have been. After extensive training, you\u2019ve acquired some new and valuable skills. You saved up and invested in some championship-caliber climbing equipment that shows how serious you are about getting to the preverbal and quite literal mountain top.\n\nNow just imagine you start the expedition, and things seem to be much different than last year. You\u2019re more put together, and you have this undeniable rhythm and championship desire in your eyes. It\u2019s almost like things really might be different this year...and then, suddenly, you plummet to your death.\n\nTo take inspiration from a criminally underrated album, EVERYTHING WAS THE SAME! The same way you have no business climbing the tallest mountain in the world because you keep self-sabotaging yourself at every turn, is the exact same way that this dysfunctionally run franchise that makes you want to pull each individual tooth outta your mouth has no business winning an NBA championship.\n\nFor the life of me, I can\u2019t understand it. How can you constantly have pieces that worked on other teams not even so much as sniff the hardwood anytime the Los Angeles Lakers sign them? Let\u2019s start with Christian Wood. Undeniable talent, size, length, touch around the basket, and a silky jumper that Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars would be proud of. But 19 minutes and 7.5 points later, there is absolutely no sign of any of that talent this season.\n\nYou can move on to others like Gabe Vincent, who, even before he suffered his knee injury, shot worse percentage in his career in the five games he appeared for you guys since his rookie season. A case so bizarre it belongs on \u201cX-Files\u201d is whatever is going on with D\u2019Angelo Russell. There are moments in which I try to convince myself that he will be the reason that you knuckleheads win a championship. Yet there are certain nights that I look upon his stat line to see how he contributed to a specific game, and I am beside myself.\n\nAll of the right things were said in the preseason. Russell was committed to playing on the defensive side of the ball posting an above-average defensive rating, while also a 124.9 offensive rating. That would have meant that D\u2019Angelo Russell would be better at offense this season than Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, and Jalen Brunson.\n\nIt seems like every shooter known around the association for knocking down jumpers arrives on a LeBron James-led team and, all of a sudden, they simply forget how to put the ball into the basket. I am fully convinced that even if this Laker squad signed Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, they would still end up bottom-half of the league in 3-point percentage.\n\nOutside of just your roster, what in the name of lineup changes is going on with Darvin Ham? He gets a new lineup more often than Micah Richards! Why would you put your third-best player (Russell) on the bench? Why won\u2019t you play a 6-foot-10 stretch four with size and length? Why are you so hot and cold with Rui, Cam and Max\u2019s minutes?! I need answers!\n\nAll logic is thrown out the window when it pertains to the Los Angeles Lakers. I never would have believed that within the next few weeks, they could beat the number one team in the Western Conference and get a hard-fought win over the Clippers, but lose to Memphis, Utah and Brooklyn. This is what I get for being a fan, and to tell you the truth, I simply don\u2019t know how much more of this I can take.\n\nFigure it out, Los Angeles, because if you don\u2019t, I will strip the starting lineup of all their basketball prowess Monstars style and replace them with the likes of some former Laker Legends. Are you familiar with names like Jordan Hill, Xavier Henry, Jordan Farmar, Robert Sacre, and Swaggy P? Have fun winning 10 games a season!\n\nRespectfully, you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n```"}

With viewership up 7.4% from last year\u2019s game, according to Nielsen, this year\u2019s game was the most-watched Super Bowl of all time and the most-watched television event since the Apollo 11 moon landing. There were approximately 100 million more viewers for this year\u2019s big game than the first Super Bowl in 1967. Nielsen also reported that about 3.5 million people watched the game through Univision and Nickelodeon.\n\nAccording to CBS, which televised the event on Sunday, the main broadcast garnered the largest audience for a single network in American history. Super Bowl LVIII\u2019s stream on Paramount+ also broke the record for the most streamed Super Bowl of all time.\n\nThe game drew many celebrities to Las Vegas\u2019 Allegiant Stadium, and the game\u2019s commercials were equally as star-studded. From actor Michael Cera\u2019s CeraVe lotion ad to Beyonce\u2019s Verizon commercial, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce weren\u2019t the only names talked about during Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the commercials because I know that they are going to have celebrities,\u201d said Alma Sanchez, a master\u2019s student studying social work. \u201cAnd they are not in their typical roles.\u201d\n\nMany Super Bowl LVIII commercials starred Gen Z celebrities, relying on social media trends to market their products. An ad featuring TikTok star Addison Rae showcased the internet celebrity enjoying Nerds clusters candy. Rapper Ice Spice appeared in a Starry soda ad, throwing hits at rival beverage Sprite.\n\nRook Campbell, a communications and advertising professor, said that one of the keys to appealing to Gen Z is to relate to them. \u201cIf the campaign is something that creates content and people want to share it and spread it or return to it and it adds value or seems as a representation of the digital, cultural spaces or other that Gen Z is in, I think that those are some ingredients that are successful,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII commercials also appealed to the older generation of viewers. Alan Yale Abrahamson, a journalism professor and sports writer, said that his favorite Super Bowl ads didn\u2019t feature Gen Z celebrities. \u201cI loved the Dunkin\u2019 commercial,\u201d Abrahamson said. \u201c[I] thought it was hilarious. Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, J-Lo and Tom Brady are not Gen Z. I also loved the Popeyes commercial. Same. Really funny. Ken Jeong is not Gen Z.\u201d\n\nWith millions of dollars being spent, Super Bowl ads this year sparked plenty of controversy as well. From the Uber Eats peanut allergy, Scientology\u2019s \u201cDecide for Yourself,\u201d to a Christian \u201cHe Gets Us\u201d Jesus ad, many conversations were sparked about the appropriateness of some ads.\n\nRegardless of the content of Super Bowl ads, their significance cannot be denied. For Carolina De La Torre, a second-year health science and engineering master\u2019s student, the commercials are her favorite part of the Super Bowl, and \u201cthe best [ads] of the year.\u201d For Campbell, they\u2019re interesting conversation topics. \u201cThe Super Bowl and its brands are cultural pieces that sometimes we flock to and celebrate, and others, of course, go get food during that time,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThen it becomes like the common text that we all culturally have consumed in one way and chatter about for a few days at minimum.\u201d\n```"}

Students share their opinion on a recent poll about how the rest of the country views California.\n\nA street in Los Angeles. (Photo courtesy of Brendan Egli)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino, Diego Ynzunza and Heli Ruiz\nFebruary 13, 2024 at 6:06 pm PST\n\nWith sunny beaches and clear skies, California has earned its nickname of The Golden State. For decades, people have flocked to California for a better life, often with a romanticized view of the state. Yet, according to the L.A. Times, this perception of the \u201cGolden State\u201d is far from accurate to some.\n\nCanadian marketing company Leger conducted a survey for the L.A. Times last month involving a thousand U.S. residents, 120 of whom were California residents. Half the people surveyed believe the state is in a form of decline, and 48% of Republicans believe the state is \u201cnot really American.\u201d\n\nStudents had mixed reactions about the polling results. \u201cI think that anyone could really see that it\u2019s going downhill,\u201d said Kyle McNamara, a junior majoring in theater from Ohio. \u201cI think the state is in decline...with the homeless issues and the laws that they\u2019ve passed.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans surveyed identified California as being un-American, but some students believe California to be the definition of American. \u201cI feel like American philosophies should be built on the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d said Aditya Thiyag, a sophomore majoring in journalism, and Annenberg Media contributor. \u201cThat means providing the best care you can and the best freedoms you can to everyone instead of being discriminatory. I think in that regard, if that\u2019s what it means to be American, then California\u2019s doing a damn good job of it.\u201d\n\nSome who view California as being on a decline say that it is because of its cost of living. California is one of the most expensive states to live in, with the cost of living increasing yearly despite wages being raised to combat it. This has led to residents moving out of California into states like Texas, according to the L.A. Times. The Times also claims some reasons are lower taxes and more affordable housing costs.\n\nWhile the cost of living may be a factor for many in leaving California, its education is a draw for some. California is typically known as one of the states with the most prestigious colleges. Despite five California universities landing in Forbes\u2019s list of the top 25 schools \u2013 with USC being placed 14th \u2014 only three in 10 survey respondents believed California\u2019s college education was superior to other states.\n\nOne student believes this is partly due to the tuition costs. \u201cIf you\u2019re outside, there\u2019s no real reason I see for you to come in unless you\u2019re super rich because you can\u2019t really afford it, and you can get the same opportunities elsewhere,\u201d said Alyssa Garcia, a freshman studying health and human sciences and an L.A. native. \u201cIf you did want to come, you could just get a degree somewhere else where it would probably be a lot cheaper and then move here if you wanted to.\u201d\n\nEven with evidence of people moving out, high prices, along with 50% of those surveyed saying California is on the decline, plenty still believe it is a successful state. About seven to 10 Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 think California has had a positive impact on the U.S., according to the survey. In addition, six out of ten adults agree that California is a trendsetter and positively affects the country.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is the trendsetter when it comes to health care practices [and] when it comes to education,\u201d Thiyag said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily believe that California is in decline, but I do think it\u2019s better than other areas in the country.\u201d```"}

You\u2019re in your dorm room, eating your way through that Valentine\u2019s Day chocolate gift tin you got for $40 at the Village Target. It was a bit of a splurge; you told yourself that you would share the chocolates, but that didn\u2019t happen. Another year will go by, and you\u2019re still alone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna buy a bunch of frozen food and the Trader Joe\u2019s mini ice creams and go home and cry myself to sleep,\u201d said Sanjana Senthil, a junior studying business of cinematic arts.\n\nValentine\u2019s Day is a day of chocolate, flowers and love \u2014 for some. But for USC singles, it\u2019s just another reminder of their relationship status. Single students shared their sentiments about the holiday, criticizing its sensationalized nature.\n\n\u201cIf you celebrate [Valentine\u2019s Day], that\u2019s good for you,\u201d said Weilian Zhang, a junior majoring in business administration. \u201cBut you know, me personally, I\u2019ll be in the gym, working on myself ... if I see a couple walk by I\u2019m gonna use that anger, because I\u2019m single, to get that extra rep in.\u201d\n\nZhang said he sees Valentine\u2019s Day as an opportunity to harness the pain of heartbreak to focus on self-improvement. He says he\u2019s too busy to even think about love.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m loyal to the dumbbells,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nWhile Zhang dials in at the gym, Senthil finds it hard to stay motivated on the fated February 14.\n\n\u201cIf anything, it makes me shut down completely, but I guess I do work harder when I\u2019m trying to avoid my own thoughts,\u201d Senthil said.\n\nZhang said the capitalistic and materialistic underpinnings of the holiday aren\u2019t lost on him.\n\n\u201cYou have all these anniversaries and Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another way to spend money.\u201d\n\nOthers are looking to turn their luck around by taking a shot in the dark \u2014 going on a date on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going on a date with a guy from Hinge, I don\u2019t even know him,\u201d said Michelle Rojas, a graduate student. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for a few weeks, so we\u2019re going to Tartine in Santa Monica and just having coffee, talking about our lives and I don\u2019t know, hopefully we hit it off.\u201d\n\nBut if push comes to shove, students said they will always have their friends to fall back on for support.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re painting and drinking wine and we\u2019re eating cake and pizza and just talking, gossiping, I don\u2019t know, talking about boys I guess ... I\u2019m more excited for that,\u201d Rojas said.\n\nJazz studies doctoral student Yafeu Tyhimba is a hopeless romantic. He said he\u2019ll be playing soulful jazz at Wilshire Ebel Theater while dreaming about his perfect date.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re outside, you see the stars, you hear some sort of music. You\u2019re at a really nice restaurant, and you\u2019re just looking in somebody\u2019s eyes,\u201d Tyhimba said.\n\nWhile lovers may spend time seeking out the best date spots, lone peas in the pod look to other activities to take their minds off of the festivities. Some students are taking it upon themselves to host events that both singles and couples can attend.\n\nLeyla Akgedik, a junior majoring in fine arts, will spread the love on Tuesday by offering free roses to students in the Village. She said she celebrates the holiday by showing compassion and love for everyone.\n\n\u201cI think of love, and not in a personal relationship kind of way,\u201d Akgedik said. \u201cBut more human values, bringing people together and bringing communities together instead of one-to-one relationships.\u201d\n\nShe is also hosting a poetry night on Valentine\u2019s Day through Erguvan Art & Academy, a youth program advocating for world peace through fine arts. Her Roommate Compassion event aims to promote kindness and harmony through singing songs, reading poems and celebrating with friends.\n\nHere are some other events located on campus to enjoy the festivities. Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention services (RSVP) will host tables throughout the student community centers in the Student Union Center. Each table will have five jars, each filled with a different color of Hershey\u2019s Kisses. Every color represents a different relationship value. RSVPS hopes students will learn what their \u201cValentine\u2019s Values are.\u201d\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t float your boat, you could also go to the Farmer\u2019s Market in the lawn space between Doheny Library and Pardee Tower. There, USC Student Health will have a special booth where students can win prizes and learn more about their services.\n\nIf all else fails, the USC Peace Garden will be open from 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. There, students can garden, study, relax or even cry.\n\n\u201cTo the single people out there, I believe in you,\u201d said Sanjana Senthil, a junior studying business of cinematic arts. \u201cYou may not have anyone and you may be alone, but that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m always here for you.

The event featured special guest Dr. Ilyash Shabazz, the third daughter of Malcolm X, speaking with USC Bass Labs founding director Allissa V.

The holiday was officially added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in September 2022. It\u2019s defined as \u201ca holiday observed as a time to celebrate friendships especially among women.\u201d The holiday was first introduced in the popular comedy show Parks and Recreation, where characters celebrate the holiday annually by sipping coffee and eating waffles together over breakfast. Leslie Knope, deputy director of the parks and recreation department depicted in the show, describes the holiday best. \u201cWhat\u2019s Galentine\u2019s Day?

Planning on calling a car to get home from class? Or ordering in for a self care night? Well, your plans might have to be changed. Tomorrow, rideshare and delivery drivers across the country for Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash are striking, as they demand for better wages and working conditions.\n\nWe spoke to Alejandro Rodriguez, a driver with Uber and Lyft for over 8 years. Rodriguez is a member of Rideshare Drivers United, a coalition heading the strike tomorrow. Rodriguez shared that he has faced a significant decline in pay over the years, as the rideshare platforms have taken a larger chunk of ride fares. Rodriguez feels that rideshare companies have had no response to the rising cost of gas and car insurance. He is also calling for increased transparency between how much of the ride fare is going to the driver vs. the platform. Rodriguez hopes that this strike will put pressure on rideshare companies to instill more trust in their drivers, as well as increase their wages.\n\nRodriguez: My main goal for why I\u2019m striking is for Uber and Lyft to respect our rights. They haven\u2019t respected us and on the contrary, have taken actions to limit our wages. As costs for gas and insurance have increased, our wages and earnings per mile have decreased.\n\nBut what about those on the other side- those who rely on these services? We talked to USC students to hear their perspective on the strike and its potential effects on the USC community. Roxane Zaimi, a masters student majoring in both aerospace engineering and engineering management, shared that the strike does not come as a surprise to her.\n\nZaimi: It\u2019s no secret that everyone has known that they haven\u2019t been paid that well for a while. They\u2019re still being paid pretty badly. They\u2019re all working crazy hours.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s strike will also expand to delivery services like Doordash. Zaimi feels that Dashers are also being mistreated.\n\nZaimi: Well, you\u2019re already up charging like, essentially like restaurant prices like and then to see the fact that you\u2019re spending so little that amount of money that you\u2019re getting on your drivers is just like, like for like you wouldn\u2019t even have a company if it weren\u2019t for the drivers.\n\nEmily Lynch, a USC junior studying law, history, and culture, shared that the strike will be affecting her Valentine\u2019s Day plans.\n\nLynch: Specifically for Lyft, my goal was to go with my friends to their apartment, which is on the other side of campus because I live in the sorority house. And we were going to do a little Galentine\u2019s Day dinner before we went to the 901. And so now it\u2019s going to suck having to walk everywhere because it\u2019s pretty dangerous.\n\nLynch\u2019s dilemma is shared by many USC students, who heavily rely on the Lyft rideshare service provided by USC to navigate what they feel is an unsafe area surrounding campus. Alex Li, a sophomore studying architecture, looked at the bigger picture.\n\nLi: I can imagine that it would have a pretty big impact on, you know, events that are happening that because it is Valentine\u2019s Day, imagine people would be taking a Lyft or taking Uber to see other people and get together.\n\nDespite the inconvenience, Li is interested to see how big of an inconvenience and impact this strike will have.\n\nLi: If this has never happened before. Like, maybe we don\u2019t realize how much of a dependency we have on Uber and DoorDash and Lyft. Yeah. Oh, wow. I\u2019m kind of excited to see what happens now.\n\nThe strike is more than just a day without rides- it\u2019s a call to action that underscores the essential roles of rideshare drivers in our daily lives and the need for change by companies like Uber, Lyft, and Doordash.\n```"}

Surprise, surprise, both are represented by none other than super agent and notorious negotiator Scott Boras.\n\nHere are my top three contenders for the Commissioner\u2019s Trophy:\n\n#1: Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nThis is clearly not a surprise after their major offseason deals for right-hander Tyler Glasnow, ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto and, oh yeah, the highly acclaimed Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers now have a loaded bullpen with these additions, even though Ohtani is limited to serving as just a designated hitter until 2025. Keep in mind that the pen was already occupied by breakout stars Bobby Miller and Emmet Sheehan. These three pitching upgrades alone raised the Dodgers up in the ranks, but that\u2019s not the only reason they hold the top spot.\n\nThe batting lineup has grown even deeper with the acquisitions of right fielder Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez and center fielder Manuel Margot. Hern\u00e1ndez has a career batting average of .261 with a .316 OBP, similar to Margot\u2019s career .255 AVG and .309 OBP. Hern\u00e1ndez is predicted to be in the cleanup spot. Both sluggers will boost the already adept lineup which consists of Freddie Freeman, Mookie Betts and Jason Heyward.\n\nWhen asked about their offseason moves, Dave Roberts gave high praise to Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. \u201cOur ownership and front office did a fantastic job, a lot of man-hours trying to work with both sides to get a deal done,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nDodgers are yet again placed at the top of power rankings, but will they actually justify the hype? That\u2019s always the question.\n\n#2: Atlanta Braves\n\nThe Braves have won 18 National League pennants and four World Series titles with their most recent in 2021 against the Houston Astros. The franchise is in this annual conversation every year and for a good reason: they are eager to win. The Braves spent the offseason proving just that by adding new talent to their roster and retaining big shots in preparation for the upcoming season.\n\nThe Braves signed former top prospect Jarred Kelenic, who previously played outfielder for the Seattle Mariners. He posted a .253 AVG and .327 OBP in the 2023 season with 94 hits and 11 home runs. Kelenic is still full of potential at only 24 years old, giving the Braves another solid bat in already stacked order.\n\nAfter unanimously winning the 2023 NL MVP award, Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. remains at the top of the lineup, poised for another outstanding season. Acu\u00f1a Jr. recorded an absurd .337 AVG, .416 OBP, 217 hits, 73 steals and 41 home runs in the 2023 season. Also returning are second baseman Ozzie Albies, third baseman Austin Riley and first baseman Matt Olson, the three of whom combined for 518 hits and 124 home runs in the 2023 regular season.\n\nFurthermore, there weren\u2019t really many crucial changes to be made following their postseason run. Despite falling short to the Phillies, this team is just steady. But still, the Braves elevated their bullpen this offseason, signing left-hander Chris Sale to a $38 million, 2-year deal with a club option for the 2026 season \u2014 a fairly low-risk, high-reward move in exchange for former Braves infielder Vaughn Grissom.\n\nThe veteran Sale has proven himself at a high level as a seven-time All Star with a career 3.10 ERA and over 2,000 strikeouts, but he\u2019s also had injury hiccups with a Tommy John Surgery in 2020, which was followed by a rib fracture and right wrist fracture in the 2022 season.\n\nAll in all, Atlanta is consistently high in the ranks because of their hard work both behind the scenes and on the field.\n\n#3: New York Yankees\n\nThe Yankees were aggressive this offseason and managed to lock in power-hitting outfielder and potential MVP candidate Juan Soto at $31 million for the 2024 season. Soto played with the San Diego Padres for the 2023 season and posted a .275 AVG and .410 OBP with 156 hits and 35 home runs. Now, he\u2019s moved across the way and will play alongside five-time All-Star Aaron Judge, who has played in New York for eight seasons.\n\nFollowing the 2022 season, Judge signed a 9-year, $360 million extension which could keep him with the Yankees until he retires. On the other side of the ball, the Yankees also made improvements building their bullpen. Most notably, they signed right-hander Marcus Stroman to a 2-year, $37 million contract.\n\nStroman had a 2.96 ERA in the first half of the 2023 season with the Chicago Cubs before he injured his hip and ribs, which then pulled his ERA up to 3.95. Nonetheless, the two-time All Star is a poor-contact specialist with the second-highest ground ball rate of 56.7% among pitchers with at least 1,000 innings since 2014, Stroman\u2019s debut season.\n\nAcross his career, Stroman has been a solid starter with a 77-76 record and a career ERA of 3.65.\n\n\u201cThe culture we have with the Yankees that we project constantly is our intent to win,\u201d said Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman, via ESPN. \u201cWe\u2019re here. We\u2019re in it to win it.\u201d\n\nWith the talent of Judge, Soto and Stroman combined, the Yankees have a chance to take home the hardware.\n```"}

City officials are threatening to step in.\n\nAn unfinished high-rise development in the downtown entertainment district that has become the target of graffiti taggers who have struck dozens of floors is seen in Los Angeles on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Keira McNamara, Cordelia Weld, and Dash Chaiyasen\nFebruary 13, 2024 at 5:04 pm PST\n\nAfter tagging 30 floors of the abandoned Oceanwide Plaza, Angelenos are now paragliding off its roof into the heart of Downtown Los Angeles, alarming city officials. The Oceanwide Plaza was slated to be one of the most luxurious building developments in Downtown L.A. However, developer Oceanwide Holdings deserted the over one billion dollar project after filing for bankruptcy in 2019, and two weeks ago graffiti artists claimed its windows as their new canvases.\n\nSpray painters broke into the complex late at night to tag the building windows with phrases like \u201cset the pace,\u201d \u201camen\u201d and \u201cforever.\u201d Nearly 30 floors have been tagged by various graffiti artists and the vandalism has yet to cease. Now, videos are circulating on social media of paragliders jumping off the building near Crypto Stadium.\n\nThe L.A. City Council recently voted to secure the site, restore the sidewalks and remove all graffiti if the property owners fail to respond by Saturday. Councilmember Kevin de Le\u00f3n also introduced a motion Tuesday seeking to allocate $3.8 million to secure the abandoned skyscraper.\n\nLAPD and Mayor Karen Bass view the graffiti as dangerous acts of vandalism, trespassing, burglary and other crimes. According to the LAPD, 12 arrests were made on Sunday at the Oceanwide Plaza. This followed the arrest of four individuals on February 6 who were found in the building and booked for trespassing.\n\nIn addition to the recent arrests, Bass told reporters she\u2019s extremely concerned about the dangers the taggers are facing. \u201cI guarantee you tragedy will take place there if that place is not boarded up quickly,\u201d Bass told NBC Los Angeles. \u201cNew fences will be put up, but it\u2019ll take a few days. The owner should reimburse the city for every dime.\u201d\n\nBecause Oceanwide Plaza has been abandoned for roughly five years, many L.A. locals have viewed the unfinished development as an eyesore. Stefano Bloch, former L.A. graffiti artist and current University of Arizona professor, believes that graffiti is a subcultural art form. He said the taggers have little to no concern for the potential repercussions of their art. Instead, they prioritize their self-expression.\n\n\u201cI think I speak for most graffiti writers when I say graffiti writers don\u2019t want a relationship with the city, and the minute the city makes something even tacitly legal, graffiti writers will just walk the other way and go write on other walls,\u201d Bloch said. \u201cSo graffiti writers don\u2019t wait for the city\u2019s approval. Graffiti writers are bolder than that; they kind of take what they want. And in this case, they\u2019re taking the towers for their own use.\u201d\n\nBloch said many of these artists are willing to risk potential legal trouble to express themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s members of a transgressive, illicit subculture taking it upon themselves, without any exchange of money and writing their names on a building that\u2019s been abandoned by people with power and money,\u201d Bloch said. \u201cThe motivation is recognition, notoriety, fame, adventure, all of the most basic aspects of what it means to be a human.\u201d\n\nSome students said they respect graffiti as an art form but do not fully approve of the taggers\u2019 actions. \u201cIn school, some people say it\u2019s [graffiti] the ultimate kind of expression of art because it\u2019s putting anything that you want in the public eye,\u201d said design major Mateo Garcia. \u201cIt allows the culture of L.A. to actually be seen. Not everything is super pretty and pristine.\u201d\n\nGarcia also said he appreciates the artists\u2019 willingness to accept risk in the pursuit of self-expression. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool that different artists came together to create so much graffiti in such a short amount of time,\u201d said Janette Fu, a business administration and journalism double major. \u201cIt\u2019s really dangerous for them to climb the building and spray paint without any sort of net to catch them if they fall. These artists are really committed to their craft.\u201d\n\nFu also raised concerns about this art form\u2019s negative effects. \u201cGraffiti is a valid, but illegal, form of art,\u201d Fu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different way to express yourself... However, there can be a better way to incorporate graffiti into the world. Illegally spray painting walls can hurt businesses and can also hurt the environment by emitting volatile organic compounds.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Nell Redmond)\n\nBy James Bao\nFebruary 13, 2024 at 2:53 pm PST\n\n\u201cTriple Threat\u201d is a column by James Bao in which he covers trends in the NBA through an analytical lens.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors are in hibernation. But this time, the turnaround could be quick. Ever since Kawhi Leonard brought home the franchise\u2019s first Larry O\u2019Brien trophy (and then dipped), Raptors fans have felt a lack of excitement and direction. However, the team\u2019s trades this year have fueled optimism for another Jurassic Park takeover sooner than anticipated.\n\nAfter four transactions in six weeks, the Raps turned these players:\nPascal Siakam\nOG Anunoby\nDennis Schroder\nPrecious Achiuwa\nOtto Porter Jr.\nThad Young\nMalachi Flynn\n\nInto these:\nRJ Barrett\nImmanuel Quickley\nBruce Brown\nKelly Olynyk\nOchai Agbaji\nJordan Nwora\n2024 first-round pick (via Pacers)\n2024 second-round pick (via Pistons)\n2026 first-round pick (via Pacers)\n\nNo, these trades don\u2019t exactly seem the most glamorous on paper and most definitely will not make an immediate impact \u2014 but they pave the way for a potentially game-changing offseason. Losing Anunoby is a tough pill to swallow, but acquiring a former third overall pick plus an almost sixth man of the year type player could be worth it.\n\nMany of us forget Barrett and Quickley\u2019s talents, as they\u2019re often overshadowed by the New York Knicks\u2019 Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle. Since the trade on Dec. 30, Barrett is averaging 20.7 points (up from his Knicks average of 18.8), shooting 54.7% from the field (up from 42.8%), grabbing 6.8 rebounds (up from 3.9) and dishing out 3.9 assists (up from 3).\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen Quickley\u2019s off-ball craftiness in New York, but he\u2019s also an excellent ball handler that should fit comfortably beside first time All-Star Scottie Barnes, who\u2019s been assuming a point-forward role. In theory, the 6-foot-2 guard should thrive in Toronto as both an off-ball weapon and a play initiator, relieving some of Barnes\u2019 playmaking pressure.\n\nSiakam\u2019s departure was inevitable, in my opinion. Despite being a core contributor in the 2018-19 championship season, the Cameroonian forward is turning 30 and about to make a bag that the Raptors can\u2019t afford. Re-signing the talented forward would take a max contract, which means losing 22-year-old Barnes when his rookie deal ends next season due to salary cap restrictions, and the Raptors aren\u2019t about to let their former fourth-overall pick walk for nothing.\n\nBy engaging in a three-team deal that sent Siakam to the Pacers, the Raptors acquired multiple draft picks and a solid backup guard in Brown, whose contract includes a $23 million team option next year. The front office can keep him for that amount, let him go or try to bring him back for less money.\n\nToronto\u2019s intentions are clear at this point \u2014 they\u2019re prioritizing flexibility and preparing for a successful offseason. This is evinced by two more trades at and around the trade deadline on Feb. 8. The team unloaded Schroder\u2019s upcoming $13 million to the Brooklyn Nets for Spencer Dinwiddie, who immediately got waived to create more cap space. Olynyk and Agbaji were also welcomed to the 6ix. The former is in the last year of his deal, and the latter is a 2022 lottery pick who can develop into a rotational guard in the near future.\n\nThough a first-round pick was traded away as a part of this deal, it\u2019s projected to be the lowest among four other teams involved, likely meaning a late-round selection that won\u2019t significantly influence the immediate future.\n\nAfter these changes, Toronto is expected to hold approximately $55 million in cap space this offseason. This allows them to carry Quickley\u2019s restricted free agency bid while still leaving space for headline signings. If all things go right, the Jurassic Park\u2019s revival could be just around the corner.\n\n\u201cTriple Threat\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

Arguably the best romantic-comedy from the early 2000s, this movie follows young teenager Jenna Rink (Jennifer Garner), who desperately yearns to be popular. The answer to her insecurities? Time. After all, wouldn\u2019t everything be better if she were just older, mature and successful? During Jenna\u2019s 13th birthday, her nerdy best friend Matt Flamhoff (Mark Ruffalo) gifts her wishing dust, which she uses to inadvertently jump 17 years forward. To the newly-transformed adult Jenna\u2019s elation, she finds out she got everything she wanted: a top position at a renowned fashion magazine, an attractive boyfriend and a luxurious lifestyle of swanky parties and influential acquaintances. Her adult life turned out to be the textbook definition of thirty, flirty and thriving, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t come with its own set of challenges. 13 Going on 30 is the classic, perfect romantic-comedy: the perfect blend of early 2000s nostalgia, heartwarming charm and natural chemistry between Garner and Ruffalo.\n\nFor those of you who love your gals!\nThelma & Louise (Roku), Little Women (Hulu) Valentine\u2019s Day is as a good time as any to recognize the value of, you guessed it, the girls. The girls in your life who uplift you and champion you. The girls who will be in your life forever. The first film that comes to my mind is, of course, Thelma & Louise starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. These are two women who truly know each other and find their identity through a shared female perspective. It\u2019s truly amazing to see their friendship progress from a seemingly harmless road trip to an all-out police chase down. You won\u2019t be able to forget the final scene, a perfect picture of a triumphant, us-versus-the-world friendship. Greta Gerwig\u2019s Little Women also might hit the spot, especially if you\u2019re a dreamer. It follows the well-known novel by Louisa May Alcott, featuring the March sisters: Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth, who all have vastly different aspirations in life. This movie does a fantastic job of portraying the powerful intimacy of the March sisters\u2019 connection that exceeds mere blood, through their celebrations and grievances. The sisters\u2019 journey takes them to see the value in their individuality. One of my favorite quotes comes from Meg March (Emma Watson), who tenderly reminds her sister, \u201cJust because my dreams are different than yours doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re unimportant.\u201d Note: While these two movies might not be classified as classic romantic-comedies, they both contain elements of the genre.\n\nFor those of you who love your job (work over jerks edition)\nLegally Blonde (Max) Intelligence comes in all forms, including knowing that it\u2019s impossible to use half-loop top stitching on low-viscosity rayon (it would snag the fabric). Sorority house leader Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) proves her fashion-savviness and quick thinking in the first few opening scenes of this iconic movie. Elle leads a perfect life with a perfect boyfriend whom she intends to marry \u2014 until he dumps her in anticipation of him starting law school, saying he needs to \u201cmarry a Jackie, not a Monroe.\u201d To win him back, she gains admission to Harvard Law (what, like it\u2019s hard?) and after facing his rejection, quickly falls in love with the subject of law. Elle Woods never sacrifices who she is or diminishes her perspective, even though it starkly contrasts her serious, high-brow classmates. Her successes demonstrate you can be smart and fashion-minded, well-spoken and girly, analytical and romantic. (Plus, some of the scenes were filmed on USC\u2019s campus! During law school orientation, you could catch glimpses of Bovard Auditorium.)\n\nFor those of you who love classic adaptations\nShe\u2019s the Man (Netflix), 10 Things I Hate About You (Hulu), Clueless (Paramount+) The only thing better than Shakespeare is Shakespeare set in high school with the kings and queens of the cafeteria. Modern adaptations of the playwright\u2019s work have almost cemented itself as its own genre within the realm of romantic-comedy. Let\u2019s talk about some of the best ones out there. She\u2019s the Man is probably the lesser-known Shakespeare adaptation, yet it might be my favorite one. Based on Twelfth Night, this film is pure hilarity. Amanda Bynes portrays Viola Hastings, a talented soccer player who dreams of playing for UNC-Chapel Hill. When she discovers the girls team has been cut, she goes to a new boarding school while pretending to be her twin brother, Sebastian, who went to London with his band, so she could play on the boys soccer team. Things get a little complicated when she falls for the team captain (young Channing Tatum), who\u2019s crushing on the popular girl, who\u2019s crushing on who she thinks Sebastian is, while the real Sebastian\u2019s girlfriend keeps turning up. . . you think you know a love triangle? You haven\u2019t seen anything yet. I can\u2019t mention \u201cclassic adaptation\u201d without bringing up 10 Things I Hate About You, a retelling of The Taming of the Shrew. The movie features a ploy for rebel Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date the reserved Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) so new student Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) could pursue her younger, bubbly sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). The dynamic between Ledger and Stiles could only be described as electric. While I\u2019m not sure the ethics of the original premise are the best, there\u2019s no denying we didn\u2019t all want to be Kat Stratford when Patrick Verona performed \u201cCan\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You\u201d on the school bleachers. (Ugh,) as if Shakespeare is the only writer worth adapting! If you think Jane Austen deserves some love, too, check out Clueless if you haven\u2019t already. This modernization of Emma features high school \u201cit girl\u201d Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) who takes on the role of fashion guide and love matchmaker. She seemingly knows everything about other people\u2019s love lives, but when it comes to her, well, she\u2019s certainly clueless!\n\nFor those of you who love your pals\nSex Education (Netflix) It\u2019s not a film, but the 2019 Netflix show, Sex Education, has one of the most beautiful and healthy displays of male friendship I have ever seen represented in the media. While much of the show follows the romantic relationship between high school protagonists Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield) and Maeve Wiley (Emma Mackey), I think the real star of the show is the friendship between Otis and Eric Effiong (Ncuti Gatwa). Their friendship, based on mutual support and loyalty, has its ups and downs, but overall, their love for each other shines through in the way they know each other, like when Otis buys tickets to see Hedwig and the Angry Inch for Eric\u2019s 17th birthday.\n\nFor those of you in love (enemies to lovers edition)\nPrincess Diaries 2 (Disney+), Candy Jar (Netflix) A sequel can rarely meet the quality of its predecessor, yet that\u2019s exactly what Princess Diaries 2 accomplishes. This movie is so underrated in the enemies-to-lovers department. Anne Hathaway shines in her follow-up performance of a shy, unpopular Mia Thermopolis who discovers she\u2019s the heir to the throne of Genovia (a European country). She experiences a mutual attraction to Lord Nicholas Devereaux (Chris Pine) until she realizes a plot to make him the next heir of Genovia. It\u2019s easy for them to hate each other, but it\u2019s harder for them to stay away from each other. Candy Jar is perhaps one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time. This 2018 film covers the senior year of two overachieving high school debaters, Lona Skinner and Bennet Russell (Sami Gayle and Jacob Latimore) who are fixated on attending Harvard and Yale, respectively. As the only two members of the debate club, Lona and Bennet have to compromise in their debating styles in order to compete at a regional and later, state level. The realistic portrayal of ambitious students coupled with the subtle romance makes for a heartwarming movie worth every minute.\n\nHowever you spend your Valentine\u2019s Day, there\u2019s a rom-com for you, so grab your popcorn and snuggle up with your loved ones! These stories are guaranteed to leave you with a warm heart.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Kristin Juszczyk via Instagram)\n\nBy Scarlett Khanbeigi February 13, 2024 at 11:00 am PST\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\u2019 fullback Kyle Juszczyk did not go home with a Super Bowl ring this Sunday, but his wedding ring may be the real win of the season. Kristin Juszczyk, expressed her support for her husband\u2019s Sunday night showdown against the Kansas City Chiefs through a one-of-a-kind bomber jacket.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Kristin took to Instagram to not only show off her game day outfit, but to also create a heartwarming tribute to her husband\u2019s career. As Kristin spun around and pointed out the individual jerseys making up her bespoke jacket, footage of Kyle Juszczyk\u2019s career played out in her reel.\n\nNot only did she incorporate Kyle Juszczyk\u2019s current 49ers\u2019 jersey, but she also cut together and collaged his jerseys from high school, Harvard, and the Baltimore Ravens, who he played for from 2013 to 2016. The result was an eye-catching statement piece featuring virtually every color of the rainbow. One of Kristin\u2019s millions of followers commented, \u201cIt\u2019s giving Kyle Juszczyk eras tour.\u201d\n\nKyle Juszczyk was also seen sporting a custom letterman jacket by Kristin Juszczyk Designs before taking the field for Super Bowl LVIII. For her husband, Kristin sewed together fragments of all of his teammates\u2019 jerseys, which they each individually signed with black Sharpie. The result was a priceless piece of 49ers memorabilia that successfully combined athleisure and style through upcycling.\n\nThe Juszczyks weren\u2019t the only ones rocking Kristin\u2019s designs for the Super Bowl, though, as Gwen Stefani and Kelly Clarkson also donned custom team-neutral puffer vests for the big game. Ahead of the Super Bowl, Kristin listed an almost identical black puffer vest adorned with the official logo and colors of Super Bowl LVIII for auction on her website from Thursday through Saturday. This unique vest, which sold for $75,000, marked the first officially licensed piece created by Kristin as a result of her licensing agreement with the NFL.\n\nKristin\u2019s designs originally caught the attention of the public, and ultimately the NFL, after Taylor Swift was spotted at a Chiefs game in January wearing a custom jacket made out of her boyfriend Travis Kelce\u2019s jersey.\n\nKristin recently recognized Taylor Swift\u2019s contribution to her sudden success in an interview with the Today Show, but also shouted out her mother, who she believes is truly responsible for her success. To honor her mother, who passed away from breast cancer when Kristin was 18, she said in the interview that the proceeds from her puffer vest auction will be donated to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Not only is Kristin Juszczyk using her platform to help support women, but she is also championing creativity and sustainability through each piece of reworked clothing she designs, helping to bridge the divide between sports and fashion.\n```"}

For those that did not have the pleasure of experiencing the game firsthand during their childhood, Poptropica is an Internet game that was first released in 2007. Created by Jeff Kinney, better known for the still ongoing \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid\u201d book series, the game features different \u201cislands,\u201d each with a different quest for the player to complete. According to the Poptropica website, there were once \u201cmore than 35 islands.\u201d The game also previously featured two islands with characters and settings from Kinney\u2019s series.\n\nMy experience with the aforementioned rumor is probably different from others. While most may have followed the ongoing drama during winter break, I found out about the rumor just last week, then did a frantic search online, where I discovered that it was actually a hoax. During those brief few moments when I thought that it was actually shutting down, I was sad as I thought of the times that I spent on it over the years when I was little. I loved going from island to island and solving the puzzles and mysteries. When I was not reading, I was probably playing Poptropica.\n\nMy Experiences with Poptropica\nI first discovered the game through my older sister, and we played a lot together. I also read the Poptropica comic when it was first coming out. It had an interesting plotline and I remember being confused when it suddenly stopped, as it ended on a bit of a cliffhanger. I also loved playing the minigames on some of the islands, such as Mancala, archery, and a few arcade games. Poptropica was my first introduction to those games at a young age.\n\nReflecting on the State of Poptropica Today\nWith that in mind, the last time that I read about Poptropica, I learned that the game that I knew and loved was no more. From what I heard, the old islands (which were the islands that originally ran on Flash) were unplayable on the online version, and you had to either buy the Steam version (which itself does not have close to the amount of islands that were present on the Poptropica website during its peak) or download a separate program to be able to play the \u201cold\u201d version. At first, when I heard the hoax, I thought that it was similar to 2017, when the original Club Penguin shut down and was replaced by Club Penguin Online, which also sent the Internet into a frenzy. I then realized that this was not the same situation, as realistically, the Poptropica we knew and loved back then practically already died in 2020 with the death of Flash.\n\nPoptropica.com Today\nCurious about what the state of Poptropica looked like today, I visited poptropica.com. I was greeted by a message that said that I would have to go to Cool Math Games to access the game. Surprised, I did another search online, where I found out that, according to a post on the Cool Math Games website, Cool Math Games \u201c[took] over the preservation and hosting of popular adventure game Poptropica\u201d just this month (\u201cJanuary 2024\u201d). An understandable decision by them, given their decrease in playership from their peak, but this signified an end of an era nonetheless.\n\nReturning to poptropica.com, I decided to click on the link that they included in their message. I was still curious about what Poptropica looked like today, even if it was now on Cool Math Games.\n\nWhat New Players See\nThe launch page was significantly different from what I remembered, and I was not able to pick my name or fully customize my character. Instead, I had to choose between a few preset options of different character designs. I chose my favorite out of the options, and we were off. I was first dumped onto an island, where I was immediately told to stop someone who stole a statue. I chased them to the next page, where I found that that person simply stole their own statue. I received an \u201cadventurer outfit\u201d for solving that mystery, and I was able to customize my character from that and choose different outfits. Next, I had to talk to another character, who told me to go complete a quest on Fairy Tale Island. Yet, before I did that task, I wanted to look around the map first and see what other islands were available. I got back in the iconic yellow blimp (at least that was still there), and opened the map. I went through the pages of the map, and there was a mix of newer islands that I had not played before and older ones. Currently, there are a total of 13 islands on the Cool Math Games website, including the \u201chome\u201d island that you are immediately dumped onto when you first launch the site. You are placed on that island first regardless of if you are launching the game for the first time or if you are logging back into your account. If you are returning to the same account, you see a button at the bottom of the screen that allows you to easily return to your last played island.\n\nPlaying Time Tangled Island\nI was unsure of what island to play first. When I saw Time Tangled Island on the last page of the map, I knew that I wanted to play it. Time Tangled Island was my favorite island when I was a kid. I replayed it all the time. Instead of erasing my progress on my account, I would create an entirely new account to replay it each time. I especially loved the \u201cfuture\u201d part of the island that you get to see if you finish everything else, which included monorails and a \u201chover platform\u201d to get to my future self\u2019s \u201csky home.\u201d So, this was the island I decided to play to see what Poptropica looked like in 2024. It took me about an hour to play it, with some parts where I rushed through and others where I took my time. Some of the scenes I remembered clearly (like the Mount Everest and the Statue of Liberty workshop), but others weren\u2019t as clear. For example, I completely forgot that Da Vinci gave you a glider or that you could get a Viking Suit. All in all, to me, it seemed really similar if not identical to the original version. It has been years since I played it however, so I might not have been able to catch any subtle differences. It was nostalgic to play the same island that I played back then and seeing the same exact things again. It unlocked memories and images that I completely forgot about, and it was nice revisiting them.\n\nClosing Thoughts\nOverall, I have really enjoyed playing Poptropica. It was fun playing it when I was younger and it was more fun than I expected revisiting it. While I did not try playing any of the newer islands this time, that may be something worth exploring in the future. While the website has shut down permanently, the game definitely has not, so people are welcome to enjoy it until it does.\n```"}

(Photo by Cam Kauffman)\n\nBy Cam Kauffman February 12, 2024 at 11:05 pm PST\n\nDespite leading by just four points at halftime against unranked Arizona, No. 10 USC women\u2019s basketball regrouped for a second-half surge to take down the Wildcats 81-64 Monday night at Galen Center. Per usual, freshman guard JuJu Watkins\u2019 32 points propelled the Trojans (18-4, 8-4 Pac-12), but her efforts didn\u2019t seem quite as individual in this game as they have been as of late.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t beat anyone in this league without being a multiple-effort team,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said of her team\u2019s presence as a unit Monday. In fact, two other Trojans hit double figures in the game, including graduate guard Kayla Padilla (15) and junior forward Rayah Marshall (12). Graduate guard McKenzie Forbes had nine. The Wildcats (12-12, 4-8) had four players in double digits, but none had more than 13.\n\nIn the first half, the Trojans looked disjointed and unable to maintain control of the ball. They turned the ball over 12 times in that half alone and had a series of bad offensive possessions when players did not seem ready to catch the ball at times, resulting in more turnovers. In addition to that, the Trojans\u2019 shots were not finding the net right away. Watkins missed her first four attempts while Padilla missed her first three shots. The team made just 20% of its field goals in the quarter, tied for USC\u2019s sixth lowest single-quarter shooting percentage of the season.\n\n\u201cWe were getting good shots in the first quarter, they just didn\u2019t happen to go in,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cThe message was just to continue to shoot.\u201d\n\nPadilla, however, came into the second quarter with a newfound offensive prowess, as the grad transfer knocked down a rim-around 3-pointer on USC\u2019s first possession to set the tone. As a team, the Trojans missed just two of 11 shots and were 6-for-6 from 3-point land in the quarter. Yet, the Wildcats held on for the time being, finding ways to maneuver inside the Trojans\u2019 defense for easy layups and putbacks. By halftime, Arizona had 20 points in the paint and nine second-chance points compared to USC\u2019s 10 and zero.\n\nGottlieb said her team\u2019s energy in the first half was low, calling Arizona the \u201cmore aggressive team\u201d to start. But, whatever she said in the locker room at halftime must have worked.\n\n\u201cWords are nothing if the team doesn\u2019t respond,\u201d Gottlieb said of her halftime pep talk. \u201cWe completely changed our energy level and we were us.\u201d\n\nAnd the Trojans did. The offense looked fully cohesive for the first time all game, and USC put up 23 points in the third quarter, compared to just 11 by Arizona. Watkins scored 18 of her points in the second half, and she also wreaked havoc on the Wildcats\u2019 defense by driving in and drawing fouls or dishing it outside to a waiting Trojan for a nearly unguarded 3-point attempt. Padilla continued her hot streak, netting two more 3-pointers in the third quarter to bring her streak for five made threes in a row before an eventual miss.\n\nThe USC defense also made massive adjustments, only allowing four second-chance points and forcing 12 Wildcats turnovers in the final two frames. The third and fourth quarters were also keyed by a handful of soul-crushing blocks by Watkins, including a volleyball-esque spike that caused the pink-out Galen Center crowd to erupt. Watkins ended the night with four, but the intensity of the blocks made it feel like she had twice that.\n\nWith Hollywood stars, along with current and past professional athletes regularly in attendance now at USC basketball games, all eyes are on Watkins and this top-ranked squad as the Pac-12 tournament approaches and March Madness looms. Monday\u2019s star studded lineup included actor Will Ferrell and women\u2019s basketball icon Cheryl Miller.\n\n\u201cI think just really reminding myself to play my game will really take me very far,\u201d Watkins said of her mentality through all the outside noise. \u201cAny way I can contribute to the team and get the dub is all that matters.\u201d\n\nNext up, the Trojans travel to the Beaver State to take on Oregon Friday at 7 p.m. followed by a top-ranked matchup against No. 11 Oregon State Sunday at noon.\n```"}

Brianna Sanchez: \u201cWe decided to expand this to a week because part of the wellness committee in USG believes that there\u2019s so many resources on campus, especially wellness resources, whether that be sexual wellness, mental wellness, emotional, spiritual, and so on. It\u2019s just they\u2019re not well utilized by students because they just don\u2019t know about them and they\u2019re not really well promoted.\u201d\n\nThis time of year can be hard for those in and out of relationships... Sanchez recognizes this... so she scheduled the event right around Valentine\u2019s Day... She hopes to promote better understanding of personal love languages. as well as self-love. Sanchez: \u201cA lot of the tables around here have focused like their interactive components around like something of loving yourself or around the ideas of Valentine\u2019s Day. So, we thought this day, this week would be perfect just because it is getting into that atmosphere of Valentine\u2019s, and even if you don\u2019t have someone to spend it with, we\u2019re encouraging you, you to spend it with yourself and really take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nAt a table nearby... under the Sycamore trees...

So you know, I\u2019m always checking out like, different fair to find a community maybe I\u2019ll be interested in.\u201d Xia particularly enjoyed the self-love writing activities at the fair. Students had the opportunity to write a love letter to themselves on colorful pastel paper and put it onto the branches of a self-love tree. Xia: \u201dJournal is very important. Because sometimes you just have all these emotions kind of buried inside of you, and you need to let them go. I always love to journal. And just to reflect on the day, see how you can improve your day next time.\u201d\n\nThe fair is today only, then Wellness Week continues through Feb. 20.

The citywide holiday was declared when the Charlotta Bass Journalism & Justice Lab founder and USC professor Allissa V. Richardson realized that the Charlotta Bass\u2019s name wasn\u2019t well known in Los Angeles. She contacted the City Council representative in USC\u2019s district, Curren Price, to lobby for an official \u201cCharlotta Bass Day.\u201d After months of work, the city council officially declared Bass\u2019s birthday, February 14, Charlotta Bass Day. While the official holiday is on Wednesday, USC Annenberg will celebrate it on February 13.\n\nCharlotta Spears Bass was a prominent Black activist as well as the editor-publisher of the California Eagle newspaper. The Eagle was one of the first and longest-running Black publications in the region. Additionally, Bass was the first Black woman to be nominated for vice president of the United States.\n\n\u201cIn the past, when there [was] very low diversity in newsrooms... oftentimes the telling of stories about Black people was incorrect or from a very biased point of view,\u201d said Olivia Kelleher, a Bass Lab fellow. \u201cBass\u2019s legacy as a truth teller represents a level of depth that demonstrates the importance of telling underrepresented stories,\u201d said Rafiq Taylor, a Charlotta Bass fellow. \u201cHaving Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz as our second visitor for The Second Draft Project adds even more beautiful complexity to our history.\u201d\n\nThe mission of the Charlotta Bass Journalism & Justice Lab is to highlight how Black creators on the West Coast have used media to shine light on social justice issues to and help these creators tell their stories through their own words. On Tuesday, Richardson will host a discussion with Shabazz about her family\u2019s civil rights legacy. Shabbaz will also premiere her Interactive Interview, a tool that allows viewers to ask an AI version of Shabbaz questions about her life or her family\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cA big effort within the Bass lab is to take it upon ourselves to preserve the testimony of Black media makers and civil rights activists, and allow them to tell their story in their own words,\u201d Kelleher said.\n```"}

In 2022, Biden\u2019s social media team, and active followers revised the slogan into an attempt to make Brandon a superhero phenomenon.\n\nBiden posted a photo on Instagram and X late Sunday evening after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, mocking the right-wing conspiracies regarding the NFL and Taylor Swift endorsement. He captioned the post, \u201cJust like we drew it up.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Biden and his counterpart \u201cDark Brandon\u201d generated significant social media attention on various platforms. Biden-Harris HQ, operated by the Biden political campaign, uploaded its first TikTok video just two hours before posting on Instagram. The video featured the president answering football-themed questions.\n\nBiden\u2019s 30-second video garnered almost 6.3 million views on Monday afternoon, with almost 600,000 likes. When asked if he was responsible for deviously plotting the Chief\u2019s victory during the video, he answered, \u201cI\u2019d get in trouble if I told you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the first video on my For You Page,\u201d freshman mathematics major Zain Alam said. \u201cI get it he is trying to appeal to Gen Z, and honestly, TikTok is probably the best place to do it.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign team has faced heightened scrutiny over joining the Chinese-based ownership app. Last year, the White House gave federal agencies 30 days to wipe the app off of all government devices, and 34 states are prohibited from using the app on government devices. But the app is also immensely accessible for Generation Z, and TikTok news consumption is rising.\n\n\u201cYou have never seen a president on TikTok before,\u201d said freshman economics major Ari Cohen. \u201cIt was kind of funny, too.\u201d\n\nWhile some find the Biden-Harris HQ content laughable, others, like communications sophomore Camryn Herman, find it \u201ccringe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is trying too hard, and it\u2019s obvious that someone his age can\u2019t relate to people our age,\u201d Herman said.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign has targeted viewers who do not get their news from traditional outlets. The man behind the camera and Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Rob Flaherty, told the New York Times that \u201c[it] is proof positive of both our commitment and success in finding new, innovative ways to reach voters.\u201d\n\nAs to whether the Biden plan will work, this election is divided by USC students.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it will hurt or help,\u201d Zain said, \u201cBut it is pretty obvious that it\u2019s everywhere.

(Uber Eats via AP)\n\nBy Ari Rose-Marquez and Faith Curry\nFebruary 12, 2024 at 5:56 pm PST\n\nIt cost an average 7 million dollars to put an ad up during yesterday\u2019s Super Bowl game. And companies and religious organizations spent millions more for celebrity endorsements. Beyonce, Tom Brady and Jennifer Lopez were just a few of the A-list celebrities featured in this year\u2019s Super Bowl ads.\n\nFred Cook directs the USC Center for Public Relations. He says ad agencies are overusing celebrities and that it reduces the effectiveness for the brands.\n\nFred Cook: What has happened over the past few years it\u2019s been getting this way for a long time, is that the ad agencies and the clients for them are totally relying on celebrities. And they use them with such frequency that you can\u2019t even remember after the Super Bowl, which celebrity was in which ad. So I think that the fact that everyone is the same dilutes the impact of any of them. And honestly, you can\u2019t remember the brands that are associated with them.\n\nBeyonce is one of the many stars whose celebrity garnered her more attention the brand she represents. At the end of Verizon\u2019s Super Bowl commercial, she announced her new album and released two new singles immediately after airing.\n\nCook: It was brilliant of her. Whether it did anything for Verizon, I don\u2019t know. But it certainly created a lot of awareness for Beyonce and this new album. I went to Spotify right afterwards and listened to that song.\n\nCook says he was surprised by the ad from He Gets Us, a religious advertising campaign.\n\nCook: Probably the one about Jesus, I think was the one was most unexpected. I think that\u2019s the first time that I recall seeing a Christian organization put a Superbowl ad up about Jesus Christ.\n\nHe Gets Us was one of the few organizations to reserve multiple commercial slots during the broadcast. The most, coming from Chinese e-commerce site Temu, who had three 30-second ads with the tagline: Shop like a billionaire.\n\nSean Cudjoe is an undeclared sophomore. He expressed skepticism about Temu\u2019s multiple ads during the game.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Temu was the fifth-largest digital advertiser in the United States but has also developed a reputation for missing packages and mysterious charges.\n\nCudjoe: So personally, I feel like Temu may be a scam. I think it\u2019s really suspicious that they have so many different advertisements, because if it costs like a million dollars, even put one during the Superbowl time, having like three to four in there. All right. I\u2019ve seen enough of Temu.\n\nJournalism major Kristian Nunez says the Super Bowl ads play a big role in keeping viewers entertained.\n\nNunez: The ads are kind of the fallback, I believe, because a lot of people go into the Super Bowl, not really football fans, I\u2019d say just kind of a part of the hype, like a bandwagon. And so the ads are kind of there to keep them, you know, kind of entertained through the whole thing.\n\nWhile the Super Bowl is supposed to be about the game, this year, excitement seemed to be centered more around the celebrities attending the game and starring in commercials rather than the athletes on the field.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Ari Rose-Marquez.\n```"}

Four years after Kobe\u2019s death, the Lakers celebrated the Laker legend last Thursday, Feb. 8, unveiling the first of three new statues to stand around the arena. Before the Lakers-Nuggets game, Kobe\u2019s former teammates, other Laker Legends, his family and current Laker players gathered at a private event to commemorate the late great Bryant.\n\nIn honor of his 81-point performance in 2006 versus the Toronto Raptors, the statue encapsulates Kobe walking off the court after scoring the second-most points in a single game in NBA history. Kobe stands on a triangle platform, representing the triangle offense first created by Tex Winter and later used by Hall of Fame Coach Phill Jackson in his early 2000s Lakers days. Engraved on his right arm, pointing to the sky, are his four daughters: Gianna, Natalia, Brinka and Capri.\n\nPlenty of NBA legends have worn the purple and gold, but probably no one is more impactful to the Lakers franchise and the city of Los Angeles than Kobe \u201cBean\u201d Bryant. Entering the league in 1996 as just an 18-year-old, Kobe delivered on all his promises and brought five championships to the City of Angels in his 20-year career. And he left the franchise on top, including being its all-time leading scorer with 33,643 points.\n\nOn a clear, sunny Friday, Laker and Kobe fans dressed head to toe in purple and gold and crowded in front of Crypto.com Arena to witness the statue for the first time. They took turns taking photos of the statue as it glistened from the sun directly beaming down. \u201cGrowing up watching Kobe, it means everything to see him honored in this way,\u201d said Princess Martin, who was repping Kobe Nine Elite Teams on her feet.\n\nKobe had a special place in every Lakers fan\u2019s heart for all the memorable moments he created on the court. Whether wearing jersey number 8 or 24\u2014both of which the Lakers have retired\u2014Kobe always delivered in the most significant moments, often with his iconic fadeaway shot. Even in the final game of his career, a 37-year-old, injury-riddled Kobe found a way in the dying seconds versus the Utah Jazz. The persistent competitor scored the Laker\u2019s final 13 points, leading an epic fourth-quarter comeback to send himself to retirement. For Laker fans, there was no better ending to a Hall of Fame career.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he dropped 60 points was nothing short of amazing,\u201d said Alejandro Araujo, sporting a Laker\u2019s Starter Jacket. Kobe\u2019s impact extended beyond the basketball court with the \u201cMamba Mentality\u201d by which he lived. His constant dedication to hard work inspired many people, whether basketball players or not, in their own lives. On Mamba Day last Thursday, Johnny Marrero\u2014wearing a shirt with a photo of Kobe and him together at a meet-up\u2014attested to Kobe\u2019s work ethic being the factor in his becoming a lifelong Kobe fan.\n\n\u201cThroughout all his trials and tribulations...he never made excuses,\u201d Marrero said. \u201cEvery injury, he battled it out. He made sure that there might be that one kid that saved up to see him, he wasn\u2019t going to sit out.\u201d\n\nFor fans in attendance, the emotion ran high when they saw the statue for the first time. Kobe impacted communities nationwide, creating many fans from beyond Los Angeles. Another Kobe fan named Armani Joy, originally from Brooklyn, New York, couldn\u2019t contain his emotions as he witnessed the statute in person for the first time.\n\n\u201cI grew up watching him, playing with him in all the video games. This is my guy,\u201d Joy said. \u201cI am extremely thankful to be around people with the same passion as me.\u201d\n\nOtherwise known as \u201cthe house that Kobe built,\u201d the former Staples Center, now known as Crypto.com Arena, is set to welcome another two statues of Kobe around the property. One of them will contain him wearing his other retired jersey number, 24, and the other will feature Kobe with his daughter Gianna, who passed away in the same helicopter crash in Jan. 2020.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/12/no-blockbusters-but-these-3-nba-deadline-trades-spoke-volume/", "response": "```\nNo blockbusters, but these 3 NBA deadline trades spoke volume\n\nThe Talk of Troy\n\nNo blockbuster deals occurred at the buzzer this year, but the NBA trade deadline that passed on Thursday, Feb. 8 at 12 p.m. PST still spoke volumes. The transactions hinted at teams\u2019 intentions as we approach the regular season\u2019s end. Here are three teams that won big this week:\n\nOklahoma City Thunder gain veteran scoring\n\nBy adding Gordon Hayward in a trade with the Charlotte Hornets, OKC\u2019s talented young core just acquired a veteran forward who can help them make a deep push into the playoffs.\n\nCharlotte Hornets receive: Tre Mann Davis Bertans Vasilije Micic Draft compensation\nOklahoma City Thunder receive: Gordon Hayward\n\nDespite entering the season No. 14 in ESPN\u2019s preseason power rankings, the Thunder have exceeded their expectations by a large margin. With over 30 games remaining, they\u2019re only five wins away from tying their win total from last season (40). But with a starting lineup averaging only 22.6 years old, one question remained \u2014 does OKC have enough experience to compete with veteran superstars?\n\nThis is where Hayward can help. Though he\u2019s only played 25 games thus far in 2023-24 due to a left calf strain, the 6-foot-7 forward is averaging 14.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and 4.6 assists on 46.8% field goal percentage. Not top tier, but more than enough to provide firepower from the OKC bench, where he\u2019s expected to fit in after returning from injury.\n\nHayward\u2019s size and versatility will pose a major threat to opposing teams if they give him too much breathing room on the wing. And now teams will have four consistent scorers to worry about in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren and Hayward. This squad will force defenders to scramble and make tough decisions throughout games.\n\n3-point specialist Buddy Hield heads to Philadelphia\n\nAfter sending James Harden away in November, the 76ers were in need of a beyond-the-arc shooter who could stretch out defenses \u2014 and they\u2019ve found perhaps the best long-range marksman available at the deadline.\n\nIndiana Pacers receive: Marcus Morris Sr. Furkan Korkmaz Three second-round picks\nPhiladelphia 76ers receive: Buddy Hield\n\nOne thing has been clear preceding this trade: Philadelphia is bad at perimeter offense. This season, they\u2019re 27th in 3-pointers made per game and 25th in 3-pointers attempted per game out of 30 teams \u2014 numbers that don\u2019t scream playoff-readiness.\n\nBy no means is Hield a replacement for the former MVP\u2019s playmaking and scoring. But his strength as a floor-spacing shooter and off-ball threat might just mesh better with Joel Embiid\u2019s dominant interior presence in the 76ers\u2019 lineup, if and when the big man returns from a meniscus surgery.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 shooting guard is currently top 20 in 3-point attempts per game off of catch-and-shoot possessions (5.1), tying Stephen Curry in that category this season. He is also No. 22 in all-time 3-pointers made in a regular season at 40.1% career accuracy.\n\nBasically, Hield is the exact guy that Philly needs. This transaction should improve the Sixers\u2019 floor spacing and perimeter offense. However, key questions remain. Namely, does the 31-year-old have enough time to find his shooting groove in a post-centered system? And will they be able to avoid more injuries to Embiid and others come April?\n\nThe Big Apple welcomes Bojan Bogdanovic and Alec Burks\n\nOn top of the December trade to acquire the well-rounded forward OG Anunoby, the Knicks have now added two additional shot-makers in Bogdanovic and Burks.\n\nDetroit Pistons receive: Evan Fournier Quentin Grimes Malachi Flynn Ryan Arcidiacono Two second-round picks\nNew York Knicks receive: Bojan Bogdanovic Alec Burks\n\nBogdanovic is scorching the nets this season; he\u2019s having a career-year in both three-pointers attempted and made per game while maintaining an efficient conversion rate of over 41%. Beyond his long-range threat, the Croatian also drives to the hoop well, finishing successfully on nearly half of his attempts at the basket.\n\nBurks, as usual, continues to be an offensive powerhouse coming off the bench, averaging nearly 13 points in 20 minutes a night. His instant offense and ability to play both guard positions will provide valuable depth and ammo to the Knicks\u2019 second unit.\n\nSince the Knicks already have an effective facilitator in Jalen Brunson, acquiring two shot-makers makes perfect sense and sets them up for a formidable playoff run. Currently sitting at 33-19, the Knicks have also surpassed expectations so far this season as other Eastern Conference teams, namely the Bucks and 76ers, have been more vulnerable than expected.\n\nWith Randle\u2019s hopeful return before All-Star weekend, their immediate ceiling has lifted just in time for the playoffs.\n\nDespite the lack of jaw-dropping action at the 2024 NBA trade deadline, one thing\u2019s still certain: the trophy chase just grew a whole lot more unpredictable.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Greg M. Cooper)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner February 12, 2024 at 5:03 pm PST\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 As another season without the playoffs goes by, the Ducks\u2019 main focus has been strengthening their future core. The recent addition of one of the collegiate level\u2019s best players will add even more talent to an already formidable mix.\n\nOn Jan. 8, in one of the season\u2019s biggest trades so far, the Philadelphia Flyers sent Cutter Gauthier, Boston College\u2019s standout forward and the No. 5 overall pick in the 2022 draft, to the Ducks in exchange for defenseman Jamie Drysdale and a 2025 second-round draft pick.\n\nGauthier reportedly didn\u2019t want to play for the Flyers, so Anaheim seized on the opportunity to pick up another quality prospect; Philadelphia was left with no choice but to trade the 20-year-old, further bolstering the Ducks\u2019 stout farm system.\n\nIn addition to winning gold with Team USA at the 2024 World Junior Championship, Gauthier leads the NCAA with 23 goals and has been a catalyst on the star-studded, No. 1-ranked Eagles. At this trajectory, his college success should lead him up to a pro call-up sooner rather than later.\n\nBut what makes Gauthier so special? His 6-foot-2, 200-pound frame makes him strong and physical. Combine that size with his shifty skating ability and powerful shot, and he\u2019s been a major point-producer for BC. He\u2019s not afraid to take ambitious shots and he\u2019s an especially confident player at such a young age.\n\nLast Friday against New Hampshire, Gauthier had an outstanding, four-point performance on two goals and two assists to lift the Eagles to a blowout victory, bringing him up to 38 points on the season in just 26 games.\n\nGauthier shares the ice with fellow premier NHL draftees Will Smith and Ryan Leonard and even then he\u2019s been a true leader on a stacked team. Gauthier has also helped BC earn two wins over the rival Boston University Terriers, who feature the consensus top prospect in the upcoming 2024 draft, Macklin Celebrini.\n\nGauthier was originally a winger before transitioning to play center in college. His pure scoring ability, in conjunction with his physicality, has proved his positional change to be the right choice.\n\nAnaheim has compiled plenty of forward depth, giving them a possible explosive future core of Mason McTavish, Leo Carlsson, and Trevor Zegras. Add Gauthier to that forward pool and Anaheim will not only have an electric goal scorer, but also a puck-battling grinder.\n\nIf his excellence at the NCAA level wasn\u2019t enough of a selling point, Gauthier also dominated at the World Junior Championship, posting 12 points in seven games to co-lead the tournament.\n\nCrucially, the Ducks acquired Gauthier without having to surrender a top piece to the Flyers. While Drysdale has shown flashes of success, he has dealt with injuries that have sidelined him for many games in recent seasons.\n\nGauthier\u2019s acquisition was opportune for Anaheim not only in its timing, but also from a team-building perspective. The Ducks\u2019 future cast was in need of a more reliable scorer, which Gauthier projects to become.\n\nParting ways with Drysdale also made sense, because the Ducks\u2019 defensive prospect pool\u2014headlined by 20-year-old Pavel Mintyukov\u2014looks stacked for the long-term.\n\nAfter an unconventional start to his NHL journey by burning a bridge with the Flyers, Gauthier shifts focus to being a part of the next great Ducks squads. While recent seasons have been uninspiring for Ducks fans, highly touted prospects such as Gauthier should give them excitement for what is to come.\n\nThe front office appears committed to becoming a contender by stacking up talent for the future, of which Gauthier will be a huge part.\n```"}

(Courtesy of USC Sol Price School of Public Policy)\n\nBy Isabel Crespo February 12, 2024 at 4:47 pm PST\n\nLeonard and Pamela Schaeffer donated $59 million to open a new institute at the USC Capital Campus in Washington, D.C., with the goal to produce research that addresses public policy issues and educates students to be active participants in our democratic society. The Leonard D. Schaeffer Institute for Public Policy & Government Service is the first major research and education facility in Washington, D.C., expanding upon two existing programs: USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics and the Leonard D. Schaeffer Fellows in Government Services.\n\n\u201cThe institute will have the faculty, students and postdocs to provide the analysis and facts necessary to counter erosion in public discourse and promote more effective policy solutions,\u201d said Schaeffer, according to USC Today. \u201cThere are times in the life of a university when a vision and an opportunity align to become a powerful force to serve the public good,\u201d USC President Carol Folt said, according to USC Today. \u201cAnd our students and our nation need this now more than ever.\u201d\n\nSchaeffer\u2019s donation will fund the construction of the seventh floor of the Capital Campus reserved for the new institute and will also be used for an endowment for the Leonard D. Schaeffer Fellows in Government Service. This program enables paid fellowships for undergraduate students to work in government offices and network with industry professionals.\n\nThe new Schaeffer Institute will also create additional policy research programs inspired by the current Schaeffer Center to support the undergraduate students in their efforts to connect and learn from public policy and government service professionals.\n\nLeonard Schaeffer is a USC trustee and the founder chairman and CEO of Wellpoint, a medical health insurance company. He\u2019s also the chair of Schaeffer Center\u2019s Board of Advisors and member of USC Price\u2019s Board of Counselors.\n\nDana Goldman, dean of the Price School of Public Policy, will step down July 1 to become the director of the institute. Erica Lovano McCann, assistant vice provost for undergraduate education, will become the executive director of the Schaeffer Fellows in Government Service program.\n\n\u201cThis new institute will widen the scope of such vital, value-focused scholarship and further build on Leonard Schaeffer\u2019s legacy of health-policy leadership,\u201d Vassilios Papadopoulos, dean of USC Mann and John Stauffer Dean\u2019s Chair in Pharmaceutical Sciences, said, according to USC Today.\n```"}

Olivia Rodrigo owns both titles\n\nRodrigo embraces fluidity of genre in her music by combining pop, punk and rock sounds in a fresh way.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo performs \"Vampire\" during the 66th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Maya Hollingsworth\nFebruary 12, 2024 at 4:08 pm PST\n\nPunk-rocker is not the first term that comes to mind when most hear the name of the Disney star turned \u201cDrivers License\u201d singer Olivia Rodrigo. However, with \u201cballad of a homeschooled girl,\u201d which was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 66th Grammys and the release of her sophomore album \u201cGUTS,\u201d the title might suit her more than expected.\n\nAlthough Rodrigo lost the category to boygenius, the nomination brought her name into a space that was defined by strictly rock and punk acts. This includes artists like Nirvana, Green Day, Foo Fighters, The Red Hot Chili Peppers as well as Alanis Morrisette, who is an inspiration for Rodrigo, according to the New York Times.\n\nLooking at multiple tracks from \u201cGUTS,\u201d we see rockstar Rodrigo in full force. In addition to \u201cballad of a homeschooled girl,\u201d her rock and punk leaning titles include \u201call-american bitch,\u201d \u201cget him back!\u201d and \u201cbad idea right?\u201d from \u201cGUTS,\u201d along with \u201cgood 4 u,\u201d \u201cjealousy, jealousy\u201d and \u201cbrutal\u201d from \u201cSOUR.\u201d\n\nRodrigo told the New York Times in an August interview that she\u2019s \u201calways loved rock music, and always wanted to find a way that I could make it feel like me, and make it feel feminine and still telling a story and having something to say that\u2019s vulnerable and intimate.\u201d\n\nHer best example of this \u2018feminine rock\u2019 sound is the opening track of \u201cGUTS:\u201d \u201call-american bitch.\u201d The song alternates between delicate and sweet (but sarcastic) verses and an explosive, angsty chorus.\n\nThe verses include lyrics like \u201cI am light as a feather and as stiff as a board / I pay attention to things that most people ignore\u201d and \u201cI feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean / And I make light of the darkness.\u201d In the same forced sugar-sweet tone, Rodrigo repeats \u201cI\u2019m grateful all the time / I\u2019m sexy and I\u2019m kind / I\u2019m pretty when I cry\u201d as the song closes.\n\nYet in a sharp contrast, Rodrigo\u2019s chorus erupts, screaming the lyrics \u201cI forgive and I forget / I know my age and I act like it / Got what you can\u2019t resist / I\u2019m a perfect all-American\u2013.\u201d\n\nThe juxtaposition the verses and chorus present gives a sense of rebellion. Each time the raging chorus comes along, it is as if Rodrigo is rejecting the impossible standards that come with identifying as a woman (represented in the verses). She also calls out the standard women are often met with to repress their emotions.\n\nThis is precisely what Rodrigo means by \u2018feminine rock:\u2019 the maintaining of her loud, youthful angst and electric guitars without having to sacrifice the depth and themes in her songwriting. Rodrigo is using the traditionally \u2018male\u2019 sounds of punk and rock to express her femininity.\n\nIn an interview with Apple Music, Rodrigo said \u201cI think [all-american bitch] expresses something that I\u2019ve been trying to express since I was 15 years old, this repressed anger and feeling of confusion or trying to be put into a box as a girl.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, this song is also representative of Rodrigo\u2019s multi-faceted sound. Of course, both albums still come with piano ballads and pop-leaning tracks as well her grungier songs. Rodrigo embraces the fact that music genres are not static and can be molded to truly express herself.\n\nEarly in her career, 20-year old Rodrigo is still honing her sound. Just looking at the progression from \u201cSOUR\u201d to \u201cGUTS,\u201d it looks like Rodrigo is leaning more and more into rock and punk. However, other artists like Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato have paved the way for her.\n\nWith both artists being Disney-star-turned-rock-stars who showcased a similar feminine rock sound (for example, the highly criticized \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d). Cyrus won her very first Grammy this year, while Rodrigo already has three under her belt from her first album.\n\nThis signifies that the stigma surrounding feminine rock is slowly fading away. With the Grammys acknowledging her presence in rock music, Rodrigo is notably making a place for herself in the rock and punk genres.\n\nIn her feminine rock song \u201call-american bitch,\u201d she puts it best: \u201cI know my place, I know my place and this is it.\u201d\n```"}

Expand Graduate attacker Ella Heaney had a dominant weekend, scoring nine goals across two games. (Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)  By   Eniola Adeleke February 12, 2024 at  2:07 pm PST \n \n \n The Trojans opened their season on the road with an East Coast double header, facing No. 15 Army Friday afternoon and Villanova Sunday morning. The No. 17 USC squad secured wins in both games, beating Army 13-9 and Villanova 12-11. Friday\u2019s back-and-forth battle between the Trojans and the Black Knights culminated in a final quarter of total Trojan dominance. After going into the fourth quarter tied at seven apiece, the Trojans went on a 6-0 run initiated by graduate attacker Ella Heaney to give them a comfortable lead and erase the Army\u2019s chance at a win. Heaney recorded her 16th-career hat trick against Army, leading USC with a career-high six goals and surpassing 100 career goals, making her the sixth Trojan in program history to do so. Senior attacker Shelby Tilton also recorded a hat trick of her own, scoring all of her goals in the fourth quarter in under four minutes to extend USC\u2019s lead to four goals. The Trojans are now 4-1 all-time in road season openers. Two days and a nearly three-hour road trip later, head coach Lindsey Munday\u2019s squad took on the Villanova Wildcats. Luckily for the Trojans, they did not fall victim to the challenges that accompany playing on the road. Before Sunday, the Trojans were 18-20 all-time in East Coast road matches. \u201cWith traveling cross country ... it\u2019s hard,\u201d Munday said. \u201cIt takes a toll on your body. You just have to stay as focused as you can.\u201d And focused, the Trojans were. They had to be sharp in order to hold off Villanova\u2019s attempts at a late-game comeback led by junior attacker Sydney Pappas, who netted four of her five total goals in the fourth quarter. With 1:16 to play, a USC penalty allowed Villanova to get within one. But, in its second ever meeting against Villanova, USC secured two much-needed possessions to slow the Wildcat\u2019s momentum and grab the win. The Trojans are now 2-0 all-time against Villanova. Last year, the Trojans handled the Wildcats to the tune of a blowout win at McAlister Field, 15-4. Team defense is USC\u2019s key to success. They had the No. 5 defense in the NCAA last season and put it on display again on Sunday, forcing the Wildcats to commit four shot clock violations. However, the Trojans\u2019 offense demonstrated significant resilience and intensity, and deserve equal \u2014 if not more \u2014 credit for the win. Reminiscent of Friday\u2019s game, Heaney gave the Trojans a hot start, scoring two on top of a goal from senior midfielder Claudia Shevitz for a 3-1 first-quarter lead. The second-quarter tides turned in Villanova\u2019s favor as the Wildcats scored three unanswered goals while junior goalkeeper Cate Gallagher came up with two big stops to hold the Trojans scoreless for over 12 minutes. In a moment where Munday\u2019s squad could have panicked, the Trojans stayed cool, calm and collected. \u201cStay confident,\u201d Munday told her players at that moment. \u201cStay patient and the goals will come. If you start playing tight it\u2019s usually not a good thing.\u201d The Trojans heeded the words of the reigning Pac-12 Coach of the Year, which proved to be the difference-maker in a momentum-shifting third quarter. After scoring only once in the second quarter, the Trojans outshot the Wildcats 14-3 and advanced to a 10-4 lead to end the third. The key? Their patient, deliberate offense. From patiently moving the ball to find the right opportunity to going on a fast break to capitalize off transition play, the Trojans trusted their gameplan. \u201cIn both games, our girls believed [that] even if things aren\u2019t going our way, or we don\u2019t think we\u2019re playing our very best, they still know, no matter what, [to] have faith ... that we\u2019re going to win,\u201d Munday said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we saw today.\u201d Although Army and Villanova are not the toughest opponents the Trojans are scheduled to face this season, these weekend wins set the tone for what the Trojans hope will be a successful final ride in the Pac-12 before next year\u2019s move to the Big Ten. \u201cEvery game is big. We\u2019re happy to come away 2-0,\u201d Munday said. The Trojans will have their first home game of the season Saturday at 12 p.m. against Hofstra at Dignity Health Sports Park, one of USC\u2019s two home sites this season as they await the construction of the new Rawlinson Stadium.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nBy Elizabeth Farrington\nFebruary 12, 2024 at 1:29 pm PST\n\nThe Supreme Court is slated to decide on former President Donald Trump\u2019s political fate in the following weeks, as the court heard oral arguments on Feb. 8 about Colorado excluding Trump from the primary ballot. The case Trump v. Anderson is based on the appeal of a Colorado court ruling which excluded Trump from the 2024 Republican primary ballot.\n\nIn the hearing that lasted over two hours, justices across ideological differences heavily questioned the arguments of both Colorado and Trump, considering the consequences of allowing states to decide what candidates end up on their ballots.\n\n\u201cIn this situation a ruling from this court that affirms the decision below, would not only violate term limits, but take away the votes of potentially tens of millions of Americans\u201d said Jonathan Mitchell, Trump\u2019s lawyer for the oral arguments, in a video aired by C-SPAN.\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court ruling was the first of its kind in the United States. In Anderson v. Griswold, a majority of the court found that the former president is disqualified from holding presidential office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, according to the Colorado Supreme Court. The section states that no officer of the United States should have engaged in insurrection against the country.\n\nThe Colorado court ruled that a president is an officer of the United States, and therefore Trump\u2019s actions on Jan. 6 were disqualifiers. The case was appealed to the high court by Trump\u2019s lawyers.\n\nDuring oral arguments, the justices further questioned Colorado attorneys over the constitutional definition of an officer of the United States. Jonathan Mitchell, Trump\u2019s attorney, argued that Trump was not covered by Section 3 because he was not an officer, and that states cannot alter federal qualifications for the president.\n\n\u201cOfficer of the United States refers only to appointed officials, and it does not encompass elected individuals such as president or members of Congress,\u201d Mitchell said in an opening statement to the court.\n\nDuring the hearing, Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Mitchell to explain the distinction between the presidential office and officer of the United States, to which Mitchell responded that some officers are not elected officials, therefore excluding the president and any candidates.\n\nJason Murray, the attorney representing Colorado voters, argued that Section 3 is deliberately vague to include all federal officers, disqualifying the former president from higher office. He continued by referring to Article 2 of the 10th Amendment, which delegates rights not listed in the constitution to states.\n\nMurray emphasized the unique circumstances of the Jan. 6 insurrection as a reason to disqualify the former president.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts questioned partisan interpretations of Colorado\u2019s ruling, calling partisan applications \u201ca daunting consequence.\u201d\n\nIf the Supreme Court sides with Trump, he will return to the Republican primary ballot in Colorado and any other state challenges will be overruled. If the court sides with Colorado, he will remain off of the ballot in the state, and allow other states to follow suit.\n\nAs the Republican presidential primaries continue, this ruling could stop Trump\u2019s winning streak thus far in Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire. This opinion of the court is expected within weeks, as Colorado\u2019s primary will be held on March 5.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nFebruary 12, 2024 at 1:27 pm PST\n\nEach week, we inch closer to March Madness and Selection Sunday where we get a clearer picture of who deserves to make the Big Dance and whose season will end early. One conference, however, is shockingly standing near the top: The Mountain West. While the Mountain West has always been a decent conference \u2014 a few teams generally sneak into the seven through 10 seeds \u2014 this year, the Mountain West has come to shake up the tourney.\n\nLast year, San Diego State made it all the way to the National Championship before succumbing to the highly talented UConn Huskies. However, it showed the world that the Mountain West plays some good basketball. This year, the conference is loaded with talent. Currently the top six teams in the conference standings have 16 or more wins, with four having 19 or more. Those six teams (Nevada, San Diego State, Utah State, Colorado State, Boise State and New Mexico) combined for an out of conference record of 68-8 with notable wins over teams such as Gonzaga, Saint Mary\u2019s, Washington, TCU and Creighton.\n\nAll of these teams have made some sort of impact on power six teams throughout the course of the year, and I can\u2019t see how March Madness would be any different. The best are San Diego State or Colorado State. The Aztecs and Rams have the most wins over power conference teams and I believe have the talent to go far in March.\n\nOut of conference, Colorado State beat Washington, Boston College and Creighton. While Boston College and Washington aren\u2019t the most formidable opponents, beating power conference teams as a non power team is impressive. The Rams have four players who average double-digit points, but are led by senior guard Isaiah Stevens who leads the country in assists per game at 7.5 while also averaging nearly 16.3 points on great efficiency. It may be difficult for teams to stop a guy who can score at will while also distributing the ball well.\n\nSan Diego State is led by senior forward Jaedon LeDee who is averaging 20 points and 8.3 rebounds per game while dominating the low game for the Aztecs. Don\u2019t forget about former Trojan, junior guard Reese Waters, the Aztecs second leading scorer averaging around 11 per game (Please come back Reese, USC needs you so badly). Out of conference, San Diego State has wins over Gonzaga, Saint Mary\u2019s, Washington and Cal. Their only non-conference loss came to BYU, currently ranked No. 19.\n\nBoth these teams are deadly and have head coaches who have been at the helm for a while now whose experience could be crucial. Don\u2019t be surprised if either team makes a deep run in March.\n\nThe final team I believe could be deadly is New Mexico. The Lobos have some of the best guard play in the country, with their three rotational guards, sophomore Donovan Dent, and seniors Jamal Mashburn Jr. and Jaelen House all averaging over 15 points per game. If New Mexico runs into a team whose guard play isn\u2019t strong, the Lobos could run circles around them. To add onto the guard play, freshman forward JT Toppin is averaging 12.5 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, meaning New Mexico isn\u2019t afraid to pound the paint either.\n\nCurrently in Joe Lunardi\u2019s most recent bracketology, there are five Mountain West teams projected to make the NCAA tournament with Nevada on the bubble as one of the first four teams left out. The Mountain West will make its mark on the NCAA tournament this year, mark my words. Hopefully I will be able to triumphantly write about how I predicted the Mountain West would be great in a few weeks time.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(AP/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Adam Bradford February 12, 2024 at 11:31 am PST\n\nAt long last, baseball is back. And for the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose Spring Training began this week in Arizona, that means the start of one of the most hyped-up campaigns in franchise history. While the majority of the attention heading into the season will be on veteran stars Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, there are several young players within the organization who could make an impact as well. Let\u2019s take a look at three Dodgers prospects to look out for in 2024.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto\nOkay, this one feels a bit like cheating. It\u2019s hard to really consider a 25 year-old who just signed a 12-year, $325 million contract a prospect. Yamamoto should make an immediate impact with the Dodgers, and projects to be one of the team\u2019s top starting pitchers in 2024. However, Yamamoto has played his entire professional career to date in Japan, and he has yet to actually appear in an MLB game. Thus, according to MLB\u2019s own standards, Yamamoto is still considered a prospect\u2014albeit a very expensive one. In a funny twist, the Dodgers will open the 2024 season with a two-game series in Seoul, South Korea, against the San Diego Padres\u2014hence, there is a good chance that Yamamoto\u2019s MLB debut will come across the ocean, further delaying his highly-anticipated first start on U.S. soil.\n\nKyle Hurt\n2023 saw several of the Dodgers\u2019 top young pitchers, including Bobby Miller and Emmet Sheehan, graduate from prospect status into roster mainstays. One young arm who remained in the minors for the vast majority of the season, however, was Kyle Hurt. A name many USC fans should be familiar with, Hurt was selected in the fifth round of the 2020 MLB Draft by the Miami Marlins. In February of 2021, however, he was traded to Los Angeles in the same deal in which the Dodgers acquired reliever Alex Vesia. After working his way through the team\u2019s farm system over the course of three seasons, Hurt made his MLB debut in September of 2023, pitching two scoreless innings of relief in a win over the San Diego Padres. However, that turned out to be Hurt\u2019s only big league appearance of the season, as he was optioned back to Triple-A Oklahoma City shortly thereafter. While Hurt will likely open the 2024 campaign in Oklahoma City, expect to hear his name called back up to Los Angeles at some point during the year.\n\nDiego Cartaya\nAfter signing with the Dodgers as a young international free agent from Venezuela, Cartaya, now 22 years old, has spent the past five seasons as a catcher in Los Angeles\u2019s farm system. Cartaya impressed at the lower levels of the minors over his first few seasons, and spent the entire 2023 campaign with Double-A Tulsa. Cartaya\u2019s first full season in Double-A was an inconsistent one. Although he had some big moments, hitting 19 home runs to go along with 57 RBIs, the young catcher batted just .189 on the season. With Will Smith entrenched as one of the best catchers in baseball and Austin Barnes a consistent backup option, it appears unlikely that we will see Cartaya reach the majors in 2024. However, his name is definitely one to watch moving forward, as Los Angeles believes he could be a large part of the franchise\u2019s future plans.\n```"}

The Trojans defeated Irvine 3-1 Saturday at Galen Center. (Photo by Kim Ly)\n\nBy Riley Sager February 11, 2024 at 12:33 pm PST\n\nFollowing a 3-1 loss at Irvine on Wednesday, the Trojans returned the favor, taking down the Anteaters in a comeback win Saturday night at Galen Center. After bearing the brunt of Irvine\u2019s Hilir Henno\u2019s 29 kills in Wednesday\u2019s game, freshman setter Caleb Blanchette focused last week\u2019s practices on blocking. Improvement was evident, as Blanchette helped the Trojans limit the freshman outside hitter to just 16 kills Saturday night.\n\nWhile Blanchette put up a defensive front, his impact wasn\u2019t limited to only defending an Anteater offense. \u201cThe first set I struggled to find my hitters. I think I was trying to do too much, but I loosened up, let them be big, let them swing and let them do their thing, and they killed it,\u201d Blanchette said. Blanchette had 29 set assists, which allowed sophomore outside hitters Dillon Klein and Riley Haine to secure a collective 30 kills.\n\nThe Trojans got off to a slow start, only tallying seven kills and one team block in the first set. However, their total kills more than tripled, and USC added four more team blocks by the end of the second set. \u201cWe came together as a team,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like how we played in the first set, and it was a wake-up call like, \u2018hey, we know we can beat this team; let\u2019s go out and do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite a 13-point win over the Trojans in the first set, neither team could command more than a three-point lead in the second. It was a battle at the net between Irvine sophomore middle blocker Maxim Grigoriev and Klein, who each finished the second set with six kills. The Trojans called a timeout at 20-20, which propelled them into a 25-22 set win.\n\nWith split sets, USC blew an 8-5 lead in the third and quickly found itself down 17-12. Perhaps the most underrated player of the game was the Trojan timeout because it once again broke up Irvine\u2019s momentum. USC won five of the next six points, and kills by Haine and Smith helped close out the set 25-23.\n\nHead coach Jeff Nygaard explained the importance of finishing off sets, especially when it\u2019s only a matter of a few points. \u201cIt\u2019s about the response,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to reinvent the wheel, we\u2019re just one or two points away from flipping those 23-25 games to 25-23. [Set] three was exactly that, we got the two points we needed to get 25-23.\u201d\n\nAnother contributor who helped uphold Irvine\u2019s defense was freshman middle blocker Wesley Smith. He led the team in solo blocks, with three, and matched senior middle blocker Kyle Paulson\u2019s five block assists. \u201cI think an unsung hero is going to be Kyle Paulson,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cHe does so many smart things for us that may or may not show up on the score sheet.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the third set, the Trojans were pumped with momentum and ready to triumph over one of the nation\u2019s top teams. \u201cLosing is a big motivator for me,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe felt like we had more in us after Wednesday\u2019s game, and we really showed it tonight at home.\u201d\n\nKlein had the most kills of anyone on the floor from either team with 17, averaging five in the last three sets, and contributed to a third of the team\u2019s total. His valuable offensive presence helped the Trojans close out the game 12-25, 25-22, 25-23, 25-14.\n\nUSC\u2019s first conference matchup is at 7 p.m. on Wednesday at Concordia University Irvine. Both Blanchette and Nygaard agreed that the biggest takeaway from Saturday\u2019s game was that the Trojans have what it takes to upset powerful teams, which will be crucial later this month with a Bruin matchup on the horizon.\n```"}

(Photo by Micah Chow)\n\nBy Eniola Adeleke February 11, 2024 at 10:27 am PST\n\nUSC men\u2019s basketball entered this game desperately needing a win after its overtime loss to Cal Wednesday night. The Cardinal had other plans. Instead, head coach Andy Enfield\u2019s squad found itself in a less severe rendition of the Maples Massacre, UCLA\u2019s 48-point loss to Stanford at Maples Pavilion in 1997. After an 82-74 home loss to UCLA Wednesday, Stanford displayed a dominant, complete team win Saturday night before a sold-out Cardinal student section, ultimately defeating the Trojans 99-68.\n\nStanford\u2019s 3-point shooting was the key to this win. The Cardinal shot 50% from beyond the arc, led by fifth-year forward Spencer Jones, who was 5-for-7 from three. And, it wasn\u2019t just Jones lighting it up from downtown. Stanford freshman guard Andrej Stojakovic \u2014 son of three-time NBA All-Star Peja Stojakovic \u2014 scored 12 of his 20 points from beyond the arc while sophomore guard Benny Gealer shot 67% from three. Stanford saw its most 3-pointers made in a single game Saturday (19).\n\nWith this loss, USC remains last in the Pac-12 (9-15 overall, 3-10 conference) while Stanford moves up one spot to sixth (12-11, 7-6). The Trojans continued their misfortune on the road, extending a seven-game road losing streak, their longest since the 2016 season. Before that, USC lost nine consecutive road games in 2015.\n\nSophomore forward Vincent Iwuchukwu opened the game with a commanding dunk off a pass from freshman guard Bronny James. That was followed by a Stanford turnover that led to another Trojan score, setting the scene for a dominant first half for the Trojans. Or so it seemed. Stanford answered the call immediately with back-to-back 3-pointers, a true indication of how this game would play out.\n\nFollowing USC\u2019s quick start, it could not have asked for a worse first half. Due to sloppy turnovers, missed layups and failed free throws, the Trojans quickly found themselves on the wrong end of a Stanford 25-0 run. In his second game back from a right hand injury, star freshman Isaiah Collier snapped the run with a free throw, but it was not enough to give the Trojans the momentum they needed to get back in the game.\n\nUSC especially struggled due to the likes of Stojakovic and junior forward Maxime Raynaud having a field day from the field. The electric duo had 29 points to end the first half, while USC had 26 total. After the Cardinal closed out the first half with their most points in a first half since 2013 (55), USC needed to make some changes entering the second half.\n\nAnd, at first, it seemed like whatever Enfield said to his squad at halftime worked. The Trojans displayed a better second-half performance on both ends of the ball, converting more of their offensive chances. USC saw some momentum with a 10-2 run midway through the second half and a James monster slam off a Stanford turnover. The Trojans also locked down their defense, forcing Stanford into seven second-half turnovers.\n\nBut, the pattern remained, and Stanford responded to every Trojan effort with some noise of its own. The Trojans just could not catch a break, making less than 45% of their field goals and just 6 of 20 attempts from three.\n\nEnfield turned to his bench throughout this game \u2013 namely sophomore forward Kijani Wright, junior guard Kobe Johnson and freshman forward Arrinten Page \u2013 which provided much-needed electricity to this Trojan squad. Yet, any attempts by USC to claw its way back into the game were promptly quenched by an aggressive Stanford team.\n\nRaynaud led the Cardinals with 25 points and nine rebounds. For the Trojans, Collier had 18 points, while star guard Boogie Ellis had a quiet night with just seven points.\n\nThe Trojans will return to Galen Center on Thursday to take on Utah at 8 p.m. with hopes of turning their season around.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Chris Seward)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington February 10, 2024 at 4:18 pm PST\n\nThis week featured several matchups between top 10 teams, including another chapter in the iconic Duke-North Carolina rivalry in which the Tar Heels came out on top. Wins against elite competition for North Carolina, the Tennessee Volunteers, and the Kansas Jayhawks point towards postseason potential, but the Tar Heels and Jayhawks each lost their following games against lesser opponents. How can we make sense to help our brackets in March?\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s roller coaster week\n\nThe North Carolina Tar Heels and Duke Blue Devils share the best rivalry in sports. Both are \u201cblue bloods,\u201d a title bestowed on college basketball\u2019s historically great programs, and are guaranteed to play each other at least twice a year in the ACC. Last Saturday, they logged their first matchup this season and both entered the game ranked in the top 10.\n\nThe Tar Heels had lost three of their last five games against Duke in Dean E. Smith Center, and coming off of a disappointing loss to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, they needed a win to regain the momentum that gave them a 17-3 start to the season. Fifth year senior big man Armando Bacot scored 12 first half points to power the Tar Heels to a double digit lead going into the locker room. This was Bacot\u2019s 153rd start for the Tar Heels and 10th career game against Duke, so he understands the importance of beating the Blue Devils.\n\n\u201cDuke-Carolina is a crazy rivalry and we knew coming in we just had to be physical from the jump,\u201d Bacot said after the game. Bacot was the focal point of the Tar Heels\u2019 physicality, finishing with his eighth career 25-point game and a career best against the Blue Devils in his last home game against them. Forward Harrison Ingram also played a huge role in the win, finishing with 21 points and five made threes.\n\nThe Tar Heels finished shooting 37.5% from three to Duke\u2019s 26.3%, another pivotal factor in Saturday\u2019s 93-84 victory for Carolina. The Tar Heels\u2019 ability to win on the biggest regular season stage in college basketball is encouraging, especially considering the veteran presence on their team. In addition to Bacot, two other starters\u2014RJ Davis and Cormac Ryan\u2014are seniors, which gives the Tar Heels an upper hand under pressure.\n\nHowever, against the Clemson Tigers on Tuesday night, North Carolina\u2019s seniors were not composed. Bacot turned in another excellent performance with 24 points and 13 rebounds, but Davis and Ryan combined to shoot a disastrous 25% from the floor. Despite Carolina having home court advantage, the first half was all Tigers, including a 15-2 Clemson run to start the game. In the second half, the Tar Heels fought back, even tying the game at 70 each with four minutes remaining. But they were no match for Clemson leading scorer PJ Hall, who sealed the game with four points in the game\u2019s last four minutes to bring his total to 25 on the night.\n\nWith true road wins against North Carolina, Florida State, Pittsburgh, and Alabama, the Tigers all but clinched an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. North Carolina has been \u201cin\u201d for weeks now, but recent results have raised eyebrows regarding their consistency. Veteran leadership will help them in big games, but they are not immune to off-nights typical of less experienced squads.\n\nThe tale of two Kansas teams\n\nEntering this week, the Kansas Jayhawks were a perfect 11-0 at home, with their last loss at Allen Fieldhouse coming against TCU on January 21, 2023, over a full year ago. However, the Houston Cougars, who currently have the third-shortest odds to win the National Championship, came into town on Saturday, Feb. 3 to challenge the Jayhawks\u2019 unblemished home record.\n\nPrior to the game, Kansas head coach Bill Self called Houston\u2019s rebounding \u201cprobably the best in the country,\u201d and said that Kansas \u201c[has] to be exceptional on the glass.\u201d The Jayhawks outrebounded Houston 40-24 en route to a shocking 78-65 beat down. Per KenPom, Houston ranks first in defensive efficiency this season, but the Cougars had no answers for Kansas. The Jayhawks shot 68.9% from the floor and their 78 points were the most Houston has allowed in a game all season.\n\nOn offense, Hunter Dickinson led the way for Kansas, who finished with 20 points, eight rebounds and four assists to help keep the Jayhawks\u2019 historic home win streak alive. On the road, Kansas has not been as impressive. The Jayhawks have only played six true road games this season, and they are 2-4 in those contests, including losses to unranked UCF, unranked West Virginia, and on Monday night, the unranked Kansas State Wildcats by a 75-70 score.\n\nWith just over 17 minutes left in the second half, the Jayhawks were up by eleven points, but the rest of the game was dominated by senior guard transfer Tylor Perry, who finished with a career high 26 points, including eight overtime points that sealed the game for the Wildcats. Additionally, Kansas failed to carry over their rebounding prowess from earlier in the week, as they were outrebounded by ten against Kansas State.\n\nIf Kansas struggles to win on the road, how can they be trusted during March Madness, where they won\u2019t play a single home game? Early this season, Kansas played in tournaments at neutral sites and went just an alright 2-1 against ranked opponents. Ultimately, their road losses should generate some concern, but the last time Kansas lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament was March 17, 2006. You must trust Bill Self in the postseason.\n\nTennessee\u2019s offense overpowers Kentucky on the road\n\nOn Saturday, Feb. 3, the Tennessee Volunteers went into Rupp Arena to give the Kentucky Wildcats their third home loss of the season. Surprisingly, this signature win didn\u2019t require a big performance from the Volunteers\u2019 leading scorer, Dalton Knecht. Purdue\u2019s Zach Edey has locked in another Naismith Men\u2019s College Player of the Year trophy, but many have argued that Knecht is the sport\u2019s most valuable player due to his versatility and consistency on offense.\n\nThis season, Knecht, a 6-foot-6 combo guard transfer from the University of Northern Colorado, has averaged 20.2 points per game while converting 48.1% of his shots. However, against top-10 opponents, Knecht\u2019s scoring production drops to 14.5 points per game on a much less desirable 33.3% shooting. Coming into Saturday\u2019s contest, the Volunteers hadn\u2019t played against a top-10 team since late November, so all eyes were on Knecht to see if his woes against the best teams in the country would continue.\n\nInterestingly, Knecht only scored 16 points on a disappointing 35.7% shooting mark, but unlike Tennessee\u2019s other top 10 matchups, the Volunteers won the game. All five of Tennessee\u2019s starters scored in double figures, with guard duo Josiah-Jordan James and Zakai Zeigler combining for 52 of Tennessee\u2019s 103 points, the most Kentucky\u2019s defense has allowed all season.\n\nKnecht then returned to form on Wednesday night versus LSU with a game high 27 points as the Volunteers won 88-68. Tennessee\u2019s road win against then-No. 10 Kentucky bodes well for the Volunteers\u2019 chances in important late-season games, despite Knecht\u2019s mediocre performance on the night. As long as they can survive a Knecht off night, they can beat any team in the country.\n```"}

(Photo by Desirae Ridley)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson February 09, 2024 at 10:31 pm PST\n\nUSC women\u2019s basketball can start to believe, and not just because Jason Sudeikis was at Galen Center Friday night, potentially imparting his Ted Lasso wisdom on head coach Lindsay Gottlieb.\n\n\u201cHe got me in my Ted Lasso bag of quotes,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI used a Ted Lasso quote before the game. So definitely, I was excited to have him here. That was very cool. Only in L.A.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans can take inspiration from Ted Lasso and, after their 81-63 win over Arizona State, start to believe it will not all rest on the shoulders of freshman guard JuJu Watkins come March. Watkins might be one in a million, which means some people forget she is one of five Trojans on the court.\n\nWhile the star freshman still dazzled with some impressive passing in the first half \u2014 including one to redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby who capitalized with a 3-pointer \u2014 she did not have to score a bulk of the points like normal against the Sun Devils in the opening 20 minutes.\n\nThe Trojans did not necessarily need the star power of Watkins to build a 10-point halftime lead against a team like the Sun Devils \u2014 a squad with a 2-9 Pac-12 record \u2014 but this does not mean USC can\u2019t learn anything from this game.\n\n\u201cEverybody is daunting in this league,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c[The Sun Devils] recently beat Washington, and that resonates with us. Obviously, they have a couple wins in the league. To me, we look at every game and evaluate \u2014 are we playing to our level and our standard?\u201d\n\nBut of course, Watkins is going to be Watkins. The star guard had 31 points after a quiet first-half performance, at least according to what Trojan fans have started to expect. USC has been looking for secondary scoring all season \u2014 which has usually come from graduate guard McKenzie Forbes \u2014 but the Trojans\u2019 other options have been streaky on the scoreboard all season.\n\nThat was not the case for a player like junior center Rayah Marshall against ASU, who hit double-digit points for the first time in seven games.\n\n\u201cI came out in the first quarter, it was tough getting my feel for offense,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBut one thing about my teammates, they\u2019re great people, [not just] the number on their jersey. They told me to just keep shooting the ball and the flow of the game, it was clicking for me. I just took advantage of that.\u201d\n\nWith USC players not named Watkins sometimes disappearing in bigger games, it was important for the Trojans to see other players put the rock through the net as March approaches. Luckily for USC, if that secondary scoring ever fails to knock down buckets, Watkins is still as bad as ever, but it\u2019s kinda like back in the \u201880s, when \u2018bad\u2019 meant \u2018good.\u2019 Really, really good.\n\nSo good, Sudeikis would likely not want to watch Watkins arm wrestle Michelle Obama either. In such a tough conference like the Pac-12, it is rare to find a team with a losing record \u2014 only two exist this season. USC capitalized against one of them, hitting its highest point total in conference play this year.\n\nYet, despite facing an unranked team, the Trojans had high levels of energy, out-rebounding the Sun Devils on the offensive boards by nine to the tune of 20 second-chance points.\n\n\u201cOur energy, our rebounding, our offensive rebounding, our paint presence, I thought ... was really good,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nThe Trojan locker room is smelling with potential as USC will continue its lightest part of its conference schedule to date. The Watkins-led squad will play two more games against currently unranked opponents as part of a four-game stretch squaring off with non-AP Top 25 teams.\n\nDuring this part of the Pac-12 schedule, the Trojans will look to keep believing. Keep believing they can get scoring from multiple players. Keep believing they can take it to tough opponents down the road in March. Keep believing celebrities like Sudeikis will continue wanting to tune into their games.\n\nUSC has its belief and will hope to showcase it again Monday against Arizona at Galen Center, with tip-off scheduled for 6 p.m.\n```"}

Since February 1, nine Trojans featured on NBA hardwood in the past week on the cusp of trade deadline day and the NBA All-Star break. It is important to note that one former Trojan was traded to another franchise during deadline day. Chimezie Metu was part of a three-team deadline day trade that took him from the Phoenix Suns to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nHowever, this week, we will be putting the spotlight on two former Trojan centers, who were both First Team All-Pac-12 during their sole seasons playing at Galen Center. Let\u2019s take a look at both former NBA lottery picks in the past seven days.\n\nEvan Mobley\nAfter being sidelined for about two months with a left knee injury, Mobley has returned in stunning style despite a minutes restriction. He has shown flashes offensively in limited playing time while dominating on the defensive end of the ball. Mobley has averaged 18.8 points and 11 boards per game while only playing about 26 minutes a night.\n\nOn February 3 against the San Antonio Spurs, Mobley showed his case for being an All-Defensive player. Matching up against the 2023 No. 1 overall pick Victor Wembanyama, Mobley held the Frenchman to just 20% from the field. Mobley also notched a double-double with 28 points and 10 rebounds in a 16-point victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nTwo nights later, Mobley had an all-around solid game against the Sacramento Kings. He dished out seven assists, while putting up his second consecutive double-double of 11 points and 14 rebounds to help the Cavaliers extend their winning streak to six games.\n\nAgainst the Washington Wizards on February 7, Mobley arguably had his most efficient night in his three-year NBA career. The 2021 No. 3 overall pick went 9-for-10 from the field and 2-for-2 from behind the 3-point arc, scoring 22 points and tallying eight rebounds in a dominant win in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIn a second night of a back-to-back against the Brooklyn Nets, Mobley earned his third double-double during the week with 14 points and 12 rebounds to stretch the Cavaliers\u2019 win streak to eight games. Cleveland currently sits second in the Eastern Conference, and Mobley\u2019s return is helping to close the gap to the Boston Celtics, who currently sit 4.5 games ahead of the Cavaliers with about 30 regular season games remaining.\n\nOnyeka Okongwu\nIn his past four matchups, Okongwu has averaged 18.5 points per game and 9.5 rebounds per game despite being limited to a role off the bench. After Atlanta Hawks center Clint Capela went down with a left adductor strain on, Okongwu has shone in his recent starting role the past few nights, averaging 4.8 offensive rebounds per game in the last week of NBA basketball.\n\nAgainst the Phoenix Suns on February 2, Okongwu tallied 15 points and seven boards with great efficiency. He shot 88% from the field and 100% from three in a nine-point win over the Suns.\n\nOkongwu arguably had his career night two days later against the Golden State Warriors. The No. 6 overall pick from 2020 played 36 minutes after taking over for Capela, notching a career high 22 points and grabbing 16 rebounds in a thrilling overtime victory over the Warriors. The Hawks had won four consecutive games at this point.\n\nAgainst the Los Angeles Clippers in the final game of Atlanta\u2019s seven-game home stretch, Okongwu went 8-for-10 from the field, scoring 18 points in a close five-point loss to the Clippers.\n\nIn the final game of the week against the No. 1 seed Celtics, the former Chino Hills standout collected 10 rebounds and 19 points to reach his second double-double in three games in another single-digit loss to a championship contender. Despite losing two on the bounce, the Hawks will look for Okongwu to keep playing the way he is as the team is part of the play-in tournament hunt.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Gribbon)\n\nBy Angelina Hicks\nFebruary 09, 2024 at 4:31 pm PST\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley started her campaign speech in Los Angeles with gratitude and a mistake. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here in Orange County!\u201d Haley said as she took the stage. But the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador was met quickly with shouts and laughter from the audience of about 150 people. She was actually in Los Angeles County, speaking to voters at the Hollywood American Legion, a veteran\u2019s center. This event was one stop on her visit to California ahead of Super Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI was in Orange County earlier,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m sleeping these days. You\u2019ve got to forgive me on that.\u201d\n\nDespite the misstep, Haley was quick to call out former President Donald Trump, or as she called him: one last \u201cfella\u201d to defeat in her race for the nomination. Last month, Trump posted on the social media platform Truth Social that anyone who contributes to Haley\u2019s campaign will be \u201cpermanently barred from the MAGA camp.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen someone runs for president, this is supposed to be a story of addition,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be bringing people in, not pushing people out of your club.\u201d\n\nThe event was the day after Haley suffered a major loss in the Nevada primary, finishing in second place to the \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d option. Trump didn\u2019t compete in that race. While Haley didn\u2019t mention her loss in Nevada, she criticized Trump\u2019s reaction to her second-place finish in New Hampshire. Haley received 43% of the vote, just behind Trump with 54%.\n\n\u201cThe night of New Hampshire, he was all upset because he thought I was going to be 30 points down,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all he did was have a total temper tantrum on stage, talking about revenge.\u201d\n\nBut while Haley hosted a couple of events across Southern California this week, a recent primary rule change could prevent her from gaining a single delegate from the Golden State. A GOP rule switch approved in 2023 will allocate all 169 California delegates to the candidate that wins the majority of primary votes instead of allocating delegates proportionally according to voting results. That means Haley would have to beat Trump in California in order to gain any of the delegates from the state with the most sway.\n\nShe spent the rest of her 30-minute speech calling for more transparency in the classroom, tighter borders, solutions to the fentanyl crisis and improved veteran health care. Throughout her speech, attendees\u2019 devices were ringing with emergency alert warnings regarding flash floods and thunderstorms as the rain came down outside.\n\nHaley was also interrupted in the middle of her speech by a climate protester saying she\u2019s \u201cselling out to the fossil fuel industry\u201d and holding up a sign claiming she\u2019s a \u201cclimate criminal.\u201d The protester was part of the Sunrise Movement seen at Republican presidential candidate events across the country, including at campaign events leading up to the Iowa caucuses last month. The protester was escorted out of the room after he stood up and started shouting toward the stage.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever get upset when you see a protestor like that because my husband and his military brothers and sisters sacrifice every day for them to have the right to do that,\u201d Haley said, referencing her husband Michael, a National Guardsman serving a yearlong deployment in Africa.\n\nHaley\u2019s next stop is her home state of South Carolina. She has campaign events throughout the state leading up to the Republican primary on Feb. 24. Despite her ties to the Palmetto State, latest polls have Trump in a large lead ahead of Haley.\n\nDespite her highly unlikely chances of clinching the GOP presidential nomination, supporters at her L.A. rally Wednesday night were in high spirits and excited to support her candidacy. William E. Pascarella Jr. \u2014 a 63-year-old resident of San Gabriel \u2014 waited in line after Haley\u2019s speech for a chance to talk with her and shake her hand. After meeting her, he said he was \u201crejuvenated\u201d and \u201cfilled with hope.\u201d\n\nA Navy veteran who served for six years, Pascarella was especially interested in her messaging about veteran health care and border policies. He also said he\u2019s done with \u201cTrump\u2019s drama\u201d and ready to support a new face that might be able to unite the country.\n\n\u201cIt seems like she might be somebody who can help pull things together,\u201d Pascarella said after meeting Haley. \u201cPeople that support Trump despise Biden. People that support Biden despise Trump. Voting for either person, to me, is going to continue the separation of this country.\u201d\n\nDarene Jones, 72, drove for an hour and a half from Brea with her husband for the chance to see Haley. She was mostly interested in her policies regarding education and classroom transparency. Jones said she voted for Trump previously, but now she said he\u2019s \u201cout of control\u201d and has become self-centered over the years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s out for the country. I think he\u2019s out for himself,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think he was out for the country before. I really do. But I think now he\u2019s just about himself.\u201d\n\nWhile Jones conceded that Haley didn\u2019t have a likely chance of winning California\u2019s primary, she still felt it was important to show up and support her.\n\n\u201cWe have to change,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere has to be a change sometime. If we all just sit back and say, \u2018Well, she doesn\u2019t have a chance\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019ll never change.\u201d\n\nHaley ended her speech calling for courage in preparation for Super Tuesday, emphasizing that she\u2019s not backing down and that she\u2019s in this race for the long haul.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be messy,\u201d Haley said at the end of her speech. \u201cThis is going to hurt, and it\u2019s going to leave some bruises. But at the end of the day, I don\u2019t mind taking that if you\u2019ll go right along with me.\u201d```"}

Lunar New Year is celebrated across Asia, with the Chinese New Year Festival dating back thousands of years. Following the lunar calendar, each new year is represented by one of twelve rotating animals; for those born in 2024, the dragon will be their personal zodiac. Known as the Spring Festival, which is traditionally a fifteen-day celebration, different Asian American communities honor it in various ways, and at USC, students have created their own means to ring in the new year.\n\nSenior Wilson Lim Setiawan is an international student from Singapore, back home, the holiday is packed with family, special greetings, and traditional goodies. Only one of those remained for his Lunar New Year celebration at USC. \u201cPlanning with some other international friends to have, like, a reunion dinner type of thing,\u201d is what Setiawan typically plans, but he doesn\u2019t quite consider it the same as a \u201ccelebration celebration.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very family-based activity, so recognizing that, obviously, my family\u2019s not here, but with friends that also are maybe missing that family experience or whatever, to just come together, get dinner, and [we] still can have a good time,\u201d Setiawan said.\n\nIn Singapore and several other Asian countries, the most common and traditional gift for the holiday is a pair of oranges. The pair of oranges is a way to wish someone luck, prosperity, and longevity in the new year. In China and Hong Kong, it is common to give gifts in red envelopes filled with money, traditional foods, gold accessories, fruits, and sweets.\n\nFor some though, home isn\u2019t so far away. Chrystal Nhan, a senior from Monterey Park, is about 20 minutes away from the same celebrations she grew up with. For her, Lunar New Year means going back to traditional dinners of fish and crab and hopping between the abundance of temples in the 626 area, all with the warm company of her family. \u201cI really just love seeing my family. Especially, extended family...that I don\u2019t really see that often,\u201d Nhan said. \u201cI also really enjoy going to temples, I\u2019m Buddhist and it\u2019s just nice getting to share that culture with everybody else that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, new students on campus are relying on student services such as the U.S.-China Institute at USC to determine their plans for the new year. USC Annenberg Career Development, International Programs, and U.S.-China Institute hosted a Lunar New Year celebration at Wallis Annenberg Hall this Friday. Faculty, staff, and students came together to cherish the new beginning with dumplings, Asian snacks, and a lottery. Vicki Higgins, the Program Manager at the U.S.-China Institute said the event was expected to have about 200 attendees. Soon after a successful mid-autumn festival last year, the preparations for a new year had begun with grand plans.\n\nLunar New Year Event featured dumpling food truck for students.

So, I hope they can find some loved ones and maybe make a friend today.\u201d Higgins, excited about creating a memorable experience for the attendees said, \u201cthe people who have never experienced lunar new year get a chance to do it.\u201d\n\nSignifying a fresh start in the second month of the calendar year, this time brings about a much-needed opportunity for many people. \u201cNew beginnings.

The NBA has awarded the 2026 All-Star Game to the Los Angeles Clippers' new arena, which is set to open in time for the 2024-25 season. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner February 09, 2024 at 2:31 pm PST\n\nGoing into the NBA regular season\u2019s final stretch, the Clippers are a premier Western Conference team with Finals dreams. The Clippers\u2019 34-16 record has brought them back to relevancy and all of the pieces look to be finally clicking. The addition of shooting guard James Harden has injected new life into the once-struggling squad and forwards Kawhi Leonard and Paul George are well deserving of All-Star selections.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 top-notch play has arrived at an opportune time; Intuit Dome, the $1.8 billion facility set to host Clippers games beginning next season, has fans excited to finally cheer for a team that has its own home arena. The Clips have shared Crypto.com Arena, formerly known as Staples Center, with the Lakers since 1999 and have struggled to find a true identity within the city and the building.\n\nThe Clippers are forced to cover the Lakers\u2019 plentiful championship banners and retired numbers every game and in a crowded LA sports market, the Clippers often feel like an afterthought. Owner Steve Ballmer seems to have grown tired of this narrative and will finally have a chance to build a stronger identity for his team in its new 18,000-seat building.\n\nHe is committed to giving the Clippers a unique home by implementing innovative features into the building, including one designed to engage Clips fans in an eccentric way. The diehard cheering section, also known as The Wall, could either be a major success or a dire failure. In this section, fans will be outlawed from sporting opposing team gear or cheering for them and it will consist of 51 uninterrupted rows, which is quite the spectacle from the court view.\n\nWhile this appears to be a great way to engage Clippers fans, questions have arisen as to how these rules could be enforced. Lakers fans will surely make the short trip when the rivals play each other and with the one-sided nature of the Los Angeles basketball scene, it might take a number of years before the Clippers can hold down the fort and defend their territory, even with The Wall\u2019s help.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t favor the Clippers the same way it favors the LakeShow, but if the Clips can end their 53-year title drought and finally hang a championship banner of their own, they\u2019ll continue to grow their fandom. While having varied success on the field, Los Angeles\u2019 two NFL teams have both had similar experiences playing at the new, shiny SoFi Stadium, also in Inglewood, that the Clippers could learn from.\n\nThe Rams won the Super Bowl in just their second season playing there, which generated a lot of buzz, but opposing fans still flood the stands despite the Rams\u2019 recent playoff success. The Chargers haven\u2019t had the on-field success of the Rams and also struggle to pack SoFi with their own fans.\n\nWhile this might seem discouraging for Clippers faithful, they\u2019re in it for the long haul. The Lakers have employed stars players and NBA icons in pretty much every era of their history, so bringing in new fans came naturally to them. The Clippers, on the other hand, haven\u2019t had anywhere near the same amount of success, but the future presents promising opportunities.\n\nThe Clips should take initiative to sway Southern California\u2019s interest once LeBron James either leaves the Lakers or retires, as his absence will leave a void in the Los Angeles basketball scene. It might take years, or even decades, to create a more even playing field, but it can be done. Just ask the Brooklyn Nets, who like the Clippers, are overshadowed by a historic, popular neighbor.\n\nDespite this disadvantage, Nets attendance has only increased since moving to Brooklyn from New Jersey in 2012, and in addition to outplaying the Knicks in multiple seasons and attracting national attention, they\u2019ve created a unique brand in Brooklyn, in part thanks to the state-of-the-art Barclays Center.\n\nFor many, the Clippers aren\u2019t the first to come to mind when talking about Los Angeles basketball, but the team\u2019s popularity and relevance has the chance to skyrocket in the coming years. If Clippers ownership can capitalize on the upcoming transition period for the Lakers \u2014 and simultaneously put a perennial winner together \u2014 Intuit Dome will elevate the Clippers to heights they\u2019ve never seen before.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Matt Kim February 09, 2024 at 2:21 pm PST\n\nThe Angels haven\u2019t had a top ten prospect since Shohei Ohtani and that trend will continue this season, as their farm system currently ranks 27th in the MLB. The Angels do have a couple of intriguing prospects, though, including first baseman Nolan Schanuel, who made his big league debut in 2023 and went 1/4. Although the farm system doesn\u2019t have the same depth and quality as other clubs, the Angels might have some help on the way, especially on the pitching side.\n\n#1: Nolan Schanuel, 1B\nSchanuel was the only Angels prospect to crack MLB.com\u2019s top 100 prospect list. He was ranked 95th, mainly for his 60 grade hit tool (on baseball\u2019s preferred 20-80 scale) that prompted the Angels to select him 11th overall out of FAU in the 2023 draft. Schanuel had a cup of coffee in the big leagues last year, walking more than he struck out and setting an Angels rookie record for reaching base in each of his first 29 games. Schanuel\u2019s lack of power became his biggest problem, though, hitting one home run in 132 plate appearances. This marred his rookie season considerably, since even though his .275 AVG and .402 OBP were great, his 103 OPS+ mark suggests he\u2019s only a slightly above the average hitter. For a first baseman specifically, he needs to display more power going forward. The good news? Schanuel has a frame for power at 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds. At Florida Atlantic, Schanuel\u2019s power stats increased each year, so maybe he just needs time to adjust at each level. In his freshman year, he posted a 1.020 OPS and by his junior year, that mark jumped to 1.483. He simultaneously set school records in on-base percentage (.615) and walks in a single season (71) and posted three multi-home run games and 19 home runs overall in his stellar junior season. He should have a full season to develop his power stroke, as he\u2019s slated to be the Angels\u2019 opening day first baseman. It\u2019s his job to lose and if he makes strides in the home run department, he\u2019ll be the face of the future in Anaheim.\n\n#2: Caden Dana, SP\nThe 20 year old RHP hasn\u2019t made it past High-A, but there\u2019s a lot for Angels fans to like. When the Angels selected him in the 11th round in the 2022 draft, they paid him well-above the slot value for that pic\u2014a signal to what they hope he might become. His 1.5 million dollar signing bonus set a record for a post-10th round pick and it\u2019s easy to envision what the Angels saw in Dana. He possesses a strong, projectable build at 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds with a developing repertoire. His fastball is mainly in the low-to-mid 90s, but has occasionally touched 97 mph. A 60-grade slider is also featured in his game that sits in the mid-80s and has big swing-and-miss potential. Scouts have expressed concern about the lack of a third pitch, as his changeup and curveball are both average-at-best offerings, but he\u2019ll continue to develop his arsenal especially as a starter. He generated good strikeout numbers even with an evolving pitch mix. In only 76.2 minor league innings, he struck out 97 hitters\u2014good for a 11.39 strikeouts per nine innings mark (K/9). Those strikeouts do come with a fair share of walks however, as his 3.95 walks per nine innings (BB/9) was on the higher side. Considering how quickly they promote top prospects to the majors, the Angels are rather surprisingly in no rush to hurry Dana\u2019s development. They\u2019ll be sure that he develops a sufficient pitch mix before bringing him all the way up, but he\u2019s projected to be a mid-to-back end starter who can eat innings at the highest level when he does arrive.\n\n#3: Ben Joyce, RHP\nNot many pitchers can bring it like Joyce. At Tennessee, Joyce wowed the baseball world when he topped 105 mph in college. That kind of fastball led the Angels to select him in the third round of the 2022 MLB draft. Joyce made his Angels debut in 2023 and showcased that top-tier velocity that made him effective in college. He averaged 100.9 mph on his heater, which ranked him second in all of MLB right behind flamethrower Jhoan Duran. Joyce brings plenty of concerns with him, too. Crucially, his blazing fastball often doesn\u2019t find the strike zone. In 10 innings out of the Angels bullpen, he walked nine hitters and only struck out 10. Usually, high-leverage relievers can get away with higher walk rates as long as their strikeout numbers are top notch. With Joyce, his 9.0 K/9 was promising, but having a near 1:1 K/BB ratio led to a brutal 5.4 ERA. His slider is also a work in progress as Joyce tries to find a go-to secondary pitch. Having a 100-plus mph fastball is great, but when hitters know it\u2019s coming they have a much easier time squaring it up. The key factor for Joyce heading into 2024 will be honing in on his strike zone command. Joyce is 6-foot-5 and sits in the 94th percentile for extension towards home plate. That lethal combination makes hitters feel like they\u2019re hitting the ball out of his hand. If Joyce can even leverage mediocre command over his fastball-slider mix, he\u2019ll be a top option for an Angels bullpen that has struggled in years past.\n```"}

The counsel acknowledged a difficulty prosecuting him,\u201dMr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d\n\nIn his interviews with the special counsel about his handling of classified materials, Biden had trouble pinpointing when his son Beau passed away, when his vice presidency ended and the date of a crucial debate about troops in Afghanistan. An impromptu Address to the Nation was scheduled by Biden and his team to respond to the report.

{"key": "/2024/02/09/sports-mythbusters-no-1-debunking-the-dumb-jock/", "response": "```\n\u201cSports Mythbusters\u201d is a column by Sammie Yen about common stereotypes in and around sports culture. When you think of an outstanding athletic performance, who or what do you think of? Perhaps the image that crosses your mind is when Padres third baseman Manny Machado launched a seemingly impossible rocket of a throw across the diamond for an out. Or maybe you reminisce of that time Damian Lillard sunk a buzzerbeater from light-years away (really, the Portland Trail Blazers logo) to advance his team to the 2019 Western Conference Semifinals. Maybe you remember when New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. made arguably the best catch in football history against the Cowboys in 2014. These exceptional athletes undergo intensive physical training to reach capabilities that exceed those of the average human. However, what we see in these moments \u2013 extraordinary athletic ability \u2013 is not the full picture. What do people overlook in elite athletes the most? The intelligence factor. Athletes must absorb key information while filtering out unimportant stimuli. An elite pitcher may focus only on the location of a catcher\u2019s mitt and the strength of the wind, while a nonathlete may take note of more irrelevant information on the baseball diamond. This athletic advantage is called \u201cchanging the breadth of visual attention,\u201d or the ability to focus on relevant information to an action while ignoring distractions. Being able to narrow one\u2019s breadth of visual attention is essential for athletes in crunch time. When an elite basketball player has to make free throws to win the game, they are able to tamp down external background noise \u2014 like a jeering crowd. This is an enhanced ability that any human can benefit from in order to better understand one\u2019s sensory environment. Athletes also have little time to make complicated decisions. These decisions, both conscious and unconscious, are more than just products of an automatic muscle memory; a player\u2019s actions are dynamic strategies that vary by the challenge, according to New York Times science journalist Carl Zimmer. As no two offensive or defensive plays are identical, athletes constantly engage with new obstacles. During these new challenges, an athlete\u2019s brain will set commands to fulfill a particular goal or goals. If these ambitions aren\u2019t successfully executed, the brain will adjust its original plan to avoid errors. Experts have also found elite athletes to be better at processing information and predicting results. A study done in Italy gathered professional basketball players and nonathletes together to watch footage of free throw shooting. The video would pause right after the ball left the shooter\u2019s hands, and both groups would predict whether or not the shot would go in. The pros guessed with around 75% accuracy, while nonathletes guessed with around 40% accuracy. Furthermore, the researchers observed the professional players had relatively high activity in the area of the brain connected to hand and arm muscles as they watched each video. This suggests they were mentally taking the shot themselves, using previous experience to determine the outcome. Comparatively, the nonathletes had much less brain activity in those regions. If you\u2019re somehow still doubting the role of the brain in sports, think of someone like LeBron James, a dominant force in the NBA. At 6-foot-9 and 250 pounds, he is more than physically capable to be a basketball player. But this video\u2019s first few seconds shows James throwing a no-look assist. His pass demonstrates more than just physical ability. He runs a fastbreak play in mere seconds, but there is so much happening in his brain in those moments. He needed to predict what his teammates would do and how his opponent would react, all the while computing and processing the output of his actions. It\u2019s remarkable when you take the time to think about it, especially compared to the motor processing of something as low-pressure as, say, reading a digital sports column. To put it plainly, sports is the perfect intersection between physical and mental aptitude. Not only that, but it carries the same type of complexity that we see in other hobbies, like listening to music or visiting museums. We\u2019re drawn to the intricacy of a soccer match just as we\u2019re innately drawn to an incredible piece of art or musical composition. In a way, athletes are orchestrators, architects and artists on an unconventional stage. While we don\u2019t necessarily think of sports as the most intellectual pursuits, we should give more credit to elite athletes. You can\u2019t have excellence without intelligence. \u201cSports Mythbusters\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/08/rookie-report-cam-whitmore-and-gg-jackson/", "response": "```\nCollege basketball has become an increasingly fraught developmental station for future NBA-ers. Unlike college football, where about 99% of NFL draftees have played for an NCAA program, college basketball has competition both at home and abroad for recruiting and growing young talent. Add in the NIL and transfer portal chaos that now rules college sports, and you have myriad ways in which a college basketball career can go wrong. That\u2019s not to say college basketball produces poor pros\u2014obviously it still churns out future All-Stars. But the league\u2019s pool of potential talent has expanded, and continues to do so. In the 2023 draft, four of the top five players selected did not play at an American college. Looking ahead to the 2024 selections, we could see the same thing happen this year. The top prospects in this upcoming draft play in Australia, France and Serbia. Obviously, international development has caught up to (and arguably exceeded) player training in the US. But I also think US colleges have been less secure destinations for the top American high schoolers to grow. The extra year of eligibility granted to players in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic means that college teams can have older rosters. For example, the San Diego State Aztecs roster that competed against the UConn Huskies in the 2023 national championship game had an average age of 22.9 years old. In concert with a more open transfer portal, even highly-touted freshmen can suddenly find themselves sitting behind more experienced players. That\u2019s the long way of explaining why players like Cam Whitmore and Gregory \u201cGG\u201d Jackson II fell in the 2023 draft. The pair had a similar trajectory; Whitmore and Jackson finished high school as top 15 players in their class, matriculated to programs where they were expected to contribute immediately and found college ball more challenging than expected. Whitmore arrived at Villanova for his freshman season just as legendary head coach and two-time national champion Jay Wright departed, becoming new head coach Kyle Neptune\u2019s star prospect. Whitmore scored a decent 12.5 points per game on 47.8% shooting, but found it difficult to play team basketball. He averaged just 0.7 assists to 1.6 turnovers in his lone season at the Wildcats. Scouts and draftniks were mixed on Whitmore, but most experts at least expected him to go in the lottery. Instead, he fell to No. 20 ( in part due to injury concerns ), where the Rockets selected him as their second first-round talent alongside Overtime Elite\u2019s Amen Thompson. In Jackson\u2019s case, his ascent to the NBA was even more rapid and precarious than Whitmore\u2019s. Despite ultimately finishing as a slightly higher-ranked recruit than Whitmore (No. 6 to No. 11), Jackson actually reclassified from 2023 to finishing high school in 2022, allowing him to enroll earlier than anticipated. He simultaneously announced his commitment to the South Carolina Gamecocks, when he had previously declared for the North Carolina Tar Heels, the much more heralded basketball program. That left Jackson in a tricky spot: he was a younger-than-average freshman on a team where he was by far the most accomplished recruit. You can probably guess what happened there: Jackson took a lot of questionable shots. He scored 15.4 points per game while shooting 38.4% from the field and had an even worse turnover problem than Whitmore with about 0.3 assists per giveaway. Beyond his immature play, scouts likely thought Jackson needed to grow up off the court, too. Before a February game against Missouri, when the Gamecocks were a measly 8-15, Jackson took to Instagram Live to complain about the team\u2019s fortunes and his role, saying, \u201cbro I\u2019m not even getting plays drawn up for me in the crunch time.\u201d The coaching staff then omitted him from the starting lineup for the Missouri game. Between his inconsistent performances and minor character concerns, Jackson failed to establish himself as a first-round talent and the Grizzlies picked him up at the No. 45 pick. Neither player\u2019s draft status guaranteed them big minutes from opening night. Whitmore played 10 minutes against the Magic in the Rockets\u2019 first game, but shot 0-4 in his cameo and stuck to the bench for their next three. Even when he did reappear in the rotation, Whitmore played single-digit minutes unless it was a blowout one way or another. The Grizzlies gave Jackson even fewer early opportunities. He didn\u2019t eclipse five NBA appearances until January. And Jackson\u2019s minutes didn\u2019t truly start increasing until Ja Morant suffered a season-ending injury, ruling the Grizzlies out of the playoff race and permitting them to focus on player development. Now, both players have become night-in, night-out contributors who eclipse 20 minutes per game with regularity. Whitmore has slotted into the Rockets\u2019 rotation fluidly as an at-will scorer with formidable size and an effective shot from range. Listed at 6-foot-7 and 230 pounds, Whitmore has a dominant frame combined with jump-out-the-gym athleticism. Just watch this sequence from Rockets vs. Pelicans on Jan. 31: Whitmore collects the rock from a jump ball won by fellow super-athlete and rookie Amen Thompson and just starts running. The former Wildcat races into the Pelicans\u2019 half-court before they have a chance to set their defense and goes straight toward the hoop. Pelicans\u2019 guard Jordan Hawkins tries to disrupt Whitmore\u2019s path, but realizing that Hawkins is on the wrong side to defend him, Whitmore turns on a dime and dunks over a desperate Hawkins. This is the kind of situation where Whitmore benefits from his score-first tunnel vision. The rookie has averaged 0.4 assists per game so far in his NBA career, but when you can outrun and outmuscle 80% or more of NBA athletes, who needs to pass? Jokes aside, if Whitmore can start leveraging his downhill threat to play make for others, he could ascend from a reliable off-the-bench scorer to a second or third option on a good team. Take this bucket against the Raptors, for instance: Obviously, Whitmore\u2019s finish at the rim here is extremely impressive \u2014 it almost feels silly to pick a hole in this. Fred VanVleet sets an effective screen for Whitmore, allowing him to switch onto the smaller Dennis Schroder and pick up speed. It creates space for Whitmore to work with \u2014 and work with it he does \u2014 but Whitmore ends up finishing through triple coverage when Jae\u2019Sean Tate was open in the corner to his left. He has the bounce and skill to make it work, but going forward Whitmore will have to make that pass more often for fear of becoming one-dimensional. But Whitmore\u2019s stock is undoubtedly trending up. During a six-game stretch from Jan. 24 against the Hornets to Feb. 4 against the Timberwolves, Whitmore averaged 19.8 points per game and 5.6 rebounds. His three-pointer has translated to the NBA, too, shooting 39.5% on 4.2 attempts from distance per game. Even as the Rockets have fallen away from the playoff race, Whitmore has been a compelling watch. As has GG Jackson. While the Grizzlies have lost their last six, Jackson has played 16 or more minutes in all of those games and made noise when on the court. The highlights in this recent stretch were two 18-point performances against the Celtics and Pacers. Against Indianapolis, Jackson displayed ruthless efficiency \u2014 shooting 6-9 from the field, including 2-4 from three, and sinking four of his five free throws. The Celtics game was the opposite story, as Jackson made just eight of his 24 field goals and chucked up 10 threes (only two went in). He needs to work on his consistency, but he has shined in flashes. Jackson is the youngest active NBA player, but has a grown man\u2019s body. At 6-foot-9 and 210 pounds, he could still add muscle to his frame, but Jackson belongs on an NBA court. He has an NBA-level brain and confidence, too. In this possession against the Pacers, Jackson jogs up the court under no pressure and as soon as he starts moving into a reasonable shooting range, he realizes that no Pacer will step up to guard him: He quickly calls for the ball from Ziaire Williams, catches and slides into his shooting motion smoothly and unleashes. Jackson makes the shot and gives the Grizzlies a seven-point lead in the second quarter. And he\u2019s not just a shooter with size \u2014 Jackson has displayed some ridiculous bounce, like here, also in the Pacers game: On a fast break against a stranded Andrew Nembhard, Grizzlies guard John Konchar lobs the ball up to Jackson, who jumps so high his knees are on the same horizontal plane as Nembhard\u2019s head. Sure, Jackson didn\u2019t have the cleanest one-handed dunk, but it looks almost as if he was so impressed with his own hops that he forgot what to do with the ball. That\u2019s the stuff you can\u2019t teach. And Jackson has plenty of time to learn, considering he skipped a year of high school ball. Remember that he\u2019s still the youngest player in the league. Whitmore sits at No. 5 on this list, at 19 years and 215 days of age as of Feb. 7. The lesson? Sometimes, you just have to bet on talent. Combinations of athleticism and ability to score like Jackson and Whitmore\u2019s don\u2019t come around often. Becoming an All-Star is no guarantee, but their general managers will look like geniuses if they do.```"}

According to Folt, the initiative will focus on building \u201cgroundbreaking programs\u201d in areas of computer literacy and aims to provide interdisciplinary opportunities to learn about the ethical uses of computer technology.\n\nGaurav Sukhatme, whose background is in computer science, electrical and computer engineering, was appointed inaugural director of the school. \u201cOur work will be firmly rooted in solving important societal problems that address issues of sustainability, global health, society and governance, and many others,\u201d Sukhatme said in a USC release announcing his appointment.\n\nThe opening of this school falls under Folt\u2019s new initiative, \u201cFrontiers of Computing,\u201d a $1 billion initiative that focuses on three key areas: advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning software, improving hardware efficiency and scalability and expanding quantum computing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just computing, it is that full embedding of the future of computing for what it means in every field, in every endeavor, and really for our students,\u201d Folt said in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\nBoth Folt and Sukhatme were clear that the school, while part of Viterbi, is meant to be used by students across majors and disciplines. \u201cWe already have a rich set of courses and minors in computing, which are taken by students across the university,\u201d Sukhatme said in a Q&A published by the university. \u201cWe plan to build on these to create new programs and courses, many of which will be the result of cross-school collaborations.\u201d\n\nThe new project dubbed, a \u201cschool within a school\u201d will feature the Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science, the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Division of Computing Education, which will incorporate the Information Technology Program.\n\nThe new program is currently funded by a $260 million donation from the Lord Foundation of California, received in 2019. The funding, along with future donations to the program, will be used to extend USC\u2019s reach into Los Angeles County\u2019s growing tech corridor, which has been coined \u201cSilicon Beach.\u201d\n\nThe area, which encompasses Marina del Rey, is already home to two USC Viterbi institutes: the Information Sciences Institute and the Institute for Creative Technologies, which together provide the largest quantity of \u201ctech talent\u201d in the country, according to the information sciences institute website.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re the best in California, without any doubt,\u201d Folt said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly the largest. We produce more [computer information systems (CIS)] students than any other research university in America.\u201d\n\nFolt went on to demonstrate the school\u2019s commitment to representation in the industry. \u201cWe produce more women, more engineers of color in that CIS space,\u201d she said.\n\nUSC\u2019s long-standing dedication to computer innovation has been well documented with more than 10,000 computer science degrees conferred between 2012-2021 \u2014 the most on the West Coast.\n\nYannis C. Yortsos, dean of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, which will oversee the new school said he believes the number is indicative of the need for people with these skills. \u201cThe world needs engineers and computer scientists to solve the grand challenges we face,\u201d Yortsos said in a statement on the school\u2019s webpage.\n\nAccording to the university, 30 new faculty members will be added in priority areas by 2025, with another 60 recruited by 2030 to support the needs of the new school.\n\nThe new building for the computing school, the Dr. Allen and Charlotte Ginsburg Human-Centered Computation Hall, is projected to open this summer.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Eric Thayer)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza February 08, 2024 at 6:06 pm PST\n\nFor Angeleno basketball fans, the last two numbers are synonymous with the life and legacy of Kobe Bryant, who wore both during his 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers. The 2 at the beginning represents the number Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Gigi, wore on the basketball court. So it\u2019s only fitting that today was the day Kobe joined the ranks of other Laker greats with the unveiling of a statue in his likeness outside of Crypto.com arena (popularly known among fans as \u201cThe House that Kobe Built\u201d).\n\nThe new statue, the first in a series of three, was unveiled late Thursday afternoon, ahead of the team\u2019s showdown with the defending champion Denver Nuggets. It commemorates the first stage of Bryant\u2019s career and depicts the iconic moment he walked off the court after scoring 81 points, a career-high, and features the names of Bryant\u2019s daughters emblazoned on his arm and a triangle at the base, a nod to former Lakers Coach Phil Jackson\u2019s signature triangle offensive scheme. According to his widow, Vanessa, Bryant chose the moment himself.\n\nFor those displeased with the statue, Bryant\u2019s widow had just one thing to say: \u201cTough sh*t.\u201d But she had some kind words for the fans as well, especially those in Los Angeles. \u201cThis moment isn\u2019t just for Kobe,\u201d she said at the unveiling. \u201cIt\u2019s for all of you that have been rooting for him, all of these years. To the fans here in LA, this was a city that Kobe was so proud to represent. It brings me joy to see how much love you have for all of us.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony featured speeches from Laker greats Derek Fisher, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, as well as team owner Jeanie Buss and Jackson. \u201cLet us not just dwell on the sadness of how that feels, but let\u2019s celebrate what their lives represented,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cBe the culture shifters that define the legacy of a true legend.\u201d\n\nFor many around the community, this honor was long overdue, given the time that has passed since the January 2020 helicopter crash that claimed the lives of eight \u2014 including Bryant and Gigi. However, for those who made the trip out to the arena, all that matters is that the statue is up and the community can now honor the great.\n\nIt\u2019s only fitting that Kobe is the recipient of all these enormous honors, considering the impact he had on the court, as well as off of it. He is the Lakers\u2019 all-time leading scorer and brought the city five championships. His charitable contributions have also had an outsized impact on the region also must not go unrecognized, as his foundation, and his involvement with Make-A-Wish, NBA Cares, and the Boys and Girls Club of America cement him as one of L.A.\u2019s most community-involved sports figures of all time.\n\nIn the national basketball landscape, he is one of the most celebrated and respected athletes ever. For freshman Riley Sager, Kobe had an immense impact on her life, even though his impact was only felt through a television screen. \u201cAnytime anyone pictures the Lakers, they picture Kobe,\u201d Sager said. \u201cKobe is so monumental in the Lakers\u2019 legacy and I\u2019m just so excited that he\u2019s being honored this way.\u201d\n\nBryant\u2019s statue is the 12th outside of Crypto.com arena and is just one of the many ways his memory continues to live on. \u201cMamba Day\u201d on 8/24, has been celebrated yearly since his retirement in 2016. Upcoming statues will feature Bryant and daughter, Gigi, signifying his commitment to fatherhood, and the great\u2019s later years after he switched his number to 24. Both the number 8 and the number 24 have been retired by the Lakers organization, making Bryant the first to have two numbers retired by the same team.\n```"}

Colorado\u2019s Supreme Court applied the provision, Section 3 of the 14th amendment, to Trump in it\u2019s ruling. The provision prevents any former officeholder who engaged in insurrection from holding office, civil or military, in the United States.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments from both the state of Colorado and lawyers for former President Trump. The Supreme Court justices seem skeptical of Colorado\u2019s ruling from their questions and their statements. It seems the justices believe that individual states may not disqualify candidates in a national election. There was little discussion today of whether to Trump engaging in the insurrection. Rather, Trump\u2019s lawyers made more procedural arguments.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney Jonathan Mitchell opened the hearing explaining that Trump is exempt from the provision because a president is not an officer of the United States. Jonathan Mitchell: Officer of the United States refers only to appointed officials, and it does not encompass elected individuals, such as the president or members of Congress.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Alito spoke to possible consequences of letting Colorado keep its ruling. Justice Alito: Some people claim would be quite severe would it not lead to the possibility that other states would say that there\u2019s non mutual collateral estoppel against former President Trump. And so the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court could effectively decide this question for many other states, perhaps all other states.\n\nJason Murray is an attorney representing the state of Colorado. He explained that the \u201celigibility provision\u201d of the US Constitution was written soon after the Civil War to prohibit insurrectionists from holding political office. Jason Murray: What is very clear from the history is, is that the framers were concerned about charismatic rebels who might rise through the ranks up to and including the presidency of the United States.\n\nJena Griswold is the Colorado Secretary of State. She says the Constitution is clear that Trump is ineligible for future office. Jena Griswold: And it\u2019s striking just steps away from the U.S. Capitol, where Donald Trump incited an insurrection, a violent mob where Congress people ran for their lives. Donald Trump argued that all insurrectionists can be on ballots, and that even if he was convicted of insurrection, that he has presidential immunity.\n\nThe Supreme Court justices are expected to act quickly before Super Tuesday March fifth and primary elections in 15 states, including Colorado.

People across the world celebrate to commemorate the beginning of the new year on the Lunar calendar and the arrival of spring. There are 12 animals on the Chinese zodiac, and each one is associated with a new year. This year is the Year of the Dragon, which symbolizes power, nobility and good luck.\n\nThe Lunar New Year is accompanied by a variety of traditions and lively celebrations, many of which surround the Chinese legend of a monster named Nian. As the story goes, the monster would attack villagers at the start of each year, but it was afraid of loud noises, bright lights, and the color red. Now, Lunar New Year celebrations are sure to include those three things, in order to ward off the monster and ring in the new year. Fireworks and firecrackers are the source of loud noises and bright lights...additionally, it is custom to wear red clothing and put up red decorations to symbolize good luck. Oranges are often put out as a sign of wealth.\n\nPeople often spend Lunar New Year surrounded by family and feasts. Many families carry their own traditions with them to celebrate the annual holiday. Xinyu \u201cSigrid\u201d Xu is a grad student studying communication management. She has celebrated Lunar New Year in Shanghai.\n\nXinyu \u201cSingrid\u201d Xu: I was born and raised in Shanghai, so it\u2019s sort of the East Coast of China. We do celebrate the Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve, not the day. It\u2019s the day before, like Christmas Eve here. And for our family tradition it\u2019s to get together, usually the grandparents, parents and the children, get together and we have a wonderful feast at night. We would eat hot pot. We have all our things, put it in the hot pot and let it boil, and we dip in different sauces.\n\nAnd she has celebrated in Los Angeles.\n\nXu: I\u2019ve decorated my house, so far, and I will invite my friends tomorrow night to my house to celebrate the New Year.\n\nElders give young people money in red envelopes called lai see or hong bao, for good luck. Additionally, the dragon represents good fortune in Chinese culture, so the annual parade often involves a dragon dance, with a large dragon puppet operated by talented performers, who parade the dragon through the streets. The traditional song of the new year is \u201cGongXi GongXi,\u201d which translates to \u201ccongratulations, congratulations\u201d in Mandarin.\n\nUSC has its own celebrations for Lunar New Year. The USC Pacific Asia Museum will host a celebration on February 10th.. It will include dances, crafts, and storytelling... Before that, we\u2019ll celebrate here at Wallis Annenberg Hall on the eve of the new year with food and festivities.\n```"}

For big games like this, fans might eat a certain food or wear specific clothes during a game. Fans might even have a special, \u201cgood-luck\u201d seat on the couch when watching a game. USC student, Jake Thurman, is among this group of superstitious fans.\n\nJake Thurman: I\u2019m a Patriots fan. So we usually we\u2019ll have like a Super Bowl party and nobody\u2019s allowed to bet on the score and no one\u2019s allowed to make any predictions out loud. But since the Pats aren\u2019t in it, I can do whatever I want.\n\nFor superstitious fans like this, there are some interesting stats about past Super Bowls which can be applied to Super Bowl 58. According to clutchpoints.com, over the past 30 years, teams traveling west to the Super Bowl are 7-0 against teams traveling east to the Super Bowl. In this years matchup, the Chiefs are traveling west while the 49ers are traveling east. For those superstitious fans, this seems to be a beneficial omen for the Chiefs.\n\nAnother interesting statistic to fuel the superstitions of NFL fans is the fact that of the previous 57 Super Bowls in NFL history, two out of three of the winners wore white jerseys during the game. That\u2019s according to NBC. On Sunday, the 49ers will wear white, while the Chief will wear red. For superstitious fans, it seems that the 49ers have the good omens in this case of jersey color.\n\nLast of the interesting stats, regards the game\u2019s coin toss. Of the past nine winners of the coin toss, eight of them have gone on to lose the game. It had been eight years in a row until the Chiefs broke the streak last year after winning the toss and the game.\n\nA conspiracy that emerged in November of 2023, suggested that the two colors on the Super Bowl logo determine the two teams that end up in the Super Bowl. The colors on both the 2022 and 2023 Super Bowl logos matched the colors of the teams that played in both of those respective Super Bowls. This conspiracy added further support to the \u201cNFL is scripted\u201d narrative seen across social media, until it was debunked this year. This year\u2019s red and purple logo does not perfectly match the red color schemes of the Chiefs and the 49ers.\n\nConspiracies, stats and superstitions like these might support the \u201cNFL is scripted\u201d conspiracies, but they are all just pure coincidence. Football is a game which goes far beyond a script, and its unpredictability and dramatic nature makes the Super Bowl the most watched television event in the U.S. every year.\n\nUSC journalism professor Alan Abrahamson gives it straight: Alan Abrahamson: All these superstitions, all of these conspiracy theories are fun. They\u2019re fun for sports talk radio. They\u2019re fun for our taste. But in the end, the two teams have to line them up, hit each other in the mouth and see who wins. This is what makes football so great. It\u2019s all just noise.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what new superstitions and conspiracies come out of this year\u2019s Super Bowl. With America\u2019s biggest game, anything is possible.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Roman Marchetti.\n```"}

After a mutually botched mission, the couple gets assigned to kill each other. While their marriage may have been lacking in passion, their attempts to kill one another were not. Ultimately though, they are reunited and come together to outsmart their employers. I don\u2019t want to spoil the ending here, but let\u2019s just say, everyone lives happily ever after.\n\nWhen it was announced that Francesca Sloane and Donald Glover would team up to reimagine this cult classic, there was a lot of pressure for the new series to live up to the iconography created by the original film. The lethal combo of a young Jolie and Pitt alone is enough to make a successful adaptation a true feat. What really worked to the series\u2019 advantage is the almost complete reimagining of the plot that the eight-episode short series exercised.\n\nJohn (Donald Glover) and Jane (Maya Erskine) are paired together by \u2018The Company\u2019\u2014the elusive organization that recruited them\u2014and tasked to pose as a married couple. They muse that as a couple they draw \u201cless attention\u201d when they are out on their missions. As they tackle these difficult and violent tasks, they quickly turn from strangers to colleagues to lovers. While the circumstances of their coming together are anything but ordinary, their romantic struggles are not unlike the average married couple, exacerbated by working and living together.\n\nIn between machete-wielding missions in El Salvador and near-death experiences in the Italian Dolomites, they disagree about kids, in-laws, how to spend their money and how they show affection to one another. They share moments of heartfelt understanding and intimacy in a way that only people with shared trauma can. Despite their incompatibility and character flaws, you find yourself rooting for the couple.\n\nThese relatively mundane moments are where the show differentiates itself from the original film. The movie is exciting because it\u2019s sexy, high-stakes, action-packed and at the end, two beautiful people return to a beautiful life. The show packs a similar sense of action and risk, but it is coupled with the complications of intimacy between two broken and imperfect people.\n\nIt\u2019s like if Jim and Pam from \u201cThe Office,\u201d worked as spies in \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d rather than a paper company.\n\nIn an era dominated by nostalgia in the media, remakes almost always leave something to be desired. We witnessed this with the remakes of \u201ciCarly\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d where, in an attempt to modernize the plot, the original allure was lost. But the \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith\u201d series adds much more to the original premise and redefines how spinoffs can successfully take the audience in a whole new direction.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Matt Krohn)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nFebruary 08, 2024 at 1:13 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s forceful phenoms\nChicago\u2019s Connor Bedard might be the headlining newcomer of the NHL this season, but about 400 miles northwest, two rookies are making Calder Trophy cases for themselves: Minnesota Wild center Marco Rossi and defenseman Brock Faber. At seventh in the Central, the Wild are not having the year they would\u2019ve hoped for following a 103-point playoff season in 2022-23. However, the elevation of Rossi and Faber has been huge in solidifying a strong future for the team.\n\nBoth were drafted in 2020 and had long routes to the NHL before finding their footing on the Wild. At 5-foot-9, Rossi wasn\u2019t the typical size for a top draft pick, but his stout skill set overshadowed this narrative. His path to the NHL was unconventional to say the least \u2014 Rossi\u2019s life and big-league dreams were severely in jeopardy after he was diagnosed with myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle. When he finally recovered, he made stints at both the AHL and NHL levels but appeared timid with Minnesota, landing him back with the minor-league Iowa Wild. This was a blessing in disguise, though, as Rossi earned his stripes with Iowa and furthered his development into an NHL-caliber center.\n\nThis season, he has completely broken out. Through 50 games, he has racked up 13 goals and 15 assists. He has spent time on the first line with bonafide stars Mats Zuccarello and Kirill Kaprizov while also developing his game on the lower lines. Rossi is an explosive skater, and his speed and craftiness has taken his offensive game to the next level. His new-and-improved confident playing style this season has made him look like a completely different player than in his earlier NHL days.\n\nFaber was a main piece in the Kevin Fiala trade back in 2022 after being drafted by the Kings a round after Rossi. A native of Maple Grove, Minnesota \u2014 a 30-minute drive from St. Paul \u2014 Faber grew up a big Wild fan. He played college hockey at the nearby University of Minnesota and got his first stab at playing a full NHL campaign this season following limited time with the Wild last year. The 21-year-old defenseman leads all Wild players with 24:51 of ice time per game, showing his impressive resilience and durability at such a young age.\n\nFaber\u2019s 30 points only trail Bedard by three for the rookie lead, but Minnesota\u2019s star defenseman will surely be on track to pass Chicago\u2019s center due to his absence with a broken jaw. Faber has shined in the defensive zone, creating havoc for opposing teams looking to score. On top of his stout defense, he is a skilled playmaker and uses his strong physicality to evade defenders in the neutral zone to generate points. He\u2019s also been a big part of Minnesota\u2019s power play unit, posting nine points on special teams thus far.\n\nThe Wild sit five points out of the Western Conference\u2019s second Wild Card spot and are determined to make their fifth-straight Stanley Cup Playoffs appearance despite the shaky start. Regardless, the time ahead is looking bright with two Calder candidates taking initiative this season.\n\nThe best prospects for early pick-hopefuls\nTwo weeks ago, I wrote about Macklin Celebrini, the consensus projected No. 1 overall pick in this year\u2019s draft. However, only one team will land him, and because of the lottery system, a handful will be disappointed when they don\u2019t hear their name called at the No. 1 slot. While Celebrini is extremely talented, these teams can still be happy with their selections as there are plenty of highly touted prospects. So, let\u2019s look at some of the top draft prospects not named Celebrini.\n\nIvan Demidov\nIvan Demidov is an 18-year-old Russian forward who currently plays with SKA-1946 of the MHL. His playmaking ability, consisting of elite puck handling and flashy shooting, has helped him tally 45 points this season. Demidov\u2019s high hockey IQ and unpredictable mobility will definitely be attractive to teams picking in the top three.\n\nArtyom Levshunov\nBelarusian defenseman Artyom Levshunov has made an immediate impact at the NCAA level with Michigan State, posting 27 points in 28 games this season. He\u2019s been vital on the Spartans\u2019 penalty kill and his 6-foot-2 frame gives him the physical edge on defense. Levshunov is more of an offensive defenseman but he can perform at the top of his game in all three zones.\n\nCole Eiserman\nWinger Cole Eiserman is only 17 years old but could be the next American phenom in the NHL. He\u2019s committed to Boston University and currently plays for the U.S. National Development Team. Averaging a whopping 1.63 points per game, Eiserman is a pure scorer. The issue is that he is far from a jack of all trades; his playmaking and skating could use some work, but he\u2019ll have plenty of time to improve upon his flaws as development continues.\n\nAnton Silayev\nDefenseman Anton Silayev\u2019s 6-foot-7 size and precise skating ability has made him into a highly touted prospect. His stats don\u2019t tell the full story; he only has 11 points this season in Russia\u2019s KHL but has been elite covering ground and setting up his teammates. With his physical build and skill set, the sky\u2019s the limit for Silayev.\n\nCayden Lindstrom\nBritish Columbia native Cayden Lindstrom is a physical center who isn\u2019t afraid to charge loose pucks and battle to make plays. He\u2019s recorded 46 points with the WHL\u2019s Medicine Hat Tigers and would likely have plenty more if he wasn\u2019t sidelined with a hand injury. Lindstrom is gifted in playmaking in transition and would be a solid addition to any NHL team looking for a skilled player in the middle.\n\nThe 2024 NHL Entry Draft will begin on June 28, but it\u2019s never too early to check in on the league\u2019s next stars. Past the midway point of the season, a handful of teams look to select a top prospect and build for the future.\n\nThe NHL\u2019s best face off in Toronto\nThe 2024 NHL All-Star festivities took place last weekend, with Team Matthews winning the 3-on-3 All-Star Game tournament and Edmonton\u2019s Connor McDavid taking the Skills Challenge. The Canucks led the league with six All-Stars following their acquisition of forward Elias Lindholm. The Maple Leafs, the hosts of All-Star Weekend, had four and impressed home fans as all played on the victorious Team Matthews. Popular Canadian celebrities Justin Bieber, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Will Arnett and Tate McRae made appearances as honorary captains. Teams got back to work on Monday after almost a week off from games.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Cam Kauffman February 08, 2024 at 10:02 am PST\n\nThe USC men\u2019s basketball team trailed by 15 points with 15:40 remaining in the second half Wednesday night at Cal, causing many to think the game was all but over. But freshman guard Isaiah Collier had other plans, scoring 17 points during the final 15 minutes of regulation. Collier took to the free throw line with 27.7 seconds remaining, trailing by one, with a chance to give the Trojans their first lead since the five-minute mark of the first half. He made the first one easily to tie it, but his second attempt rimmed out and into the hands of the Golden Bears. Moments later, Cal junior guard Jaylon Tyson wound up missing a forced 3-pointer as time expired.\n\nIn overtime, the Trojans did all they could, but two clutch 3-pointers from Cal\u2019s Tyson and junior guard Jalen Celestine within the final 91 seconds put it out of reach for USC, who fell 83-77. The loss keeps USC (9-14 overall, 3-9 conference) in dead last in the Pac-12, while moving Cal (10-13, 6-6) into a tie for seventh place with Stanford after its loss to UCLA Wednesday. The loss is also the first time the Trojans have lost to the Golden Bears since 2017, breaking an 11-game head-to-head win streak for USC.\n\nIn what could have been, or should have been, another bounceback game for the Trojans, who defeated Oregon State Saturday for their first win since January 6, USC could not find any sort of cohesion. Instead, the Trojans looked sloppy on both sides of the ball early, late and, quite frankly, in overtime as well. They missed countless layups and short bunnies, got outrebounded by an astonishing 54-27 margin and missed nine total free throws on the night. The Trojans missed seven shots from within the four-foot arc.\n\nHead coach Andy Enfield was frustrated by his team\u2019s inability to effectively rebound the ball, especially after USC\u2019s 44-rebound night against Oregon State four days prior. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when you guard for 20 or 25, or sometimes 29 seconds, and they miss their shot and get the offensive rebound, kick it out and make a 3 or run 20 more seconds off the clock,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has been challenging for us at times this year.\u201d\n\nThe game wasn\u2019t solely USC\u2019s for the taking, however. In reality, the Golden Bears made shots late when it mattered. Leading by just two points with 1:58 remaining in regulation, Cal graduate guard Jalen Cone hit a massive 3-pointer to keep the Golden Bears in the driver\u2019s seat. Multiple other Cal players came up clutch in the second half and in overtime, connecting on four different 3-pointers with less than three seconds remaining on the shot clock each time.\n\nThe main reason the Trojans were even in the game late was Collier\u2019s dominant second-half performance. The Georgian scored all 20 of his total points in the second half and overtime combined, as he was unable to connect whatsoever in the first half during his limited playing time. Enfield chalked up Collier\u2019s first half to being \u201crusty\u201d after missing four weeks of games. \u201cHe was terrific; he gave great energy defensively,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nWithout Collier, the Trojans have struggled immensely at times. Since his hand injury on January 10 during a game against Washington State, the Trojans have posted a 1-5 record and have averaged just less than 66 points \u2013 USC averaged almost 78 before his injury.\n\nAnother notable Trojan performance came from DJ Rodman, who had somewhat of a breakout game against Oregon State last week, when he tallied 12 points and 14 rebounds. Against Cal, he netted 7-of-9 shots, including three 3-pointers, for 17 points off the bench. Rodman only grabbed two boards Wednesday night, as freshman guard Bronny James led USC with five total.\n\nCal had three players with 15 or more points, including Cone (20), Tyson (27) and graduate forward Fardaws Aimaq (15), who recorded a double-double with 20 rebounds.\n\nUSC now moves to 0-3 in close games (games decided by six or less points) this season, including an 0-2 record in overtime games. Cal has won four of its last five games, Including a 2-0 record in overtime during that stretch.\n\nThe Trojans continue their Northern California road trip at Stanford at Maples Pavilion Saturday at 7 p.m.\n```"}

Available from February 10 to March 30, 2024, this initiative seeks to support students not covered by the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP).\n\nRudra Saigal, the Senator of the USG, shared insights with the Daily Trojan into the previous system\u2019s limitations, highlighting the financial and privacy concerns that deterred some students from getting tested. \u201cBefore this initiative, students outside the SHIP had to pay upfront for STI testing and then navigate the cumbersome reimbursement process\u201d Saigal said. \u201cMoreover, students using their parents\u2019 insurance plans often avoided testing for fear of disclosure.\u201d\n\nThis campaign promises a significant shift, removing the need for insurance claims and ensuring complete confidentiality. It aims to empower students, especially around Valentine\u2019s Day, to take control of their sexual health without the burden of cost, or the worry of insurance paperwork.\n\nStudents who want to get tested can do so easily. Here are the steps:\n\nLog into MySHR and choose \u201cSTI Testing\u201d for your appointment category.\nObtain a lab order for sample collection at the USC Student Health Center.\nHead to the first floor of either Engemann or Eric Cohen buildings for lab services.\nProvide a blood or urine sample as required.\nAccess your test results confidentially through the MySHR portal.\n\nThis service is exclusively for USC students who contribute to the Student Health Fee.\n\nThe STI tests available include:\n\nChlamydia and Gonorrhea: Urine tests, recommended for sexually active individuals under 25.\nSyphilis: Blood tests, advised for males, nonbinary, and transgender individuals having sex with men and for females who have never been tested.\nHIV: A one-time recommended blood test for everyone, with additional screenings for those at higher risk.\n\nFor urgent concerns, USC offers 24/7 crisis support via call or text, alongside the option for immediate walk-in consultations at the Engemann Student Health Center for emergencies.\n\nThis initiative underscores USC\u2019s commitment to fostering a healthy, informed, and supportive community, ensuring students can focus on their education and relationships without health-related anxieties.\n```"}

(AP/Toru Takahashi, File)\n\nBy Marissa Russ February 08, 2024 at 12:14 am PST\n\nIn a shock to the motorsport world, record-tying seven-time World Drivers\u2019 Champion Lewis Hamilton has decided to opt out of his final contract year with Mercedes AMG PETRONAS F1 and start the 2025 Formula One season with Scuderia Ferrari, the most successful and iconic Formula One team of all time.\n\nAfter he signed his contract extension with Mercedes AMG PETRONAS F1 Team in August 2023, Lewis Hamilton wondered if his recent seasons of misfortune with Mercedes were because of him, or because of the car. Maybe he\u2019s finally found the answer.\n\nAfter racing one of the best Formula One cars of all time in the Mercedes W11\u201482 race wins, six drivers\u2019 titles\u2014what was the final straw? Was it years of cars underperforming, driver decline, or perhaps the team itself?\n\nHow Did This Happen?\n\nThe storm clouds rolled in for Hamilton and Mercedes long before his summer contract extension. The 2022 and 2023 seasons were anything but a respite from the infamous heartbreaking end for Hamilton at the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\n\n2022 was the first year in Hamilton\u2019s Formula One career that left him with no wins and no pole position starts. When speaking to Sky Sports at the end of the 2022 season, Hamilton called it one of his \u201ctop three worst seasons.\u201d\n\nHamilton went from scoring a total of 387.5 points and finishing in second place in the drivers\u2019 standings in 2021 to scoring only 240 points and finishing in sixth place amongst his fellow drivers.\n\nOne of 2022\u2032s biggest issues with the Mercedes W13 car was porpoising, which is a phenomenon that causes the car to bounce up and down while racing. This caused Hamilton to suffer significant back pain after the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix specifically.\n\nHamilton himself said he was looking forward to never having to drive the W13 car again at the end of the 2022 season and Wolff agreed that the car was lackluster according to Mercedes\u2019 standards.\n\n2023 brought the W14 car. Mercedes had curbed the porpoising and after upgrades, the team earned back-to-back podium finishes in Spain and Canada. But all good things must come to an end.\n\nFor the entirety of the 2023 season, Red Bull Racing and Max Verstappen dominated not just Mercedes, but the entire grid for a second year in a row, as Verstappen won his third consecutive Drivers\u2019 Championship.\n\nDespite it all, Hamilton managed to climb higher in the driver\u2019s ranking and finish third, but kept his total point haul to 234 for the season.\n\nDuring the season, Wolff told Formula Uno that Hamilton wasn\u2019t on board with the direction the Mercedes team wanted to take in developing the car. Wolff and the team decided to go with what data was showing them, rather than what their World Champion driver advised.\n\nSuch a choice was clearly catastrophic for Mercedes. It was a choice that caused Hamilton to be \u201cemotionally drained.\u201d\n\nEven so, at the end of 2023, Hamilton said there were \u201cfundamental changes\u201d to the car that he had been suggesting for \u201cover a year.\u201d He expressed an expectation that they would be implemented in the future without naming any specific timeline.\n\nBut before the 2022 season could even start, things at Mercedes were already changing. Mercedes announced that they were signing British driver George Russell to the team. He would take over Valtteri Bottas\u2019 seat at Mercedes.\n\nAs expected, Hamilton was nothing but welcoming to the younger driver. Hamilton also took time to post a moving tribute to Bottas and their time as teammates together on X, calling Bottas \u201cthe best teammate\u201d he\u2019s \u201chad the pleasure of working with.\u201d\n\nWith a young, talented driver in Russell and the greatest driver of all time in Hamilton, Mercedes had an ideal driver pairing going into the 2022 season. It was shaping up to be not just Hamilton\u2019s redemption season, but Mercedes\u2019 as well.\n\nRussell did not disappoint in his debut Mercedes season, with 275 total points, a fourth-place finish in the drivers\u2019 standings and his first Grand Prix win in S\u00e3o Paulo. On paper and across major stats, he\u2019d beaten Lewis for the season.\n\nDespite the stats, Hamilton praised his teammate at the end of the season, saying Russell\u2019s transition to Mercedes had been \u201cimpressive\u201d and that the other driver was a \u201cpositive force\u201d for the Mercedes team.\n\nTeam Principal Toto Wolff said that Hamilton and Russell \u201care both alpha drivers and this is good.\u201d Wolff said he didn\u2019t want a \u201cpuppy\u201d on the team.\n\nIn 2023, the driver pairing put that dynamic on clear display. Head-to-head, Hamilton was victorious over Russell, finishing third in the drivers\u2019 standings with 234 points. Russell finished eighth with 175 points.\n\nWhile Mercedes didn\u2019t get the finish they hoped for during the Singapore GP, it was Hamilton who held the team down to secure much-needed points. If Russell had even managed to finish the race, he would have given Mercedes valuable points to help narrow the race between Mercedes and Ferrari in the Constructors\u2019 Championship that year.\n\nAt the podium celebration after the race, when Hamilton collected his trophy, no Mercedes team members were seen at the celebration with Lewis. The other two podium finishers, Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz, were greeted with cheers from several team members at the celebration.\n\nWhen speaking to Autosport.com, Mercedes Technical Director James Allison said, \u201cOf course the team was there... as many of the team as it was practical to get to the podium were there.\u201d No additional comments from Mercedes were given for the Singapore podium celebration.\n\nFan speculation swirls online still about what, if any, dynamics within the team changed on that day. It\u2019s certainly plausible that the broadcast team decided not to feature the Mercedes team members who were at the podium celebration.\n\nHowever, when images of Lewis being celebrated by rival Ferrari Mechanics and Hamilton himself posting a forlorn picture on X after the race, it would have been a perfect opportunity for Mercedes to stop the negative press by simply posting an appreciation for their driver, specifically confirming their support for him during the celebration. Mercedes did not do that. They posted standard congratulatory posts centering Russell in the conversation.\n\nPerhaps the most tense moment between the teammates came at the Qatar Grand Prix. Russell finished fourth but Hamilton had to retire his car in the first lap after a collision with Russell. Hamilton ended up taking \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the collision.\n\nAfter the race, the Mercedes Instagram account posted a video of Hamilton apologizing to Russell for the collision. To some, the video was an uplifting moment between the two drivers and reassurance that the team was harmonious in its goal to finish out the season as best they could.\n\nTo others, the video was anything but. At the start of the Grand Prix, Hamilton and Russell were on different racing strategies. Hamilton started the race on soft tires, the fastest type available, while Russell started his race on medium tires.\n\nAt the time fan speculation arose that the strategy was\u2013or should have been\u2013Hamilton passing Russell at the start because of his faster and quicker-to-wear tires. In the Mercedes race debrief video posted to YouTube, trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said that the team was aware of the chance that Hamilton would overtake Russell at the start, but there was never any plan for one driver to stay behind or go ahead of the other.\n\n\u201cIt was important that they didn\u2019t lose time racing each other,\u201d Shovlin said. \u201cand that was clear, but we weren\u2019t imposing team orders on the race.\u201d\n\nDynamics between two drivers on a team are almost always up to speculation, unless you\u2019re Hamilton in 2014, declaring that Nico Rosberg and he \u201care not friends.\u201d\n\nWhat can\u2019t be misinterpreted was Hamilton\u2019s deep dissatisfaction with the gap between his goals for the team and the on-track performances.\n\nNot all of Hamilton\u2019s personal relationships have been torn apart. Most consequentially, his relationship with Ferrari team principal Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur has stood the test of time.\n\nBefore Hamilton had signed his contract extension with Mercedes, Vasseur\u2019s name constantly came up in rumor mills as trying to lure Hamilton from Mercedes. The two have a friendship that goes all the way back to 2006, when Hamilton\u2019s future career was anything but predetermined.\n\nVasseur founded ART Grand Prix team in 1996. ART Grand Prix races in the Formula Two racing division, which is typically the final racing category a driver competes in before graduating to Formula One.\n\nHamilton raced for ART Grand Prix in 2006 while Vasseur was leading the team. Vasseur was still with the team when Hamilton made the famous call for the wing angle of his car to be trimmed in order to increase straight-line speed before the Istanbul 2006 sprint race.\n\nHis mechanics weren\u2019t fond of the idea, but they obliged the then-21-year-old\u2019s wishes anyway. Hamilton would spin early on in the race, but eventually come back to finish second. He went from P17 to P2.\n\nIt was a display of Hamilton\u2019s racing prowess very early on in his career. Maybe Hamilton never forgot that trust, and maybe he was reminded of it when Mercedes wouldn\u2019t listen to his requests.\n\nIn 2007, Hamilton raced for McLaren in Formula One. Vasseur would work as team principal for Renault and Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 Team, and frequently see Hamilton throughout the years.\n\nMore than likely, though, Vasseur was just the cherry atop the red Ferrari cake. In May 2023, three months before he signed his contract extension with Mercedes, Hamilton said he saw himself \u201cbeing with Mercedes till my last days.\u201d\n\nHowever, dating back to 2017, Hamilton has referred to racing for Ferrari as a distant dream. In his first post about his move to Ferrari, Hamilton called racing in Ferrari red as a childhood dream. He thanked Mercedes and Toto specifically for all of their support.\n\nWhen Wolff spoke to the media about Hamilton\u2019s departure, one day after the driver\u2019s announcement, he revealed that Hamilton had informed the team principal of his departure only days earlier over a cup of coffee.\n\nThe Last Dance\n\nWas it the car, the driver or the team that pushed Hamilton to leave Mercedes? It was undoubtedly the driver.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled \u2014 it\u2019s not due to declining talent, skill or work ethic. Hamilton has been at the steering wheel his entire life, and there was no way he would leave his last chances at an eighth championship in the hands of a team that spent half of the year defeating itself and then sitting on its hands instead of playing catch up to Red Bull.\n\nThe adversity Mercedes has faced in the past three years pushed Hamilton and the team in a way they hadn\u2019t been pushed before. Of course, in Hamilton\u2019s previous 11 years with Mercedes, everything was not smooth sailing. But different teammate dynamics and Hamilton\u2019s record-breaking career could have added strain in places there never was before.\n\nMaybe Hamilton was unsatisfied with the team\u2019s reaction. Maybe he felt a lack of urgency from his team to get back to the top.\n\nOr maybe \u2013 as he explained to Toto Wolff over a simple coffee \u2013 moving to Ferrari was the last chance he had to truly challenge himself during his career.\n\nFerrari isn\u2019t paradise on the grid \u2014 it\u2019s not like Hamilton is getting a seat upgrade. Ferrari\u2019s last two years have been swamped by Red Bull dominance, and they\u2019ve also hurt themselves with poor racing strategy and car development decisions, arguably to a further extent than even Mercedes.\n\nIf somehow Mercedes gets it right, they could give Hamilton the fairytale ending he\u2019s been chasing for two years: a record-breaking eighth drivers\u2019 championship. I don\u2019t think they will, but it\u2019s nice to dream.\n\nA race win or two would be nice for his 2024 season, but it would also be a staunch reminder of how far the team has fallen, reflecting the very reason Hamilton is leaving them behind.\n```"}

Although the Los Angeles Clippers did not have any players crack the starting lineup for the west, both Paul George and Kawhi Leonard were named reserves in this year\u2019s contest. With the level of talent in today\u2019s league, there are always going to be All-Star snubs. But one thing NBA fans, players and coaches did get right this year was voting both of the Clippers\u2019 superstars into this year\u2019s game.\n\nCurrently, the Clippers are the No.3 seed in the Western Conference with a 34-15 record. L.A. boasts the third-best offensive rating in the league at 120.3, the best three-point percentage at 39.9% and the fifth-best field goal percentage at 49.7%. All this because Leonard and George are playing some of the best basketball of their careers.\n\nAfter only playing 52 games total in each of the last two regular seasons, Leonard has already played in 46 of the Clippers\u2019 50 games.  On the season, he is averaging 24.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. Leonard is also having the most efficient shooting season of his career as he is shooting 53.3% from the field and 45.7% from three-point range. Leonard has long been regarded as one of the best two-way players in the league, this year being no exception as he is averaging 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks per game.\n\nGeorge has played in 47 games this season and is averaging 22.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game. Like Kawhi Leonard, George is also averaging 1.7 steals per game on the defensive side as well.\n\nThe Western Conference is loaded with talent in the frontcourt, and when compared to their peers, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have been as good as anyone this year. Take Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, for example, was named as one the West\u2019s starters this year even though both Leonard and George are putting up comparable numbers on great efficiency. One could argue Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant has been the best forward in the Western Conference this year, putting up 28.3 points, 6.3 rebounds and 5.7 assist per game. But the Suns do not have the same success when it comes to winning as the Clippers have\u2014a team with Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal is currently 29-21 and the No. 6 seed in the West.\n\nThe Clippers just wrapped up a seven-game road trip and will be looking to head into the All-Star break continuing their winning ways, with fans everywhere hoping for Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to keep up their stellar play deep into the postseason.\n```"}

But everyone knows that his abusive actions in the past with his former girlfriend, Rihanna, have pinned a heavy label on his image that negatively impacted his career and reputation as an artist. Then why do we still celebrate him? Although his immense impact on the music industry and the dance community prevails, Brown is a stark reminder of how we can collectively ignore his well-documented history of domestic violence abuse, legal issues and aggressive social media presence.\n\nChris Brown, who was up for a Grammy award on Sunday, becomes a prime example of the paradox within the limitations of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d The dispute in 2009 that caused Brown to lose so many music deals, banned from many radio stations, which supposedly affected his overall career and image, turned to the release of his album \u201cGraffiti,\u201d which reached the top 20 of the Billboard charts later that year. It led music critics and fans to believe his album showed significant remorse and a plea for Rihanna\u2019s forgiveness. Three years later, he took home his first Grammy for the 2012 Best R&B Album \u201cF.A.M.E.,\u201d and we all seemed to move on from his violent history.\n\nAs a reminder, many of your favorite artists have collaborated with Chris Brown. Regardless of his countless apologies to Rihanna and her acceptance of his apology, we don\u2019t know if she genuinely forgave him. Her public forgiveness seemed to become a green light for his fans to rise to Brown\u2019s defense and claim his music to be revolutionary and worth listening to now, completely ignoring the fact that she was not his only victim even after five years of probation, community service and anger management rehab.\n\nIt raises an uncomfortable topic of whether attitudes towards domestic violence are moral standards in the entertainment industry. The idea behind \u201cseparate the artist from their music\u201d is epitomized by Chris Brown in almost every situation. The discussion revolving around his nomination at the 2024 Grammys (his 22nd career nomination) is nonexistent; audiences raised no backlash. Brown remains high on the charts with over 500 million streams of his top songs and 49.3 million monthly listeners on Spotify.\n\nHis Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance on the song \u201cSummer Too Hot\u201d may not be for the quality or message of his music but more for his recognition as an artist and distinguished popularity within the music community. I would categorize him as a good artist but a horrible celebrity. With all that money he makes and the recognition he receives from The Academy, he could have revamped his image and recovered from this incident\u2014I feel that he continues to sabotage his career.\n\nTo add, he remains a poor example to his young audience as he continuously glamorizes violence and disrespectful attitudes towards women in his music. His behavior should hold concerns on why we continue to stream his music, like other artists with a tumultuous background of abuse. Even though we are now quick to jump onto the \u201ccancel culture\u201d bandwagon, Chris Brown seems to slide past without much flack.\n\nWhy is Chris Brown an exception? Maybe people don\u2019t take domestic violence seriously enough to shun abusers out of the limelight altogether. What about Woody Allen, Marilyn Manson, or countless other celebrities whose misdeeds and poor behavior are often overlooked for the sake of their talent and skill? Perhaps we choose to let Brown and others slide because of their level of relevancy. We just choose who we want to \u201ccancel\u201d based on what discourse is happening on the internet.\n\nWhether or not Brown\u2019s nomination for the 2024 Best R&B Performance is deserved, the complex narrative surrounding his figure is relevant to the pattern of male musicians\u2019 aggressive reputations being ignored by mainstream society. It raises the question of whether we can look past artists\u2019 dark histories in the name of their musical achievements. The answer is yes. People like Chris Brown still make a lot of money, have a large fanbase and receive press appearances and Recording Academy recognition.\n\nSociety must hold artists like Chris Brown accountable for their actions instead of forgetting about their dark pasts. When we don\u2019t value accountability, we enter a constant cycle of ignoring and streaming within our consumer society. It is essential not to pardon a history of abuse with award nominations and record sales, as this cycle just enables and excuses harmful behavior within the ones in the entertainment industry. It shines a light on how the industry prioritizes the commercialization of music over the ethical considerations of violent behavior.\n\nThe media has a reputation for normalizing abusive behavior along with the use of lyricism language within music that makes light of violence and misogyny. As consumers, we must acknowledge these uncomfortable questions about its continued success.\n```"}

The 15-year-old Russian skater tested positive for a banned heart medication weeks before the Games.\n\nDoping can never be excused or justified, and I was just glad that the other skaters who competed clean are finally getting an answer. I don\u2019t have a problem with the verdict itself being a typical four-year ban. I don\u2019t even have a problem with the fact that CAS treated Valieva the same as an adult athlete.\n\nNo, I have a problem with why this happened in the first place. I have a problem with manipulating a child and then letting her alone face the consequences. I have anger and sadness about some of the most toxic issues within figure skating (many outside of the skaters\u2019 control) that do not seem to lead to any change but this broken article.\n\nHow lamentable to see someone who was born to skate now being rejected by the ice where she used to make life happen. Don\u2019t be fooled when they say the ban will stop right before Milan 2026. All of the girls who train under Eteri Tutberidze have the infamous \u201cEteri Expiration Date,\u201d which happens roughly when they hit 17.\n\nIt means that Valieva might not even be physically competent to fight for a spot on the podium, even with both the CAS ban on her and the IOC ban on Russian athletes out of the way. Since she is barred from both public and private ice, Valieva is watching her prime slip away.\n\nThe closest she can get to the ice is behind those hockey boards. There is no crueler fate for a figure skater.\n\nFlashing back to the team event in Beijing where Valieva helped Russia soar to gold and took my breath away with her In Memoriam, Valieva\u2019s elegant dancing figure was like a delicate butterfly bracing the ice. Her lyrical and ballet-esque movements presented a mesmerizing balance between fragility and resilience.\n\nThe program showcased the sophistication of her skating and jumping skills and an astonishing level of musicality. How mature she was in mastering her music and emotional expressions was almost surprising for her age.\n\nMy favorite characterization of the young girl is from The New York Times, which called her a \u201csupernova.\u201d It was true, at least for a while. She was an exploding star who landed on the scene with magnificent light and a gravitational force, pulling your attention in and not allowing you to look away.\n\nExactly two years later, today, I can still see her as a butterfly, but this time being helplessly mired in the storm of politics, toxic coach-student dynamics, international power struggles and, frankly, endless troubles over which she has no control.\n\nThe girl was branded all over with the interests of others. Now, she is being punished for the sins of others. The adults around her \u2014 those who should be responsible \u2014 are not being punished.\n\nIn their place is Valieva, a child at her first Olympics, filled with hopes and expectations. Russia flew too close to the sun and its athlete is paying the price with potentially the rest of her competitive career.\n\nCAS, by explicitly saying that there was no reason to treat her differently from adult athletes, is likely trying to make Russia really hurt this time. But Russia is ready to give her up.\n\nOne comment under The Washington Post\u2019s reporting says: \u201cCan\u2019t imagine why anyone would bother watching skating going forward.\u201d It breaks my heart, but here lies the inconvenient truth.\n\nWhere do we go from here? When are we going to see another gifted young skater from Russia starting to dominate the sport (well, at least at where they are allowed to compete)? Probably tomorrow, considering how fast Tutberidze\u2019s inhumane training methods can churn out medal-getters.\n\nBut when are we going to see an end to the exploitation of children athletes in Russia? And how dare Tutberidze question if Valieva was sufficiently represented at the hearings when she got away by hiding behind her once-promising student?\n\nIn Memoriam still haunts me. As one of the last dances Valieva performed at the Olympics, it might just well be the memoriam for herself as a competitive figure skater.\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Elijah Patterson)\n\nBy Paulena Edelman February 07, 2024 at 6:20 pm PST\n\nWith USC moving into the Big Ten, it\u2019s more imperative than ever that USC recruits talented players. As the recruitment process comes to an end with National Signing Day, USC football secured two new commitments, flipping both from current or future Big Ten schools.\n\nRatumana Bulabalavu \u2014 a former Washington commit from Carlsbad, California \u2014 signed Tuesday. The 6-foot-4 and 245-pound defensive lineman is ranked No. 765 nationally, the No. 67 DL and the No. 53 player in California, according to On3. Bulabalavu\u2019s signing with USC makes him the second four-star lineman to join the Trojans in addition to Carlon Jones. Bulabalavu, on the smaller end for a defensive lineman, is expected to join the outside of the line rather than the interior.\n\nFormer Michigan State commit Jadyn Walker also signed today. The 6-foot-3 and 205-pound linebacker is from Portage, Michigan. The three-star recruit is ranked No. 1,180 nationally, No. 114 among linebackers and as the No. 24 player in Michigan, according to On3.\n\nSix-foot-1 and 170-pound cornerback Isaiah Rubin also finally inked with the Trojans. Originally committing on October 20, 2023, Rubin did not sign during the Early Signing Period and instead waited until February to lock in his commitment. The cornerback from Los Alamitos is ranked 471 nationally, No. 45 among other cornerbacks and No. 36 in California. Rubin, also ranked as a four-star prospect according to 247Sports, brings a lot of promise to the team with his top-notch footwork, sense for direction changes and formation recognition.\n\nUSC finishes with On3\u2032s No. 18 class in the country. The Trojans\u2019 high school class includes 22 players, 13 of which are four-star recruits. The Trojans faced several losses last season with an 8-5 game record, with some disappointing defeats against Utah and UCLA. After starting out strong at No. 6 in the AP Top 25 poll to start the 2023 season, USC dropped completely out of the top 25 rankings to No. 30.\n\nThe disastrous defense resulted in head coach Lincoln Riley firing then-defensive coordinator Alex Grinch and bringing on D\u2019Anton Lynn as the new defensive coordinator. Lynn has had experience coaching both college-level football and the NFL. The new coaching staff is already having an enormous impact on the defensive positions. Since the announcement of Lynn\u2019s arrival on December 1, 2023, two players \u2013 Bulabalavu and Walker \u2013 flipped their commitments from other schools to sign with USC. Walker had been committed to Michigan State since September but ultimately ended up signing with USC because of the changes to the coaching staff.\n\nAll in all, out of the 22 players who signed in the 2024 recruiting class, 13 are defensive players. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see different styles in the Big Ten, and that\u2019s something where we have to do a good job in the spring, making sure we\u2019re seeing the stuff we\u2019re going to see in the fall,\u201d Lynn said to the media in early December.\n\nThe addition of multiple defensive players, along with a new defensive coordinator brings hope for USC in the upcoming 2024 season, just in time for the Trojan\u2019s entrance into the Big Ten.\n```"}

Patton: I do think that it is in a form of a monopoly, that Disney is kind of taking over a lot of big streaming services and a lot of big companies, and I think it\u2019s really important for them to, for independent companies to shine, especially because there needs to be a more independent and a diversity of opinions rather than being controlled by one conglomerate, in a sense.\n\nOver the years, streaming has become one of cable television\u2019s greatest competitors, as cable and broadcast viewership now makes up less than 50% of TV watching. But are they really all that different? Theater major Ryann Jacobson points out the similarities between the two. Jacobson: It seems to me almost like cable is coming back. It\u2019s like being invented in a new way, because everything\u2019s being bundled together. And then having ads again, like on the services, just like commercials. So it kind of seems like it\u2019s an eternal loop. I do like streaming services because it\u2019s easy to watch at home if they pay the people correctly and are giving them the correct royalties and things like that.\n\nSimilar to cable, streaming services charge monthly fees and while the price point for the new service has not been announced, industry experts expect the cost to be around $40-$50 a month. Health and Human Sciences freshman Dream Spivey believes this price is too high. Spivey: that\u2019s a lot for sports. I mean, it if it has like, all the sports, you\u2019d have to be kind of like a fanatic because, like, if you only like one particular sport, you might not want to pay 50 to $60 for one streaming service that only a sports. So I don\u2019t know.\n\nEach of the companies involved will own one-third of this venture. As of now, this service does not have a name.\n\nFor Annenberg Media: I am Veronica Towers.\n```"}

During the Covid pandemic, Dartmouth dropped ACT and SAT score requirements along with other top colleges across the country. But, four Dartmouth professors conducted an internal study into standardized test scores of prior applicants and found that the requirement supports disadvantaged students. Lower-income applicants to Dartmouth that didn\u2019t submit their test scores harmed their chances, as the admissions office couldn\u2019t be confident about their qualifications. Even lower standardized test scores show that disadvantaged students overcame challenging environments.\n\nJerry Lucido, a professor at USC and Executive Director of the Center for Enrollment Research, Policy and Practice commented on the policy change. Lucido: it\u2019s been a growing movement even before Covid. Covid made it, almost universal. And now we\u2019re seeing some colleges move back to their testing policies. Lucido questions the benefit of this policy for low-income students. Lucido: when colleges often say we do this for equity purposes, well, it may or may not serve that. Depends on who they ultimately admit.\n\nHarry Feder, the Executive Director of FairTest, the national center for Fair and Open Testing wasn\u2019t shocked by Dartmouth\u2019s choice. Feder: It\u2019s not entirely surprising that Dartmouth would do this. Their admissions folks, I think, went into test optional reluctantly. Dartmouth is a school where a third of its student population comes from independent schools. It has a certain status it would like to keep in the firmament of the Ivies. And it wants to be seen as a selective institution. Feder says standardized scores are only one indicator of an applicant\u2019s strength and ability to succeed at a top college. Feder: You don\u2019t need to show an SAT score to prove that you can do the work at an institution. Lots of admissions offices other than Dartmouth have found lots of ways to find talented students who would benefit from the education, who would do well at an institution of that caliber. And now they\u2019re just going to be deterred and cut off.\n\nAfter Dartmouth\u2019s decision, experts are looking to other colleges if they will make the same change for next year\u2019s applicants.

Some students are questioning this finding.\n\nIn a study published by Dartmouth University in January, professors said the SAT is essential in determining a potential student's admission. (Photo courtesy of Nguyen Dang Hoang Nhu)\n\nBy Makenzi Johnson and Valeria S Macias February 07, 2024 at 5:58 pm PST\n\nThis week, Dartmouth University announced the return of mandatory SAT scores for their class of 2029 admissions cycle. The school says the move will help less-advantaged students, but USC students disagree. After being test-optional for almost four years, the decision comes amid a post-pandemic world. In June 2020, the University followed a long line of other higher education schools in removing the requirement. But now, current high school juniors will be required to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test and submit scores by next year\u2019s application deadline.\n\nIn a study published by Dartmouth University in January, professors said the SAT is essential in determining a potential student\u2019s admission. They said that bringing back standardized testing will only aid students with disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cImportantly, these test scores better position Admissions to identify high-achieving less-advantaged applicants and high-achieving applicants who attend high schools for which Dartmouth has less information to interpret the transcripts,\u201d said Dartmouth professors Elizabeth Cascio, Bruce Sacerdote, Doug Staiger and Michele Tine in a statement.\n\nThe study said that the test is an accurate reflection of the student\u2019s academic achievements once they become a college student. It argued that it is an even more accurate prediction than a GPA.\n\nUSC announced in 2020 that standardized test scores would be optional for undergraduates applying for the 2021-2022 academic year and has since extended that policy through the 2024-2025 academic year. The university said on Wednesday that it is still researching the policy regarding mandatory SAT/ACT scores.\n\nTim Brunold, USC Dean of Admission said in a statement to Annenberg Media, \u201cWe are not yet ready to reach any final conclusions about the efficacy of this approach, our initial observations and analysis give us confidence that the [current] policy has supported our prospective student and applicant population through the challenges of the COVID pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther, the quality and diversity of our incoming student cohorts have been impressive, and we are seeing expected outcomes in academic performance and student persistence at USC,\u201d Brunold said.\n\nSome USC students voiced concerns for the future of college admissions as colleges like Dartmouth returned to requiring standardized testing scores. Students denied the efficacy of standardized tests as a measurement of ability, but rather one of class.\n\n\u201cWhen I applied, I didn\u2019t use my SAT score and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very necessary just because some people don\u2019t test as well as others,\u201d said accounting major Joselyn Wyatt. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should bring it back just because it will make it much harder to get into schools that I think students deserve to go to.\u201d\n\nA study conducted by a Harvard-based organization found that students from wealthier backgrounds score higher than those of low-income backgrounds. Students from low-income backgrounds were also significantly less likely to take a standardized test.\n\n\u201cI think that the issue between standardized testing is an issue of class,\u201d American studies major Alissa Silva said. \u201cA lot of people who have the money, their parents pay to have them study and prep,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt\u2019s really inaccessible for low-income families. So I think they should keep that in mind.\u201d\n\nStandardized tests cost $60 to register for, and there are additional costs for study materials and tutoring. The average cost of tutoring can range from $40 to $200 per hour. The registration fee is another deterrent from retaking the test in hopes of a higher score.\n\nThose are just some of the reasons USC student Jose Romo said bringing back the SAT requirement is a \u201cbad idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite known that affluent schools have more access to test prep,\u201d Romo said. \u201cFor students who go to private schools, it will be easier for them to prepare for these SATs/ACTs.\u201d\n\nMandatory standardized test scores will continue to be researched and debated amongst scholars and students alike. This is USC\u2019s fourth year piloting a test optional admission policy. It remains to be seen how many more are to come.\n```"}

Students say they love the music, but feel that the Recording Academy doesn\u2019t always get it right. This year\u2019s Grammys brought in more than 17 million viewers, ranking 5th lowest in viewership of the program ever, a statistic all the more surprising when you account for the fact that this year\u2019s grammys had a near 5 million viewer increase from the previous year. Despite ranking 5th lowest of all time in viewership, many USC students tuned in to watch the musical awards show.\n\n\u201cI thought this was the best award show there has been in a while,\u201d said Savannah Biscoe, a sophomore Acting major. \u201cThe only thing is that it\u2019s crazy that Beyonce hasn\u2019t won album of the year.\u201d Biscoe seemed to share an attitude echoed by other USC students who watched the Grammys \u2014 that the desire for a show which celebrates popular music and culture can sometimes feel undermined by sentiments of exclusion.\n\n\u201cObviously as a person of color, I typically root for Black artists and Black music to take home the hardware\u201d said Joshua Wilson, a senior popular music major at USC. \u201cSometimes the cards fall in your favor and other times they don\u2019t.\u201d In the Grammy\u2019s 60-year history there have been only 10 Black artists who have won the show\u2019s highest honor, Album of the Year. The artists include Stevie Wonder, who won the award three times in 1994, 1975 and 1977; Michael Jackson in 1984; and Whitney Houston in 1994.\n\nAccording to Vox, Beyonc\u00e9 and other artists of color being underrepresented in the Album of the Year category may speak to a much deeper problem around representation and race. \u201cI love my girl [Taylor Swift], but I don\u2019t think she deserves to win album of the year. I think Beyonce should have won,\u201d said Kalalapa Winter, a sophomore BFA Acting major. \u201cIt was an amazing year for women winning because they dominated, but at the same time caring enough specifically about Black women and women of color hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\nThe winners of the Grammy awards are decided by the Recording Academy\u2019s voting members. According to IMDiversity, the block of members consists of Grammy winners and those endorsed by another voting member. But the legitimacy and fairness of these voting committees came under fire in 2018 when a Diversity and Inclusion task force found the voting members of the nomination category were 74% male, according to the LA Times. The Grammy Awards said the goal of the task force was to address the addition of more women and people of color into the Recording Academy\u2019s group of voting members.\n\nSince then, the Recording Academy has created committees to review nominations by category which, according to Rolling Stone, are notably secretive with their review process. Some categories were denied specific review committees, such as the rap category. It was historically dominated by Black musicians and did not get a designated review committee until late 2018 according to APNews. The historic lack of diversity and secrecy around the practice of Recording Academy committees may have catalyzed the belief shared by multiple students on campus that some musicians are being snubbed.\n\n\u201cI think people forget the Grammys aren\u2019t a popularity contest, but rather a show that is meant to represent the best bodies of work in music,\u201d Wilson said.\n```"}

Especially, if there\u2019s an emergency at night since everything in the Village closes at 10,\u201d senior Brandi Blair said. \u201cIt\u2019s also at a cheaper cost to students than CVS or Target.\u201d\n\nStaff at USC Pharmacies will be responsible for the contents of the machine, according to the Mann school. These vending machines contain the overdose-reversing drug Narcan, a product that health officials are urging the public to keep on hand in case they encounter somebody experiencing an overdose. They accept Apple and Google Pay, along with other major contactless card payments, and are offered through a partnership from USC Pharmacies and USC Student Health.\n\n\u201cAt USC Pharmacy, we\u2019re always looking for new ways to improve and expand access to health care,\u201d said Raffi Svadjian, the executive director of community pharmacies at USC.\n\nMembers of the USG heavily pushed for the machines to sell emergency contraceptive pills. The USG and USC Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences co-funded the cost of the drug, selling it for a fraction of the retail price, according to chief campus health officer Sarah Van Orman. According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s website, the average emergency contraception pill costs anywhere from $10 to $50. USC\u2019s machines sell them for $5.\n\n\u201cWith the changing landscape of reproductive health, we wanted to make sure students had easy access to pregnancy prevention,\u201d USG Vice President Michelle Lu said.\n\nJakatdar believes students have found the Village vending machine useful. \u201cAfter the first week of the Village launch, there were over 120 people using it,\u201d Jakatdar said. \u201cAnd we hadn\u2019t even advertised it yet.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the USG and USC Student Health co-funded the cost of emergency contraceptive pills. The USG and USC Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences co-funded the cost of the drug. This was corrected on February 12, 2024.\n```"}

Fertitta Hall spotlighted unique perspectives at Wednesday\u2019s panel on \u201cReligion in the Workplace,\u201d bringing in four guest speakers of different religions who discussed the challenges they face in the professional world.\n\nThe panel, hosted by the Widtsoe Foundation, the Marshall School of Business and the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life, featured speakers from the Sikh, Mormon, Muslim, Jewish and Buddhist communities, including USC alums.\n\nAndrew Nelson, a USC Marshall graduate who works in Real Estate Development for his Orange County-based company, Red Oak Investments, practices Mormonism. He spoke about the importance of being proud of his faith and not being afraid to tell his clients that he believes in God. He also spoke on his positive experience as a member of an Orange County interfaith network.\n\nThe group, which emphasized bringing religious values into the workplace, has ten different religions represented on its board. \u201cI can see the good in [people of other faiths], and they can see the good in me,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nJasdeep Singh Mann, of the Sikh community, is another USC graduate and panel member. During the conversation, he emphasized the importance of educating people about minority religions and how it can benefit the workplace. \u201cIn America, we are Muslim,\u201d Singh Mann said of the ignorance about Sikhism in the United States, leading some to perceive Sikhs as Muslims. \u201cDon\u2019t keep yourself from engaging someone you don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\nHe expressed his desire for schools to teach about Sikhism and other religions to prevent future workplace issues.\n\nZach Ritter, a lecturer at UCLA, was a Jewish speaker on the panel. Ritter is a descendant of grandparents who were Auschwitz survivors and parents who were born in a refugee camp in Bavaria, Germany. Ritter is also part of NewGround, a Muslim-Jewish Partnership for Change that aims to create a national model for healthy relations and social change among American Muslims and Jews.\n\n\u201cJust because you are for one racial-ethnic faith group does not mean that you hate some other racial-ethnic group,\u201d he said.\n\nMarium Mohiuddin was a Muslim speaker on the panel and is part of the NewGround initiative. Mohiuddin comes from a conservative Muslim family and used to work as a journalist at the Austin American-Statesman but has transitioned her career into communications and marketing.\n\nBased on her professional experience, Mohiuddin\u2019s biggest wish is for more people to talk about religion and debunk common stereotypes. She also wants accommodations for those who practice, such as prayer rooms and days off.\n\nTonii Brady is a USC professor who attended the panel as an audience member. Brady said she believed this panel was essential in her teaching as she teaches a class on organizational behavior and leadership.\n\nProfessor Brady\u2019s greatest takeaway was \u201cto learn to be more open and not to be afraid to approach people, to ask them any questions that you might have about their religion, versus shying away from it.\u201d\n\nAnother audience member, Trinity Lee, is a senior with a double major in art history and law, history and culture, and is also involved with the Religious Center and is a Christian.\n\n\u201cWe can be fearful that having conversations about other faiths or learning about different religions or reading different books and scriptures will kind of make us less devout to our faith,\u201d she said regarding her takeaways from the panel. \u201cBut in reality, it\u2019s only helping us to grow in our own faith and helping us to grow as citizens of the world.\u201d```"}

Here\u2019s how it was made.\n\nWallis Annenberg Hall's iconic media wall. (Photo by Stephen Knobel)\n\nBy Stephen Knobel\nFebruary 07, 2024 at 3:34 pm PST\n\nWhen students, faculty and staff walk into Wallis Annenberg Hall, they are greeted with a 31-by-16-foot LED media wall complete with a mosaic of newscasts, rolling X feeds and Annenberg-related news. The media wall, and heartbeat of Wallis Annenberg Hall, has a $600,00 price tag. Whether you work in the Media Center on the first floor or study on the fourth floor, the wall catches your attention.\n\nToday, \u2018studying at Annenberg\u2019 is a phrase that USC students know refers to Wallis Annenberg Hall, but just ten years ago, the Hall didn\u2019t exist. Back in 2008, \u201cthe school was going through exponential growth. We began to look at what makes sense for the future of the school in terms of programming, facilities and demands for creating additional student opportunities,\u201d said James Vasquez, USC Annenberg\u2019s Associate Dean of Operations.\n\nWhile the conceptual development for the building began in 2008, the project took off in 2010 when USC received a $50 million grant from the Annenberg Foundation, Wallis Annenberg and the Annenberg family, according to Vasquez.\n\nThe main inspiration for the building\u2019s forum was the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University. \u201cIt\u2019s a tall open atrium space that has seating on multiple levels that can look down on events. But the great thing about it is that it\u2019s a multi-purpose space,\u201d said Brent Miller, Managing Principal at HED, an architecture firm responsible for Wallis Annenberg Hall\u2019s design.\n\nWhile it was still open and operating, architects, Annenberg faculty members and staff also toured the Newseum in Washington, DC. \u201cWhen you walk into the Newseum, they had a two-story video wall, but it\u2019s really more of a projection screen,\u201d said Vasquez, \u201cWe walked into there, and we said, we want that somewhere.\u201d\n\nWallis Annenberg Hall, and the forum in particular, was built on the principles of versatility and innovation, according to Miller. The forum gives Annenberg \u201cthe flexibility to do these programs that I think make Annenberg unique, where they bring in speakers for students, faculty and staff to really get engaged,\u201d said Miller. \u201cThat was a lot of the impetus behind the way we designed the forum and specifically with the media wall that\u2019s behind it, because it is ultimately a flexible component that lets you do lots of things.\u201d\n\nMany know the media wall for its wide array of content, but when Wallis Annenberg Hall opened in September 2014, the wall displayed a picture collage, according to USC Annenberg\u2019s former director of media technologies Charles \u2018Chuck\u2019 Boyles. \u201cYou want to grab people\u2019s attention. You want to give them something visual to look at,\u201d said Boyles. \u201cThe original display system that we had for the wall was very static, and I wanted some movement. So I really pushed for something new about a year or so after.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Boyles, in collaboration with Vasquez and USC Annenberg, upgraded the wall with the purchase of a Christie Spyder, a multi-window processor. The spyder allowed Boyles to create the screen we see today with what he calls a \u201csocial media waterfall\u201d on the left side of the screen, a news broadcast that changes channels on the bottom of the screen and Annenberg-related information at the top. The spyder also allows for the display of live content and events.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest events I recall supporting in that environment was the first Clinton-Trump debate. I mean, that place was a zoo. It was beyond capacity, and the energy in the room was overwhelming,\u201d he said.\n\nViewers watch the 2016 presidential debate in Wallis Annenberg Hall. (Photo courtesy of Charles \u2018Chuck\u2019 Boyles)\n\nThe media wall at Wallis Annenberg Hall represents the power of information and technology, but it is also meant to support the journalistic work completed in the building each day, according to Boyles. \u201cGetting the Media Center content up on that wall was always a priority: to showcase and help expose others to the great work that\u2019s being done in the Media Center,\u201d said Boyles.\n```"}

One of the trio, 32-year-old Yannick Hanfmann, played on a doubles team for Germany that made it to the semifinal of the Grand Slam event. Hanfmann graduated from USC in 2015 with a B.A. in international relations, achieved a career-high ATP singles ranking of No.45 last year and made it to the Australian Open\u2019s doubles semi-finals last month. \u201cIt was quite nice,\u201d Hanfmann said. \u201cWe got this momentum going and then all of a sudden we\u2019re in the semifinals.\u201d\n\nSabrina Santamaria and Giuliana Olmos also played in the Grand Slam event, one of four worldwide tennis championships that invite only the world\u2019s highest-ranked players to compete. Santamaria graduated from USC in 2015 with a B.A. in international relations. She represented the United States in doubles play at the Grand Slam event. Olmos, who graduated in 2016, also has a B.A. in international relations from USC and represented Mexico this year in the open, playing both doubles and mixed doubles. She reached her doubles career high of world No. 6 in April 2023.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a beautiful, meaningful college degree without any student debt,\u201d said former USC women\u2019s tennis coach and current Cal State LA coach Richard Gallien. \u201cThey\u2019re traveling the world, playing the Australian Open, doing these marvelous things, and having a blast doing it. I mean, it\u2019s just a home run.\u201d\n\nOlmos credited her professional success to the USC tennis program, saying in an interview that her USC coaches taught her to act and train like a professional player early on rather than waiting until she was on the professional tour. Santamaria feels the same way. \u201c[USC Tennis] really helped my mental toughness,\u201d Santamaria said. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped me become more independent.\u201d\n\nHanfmann, who primarily played singles, credits USC for encouraging him to develop his skills in doubles. \u201cUSC was the first time I played doubles in my life,\u201d Hanfmann said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m a good doubles player.\u201d\n\nHanfmann, Olmos and Santamaria competed for the USC tennis team simultaneously and now enjoy each other\u2019s company on the tour. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see our old teammates,\u201d Olmos said. \u201cIf we see each other on tour, we still cheer for each other.\u201d\n\nIn the first round of the Open, Hanfmann beat Ben Shelton and Chris Eubanks, the iconic American duo. His team continued to excel, defeating the No. 4 seeded doubles team in the tournament\u2019s third round, followed by the No. 7 seeded team in the quarter-finals. However, he eventually lost to an all-Italian team in the semi-finals in a competitive third-set tiebreaker.\n\n\u201cYannick is such an incredible athlete, one of the better athletes I ever coached,\u201d said former USC tennis coach Peter Smith. \u201cHe was never afraid of a moment. You know, when we won the NCAAs in 2014, he was down match point in the semis, and he hit a winner on it in very difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nOlmos competed in the Open this year for the fourth time, qualifying for a tournament that only invites the top-104-ranked tennis players without needing to qualify. She also made it to the doubles quarterfinals in 2021. Santamaria played in the tournament for the sixth time.\n\n\u201cThe Grand Slams are the ultimate test in tennis. It\u2019s the Super Bowl. It\u2019s the World Series, you know, it\u2019s the NBA finals,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cWe always try to get together for lunch or dinner,\u201d said Santamaria. \u201cIt kind of feels like we\u2019re back in college sometimes together.\u201d\n\nOlmos also spent time with Hanfmann outside of tennis at USC, where they would help each other with homework. \u201cI took German language, so [Hanfmann] used to tutor me in German,\u201d said Olmos. \" It\u2019s really nice seeing him on tour still.\u201d\n\nHanfnamm also enjoyed spending his time outside of tennis at the Coliseum. \u201cI love watching America\u2019s football,\u201d he said. \u201cI never missed a home game.\u201d\n\nOlmos and Smith gave the same advice to current college athletes looking to enter the professional world. \u201cThis is the most fun I think you\u2019ll ever have in school,\u201d Olmos said. \u201cEnjoy that and just try and learn as much as you can from every match.\u201d\n\n\u201cUSC is just a step in their path to getting their greatness,\u201d Smith said.\n```"}

(Photo by Micah Chow)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nFebruary 07, 2024 at 8:50 am PST\n\n\u201cSimonds Says\u201d is a column by Will Simonds, in which he shares his thoughts on sports at USC and beyond.\n\nThursday\u2019s loss to Oregon might have felt like rock bottom for USC men\u2019s basketball. It marked a sixth consecutive loss for the Trojans, who have been straight-up bad this season \u2014 there\u2019s no denying that. The Trojans were picked second in the Pac-12 preseason media poll, not far behind Arizona. It made sense; USC seemed to head into this season with one of its most talented rosters on paper in recent history, if not ever.\n\nIt\u2019s rare that USC fans will look forward to basketball season to make up for the disappointment of Trojans football. There\u2019s a reason for that \u2014 we\u2019ll get to it later.\n\nIn particular, a backcourt of fifth-year Boogie Ellis, freshman Isaiah Collier and junior Kobe Johnson projected as perhaps the best guard trio in the nation. USC also had potential in the frontcourt, with sophomore forward Vince Iwuchukwu getting a full offseason under his belt and the addition of graduate transfer DJ Rodman.\n\nBut the Trojans haven\u2019t lived up to that billing. In fact, they\u2019ve fallen way beneath the floor anyone expected for this squad. That is often a sign of shortcomings in a coaching staff, as seemingly no USC players have played up to their full potential this season.\n\nIn particular, USC struggles with rebounding, turnovers and free throw shooting \u2014 those are often signs of poor coaching as well. So, it\u2019s no surprise that head coach Andy Enfield\u2019s job security has become a topic of discussion as of late, especially given that recent six-game drought.\n\nA win Saturday at home over Oregon State was finally a light at the end of the tunnel, though USC still sits at just 9-13 overall and tied for last in the conference.\n\nAfter that previous defeat to Oregon, Enfield expressed some clear frustration with his current roster. In his complaints about the Trojans\u2019 effort and rebounding, he seemed to reminisce on the days of Onyeka Okongwu and the Mobley brothers, other top recruits brought in by Enfield that have since moved on to the pros.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the rare times I can remember the Trojans\u2019 coach putting blame on his players during my four years at USC, and it came across as if Enfield realized his seat was beginning to warm up.\n\nGiven his squad\u2019s underperformance, that development would typically make sense at most programs. However, Enfield does have one very easy excuse for his team\u2019s issues that he can\u2019t control, and one that he\u2019s referenced much of the season \u2014 player availability.\n\nCollier has been out for several weeks with a fractured hand, Ellis missed three games during USC\u2019s losing streak with a hamstring injury and redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan still doesn\u2019t seem to be at 100% after a bad illness. Only sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers has played in all 22 of the Trojans\u2019 contests.\n\nBut that won\u2019t be the reason Enfield keeps his job. After all, coaches, both in college and the pros, get fired all the time despite overseeing banged-up rosters. I\u2019m not sure USC would be in much better shape this season at full health, anyways.\n\nStill, there are several other reasons why Enfield won\u2019t be going anywhere anytime soon. First, credit has to be given where credit is due. Enfield is pretty comfortably the best coach in program history. He boasts a .601 winning percentage, five NCAA tournament appearances and one of USC\u2019s meager two Elite Eight trips in the last 70 years.\n\nThis is an impressive body of work for a program without a rich basketball history, even with his current struggles. Enfield\u2019s success primarily comes from his proven track record as a recruiter, which shouldn\u2019t be ignored either. Although his No. 3-ranked freshman class this season hasn\u2019t quite lived up to expectations, Enfield has another top-15 class for 2024.\n\nPeople have shown up to watch Collier and freshman guard Bronny James all season even with the Trojans\u2019 dismal performances. The NBA success of Okongwu and Evan Mobley should allow Enfield to keep attracting blue-chip players to Galen Center.\n\nIt\u2019s also a turbulent period at USC. New athletic director Jennifer Cohen has not even held her position for six full months. The university is currently embarking on massive renovations for various athletic facilities. Oh, and I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve heard by now, but the Trojans are off to a whole new conference this summer!\n\nThis just doesn\u2019t feel like the time for more chaos within a USC athletic department that could probably really use some stability at the moment. On a related note, Enfield\u2019s contract has him signed through the 2027-28 season. USC would likely have to pay a fairly significant buyout to part ways with Enfield anytime soon, and the university is focused on other big-money projects at the moment.\n\nI already mentioned the ongoing construction around campus, and in the current age of lawless Name, Image and Likeness deals, the Trojans are surely dishing out tons of cash to players in order to keep them in Los Angeles.\n\nAll of that leads to a larger point about USC men\u2019s basketball as a whole. How much does the university really care about having an elite program? CBS Sports college basketball insider Jon Rothstein has recently dubbed the Trojans as \u201cmore than a football school.\u201d But, let\u2019s be real. USC is a football school, through and through.\n\nBased in the heart of Los Angeles, this university could have built a better basketball program by now if it really wanted to do so \u2014 or could. It\u2019s very difficult to win in both sports at the college level at the same time; there\u2019s a reason none of the basketball \u201cblue bloods\u201d have much of a college football history, and vice versa for college football\u2019s current powers.\n\nSure, Florida won multiple titles in both sports in the mid-2000s, but that\u2019s more of an outlier than a trend. The USC administration is content to have a \u201cfine\u201d basketball program, one that makes the tournament more often than not with the occasional deep run, if that means it can field a successful football team.\n\nBesides, the move to the Big Ten was made to benefit the football program (it won\u2019t help the basketball teams). Most of USC\u2019s athletic budget goes to the squad at the Coliseum, not those at Galen Center or anywhere else.\n\nAnd, if people are still going to line up around the block several hours early to watch 8-11 USC host 8-11 UCLA, is there really a ton of motivation to make a big change at the helm? I\u2019m certainly not convinced.\n\nSo if you\u2019re dissatisfied with Enfield\u2019s capability to lead USC men\u2019s basketball to greener pastures, put down your pitchforks. A new face in the role might seem appetizing, but expect more of the same for the time being.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Sundance Institute)\n\nBy Taryn Snyder\nFebruary 06, 2024 at 11:24 pm PST\n\nThis year\u2019s Sundance brought a slew of musical documentaries featuring some of the industry\u2019s great visionaries. \u201cThe Greatest Night in Pop\u201d pulled back the curtain on one of the most famous nights in music history. On January 28, 1985, everyone from Harry Belafonte to Stevie Wonder to Paul Simon and more came together in one room to create \u201cWe Are the World\u201d in aid to famine relief in Ethiopia. The orchestrator of the original evening, Lionel Richie, narrates the story alongside interviews with artists Bruce Springsteen, Huey Lewis, Dione Warwick, Sheila E. and Cyndi Lauper. Richie details the pure chaos he and Michael Jackson experienced in pulling off this pure miracle recording session on the night of the AMAs. It is an unbelievable sight to see some of music\u2019s greatest legends standing in a circle singing together. Audiences are privy to a view of artists disarmed without their posse and publicists at hand. Even stars like Bob Dylan shifted uncomfortably in a room of this magnitude. At the end of the session, Diana Ross fittingly cried \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be over,\u201d as this tremendous evening and our view into it ends all too quickly. However, for re-watching or first-time viewing the documentary is now available on Netflix\n\nMoving to the intrigue of an individual artist, \u201cEno\u201d tells the career-spanning story of Brian Eno, the ambient music pioneer and producer for the likes of David Bowie and Talking Head. However, this is not fashioned as your traditional music-doc. In the press release, director Gary Hustwitz explained, \" I kept asking myself, why does my film have to be the same every time it\u2019s shown?\u201d He hoped the film could be more like a concert which is unreplicatable night after night. To combine the uniquely communal experience of live performance with the film medium, \u201cEno\u201d goes through AI generative software \u2013 meaning it makes completely new versions of the film for each screening. With endless variations on Eno\u2019s archival footage and recent interviews, it\u2019s hard to tell future viewers what to expect from their watch. In the film\u2019s second showing, he detailed his first inspiration from playing with tape records in art school to \u201cSilence: Lectures and Writing\u201d by John Cage. He later describes his reconciliations with his dichotomy: the intellectual and rock-and-roll. The child who loves playing and the critic who always finds something wrong with it. Whichever part of \u201cEno\u201d viewers may get a glimpse of, it is certain to be peppered with the artist\u2019s words of wisdom. After a lifetime as a creative in various mediums, Eno explains art to be about feeling and feeling as the beginning of thought. Between all his profoundness you still capture endearing moments as Eno yells at the ads on YouTube to \u2018Shut up!\u2019 Amidst it all, he leaves the audience with the simple yet endlessly begging question of \u201cwhy do we like music?\u201d\n\nIn another artist-centered doc, \u201cDEVO\u201d delves into the name-sake band through a mix of archival footage, captured live performances, and the artists\u2019 retellings of their journey. Through this medley, the film shows the group through both the lenses of their musical stardom and commitment to social commentary. \u201cLOLLA: THE STORY OF LOLLAPALOOZA\u201d dives into exactly what its title suggests - the summer of \u201891 when the famous festival first began out of the farewell tour for \u201cJane\u2019s Addiction.\u201d To celebrate the release of this episodic piece, the lead singer of \u201cJane\u2019s Addiction,\u201d Perry Farrell, attended. Alongside films, the Sundance festivities were music-filled from the ASCAP Music Caf\u00e9 hosted at Acura House to shows at Park City\u2019s new venue The Marquis. The three-level Marquis allowed for up to 1200 festival-goers to enjoy the sounds of Leon Bridges to Odesza during their first weekend of the festivities.\n```"}

After dropping their game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, LA  finished the trip 4-0  in their final four games, taking down the Wizards, Pistons and Heat before beating Atlanta. The Clippers\u2019 X-factor in those games? It was undoubtedly Kawhi Leonard. Recently named the Western Conference Player of the Month , Leonard has averaged over 31 points per game over the Clippers\u2019 last three outings. His strongest offensive performance came Monday night against the Hawks, where he scored 36 points while shooting 65% from the field. Leonard was also named to the Western Conference\u2019s All-Star team along with teammate Paul George, a testament to not just his performances, but also his consistency and durability so far this season. Playing in 44 of the Clippers\u2019 49 games so far this year, Leonard leads the team in scoring with 24.2 points per game in addition to 6.4 rebounds per contest. Beyond statistics, Leonard has also risen to become a team leader. After the Clippers\u2019 136-125 win against the Pistons on Friday, he set the expectations for him and his teammates when asked where the team could improve. \u201cIt\u2019s between our ears. Tonight, we were terrible on our defensive game,\u201d said Leonard, per Tomer Azarly at ClutchPoints. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been running our games off of talent, even our offensive game. It\u2019s a lot of slow pace, and it starts with our defense. We have to see who we want to be and start setting goals for ourselves.\u201d When they\u2019re firing, though, it\u2019s pretty clear who the Clippers are: an experienced and deep squad that can hurt opponents in multiple ways. In their wins against the Pistons and Heat, the Clippers found themselves down double-digits early and struggled to find the basket, but managed to comeback nonetheless. As their road trip went on and fatigue became a greater influence, the Clippers needed their bench to step up and provide the energy necessary to win. And it did just that. In Detroit, James Harden managed only 4 points and 6 assists on the night, numbers that are well below his averages. However, the Clippers\u2019 bench provided a much needed lift, especially via Russell Westbrook, who scored 23 points. Head coach Tyronn Lue discussed Westbrook\u2019s performance after the game. \u201cWhen we\u2019re not starting games well, we don\u2019t have that energy, he brings it every single game,\u201d Lue said. \u201cHe\u2019s saved at least five or six just with his energy, playing hard, competing, getting out in transition, making easy plays. It says a lot about the work he\u2019s put in and his career.\u201d After defeating the Pistons, LA traveled to Miami and battled the Heat in an ugly 103-95 win. The Clippers shot the ball poorly in this contest at just over 44% from the field, but performed much better on the defensive end. The Heat\u2019s 95 points were the fewest scored by an opponent over the  road trip, a sign that defense has become a priority, as Lue also stated. \u201cI thought addressing it before the game, just talking about having that defensive mindset and not letting our guards down, and trying to get out to a good start defensively,\u201d said Lue when asked about how the Clippers held the Heat to under 100 points. \u201cAnd I credit our guys for doing that, locking in, understanding the game plan on how we wanted to play, and they did a good job overall.\u201d The Clippers\u2019 149-144 win against the Hawks the following night was the trip\u2019s highest-scoring affair, with multiple players from both sides scoring 20 or more. The Clippers faced off against the Eastern Conference\u2019s Player of the Month in Trae Young, but with Harden\u2019s 30 points and a team-high 10 assists, the Hawks couldn\u2019t keep up. While Leonard and George receive much of the Clippers fans\u2019 praise, their star guard has made a significant impact since his first game as a Clipper in early November. Lue feels the same way, as he noted when asked about George and Leonard\u2019s All-Star selections. \u201cIt all wouldn\u2019t have happened without [Harden],\u201d said Lue. \u201cHarden has been huge for our team, him coming here and becoming a traditional point guard who can get guys involved but also can score the basketball. [Harden] has played a big part, a huge part of where we\u2019re at today. Just happy to have him and he\u2019s one of our All-Stars as well.\u201d Now, the Clippers look ahead to a three-game home stint against the Pelicans, Pistons and Timberwolves. The matchup against the Timberwolves could determine who takes Western Conference\u2019s second seed, behind only the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n```"}

Before the trip, some thought the Lakers could be deadline sellers because of their place in the standings and limited draft picks, but now they\u2019ve re-solidified themselves as buyers to make a second-half playoff run.\n\nIn addition to the wild double-overtime victory over the Golden State Warriors on just the first game of their slate of away games, the Lakers grinded out a victory over their heated rivals in the Boston Celtics without LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Plus, the Lake Show snatched a win in Madison Square Garden \u2014 long known as one of James\u2019 favorite road arenas \u2014 over the scorching-hot Knicks, who themselves went 14-2 in January, and trashed the Charlotte Hornets on Monday.\n\nWith all the pre-deadline trade chatter swarming the Lakers right now, it\u2019s a great sign that the current squad has maintained the mental fortitude to block the rumors out and secure wins over playoff-caliber teams like the Warriors, Celtics and Knicks. Now, they\u2019ll try to do the same against the defending NBA champions Denver Nuggets on Thursday \u2014 the same day as the trade deadline.\n\nCould the Lakers roster be different by the time they face the Nuggets? Perhaps, but with the way they\u2019re playing right now, it\u2019s hard to see general manager Rob Pelinka making any drastic moves, like trading for Zach LaVine or even moving James, as has been rumored. In the meantime, the Lakers will try to figure out how to break through Denver\u2019s defense. The Nuggets have the fourth-best defense in average points per game allowed to opponents and have been the Lakers\u2019 Kryptonite recently.\n\nThis could be the chance for the Lakers to take them down on home soil and earn some revenge for the 2022-23 Western Conference Finals, where the Nuggets toppled the Lakers in a sweep. If recent form tells us anything, the Lakers have a strong chance to win. D\u2019Angelo Russell averaged over 22 points per game in January, James had a triple-double in the Lakers\u2019 first road victory against the Warriors, Davis just finished with his third triple-double on Monday and Austin Reaves dropped 32 points in an underdog victory against the Celtics, the East\u2019s best team.\n\nBy the time the Lakers take on the Nuggets Thursday night, the trade deadline will have passed and the team can focus on playing basketball from there on out. To escape with a victory, the Lakers will have to focus on slowing down Denver\u2019s perennial MVP-candidate in Nikola Jokic. In the playoffs, they deployed multiple different defenders on him, including Davis and Jarred Vanderbilt. After Vanderbilt could miss the rest of the season with a sprained foot, according to reports, maybe Lakers head coach Darvin Ham should employ Jaxon Hayes to help out Davis. Hayes played two great games against the Celtics and Knicks, dropping a double-double in Boston and 10 points in 13 minutes in New York. He\u2019ll be key to trying to stop Jokic as much as they can.\n\nThis matchup against the Nuggets is just one game in a long regular season, but playing against one of the Western Conference\u2019s better teams could show the Lakers if they made sufficient progress on their road trip. They have winning momentum to carry from their Grammy\u2019s trip into the All-Star break to better position themselves to compete for a playoff spot in the second half, pending a strong result against Denver.\n```"}

Discovery CEO David Zaslav in a statement.\n\nThe service will provide broadcasting to at least 15 networks including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SEC Network (SECN), ACC Network (ACCN), ESPNEWS, ABC, FOX, FS1, FS2, Big Ten Network (BTN), TNT, TBS, truTV and ESPN+. Subscribers will be able to watch the NFL, NBA, WNBA, MLB, NASCAR, UFC, PGA Tour golf, Grand Slam Tennis, the FIFA World Cup and college sports.\n\nUSC is one of the many colleges that stands to benefit from the joint venture. Previously, USC away games were notoriously difficult to watch. Last year\u2019s Notre Dame game was nationally televised on NBC, but for other Pac-12 road games, Trojan fans could only watch via the Pac-12 network. The network is available through cable networks like Spectrum, which could run fans up to $64.99/month, or Comcast Xfinity, which requires an internet plan with TV. Satellite TV services like DISH are just as costly, and offer the Pac-12 as a $13 monthly premium in addition to their $84.99/month base fee.\n\nWith USC\u2019s departure from the Pac-12 and move to the Big Ten alongside the arrival of the joint sports streaming network, USC sports will become a lot more accessible to fans at home starting this fall. Most nationally televised Big Ten games will be included on FOX Sports, ESPN, ABC and CBS, with others available on BTN. A name and pricing scale for the platform have yet to be announced.\n```"}

But that didn\u2019t stop the performers, who went on to finish the show.\n\nStudents had the opportunity to show off their charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent at USC Queer and Ally Student Assembly\u2019s 14th annual Drag Show last Sunday. The event themed \u201cThe Freak Show\u201d featured 12 individual performances and 16 runway presentations from drag queens and kings on campus as well as a host performance from Los Angeles drag queen Lorelei. For some students, it was their first-time experience performing live for a large audience; others already had experience.\n\n\u201cSunday was the first time I had ever gotten into full drag and performed for an audience,\u201d said Sam Tarlov, aka Starlov, a double major in communication and French. \u201cI used to do theater for quite some time, and I always loved performing on a stage... so even though I might get nervous, I usually get really excited, and I just harness that nervousness to put on a better performance.\u201d\n\nIt takes a village to generate this excitement and organize the event. From coming up with act ideas, to styling their outfits, all the drag performers work together to create one show. \u201cThe purpose of the Drag Show is to really foster new queens and to allow for that communal environment in that drag family sort of vibe,\u201d said Au Chung, aka Ms. Dacity, a double major in public relations and political science. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know how to put on makeup or how to sew or make clothes, we kinda help each other out.\u201d Ms. Dacity is also running to become USG president under their drag persona.\n\nDuring intermission, the event was interrupted by the fire alarm going off, which resulted in a half an hour long intermission. Tarlov said that having to stand outside in the pouring rain was disturbing \u2014 particularly to those who had not done their performances yet. \u201cI felt fine because I had already done mine;I felt somewhat nervous and sad for my castmates because having that happen was very disruptive. During the show you\u2019re trying to get in that headspace for your performance.I would say a good percentage of the crowd came back for the rest of the performance.\u201d\n\nDespite the minor inconvenience and the downpour of rain, the show went on as planned. Seven more performances, followed by a lip sync battle between three of the top performers (Ms. Dacity, Willconique, and Nancy), occurred on the mainstage.The three performers were nominated by the audience for battle and Will Yeaman, aka Willconique, an acting major at the School of Dramatic Arts won.\n\nHalo Lyman, a junior double majoring in French and comparative literature, said that Lavinia Vaudeville\u2019s performance \u2014 which featured music from Lady Gaga \u2014 was her favorite. Saneel Sharma, a junior studying design, is the executive director of the USC Drag Show. Sharma first got involved with the USC Drag Show as a performer his freshman year. His sophomore year he served as a creative director for the show, and this year he organized and performed in the USC Drag Show.\n\nAs an organizer, Sharma says he prioritized an overall increase in production value. Sponsored by QUASA, the USC Drag Show was able to upgrade its venue and better compensate its performers. Since its founding, the show has been held in the Grand Ballroom of TCC, but this year the show was held in Bovard Auditorium. \u201cWhat I wanted to do for the Drag Show [was] to provide a venue that is worthy of the performance level,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided to elevate the show and elevate the true theatricality of the USC Drag Show and make sure that the space represented the amount of high production and high concept value [the show] deserves.\u201d\n\nWhen the fire-alarm momentarily derailed the show, Sharma says he was furious, but wanted to focus on keeping the show going. Sharma, as his drag persona Rae Oblivion, brought the night to a close with a performance inspired by the drag queens of Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race. Sharma hopes that students can take away a better understanding of what drag means. \u201cDrag to me means transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cEach performer has their own individual personality with their own individual experience. I really wanted to emphasize, every performer has a different story to tell, and I hope that each student can see that there is a different story within being a drag artist than being a performance artist in general.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Jae C. Hong for AP News)\n\nBy Zack Lara and Kim Ly\nFebruary 06, 2024 at 7:23 pm PST\n\nDisneyland\u2019s $90 million expansion project, \u201cDisneylandForward,\u201d calls for the city of Anaheim to relax its zoning rules to allow the park to develop new attractions and hotels. Current agreements between the park and city allow for specific zones to be designated for certain structures. However, Disney is requesting to choose where it will build new park areas, hotels and dining experiences within its existing 100-acre footprint. Such plans would entail Disney taking over adjacent streets including Magic Way, Hotel Way and Clementine Street.\n\nDisney expects to invest up to $2.5 billion over the next decade on this project. While the initiative does not seek to increase the existing square feet of the park, they ask for greater leniency with zoning so they can build experiences in current properties and reallocate areas for hotels, entertainment and theme parks. Without new zoning laws, DisneylandForward says that Disney\u2019s California park will never add new experiences that differ from their other parks around the world.\n\nThe site says new attractions may include areas dedicated to films like \u201cFrozen,\u201d \u201cZootopia,\u201d \u201cPeter Pan\u2019s\u201d Neverland and \u201cToy Story.\u201d While the \u2018Happiest Place on Earth\u2019 is looking to make park-goers even happier, Anaheim residents are not thrilled with Disney\u2019s proposal.\n\nA petition uploaded to change.org on Jan. 2 titled, \u201cSave Our Anaheim Streets from DisneylandForward,\u201d has recorded 258 signatures as of Feb. 6. The petition is posted under user \u201cSave Magic Way\u201d who argues that the road closures that would result from Disney\u2019s plan only benefit the company and not the residents of Anaheim.\n\n\u201cHeavier traffic impacts air quality, and further delays our own daily commutes,\u201d the poster said. \u201cMost of all, closing the streets that intersect the Resort will create an isolated, walled fortress, with Disney turning its back on the community.\u201d\n\nMany residents raised their concerns at the Anaheim City Council meeting on Jan. 23. \u201cOur city is facing a great injustice \u2013 a moral dilemma that strikes at the heart of our values,\u201d said local resident Jeanine Robbins. \u201cI present to you the case against big businesses that, despite reaping enormous profits, fail to pay their employees a living wage or provide affordable housing.\u201d\n\nRobbins accused Disney of falsely promising to build only on existing property. She says they hiding their intentions to take over public streets which locals rely on to avoid traffic caused by the park.\n\n\u201cStand with us in rejecting the crazy expansion of Disneyland in Anaheim,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cThey cannot build a Disneyworld in the middle of a residential area.\u201d\n\nTo benefit the local community and offset negative reactions, Disney looks to contribute $30 million to affordable housing. They also plan to make a 40-year commitment to expanding their workforce by hiring Anaheim residents.\n\nAnaheim is no stranger to allegations of corrupt government dealings. The 46th mayor of Anaheim, Harish \u201cHarry\u201d Singh Sidhu, resigned in 2022 after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice, wire fraud and false statements.\n\nAccording to a press release from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, Sidhu became a member of Anaheim\u2019s negotiating team for the sale of Angel Stadium to the Los Angeles Angels Major League Baseball club during his election campaign and used his position to provide the Angels confidential information. In return, Sidhu expected a $1 million donation toward his mayoral campaign from the Angels.\n\nAnaheim City Council hearings for Disney\u2019s proposed project will take place in April and May of this year.\n```"}

Students are excited for the chance to watch an international soccer tournament in their backyard this summer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super excited,\u201d said Carlos Monserrat, a senior business administration major. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to go to the games that are at SoFi, I might travel elsewhere...The players show a lot more passion playing for their countries, and I just think that\u2019s cool to see.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica will be the 48th edition of the tournament and only the second time the United States will host the tournament. The tournament will be a dry run for the World Cup for some of the host cities like Houston, Dallas and Kansas City. SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles will also host two Copa Am\u00e9rica games. Brazil will play at SoFi Stadium on June 22 against either Costa Rica or Honduras. Venezuela will also play Mexico there on June 26.\n\nThe Copa Am\u00e9rica is a soccer tournament held between national teams of the South American Football Federation, also known as CONMEBOL. However, this year\u2019s edition of the Copa Am\u00e9rica will host the 10 CONMEBOL nations and another six teams from CONCACAF, the North American soccer governing body. The 10 CONMEBOL nations automatically qualified for this summer\u2019s tournament. The United States, Jamaica, Mexico and Panama earned their spots in the cup via CONCACAF Nations League standings. Two of Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and Honduras will claim the final spots through Copa Am\u00e9rica qualification playoffs.\n\nFans will have to pay a hefty price to go to some of these games. According to StubHub, tickets for the Brazil game in Los Angeles range from around $250 to more than $20,000. As for the Venezuela and Mexico match, prices are currently listed between $300 to over $20,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be sick to actually go to a game in person, and it\u2019s cool that people will be talking about soccer,\u201d said Sophia Cabrera, a sophomore studying biomedical engineering. \u201cThe price will probably be the biggest barrier [to me going to a game].\u201d\n\nAccording to The Athletic, CONEMBOL expects to release tickets through its primary ticket distributors, Ticketmaster and SeatGeek, by the end of March. They hoped to release general admission tickets in January but experienced delays. For fans looking to buy tickets now, they will have to purchase them through third-party distributors like StubHub and VividSeats. Unfortunately for these fans, the tickets are likely to be a lot more expensive due to these resellers\u2019 fees.\n\nAttending the tournament for international fans will be expensive regardless of where they get the tickets, especially considering hotel and airfare prices. CONMEBOL is allowing fans to sign up for updates on pre-sale general public tickets on the organization\u2019s website for this summer\u2019s tournament.\n\nRegardless of if they go to the games, fans at USC said they are excited for the opportunity to see the United States play in an international tournament.\n\n\u201cI watch a lot more UEFA [European Soccer], so I don\u2019t get to see a lot of CONCACAF teams,\u201d Mark Haanschoten, a freshman studying business administration, said. \u201cIt\u2019s also nice that because the U.S. is hosting, they\u2019re going to be playing against a lot more South American countries when normally they\u2019d be playing against other Central American countries.\u201d\n```"}

The Midnight Mission shelter and resource center provides a safe haven for unhoused people in Los Angeles.\n\nBy Robert Westermann, Nora Miller, and Makena Arteaga\nFebruary 06, 2024 at 5:54 pm PST\n\nA record-breaking rainfall on Sunday has left the roughly 76,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles in distress, according to shelters across the city. The atmospheric river that has taken hold of California on Sunday has left 830,000 people without power and three people dead early this week. The downtown area saw about 4.1 inches of rain this past Sunday. Skid row, a neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles, has about 4,400 people who experience homelessness.\n\nMidnight Mission, a shelter and resource center for unhoused individuals located in the heart of the neighborhood, has seen a recent increase in the number of individuals seeking shelter from the harsh weather. Georgia Perkovich, the chief communications officer at Midnight, spoke with Annenberg Media about what the center offers to visitors.\n\n\"We\u2019re here every day. Three meals a day, every day. We have a barbershop, mail service. We have a computer lab. We have a library. We have all these services that are available to the community every day, no questions asked, at no cost, but especially at the times where it\u2019s really cold or really hot.\"\n\nIn addition to those services, Midnight offers a program called Safe Sleep, which allows those seeking shelter to spend a night as opposed to committing to a longer-term program.\n\n\"Typically we see about 30 or 40 people in Safe Sleep each night. And we are seeing, like last night, there were 122 people here.\"\n\nAnother resource center, Casa Milagrosa, has also seen an uptick in visitors since the rain began. We talked with Gabriel Partida, the communications and volunteer coordinator of the center, about how prepared centers were for the storm.\n\n\"A lot of our guests have said that they felt more informed this time that no storms passed. A lot of times, it was kind of like the days leading out. This time around, they felt like us and other centers were letting them know, made sure everyone was prepared.\"\n\nHowever, despite a higher level of preparedness, Partida said that the center\u2019s visitors still experience disruptions in their daily life because of the rain.\n\n\"We hear back from a lot of our regular guest that when it rains, it\u2019s so hard is to sleep, even if they are sheltered, because the tripping of the of the water keeps them awake because they\u2019re not able to kind of like defocus from it. So sometimes, like, even though they might be, you know, either their overpass, maybe they do have a tent, it\u2019s still a struggle for them sleeping on the streets.\"\n\nPartida also said that some of the issues unhoused individuals face during storms are largely unexpected.\n\n\"Nothing\u2019s really stable during these storms. A lot of times, there could be like quick flooding that that can just grab their stuff and move on with, and then other times, you know, we\u2019ve had plenty of guys come in and their bags have been turned though.\"\n\nForecasters from the National Weather Service\u2019s Los Angeles office expect periods of rain to continue this evening, with possible heavy rain predicted for tomorrow afternoon and evening. While the storm has been a cause of concern for many Angelenos these past few days, the severe weather has affected some communities more than others.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Amanda Murphy and Sethan Perez\nFebruary 06, 2024 at 5:52 pm PST\n\nThis weekend, the USC Thornton community had more than one reason to celebrate, as its alumni and faculty clinched over 15 Grammy awards. Nominees ranged from performers, song-writers, arrangers, posers and music industry professionals from across the school. The Grammys are the most prestigious awards within the music industry, setting a new benchmark for success and inspiring the next generation of Thornton students.\n\nLira Steiner, a junior studying music industry at Thornton, spoke to us about how it feels to be mentored by professors and alumni who are excelling in the industry.\n\nSteiner: It\u2019s great to be going to a school where, like, I can say that my professors have won Grammys. It gives me a lot more confidence in, like, what I\u2019m who I\u2019m learning from.\n\nShe noted that her classes at USC allow for unique opportunities to meet industry professionals.\n\nSteiner: I actually, tonight have a guest speaker in one of my classes. That\u2019s the attorney for, Victoria Monet. So it\u2019s just it feels really surreal to have that, like, close of a connection to people who are, like at the ceremony on TV.\n\nSteiner also shared some of the unique opportunities that she\u2019s had access to while being in Thornton.\n\nSteiner: I, through a certain alum, I was invited to like a party hosted by the Recording Academy. And it it just I didn\u2019t expect, like, that much access to that sort of world when I came here initially.\n\nLeo Mermelstein, a sophomore jazz voice and cognitive science major in Thornton, was happy to see one of his professors clinch a Grammy win this year.\n\nMermelstein: One of the winners was sage. Which one of the people in sage? It\u2019s only four people. Is Sara Gazarek. And she was my professor for 11 hours a week last year. Like, we spent so much time together. And the entire time she had just been nominated for three Grammys. And I\u2019m like, what\u2019s she gonna do now? She\u2019s won a Grammy. It\u2019s pretty groovy .\n\nProfessor Arc who teaches jazz studies at USC won the Grammy for best arrangement instruments and vocals.\n\nIn an effort to promote student musicians, student-run record label 840 West was created. Juan Razuri, co-director of artist development at 840 West and a music industry major at Thornton, gave us his insight on how his four years have prepared him to excel in the music industry.\n\nRazuri: I think the, the Thornton community is just like an amazing, bubble of, like, incredibly talented, artists, songwriters, producers, engineers, and and also incredibly talented and forward thinking, business people who will for sure be, like, taking charge of the industry as a whole later on.\n\nRazuri hopes to see his peers thrive alongside him in their respective musical journeys.\n\nRazuri: Every time I\u2019m on campus and I walk around, I can\u2019t help but feel, yeah, like the future is right here. The people who I\u2019m going to be working with for the rest of my life are here, and they\u2019re walking around me. They\u2019re in my classes, they\u2019re my friends.\n\nHe now thinks success is more achievable than ever as he wraps up his final year of school and reflects on all of his accomplishments.\n\nRazuri: It isn\u2019t impossible that it isn\u2019t like some crazy far out dream anymore, you know, to, to be involved with the Grammys, to even one day people from Thornton, people, they look up to all of us, like they even possibly get a Grammy. Like, that\u2019s crazy. But it doesn\u2019t feel impossible anymore. It feels slightly more in reach.\n\nAs the echoes of USC Thornton\u2019s Grammy triumphs resonate through its halls, it sheds light on its great program and opportunities.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode of Annenberg Media)\n\nBy Nathan Elias and Zack Lara\nFebruary 06, 2024 at 5:30 pm PST\n\nAt least 11 campus buildings flooded with rainwater as a historic rainstorm soaked USC for the third day in a row. The damage continues to cause class cancellations and closures across campus. As of Monday, USC Facilities and Planning Management said they received 216 rain-related calls across both campuses. USC deployed maintenance crews to make repairs as quickly as possible.\n\nAccording to USC Facilities and Planning Management, 11 buildings require extensive drying and repairs for walls, ceilings and floorings. Affected UPC buildings include: Bridge Memorial Hall; the Physical Education building; Hoffman Hall of Business Administration; Kaprielian Hall; Denney Research Center; Alice and Eleonore Schoenfeld Symphonic Hall; Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Hydrocarbon Institute; Allan Hancock Foundation Building; Marks Tennis Stadium and Taper Hall of Humanities. One Health Sciences Campus building, the Soto Street Building Annex, was also impacted.\n\nMusic Operations Director Marvin Munson said several Thornton classrooms suffered water damage Monday morning that rendered them unusable. Classes in the affected rooms were rescheduled for Zoom. Munson said this rainfall is pushing the limits of old infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt shows the flaws in buildings that haven\u2019t had a lot of rain in a while, especially when they are getting older,\u201d Munson said.\n\nOn Monday, USC reported severe power-related damages to the Andros Gerontology Center. Water entered the electrical room, disabling electrical panels for the entire building. A maintenance crew restored power the same afternoon, but other buildings continued to flood, according to Facilities and Planning Management.\n\nAlmira Shardarbekova, a senior majoring in music industry, discovered her class was canceled after driving to campus and braving a 15-minute walk.\n\n\u201cI had to make my way out in the rain only to find out the classroom was locked,\u201d Shardarbekova said. \u201cBut I definitely prefer it being on Zoom while it\u2019s raining because I have to make a transit here.\u201d\n\nShardarbekova witnessed flooding in the Roski School of Art and Design. In addition to slippery floors, sinks and water utilities appeared to stop working.\n\n\u201cThe infrastructure is underprepared for rain,\u201d Shardarbekova said. \u201cThis is by no means intense.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Shardarbekova said she had to carry heavy gear and electrical equipment over slippery floors, which proved dangerous with indoor water intrusions and poor drainage outdoors.\n\nMany USC buildings were built in the 1970s and 1980s, including the music complex which flooded and caused closures for the second year in a row.\n\n\u201cIt has rained so little that a lot of the infrastructure that\u2019s supposed to divert all that rainwater has not been tested,\u201d Munson said. \u201cHopefully, the university can get it all fixed.\u201d\n\nIn addition to education buildings, New North Residential Hall experienced light flooding in its stairwells. During heavy rains last year, water damage in Birnkrant Residential Hall caused part of the roof to collapse.\n\nUSC announced no operational changes on Sunday despite the declaration of a state of emergency by the city of Los Angeles. According to NBC News, the atmospheric river is now responsible for the death of at least three people in California in addition to road closures, power outages and incessant flooding.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode of Annenberg Media)\n\nBy Keira McNamara and Malieya Pittman\nFebruary 06, 2024 at 4:20 pm PST\n\nThe storm that\u2019s been pummeling Southern California has led to city-wide road closures, flooding, traffic collisions and other adverse effects in the greater Los Angeles area, causing some USC students to miss class. On Sunday, Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency for eight counties in Southern California. The next day, Mayor Karen Bass signed a declaration of a local emergency due to the severe weather conditions. This prompted President Joe Biden to call Mayor Bass, offering additional resources to remedy the negative effects of the storm.\n\n\u201cWe will get any help on the way as soon as you guys request it,\u201d Biden said.\n\nOver the past two days, downtown L.A. has received roughly half of its 30-year average seasonal rainfall. This has resulted in additional road closures, significant damages caused by mudslides and drops in student attendance. LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said that on Monday student attendance dropped to 63% while 90% of district teachers, bus drivers and classified employees reported for work.\n\nUSC students have also faced additional troubles getting to class due to the storm. Freshman psychology student C.J. Punzalun said the attendance dropped in his classes on Monday.\n\n\u201cI have a Japanese 3 class...I think like 25% of the class showed up, even though...in-person class was scheduled,\u201d Punzalun said. \u201cMy two other classes were online or asynchronous, and the only other class that stayed in person besides Japanese was stats. I think about 75% still showed up...so attendance definitely took a bit of a hit.\u201d\n\nSome professors changed classes to an online format to accommodate students and ensure safety. Similar to the students in Punzalun\u2019s Japanese class, senior environmental studies major Emily Peng did not attend her 8 a.m. Monday morning. When asked what her reasoning behind skipping was, Peng said the weather was too severe to walk to class even though she lives near campus.\n\n\u201cWell, at 8 a.m...I didn\u2019t think it was worth the trouble of going there with the rain,\u201d Peng said.\n\nJunior business administration major Cindy Nguyen also noticed a significant decline in attendance during one of her 8 a.m. classes on Monday.\n\n\u201cI went to one of my 8 a.m. [classes], granted it is an 8 a.m. so some people can be absent,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI think only about like a third of the class was there.\u201d\n\nNguyen also shared that she skipped a class for the first time this semester, citing the storm as her reasoning.\n\n\u201cThe weather condition was kind of bad and I didn\u2019t want to place myself in that type of circumstance,\u201d Nguyen said.\n\nThe rain is forecasted to come to a stop by Thursday, according to a forecast from the National Weather Service. The university has not announced any changes for students attending in-person classes.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\nBy Marco Haynes\nFebruary 06, 2024 at 3:24 pm PST\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s three most consequential results.\n\nArsenal 3-1 Liverpool\nEveryone had their eyes on this top-of-the-table clash, as third-place Arsenal faced first-place Liverpool. Arsenal\u2019s statement victory reaffirmed the club\u2019s status as title challengers and put pressure on the Reds, whose lead at the top has closed to two points with Manchester City yet to play.\n\nThe Gunners looked in control and conceded few chances for most of the first half, taking a lead after Buyako Saka tapped in a rebound. Before halftime, Arsenal defender William Saliba made a costly mistake that resulted in an own goal by Gabriel, giving Liverpool a goal from out of nowhere to equalize at 1-1.\n\nIn the second half, Liverpool had a performance to forget, with goalkeeper Alisson Becker and defender Virgil Van Dijk getting in each other\u2019s way outside of the penalty box to give Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli an open goal to finish. It got worse for Liverpool, as defender Ibrahim Konate was sent off for two yellow cards. Later, Leandro Trossard ran the ball down the left sideline and shot between Becker\u2019s legs to cap off the 3-1 victory.\n\nArsenal will have relished the victory against its fellow title contenders and have built momentum with three successive wins. This takes pressure off of manager Mikel Arteta, who has turned around his side\u2019s poor December form. During the match, Arsenal accumulated 3.50 expected goals and created six \u201cbig chances\u201d per the Premier League website, but they will be disappointed to not have secured a clean sheet after conceding a poor goal.\n\nOn Sunday, the Gunners go to West Ham, hoping to make it four wins out of four against a side they have not beaten this season in all competitions. Liverpool will be disappointed by the way they lost this important match for the title race and left with only their second league loss of the season. Additionally, Liverpool will be without Konate for the next game, as well as injured star player Mohammed Salah as they look to stay in first place. The Reds have a home opportunity on Saturday against relegation contenders Burnley to bounce back.\n\nEverton 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur\nEverton earned an important point in their journey out of the relegation zone, as they welcomed Tottenham at Goodison Park. A Jarrad Branthwaite equalizer canceled out a brace from Spurs striker Richarlison, himself a former Everton standout.\n\nSpurs opened the game well, as Richarlison scored inside four minutes to go 1-0, losing Everton defenders in their poor marking. In the 30th minute, Everton winger Jack Harrison restored the score to 1-1, but the ex-Toffee scored his second to give Spurs the lead again four minutes before halftime.\n\nIn the second half, Everton came out fighting, but like most of the season struggled to find the back of the net. Until the 94th minute, that is, when Branthwaite\u2019s header found the net after a touch from Spurs defender Cristian Romero fell perfectly in front of goal for him.\n\nThe home side\u2019s last-minute equalizer has them stay one point behind Luton Town in 18th place. Everton gave a performance that didn\u2019t deserve defeat; however, manager Sean Dyche will need to find ways to fix the defensive errors that continue to haunt his team. Everton have not won in the league since December, attaining three draws and three losses.\n\nNext up, the Toffees face a very difficult away game against title-chargers Manchester City and will have to rely on other results going in their favor. This draw puts Spurs at fifth in the table, but a win would\u2019ve moved them up to fourth to slowly get back into the title race.\n\nThe away side looked to keep control of the game and hold out for the victory but couldn\u2019t find it in the end, as manager Ange Postecoglou will be frustrated conceding a set piece so late. Richarlison adding two goals against his former side to increase his tally to 10 for the season marks a positive development in his season, and defender Micky van De Ven had another dominant display at the back with three out of three tackles won after returning from injury.\n\nTottenham haven\u2019t lost a league match in their last four games, winning two and drawing two. Spurs head back home this coming Saturday to take on Brighton for a matchup in which many will expect goals galore.\n\nChelsea 2-4 Wolves\nThe most surprising result from the weekend goes to Wolves\u2019 victory at Chelsea, who have now lost two games in a row while conceding four goals in each. The Blues were favorites to win the game \u2014 having recently been in good form apart from their loss to Liverpool \u2014 but saw many changes to the starting lineup from manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nIt seemed the adjustments were effective, as Cole Palmer put the home side up 1-0 inside of 20 minutes. Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha responded minutes later to level the score, and before half-time, an Axel Disasi own goal gave the visitors the lead.\n\nIn the second half, Wolves ramped up their performance as Cunha added two more, completing a hat trick with a penalty kick, to make the scoreline 4-1. Chelsea had some opportunities, with Raheem Sterling putting a shot wide from inside the penalty box, but eventually centerback Thiago Silva scored what was merely a consolidation goal.\n\nChelsea fans will be left wondering how much more patience ownership has with manager Mauricio Pochettino. He received his fourth home loss of the season against Wolves, and his side dropped to 11th in the table. This was his 31st game in charge \u2014 the same number Graham Potter finished with before his unceremonious departure.\n\nLooking at the table, the Blues are now closer to the relegation zone than they are to making it to the Champions League places. It still looks like Pochettino has no solutions to midfield and defensive issues, while his attackers have not been clinical enough.\n\nHe\u2019ll be hoping for more fortune in their match this Wednesday, an FA Cup replay at Aston Villa, and in a London Derby away to Crystal Palace at the weekend.\n\nThe credit has to go to Wolves and their manager Gary O\u2019Neil, who came away with a great victory and overtook Chelsea in the league, moving up to 10th. After losing a thriller 4-3 to Manchester United in excruciating fashion, his club needed this win.\n\nThe team looks set to stay up and is now eying up the European places. Rightly so, Cunha was awarded man of the match after getting his first career hat trick and causing the home side all sorts of trouble. He now has nine goals for the season and has scored four goals in his last five matches.\n\nWolves will next take on Brentford at home.\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

(Photo Courtesy of John Bazemore/AP Photo)\n\nBy James Bao February 06, 2024 at 2:44 pm PST\n\n\u201cTriple Threat\u201d is a column by James Bao in which he covers trends in the NBA through an analytical lens.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are a real problem. With eight seconds left in the Clippers\u2019 5-point win over the Atlanta Hawks on Monday night, two made free throws from James Harden sealed the deal. This victory extended the Clippers\u2019 win streak to four, putting them in a tie for the league\u2019s best record over the past 10 games (9-1).\n\nBut The Beard wasn\u2019t welcomed with open arms. The blockbuster trade on November 1 sent four Clippers players, alongside multiple draft picks, to the Philadelphia 76ers for Harden, P.J. Tucker and Filip Petrusev. What seemed to be the missing piece that completed arguably the best trio in the NBA \u2014 Paul George, Kawhi Lenoard and Harden \u2014 turned into an uninspiring losing start.\n\nOf course, criticism struck. Before his debut on November 6, the Clippers registered an offensive rating of 117.4. That number plummeted to 108.2 just five games later, with Harden averaging 32 minutes per game.\n\nDespite early struggles, it didn\u2019t take long for veteran NBA coach Tyronn Lue to figure out the problem. Moving Russell Westbrook, whose production had been decreasing, to the bench and giving Harden more space allowed the 10-time All-Star to showcase his offensive talents without stepping on another ball handler\u2019s toes.\n\nThe Clippers are 31-8 since Terrance Mann replaced Westbrook in the starting lineup on November 17, ranking third overall in the Western Conference. They also hold the third-best offensive rating at 120.3 and are in the upper half of the league in defensive rating at 114.\n\nHere are some of the Clippers\u2019 notable statistics on both ends of the field:\n\nFirst in the league in 3-point field goal percentage (39%)\nFifth in overall FG% (49.6%)\nSecond in opponent FG% between 5-9 feet from the basket (37.5%)\nSeventh in opponent FG% between 20-24 feet from the basket (36.7%)\n\nNeedless to say, the Clippers are big on isolation plays, with four players combining for 34 All-Star appearances. At a 12.3% frequency rate, they run the most isolation plays and convert them at a league-leading 14.3 points per game on 44.6% shooting.\n\nHarden sits on the throne of isolation plays, as 25% of his possessions are isolations, which exceeds any other player in the league. And this dominance isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s now his seventh consecutive season leading in this statistic.\n\nAlthough far less efficient than his MVP season in 2018, the skilled guard is still racking up 4.3 points per game in one-on-one situations.\n\nLeonard and George are defensive nightmares. They\u2019re averaging 1.7 and 1.6 steals per game, ranking fourth and fifth in the league, respectively. Their efforts on defense translate to points for the Clippers, who rank fifth in points off turnovers per game (17.5).\n\nBut the starters aren\u2019t all that the team has. While Westbrook delivers 11.4 points, 4.7 assists and 5.6 rebounds a night, the story also lies in role players like Norman Powell and Mason Plumlee, both in the middle of career seasons in FG%.\n\nThis bench production gives the Clippers a well-rounded offensive firepower that extends beyond their stars.\n\nSo, in a league where superstars team up left and right, what makes the Clippers dangerous? While other teams scrambled with their lineups, the Clippers had three months to adapt and gel with one another. Additionally, Lue\u2019s positive influence and effective coaching had time to set in.\n\nNow, as more teams are expected to move pieces as the trade deadline approaches, the Clippers will hold a rock solid core as chemistry continues to rise.\n\nAvoiding the injury bug will be crucial. But if the Clippers remain healthy, their blend of experience, talent and cohesion could make them a legitimate championship threat and a very, very fun team to watch.\n\n\u201cTriple Threat\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and Graduate Student Government (GSG) collaborated on the campaign to fund sexually transmitted infection testing for all USC students.\n\nSTI testing at USC health centers is typically only free for students with USC\u2019s health insurance. \u201cSeeing that a lot of students would be left in the dust, our wellness team and legislative branch really came together to allocate some funds towards getting this project through,\u201d USG Chief Communications Officer Mustafa Ali Khan said.\n\nTesting will be available to students at both the Engemann Student Health Center and Eric Cohen Student Health Center locations. Available tests include chlamydia urine testing, gonorrhea urine test or throat swabbing, syphilis blood testing and HIV blood testing. During this time students can participate in any of these tests with no out-of-pocket costs, and it won\u2019t appear on the student\u2019s outside insurance bill.\n\n\u201cStudents will have ample time to take advantage of that initiative,\u201d said Rachel Licthman, the associate director of public communications at USC Student Health. \u201cThanks to the generous subsidization of USG and GSG... they\u2019re going to be more educated and informed about their different statuses depending on which test they choose to do\u201d\n\nUnder the bill that was passed last semester, USG and the Graduate Student Government will provide a total of $15,000 to fund the testing. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for testing to be readily available,\u201d said Lucy Liao, a human biology major. \u201cI feel like a lot of people are afraid to get tested, and I think one factor of it is definitely the financial aspect. I think that it\u2019ll make people want to do it more and not be as afraid of doing it.\u201d\n\nStudents can schedule an appointment through the MySHR portal and get a lab order sample collection at a USC Health Center. After submitting a blood or urine test, students will receive their results through the MySHR portal.\n\n\u201cSpeaking from experience because testing wasn\u2019t free before, I would never really go out and do it,\u201d said computer science student Richard Duong. \u201cSo now being able to have it available and just making sure that I\u2019m safe and the people that I\u2019m with are safe, I think that\u2019s pretty important. It\u2019s really valuable.\n\nIn addition to \u201ctest fest,\u201d a variety of events will continue throughout next week to celebrate USG\u2019s wellness week. USC\u2019s annual wellness fair will take place Feb. 12 at Alumni Park from 12 to 3 p.m. The wellness fair will have different wellness resources that are available and tailored to help students\u2019 physical, mental, spiritual and sexual health.\n\nUSG will also host another event at Alumni Park on Feb. 13 from 12 to 2 p.m. called \u201cBe Well Love Well.\u201d The event features two activities that are focused on helping students think about how they can better love themselves.\n\n\u201cI think this is really great. I really appreciate how it is open to everybody even if they don\u2019t have the USC health package,\u201d said health and human sciences student Natalie Olivares. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really good feature, especially during Valentine\u2019s week. It\u2019s a good time to have it, and it\u2019s a good resource for students to have.\u201d\n```"}

Despite the original script being written over 100 years ago, its commentary still resonates today.\n\n\u201cKnowing that this was written so many years ago, it fits in today with today\u2019s society. I thought it was just very well adapted.\u201d Norma Maldonado, an actress and friend of the play\u2019s director Finola Hughes who watched the Jan. 28 afternoon showing, said. \u201cI was very, very happy to see young actors taking on classics and doing it justice. I think all of them have an immense amount of talent.\u201d\n\nHughes discussed the transition of this play from script to production, echoing Maldanado\u2019s praise of the actors. \u201cThis [play] is very dialogue heavy.... At the beginning, it was a bit daunting for everybody. The amount of dialogue, but actually, the actors worked so hard to get off book [memorized],\u201d Hughes said. \u201cAnd then, you can play around with staging and getting it off on its feet. And so, you know, we had a long time to work.\n\nDirector Hughes was previously an actor but directed her first movie in 2012 and directed three plays before that. Hughes said that directing a movie and directing a play are \u201ccompletely different.\u201d \u201cAt a certain point, as a director in theater, you kind of hand it over to the actors, because it\u2019s their play,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhereas in a film, you\u2019re still tinkering with it after you\u2019ve shot it.\u201d\n\nThe play is directed by SDA lecturer and actress Finola Hughes and solely features MFA Acting Year 3 students as the actors, with Krosby Jo\u00e3o Roza as lead Jack/\u201cErnest\u201d Worthing, Deniz Himmetoglu as Algernon Moncrieff, Megan Tomei as Gwendolen Fairfax, and Gabriella Weltman as Cecily Cardew, among others. The full program of the production can be viewed here.\n\nThe play was divided up into three distinct acts, with a 15-minute intermission in between the first act and the second act, and each scene in a distinct act set in the same location. The play revolves around the personas and fronts that the two main leads (Worthing and Moncrieff) put on for romance and to get what they want.\n\nLead actor Roza, who previously acted in the plays  \u201cThe Last Days of Judas Iscariot,\u201d  \u201cThe Conduct of Life\u201d  and  \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d  at USC, praised Hughes. \u201cIt\u2019s been really fabulous being in rehearsal with our director Finola. Because she, being a really experienced British actor, can give us so many insights into this play,\u201d Roza said.\n\nThe cast and creatives behind the show said they wanted everyone in the audience to enjoy watching the play. \u201cI want them to laugh at how absurd that society is and the way that Oscar Wilde set it up,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI really just want people to have fun.\u201d\n\nRoza echoed a similar sentiment. \u201cI just want people to have fun and to root for us... root for the young lovers and the old lovers,\u201d Roza said. \u201cAnybody who can make it should try and make it to see it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest\u201d is played at the Boston Court Pasadena theater through Jan. 30.

I didn\u2019t want to write this column, but deep down I knew it was something I had to do. I couldn\u2019t stay silent knowing there were millions of people around the world suffering just like me.\n\nI lived the past 20 years of my life as an optimist, trying to look on the bright side of things, especially when it comes to sports. No matter how hopeless things appear or how slim the odds are, I went into every single Laker game over the course of the last few seasons as optimistic as ever. But little did I know, these would be some of the most challenging years of my entire life.\n\nLet me paint a scene that will resonate beyond the realm of sports. For this example I\u2019ll model the NBA season after a rigorous climbing expedition. It\u2019s the middle of October and you\u2019ve spent months trying to scale the tallest mountain in the world. You built upon the trials and tribulations of your last attempt, and you told yourself this is going to be the year that all of your hard work and dedication pay off. You are more prepared than you ever have been. After extensive training, you\u2019ve acquired some new and valuable skills. You saved up and invested in some championship-caliber climbing equipment that shows how serious you are about getting to the preverbal and quite literal mountain top.\n\nNow just imagine you start the expedition, and things seem to be much different than last year. You\u2019re more put together, and you have this undeniable rhythm and championship desire in your eyes. It\u2019s almost like things really might be different this year...and then, suddenly, you plummet to your death.\n\nTo take inspiration from a criminally underrated album, EVERYTHING WAS THE SAME! The same way you have no business climbing the tallest mountain in the world because you keep self-sabotaging yourself at every turn, is the exact same way that this dysfunctionally run franchise that makes you want to pull each individual tooth outta your mouth has no business winning an NBA championship.\n\nFor the life of me, I can\u2019t understand it. How can you constantly have pieces that worked on other teams not even so much as sniff the hardwood anytime the Los Angeles Lakers sign them? Let\u2019s start with Christian Wood. Undeniable talent, size, length, touch around the basket, and a silky jumper that Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars would be proud of. But 19 minutes and 7.5 points later, there is absolutely no sign of any of that talent this season.\n\nYou can move on to others like Gabe Vincent, who, even before he suffered his knee injury, shot worse percentage in his career in the five games he appeared for you guys since his rookie season. A case so bizarre it belongs on \u201cX-Files\u201d is whatever is going on with D\u2019Angelo Russell. There are moments in which I try to convince myself that he will be the reason that you knuckleheads win a championship. Yet there are certain nights that I look upon his stat line to see how he contributed to a specific game, and I am beside myself.\n\nAll of the right things were said in the preseason. Russell was committed to playing on the defensive side of the ball posting an above-average defensive rating, while also a 124.9 offensive rating. That would have meant that D\u2019Angelo Russell would be better at offense this season than Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard and Jalen Brunson.\n\nIt seems like every shooter known around the association for knocking down jumpers arrives on a LeBron James-led team and, all of a sudden, they simply forget how to put the ball into the basket. I am fully convinced that even if this Laker squad signed Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, they would still end up bottom-half of the league in 3-point percentage.\n\nOutside of just your roster, what in the name of lineup changes is going on with Darvin Ham? He gets a new lineup more often than Micah Richards! Why would you put your third-best player (Russell) on the bench? Why won\u2019t you play a 6 foot 10 stretch four with size and length? Why are you so hot and cold with Rui, Cam and Max\u2019s minutes?! I need answers!\n\nAll logic is thrown out the window when it pertains to the Los Angeles Lakers. I never would have believed that within the next few weeks, they could beat the number one team in the Western Conference and get a hard-fought win over the Clippers, but lose to Memphis, Utah and Brooklyn.\n\nThis is what I get for being a fan, and to tell you the truth, I simply don\u2019t know how much more of this I can take. Figure it out, Los Angeles, because if you don\u2019t, I will strip the starting lineup of all their basketball prowess Monstars style and replace them with the likes of some former Laker Legends. Are you familiar with names like Jordan Hill, Xavier Henry, Jordan Farmar, Robert Sacre and Swaggy P? Have fun winning 10 games a season!\n\nRespectfully, you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n```"}

Expand Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson made his return to WWE, confronting Roman Reigns at Friday Night Smackdown. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Evan Agostini)\n\nBy Maddy Myer February 05, 2024 at  7:34 pm PST\n\nOne of the biggest news stories this week in the world of wrestling was the return of Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson. He came back on Friday Night Smackdown to confront Roman Reigns and claim a shot for Reigns\u2019 title at WrestleMania. But for many wrestling fans, that wasn\u2019t the exciting announcement the WWE fans hoped for. With The Rock returning to face Reigns at WrestleMania, Cody Rhodes is left in the dust. The man who has been a workhorse for the company and has built a long-term storyline with Reigns now has to wait his turn to face the Tribal Chief. It just doesn\u2019t seem fair, but hey, that\u2019s the business.\n\nAside from that, the company put on some great matches over the past week, especially from NXT Vengeance Day. Their NXT talent is so promising; for example, Tiffany Stratton officially signed her contract with Smackdown last week, thus \u201cgraduating\u201d from NXT.\n\nSo, here are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week leading up to the Royal Rumble.\n\nDijak vs. Joe Gacy (NXT Vengeance Day, February 4)\nNo disqualification matches are always a treat, and this one was no different. You never know what Joe Gacy will pull out, and in this match against Dijak, he did just about everything. I\u2019m talking chairs, kendo sticks, duct tape and tables filled with legos. On Dijak\u2019s end, his weapons of choice were a nightstick and trash can. Dijak used the nightstick to clobber Gacy before hitting him with a brutal knee to pick up the victory.\n\nIlja Dragunov vs. Trick Williams (NXT Vengeance Day, February 4)\nTwo of the most talented men in NXT faced off for the NXT Championship. The crowd was absolutely behind Williams, who had a match earlier in the night with his tag-team partner Carmelo Hayes. The match started off intense from the start, with bloody noses and mouths. Dragunov was the dominant man in the beginning, hitting Williams with devastating clotheslines, big boots and chops. Things continued to get brutal, with Dragunov delivering a German suplex outside the ring, followed by a head drop on the ring apron. The commentator said it best, Williams dug deeper than he ever did before and started gaining back momentum. Williams hit a ring apron slam of his own. Sadly, this is where things got messy, with referees getting knocked down and Carmelo Hayes \u2014 who was ringside as a friend in support of Williams \u2014 getting in the way and hurting Williams\u2019 leg on accident. Dragunov and Williams both lined up to deliver their finishers, but Dragunov connected first and pinned Williams for the 1, 2, 3 to retain his championship. And right after the match, Hayes did a heel turn on Williams, attacking him with a steel chair.\n\nGunther vs. Kofi Kingston (WWE Monday Night Raw, January 29)\nI can never give enough praise to Gunther, who shows out every time he\u2019s in the ring, but this match continued to showcase his immense talent. Kofi Kingston is considerably underrated but matched Gunther in every way possible to produce a classic. As the more powerful competitor, Gunther held the momentum early on, hitting some slams on top of a Boston crab submission hold. Once momentum finally shifted to Kingston after his \u2018trouble in paradise\u2019 finisher had Gunther roll outside the ring, Kingston jumped off the ring barricade to slam Gunther\u2019s neck against the ring steps. Once Gunther was back in the ring, Kingston followed it up with a double-leg drop from the top rope. When I say Kofi was doing it all, he even landed his signature \u2018SOS\u2019 move after that. But Gunther\u2019s resiliency is almost unmatched in this company, so nothing would be enough to take him down. Gunther won the match with a massive powerbomb. Their feud is incredibly entertaining, and, if it continues, it will provide some more great matches.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

Between changing seasons and developing designers, fashion is undeniably dynamic. Despite this compelling need to shift through accessories with every outfit comes a trend countering this air of dynamism: permanent jewelry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really classic and it\u2019s really timeless. As a woman, I hate putting on jewelry. Usually we have, but long nails or are alone and you can\u2019t really clip things,\u201d said Bella Preciado, owner of La Belle Boutique. Preciado began selling permanent jewelry after noticing the trend pop up in Utah and Colorado at the beginning of 2022. She attributes the success of permanent jewelry in her boutique and as a whole to social media.\n\nThe usual culprits for popularizing anything, Instagram and Tiktok, introduced Preciado\u2019s clients to permanent jewelry. \u201cThe automatic reaction in the beginning was confusion. But now that it\u2019s so popular, anytime someone sees the sign, we have our banner, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I\u2019ve seen this on TikTok. Oh my gosh, I want to do this,\u2019\u201d said Preciado.\n\nWhile permanent jewelry brings the advantage of simplicity to a morning routine, these high-quality, yet affordable pieces also boast lasting relationships. The bracelet\u2019s reputation of durability allows the accessory to act as more than just a style choice. Instead, they can also be worn as a physical manifestation of love and commitment.\n\n\u201cI feel like a lot of the people that come in here like to get that experience doing it together as a couple or as friends or family,\u201d said Samantha Cosio, owner of jewelry boutique Bella Sol. Welded together in the sterling silver or gold-plated jewelry, are stories from rom-coms to family bonds. One couple traveled from Coachella Valley to the Bella Sol studio in Downey to celebrate their anniversary with matching permanent bracelets. While they only dated for seven months, they lived next door to each other for 10 years before their first conversation.\n\nFriends, bridesmaids, couples and family alike seek these bracelets as a reminder of those they love. According to Preciado, a group of middle school best friends now in their 20s entered La Belle Boutique for matching permanent jewelry. \u201cAll the girls got the same bracelet, and there was the tiniest bit left, and the one who had the baby was like, \u2018Wait, is that enough for my daughter?\u2019 And it was so out of the blue, it was the perfect size for this little three-month-old baby,\u201d said Preciado.\n\nWhile permanent jewelry can last for a few years, the entire process will only take about three to five minutes, according to Cosio. The first step is choosing the chain. This can be the most time consuming step considering the array of options at the client\u2019s disposal. The next is to measure the wrist size to find the right fit. After a cloth is placed between the bracelet and the skin to protect it, in a matter of seconds the bracelet is soldered shut. If you ever need to remove the bracelet, a pair of wire cutters or even strong scissors will do the trick.\n\n\u201cI want to be known for the experience that you get here,\u201d said Cosio. \u201cI want to do more with the brand, not just with the jewelry itself, but giving back to my community and having it be a part of something bigger than just jewelry.\u201d\n\nFebruary marks the three-month anniversary of Bella Sol. The name originates from Samantha\u2019s middle name, Bella, and translates to beautiful in English. The glittering effect of the sun splashing over jewelry inspired Sol. Simply put, permanent jewelry is welded accessories with the power to fortify relationships. With an essence of infinity and the practicality of its form, the trend of permanent jewelry may last even longer than the bracelets themselves.\n```"}

The combination of rain and a recent drop in temperature added to the dangers and risks L.A.\u2019s unhoused population faces. According to Lewis, \u201cHypothermia is a huge, huge risk factor.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think because we have such a mild climate, but hypothermia can set in from exposure and temperatures as high as 50 degrees,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re wet, then you can start becoming hypothermic even [at] higher temperatures.\u201d\n\nKtown For All preemptively passed out donated blankets, warm clothing, hand warmers, water, tarps and trash bags to unhoused persons to keep them as warm and dry as possible in these conditions.\n\n\u201cMy Office of Housing and Homelessness Solutions directed an increase in interim shelter and vouchers ahead of [yesterday\u2019s] weather warnings. Angelenos in need of shelter can call 2-1-1 for transportation to a shelter or visit any of the listed locations,\u201d said L.A. Mayor Karen Bass in a statement posted to X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nLast Tuesday, LAHSA announced that they were opening additional shelters to help the homeless community during these drastic changes in weather conditions. This annual \u201cWinter Shelter Program\u201d provides temporary emergency shelters, access to supportive services, and motel vouchers to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. In a statement released on Wednesday, LAHSA CEO Va Lecia Adams Kellum stated, \u201cThanks to the support of our partners at the city and county, LAHSA is glad to offer this resource to keep people safe and dry during storms like we expect this week.\u201d\n\nOver 5,400 individuals utilized the expanded shelter program in 2022\u20132023 (a 652% increase over the previous season), according to LAHSA. Despite these additional shelters, most of the Los Angeles homeless population was left to endure these harsh conditions without adequate shelter. Lewis said it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to find shelter for an unhoused woman she tried to help on Saturday. \u201cJust not being able to do anything, having phone calls, you know, hung up on us.

The heavy rainfall has led people to wonder what is causing the phenomenon.\n\nA USC student biking across campus in the rain. (Michael Chow/USC).\n\nBy Sarah Arencibia, Faith Curry and Melissa Grimaldo\nFebruary 05, 2024 at 6:07 pm PST\n\nIt never rains in Southern California, but the past few days have been anything but clear skies. Despite February regularly being Los Angeles\u2019s wettest month, climate change is often the scapegoat for any weather outside of business-as-usual. Todd Richards teaches digital media at USC... He attributes the excessive puddles to a different culprit, though.\n\nTodd Richards: While climate change definitely plays a role in events like this, there is a something on top of that right now that\u2019s happening that, that is as much or more responsible for what we\u2019re seeing. And that is El Nino. El Nino occurs every 3 to 7 years... The phenomenon warms the Pacific Ocean. Since we\u2019re in a coastal region here, the effects are prominent... in Los Angeles County.\n\nRichards: This is a very strong El Nino year. El Nino has been around much longer than we\u2019ve been talking about warming of the planet and climate change. USC\u2019s Todd Richards does say that climate change can exacerbate the expected El Nino weather.\n\nRichards: Warming air and warming oceans leads to heavier rain. Events. It just it just does. That\u2019s just the science of it. And we know the air is warming. We know the oceans are warming. And, and so we can expect more of the same, to come.\n\nUnfortunately, Los Angeles lacks much of the infrastructure needed to handle to such weather. The National Weather Service is sending out multiple flash flood warnings in the last few days... stating that the Los Angeles area is in a \u201cdangerous and life-threatening situation,\u201d recommending only necessary travel. Richards agrees.\n\nTodd Richards: Our streets are not necessarily built for conditions like this. And so, that makes it that much worse. The streets aren\u2019t built for these conditions, and I\u2019m not sure the residents are necessarily built for these conditions either, which makes it, challenging for them as well.\n\nJulien Emile-Geay: It usually basically grows and dies in the span of about a year. USC Climate Professor Julien Emile-Geay assures us that the dreary El Nino days we\u2019re living with now are soon coming to a close.\n\nEmile-Geay: This particular event started really last spring or summer. And it\u2019s now basically peaking. And it\u2019s meant to, you know, alter the forecast or saying that it\u2019s basically going to decay, in the next few months. So, we don\u2019t expect its effects to be felt much beyond the summer.\n\nWith El Nino\u2019s decay around the corner, staying dry and warm will become much easier. Didn\u2019t that groundhog tell us that Spring was on its way? For Annenberg Media, this is Sarah Arencibia.\n```"}

Many, including Academy honoree Jay-Z, said that the award voting process doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the fans. We asked students and experts how the Grammys can be improved. Kate Stuzin has the story.\n\nSophomore Music Industry major India Yeoh worked directly on the PR campaign for Victoria Monet, the 2024 Grammy winner for Best New Artist, through her summer internship with BIZ 3 Publicity. India Yeoh: She\u2019s a black woman who\u2019s been around in the industry for a while but hasn\u2019t really gotten a ton of recognition. The other three winners in the Big Four \u2014 Record, Album and Song of the year\u2014 were white women. Yeoh says she hopes to see a more diverse array of winners in the future. Yeoh: I know people who are part of the Recording Academy and who are able to vote for the Grammys and, you know, I love them and I trust them and everything. But I also just think that people need to remember that maybe the Grammys aren\u2019t supposed to be representative of what their personal beliefs are.\n\nSophomore Business Administration major Varun Tamaskar didn\u2019t watch the Grammys, but followed the awards through social media. He says the Grammy Awards could be improved by a greater emphasis on fans\u2019 opinions. Tamaskar: Well, I think they have to like take more fan input. Honestly, I think it\u2019s more about like right now it\u2019s more about like celebrities and all this like show business as more about like the entertainment aspect of it. I think if they actually took what the fans, had to say, it would be a lot more accurate and people would watch it.\n\nA memorable moment at the ceremony was Jay-Z\u2019s acceptance speech for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award which he used to call out the Recording Academy and its selection process. Jay-Z: Some of you may get robbed. Some of you don\u2019t belong in a category. The rapper also referenced his wife Beyonce and how the Grammys have snubbed her time and time again. Beyonc\u00e9, has the most Grammy Awards of all time with 32 wins. Her recent album, Renaissance, did not receive a nomination in the Album of the Year category. Jay-Z: I don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album in a year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nLegal Studies junior Caroline Holmes says she resonated with the rapper\u2019s primetime speech. Caroline Holmes: I feel like it\u2019s just kind of a lot of people with opinions that ended up having a lot of power in the industry, not necessarily that they deserve it. The solution for Holmes? More transparency when it comes to people who make up the Recording Academy and what impacts their decision-making. Holmes: I would love to have a more transparent voting process, because I think that would kind of stop people from voting for bad voting, making the decisions I do based on probably biases that they have.\n\nThe conversation surrounding the voting practices of the Academy have persisted for decades and always circle back to a need for equity that has yet to be addressed. It is clear there is certainly room for improvement!\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier February 05, 2024 at  5:29 pm PST\n\nFor Austin Overn, sports were a family affair. His father Chad always coached him as a kid regardless of the sport, along with Brian Woods, a family friend who Overn credits with helping him become mentally tough. His mother Crystal, who played college basketball at El Camino, was always the team mom. Even his grandparents, who live across the street from the Overns in Tustin, always came to support. Overn\u2019s grandfather often coached him as well, earning him the nickname \u201cCoach Grandpa\u201d by all of Overn\u2019s teammates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been basically just a sports family; everything sports, growing up, that\u2019s been the main priority,\u201d Overn said. \u201cAnd I feel like kinda having sports as the main priority has gotten me to where I am today because it pushed me in every aspect possible, and I think personally, if it wasn\u2019t for them, I would definitely not be where I am right now.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Tustin, California, the sophomore outfielder for the USC baseball team grew up alongside his younger brother Taylor, who has severe autism. His mother says this made him humble and appreciate all of the talent that he was born with.\n\n\u201cAs an individual, he\u2019s very compassionate and he knows that Taylor could be him. It\u2019s not Taylor\u2019s fault that he\u2019s the way he is,\u201d Crystal said. \u201cI think that resonates in the way that he respects people with disabilities or that aren\u2019t blessed the same way God gifted him. It keeps him very humble. And I think there are a lot of people who can tell you he\u2019s very humble.\u201d\n\nChad also sees how compassionate his son is towards others.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re most proud of is how he carries himself. No matter how successful he is in life, I think he gets a broader perspective of what life is about,\u201d Chad said. \u201cHe has just a really, really big heart. He has friends over to our house or something, ever since they were little kids, everybody comes and Austin\u2019s the first one to be like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go hang out with Tay for a little bit.\u2019\u201d\n\nAustin is still close to everyone in his family. Chad and Crystal visit him once a week when he is at school to get lunch and see how he is doing. Crystal also requires that Overn calls her at least once a day to chat, even if it is only for a few minutes.\n\nOvern\u2019s compassion pairs with a deep competitiveness, a trait that led to him playing three sports in high school. As the young outfielder grew older, he and his parents began to see that he had the most potential with baseball. After dominating in Little League, his parents quickly realized how talented their son was. His sophomore year of high school, he realized that he wanted to make a career out of playing baseball professionally, which inspired him to work harder every day.\n\nThe work paid off, and Overn accepted an offer to play baseball at USC under then-head coach Jason Gill. Because he had also proven himself to be a talented football wide receiver during his senior year of high school, Overn successfully walked on and joined the USC football team under head coach Lincoln Riley.\n\n\u201cOnce they said I had a spot, I was just like: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m playing,\u2019\u201d Overn said of making the football team. \u201c[It was a] \u2018let me know what to do and I\u2019ll be there\u2019 type of thing.\u201d\n\nShortly after Overn started practicing with the football team in June 2022 following his high school graduation, Gill was fired after the baseball team went 25-28 and lost seven of its last eight games. Then-athletic director Mike Bohn turned to Andy Stankiewicz, who was the head coach of Grand Canyon at the time, to revive the Trojans. But despite playing for Stankiewicz instead of the coach who initially recruited him, there was no chance Overn would leave USC \u2014 partly because he had already started practicing with the football team.\n\nThe feeling between Overn and Stankiewicz was mutual. After getting to know Overn, Stankiewicz was confident that he would have no trouble catching up with the team once the football season ended, especially since Austin was still taking part in fall ball when he didn\u2019t have football obligations.\n\n\u201cHe was great. He\u2019s well liked. He\u2019s got a great attitude, he\u2019s a great worker,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThat was never an issue. I mean, he jumped right in, and I think the guys saw how good he was, and so naturally they\u2019re like: \u2018he\u2019s a heck of a baseball player.\u2019 So I think he fits in really well. He\u2019s got great relationships with everyone.\u201d\n\nDespite missing part of fall ball, Overn went into his freshman campaign with lofty personal goals, which included batting leadoff and starting every day in center field. He would go on to have an impressive freshman campaign and achieved both of his goals, as he started every game in center field and was moved to the top of the batting order less than two weeks after the season started.\n\nOvern hit .314 with a .530 slugging percentage and a .402 on-base percentage. He also set a new single-season USC record for triples with 14, breaking the previous USC record of 10 set by Grant Green in 2008. At the end of the 2023 season, he was named a Freshman All-American, an All-Pac-12 Selection and a Pac-12 All-Defensive Team Selection.\n\n\u201cThe triples record wasn\u2019t something I was expecting to do, but I was expecting to be the leadoff hitter and center fielder because that was my goal, and coming in you don\u2019t wanna think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll bat last and play center or something,\u2019\u201d Overn said. \u201cSo I was shooting for the stars with that.\u201d\n\nBecause he will be 21 in May, Overn will be eligible to declare for the MLB Draft this summer. He hopes to impress scouts by backing up his freshman statistics with a stellar sophomore campaign. However, he knows that he has a lot of work to be ready for that.\n\nIn order to prepare for the upcoming season, Overn has given up playing with the football team to focus on his baseball career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say balancing football and baseball last year was, I wouldn\u2019t say it was a struggle, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the easiest thing,\u201d Overn said. \u201cThere was a point where I was bouncing around with both baseball and football, and trying to get my swing all dialed.\u201d\n\nStankiewicz has plenty of confidence that Overn will continue to improve as a player and a leader with all of his focus on the basepaths instead of the gridiron.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s raw and he\u2019s coachable and he\u2019s willing to learn and listen to [assistant] coach [Travis] Jewett on the hitting side, understand his swing, understand what he\u2019s trying to do when he\u2019s in the batter\u2019s box,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThat\u2019s been probably the biggest challenge, is to try to get him to understand, as leadoff hitter, that using his speed to his strength is an asset.\u201d\n\nAfter spending the summer playing baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League and facing rejection from the USA Collegiate Team, Overn is ready to get back to work. Austin wants to improve and help his team make it into the NCAA Tournament and advance to Super Regionals, if not further, this summer. He also wants to prove that USC can win on the road, something that the Trojans struggled with last year, as they posted a 8-17-1 record in road and neutral-site games, while going 26-6 at home.\n\nWith Dedeaux Field under construction this season, USC  will split its home games across three stadiums , which Overn sees as an opportunity for the Trojans to prove that they can win anywhere.\n\n\u201cI feel like if we can overcome anything that has to do with traveling, it\u2019ll show that USC\u2019s legit, and we can finally compete with anyone,\u201d Overn said. \u201cI feel like we, as a team, all know that. We just gotta prove everyone else wrong.\u201d\n\nAfter he leaves USC, Overn hopes to play professionally. However, if that doesn\u2019t work out for him, he plans to get involved in the real estate industry, his major. But right now, he\u2019s locked in for the Trojans\u2019 2024 campaign.\n\nWith the season approaching, sophomore infielder KaiKea Harrison, who played with Overn at  Trosky National , a travel ball organization that includes both regional and national teams for high school baseball players, is looking forward to seeing how his teammate will continue to thrive as the season progresses.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s gonna hit more for power this year cause he got a lot stronger, he put on some pounds,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cHe\u2019s super fast, but hopefully he adds some home runs to his draft stock cause that would be cool. And I really think he\u2019s gonna do what he did last year but better.\u201d\n\nOvern and the Trojans return to the field on February 16 when they take on the BYU Cougars in their season opener in Arizona as part of the MLB Desert Invitational.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nBy Matt Kim\n\nFebruary 05, 2024 at 4:03 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The American League West has long featured intense division rivalries, rebuilds turning into dynasties, and perennial all stars. And in a post Shohei Ohtani world, the Angels\u2019 potential to make the playoffs looks as precarious as ever. In 2023, the AL West\u2019s top three had a hotly contested playoff race, with the Mariners missing out. If the 2024 season is anything like the year prior, it\u2019ll be must-watch baseball.\n\nHouston Astros\n2023 Record: 90-72\nMy 2024 Projection: 99-63\n\nThe Astros were the laughing stock of the AL West when they switched from the National League to the American League in 2013. However, with top draft picks from those losing seasons and key free agency signings, they\u2019ve become a dynasty. They haven\u2019t missed the playoffs since 2016 and won two World Series titles in 2017 and 2022, respectively. Their success however, became the topic of endless controversy after their sign-stealing habits en route to the 2017 chip became public knowledge. The 2022 title, however, proves their success has not been a fluke post-scandal.\n\nIn 2023, the Astros won the division for the third straight season, winning 90 games in the process. Their path to the AL West pennant was helped by a late-season collapse from the Rangers, who then had the last laugh in the playoffs. Their offense featured long-time Astros in Jos\u00e9 Altuve and Alex Bregman, alongside younger sluggers like Yordan Alvarez and Kyle Tucker. As a team, they were top five in batting average, on-base percentage, RBIs and strikeout rate.\n\nThe Astros offense revolves around Yordan Alvarez, as he\u2019s quickly cemented himself as one of baseball\u2019s best hitters. Alvarez has posted 3 consecutive seasons of a 135 OPS+ mark (100 is league average) and 30+ home runs. Altuve is still a well-above average second basemen in today\u2019s game, but for the first time since his rookie season in 2011 (excluding the COVID-shortened 2020 season), he played under 120 games. He\u2019s fully healthy heading into spring training but the Astros will depend on his availability at the top of the lineup.\n\nLooking at the starting rotation, 2023 didn\u2019t go as the Astros would\u2019ve liked. Ace Framber Valdez took a small step back last season after a breakout 2022. He posted a 3.45 ERA\u2014still solid but a sizable decrease from his 2.82 mark in 2022. He also imploded in the postseason, recording a 9.00 ERA and receiving the loss in all three of his postseason starts. Elsewhere in the rotation, RHP Lance McCullers Jr. missed the entire 2023 season due a torn right flexor tendon and RHP Jose Urquidy suffered a drop in form, even getting demoted to the bullpen. Young flamethrower Hunter Brown got his first full season in the bigs and showed flashes of future starting potential, but ultimately his ERA ballooned to 5.\n\nThe Astros should maintain their dominance in 2024 and their rotation appears improved. They still have Justin Verlander, who at the age of 40, has aged like fine wine. As their young arms receive more experience, the pitching staff is bound to take a step forward. The Astros bullpen did lose Hector Neris, but added dominant closer Josh Hader in free agency on a 5-year, $95 million dollar deal. The offense remains the same apart from Michael Brantley\u2019s retirement and Martin Maldonado\u2019s departure in free agency, neither of whom contributed much in 2023. They can win the division with relative ease on the back of an overwhelming offense and if the rotation bounces back, the Astros dominant run will continue.\n\nSeattle Mariners\n2023 Record: 88-74\nMy 2024 Projection: 90-72\n\nAfter narrowly missing out on the playoffs last year, the Mariners\u2019 always-active GM Jerry Dipoto has made a few trades to shake up the roster. He sent 2021 Cy Young award winner Robbie Ray to the Giants in exchange for OF Mitch Haniger and RHP Anthony Desclafani. He also moved 3B Eugenio Suarez to the Diamondbacks in exchange for C Seby Zavala and RHP Carlos Vargas. To cap it off, the M\u2019s also acquired INF Jorge Polanco from the Twins in exchange for Desclafani, Justin Topa and 2 minor leaguers.\n\nIn the short term, Ray was expected to miss the beginning of the season anyway while he recovers from Tommy John surgery. With this trade, the Mariners welcomed back fan-favorite Mitch Haniger, who endeared himself to Seattle for his production and heroics between 2017-2022. As recently as 2021, he swatted 39 home runs and an even 100 RBIs. The Mariners will be a highly competitive ballclub as long as the lineup provides some run support for their great rotation.\n\nJulio Rodriguez had a great overall year in 2023 but his slow start correlated to the Mariners\u2019 early season struggles. His eventual .275/.333/.485 slashline was by far the team\u2019s best, but the Mariners will need him humming from Opening Day alongside fellow sluggers Cal Raleigh and newly-signed Mitch Garver. The Mariners also added OF Luke Raley via trade and 3B Luis Urias, who the Red Sox non-tendered, to supplement Seattle\u2019s depth.\n\nThe offense lost a couple of key pieces, however, when the team traded away OF Jarred Kelenic and lost OF Teoscar Hernandez to the Dodgers in free agency. Kelenic finally looked to have hit his big-league stride after years as a highly touted prospect. He slowed down a bit as the season progressed, before breaking his foot after kicking a cooler out of frustration. Teoscar offered his usual power and now the Mariners lose his middle-of-the-order bat.\n\nTheir pitching staff, the team\u2019s strength, consists of Luis Castillo, George Kirby, Logan Gilbert, Bryce Miller and Bryan Woo. Castillo and Kirby both had a great 2023, posting sub 3.50-ERAs. Gilbert had a fine season himself, while Miller and Woo will have to establish their place in the rotation in spring training.\n\nThe Mariners have continued to build on their rebuild after a lackluster 2010s. Their chance to compete for a pennant is as great as ever and a great pitching staff combined with improved offense will put them in contention for a wild card spot at least.\n\nTexas Rangers\n2023 Record: 90-72\nMy 2024 Projection: 84-78\n\nThe Rangers are fresh off a World Series title after failing to record a winning season since 2016. Their big 2022 free agent signings of infielders Corey Seager and Marcus Semien played a huge factor in their success, alongside young stars Jonah Heim, Josh Jung and Evan Carter. Seager had back-to-back All-Star seasons, and in 2023, was the AL MVP runner-up to Shohei Ohtani. In only 119 games, he toyed with opposing pitchers and posted an OPS over 1.000 while leading the AL in doubles. He is the spark plug of this Rangers offense and showcased it throughout the playoffs.\n\nIn the Fall Classic, Seager crushed three home runs in five games and was awarded World Series MVP. Semien had a great 2023 as well, finishing third in MVP voting right behind Seager. Semien led the American league in hits this past season and posted great power numbers for a second baseman. Semien is also a workhorse, missing just one game in the past three seasons.\n\nOn the pitching side, the Rangers rotation is currently battered with injuries. When fully healthy, their rotation of Jacob DeGrom, Max Scherzer, Nathan Eovaldi, Andrew Heaney and Tyler Mahle would be one of the best in baseball. Unfortunately, both DeGrom and Scherzer will miss at least half of the season due to injury. DeGrom underwent Tommy John surgery after a season-ending elbow injury early on in 2023, and Scherzer is rehabbing a herniated disc.\n\nAt his peak, DeGrom was one of baseball\u2019s most dominant pitchers, but injuries have left him limited. Scherzer was among that same group of dominant pitchers, but age and injuries have slowed down the surefire Hall-of-Famer. Eovaldi has experienced his fair share of injuries as well, including two Tommy John surgeries earlier in his career and recent layoffs with elbow and shoulder pain. Mahle underwent Tommy John surgery last season as well and he won\u2019t be available until after the trade deadline.\n\nIf the Rangers can re-sign Jordan Montgomery who was a vital piece for them down the stretch after being acquired from the Cardinals, they\u2019ll be in a much better position. If not, this rotation lacks depth to begin the season and they may fall behind in making a postseason push.\n\nThe bullpen is also a major concern. Outside of Josh Sborz and Jos\u00e9 Leclerc, the Rangers lack high-leverage arms. Even Leclerc was shaky at times, including a blown save against the Astros in ALCS Game 5, when Altuve hit a go-ahead three-run homer in the ninth inning.\n\nThe Rangers have a surplus of major league talent but concerns regarding the rotation and bullpen will ultimately hold them back. The Rangers had a team ERA of 4.28 in 2023 which was in the bottom half of teams in baseball. Even more concerning, their bullpen put up a 4.77 ERA, the league\u2019s sixth-worst, near teams like the Angels, White Sox and Nationals. Their pitching struggles will only worsen as they continue to deal with injuries and inconsistency and they won\u2019t repeat their magical 2023 World Series run.\n\nLos Angeles Angels\n2023 Record: 73-89\nMy 2024 Projection: 79-83\n\nThe Angels are in a weird spot. They just lost Shohei Ohtani to the Dodgers in the biggest free agency signing in baseball history. However, they still have household names in Anaheim like Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon. Trout is still an elite bat, but has faded from his peak, MVP-type numbers. He\u2019s had serious injuries as well, missing half of last season and 126 games in 2021. Injuries have also prevented Rendon\u2019s contract from offering good value and whenever he does take the field, his power seems to have evaporated along with his ability to make consistent contact.\n\nThe rotation is a major question mark heading into spring training. The rotation of Reid Detmers, Patrick Sandoval, Tyler Anderson, Griffin Canning and Chase Silseth is the same squad they carried last season and produced bottom-of-the-barrel results. They were a bottom 10 team in ERA, hits, home runs and walks, playing a large role in their fourth-place divisional finish.\n\nAnderson seemed to have revived his career with the Dodgers in 2022 after posting a 2.57 ERA in 178.2 innings, but after signing a three-year deal with the Angels this past offseason, his ERA skyrocketed to 5.43. Sandoval had a similarly impressive 2022 as Anderson, posting a 2.91 ERA, but in 2023, it jumped to 4.11. If those two can return to form, alongside a breakout season from Detmers, Canning or Silseth, the Angels should win more games in 2024.\n\nPosition players like Taylor Ward and Brandon Drury have been quietly productive for the Angels, but after a surprising 2022 in which Ward contributed an .833 OPS, that mark dropped almost 70 points in 2023. Drury also missed time due to injury but still popped 26 home runs, good enough for second on the team.\n\nThe Angels did improve their bullpen with free agent signings Robert Stephenson and Matt Moore. In Stephenson\u2019s 2023 season with the Rays, he seemed to have turned his career around. In 28 innings with Tampa Bay after he was traded from the Pirates, he posted a 2.35 ERA backed up by a 2.45 FIP, or fielding independent pitching, which measures a pitcher\u2019s effectiveness at preventing home runs and causing strikeouts. Moore was arguably one of the Angels best relievers from last season, as he posted a 2.66 ERA with the team before being waived in a last-ditch August salary dump.\n\nThe Angels still have Carlos Estevez as well, who notched 31 saves last year. The team will also home prospects Logan O\u2019Hoppe, Nolan Schanuel and Zach Neto \u2014 all of whom made their big league debuts in 2023 \u2014 can continue to develop under new manager Ron Washington in a new era of Angels baseball.\n\nThe rotation should improve under new pitching coach Barry Enright but if the Halos can\u2019t keep the home runs and walks in check, their ceiling is limited. Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon will report to spring training fully healthy, but the Angels will be awfully careful in how they handle their stars\u2019 workloads. If the Angels remain healthy, they\u2019ll surpass my projected win total and possibly compete for a wild card spot. But being realistic, the Angels will deal with setbacks throughout the season.\n\nOakland Athletics\n2023 Record: 50-112\nMy 2024 Projection: 45-117\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see what the Oakland A\u2019s have become. With owner John Fisher wanting to move the A\u2019s to Las Vegas, he stripped their once talented roster to the bone to reduce payroll. The A\u2019s were playoff contenders as recently as 2021, but the 2024 season looks to a repeat of last season\u2019s disaster.\n\nThe A\u2019s roster is full of players most teams would have on their Triple-A affiliates. The only All-Star on last year\u2019s team was Brent Rooker who put up a great season, but outside of him, only Ryan Noda posted an OPS+ above 100, or league average, in a qualifying amount of games.\n\nThe lack of offense combined with the worst pitching staff in baseball produced a negative 339 run differential last season, by far the worst mark in the league. Outside of Paul Blackburn, the rest of the rotation looks grim. They limped to a 5.48 ERA and not a single starter pitched to a sub-4.3 ERA.\n\nOne intriguing arm is Mason Miller, who debuted in 2023 and impressed in his cameo. His season was cut short by an arm injury but he\u2019ll hopefully have a full season in 2024.\n\nOffensively, there are a couple of former prospects that have turned in quietly productive seasons. In 69 games last season, second baseman Zach Gelof had an .841 OPS and is projected to be at the top of the A\u2019s lineup. Ryan Noda has also flashed success with a .229/.365/.406 slashline, but dealt with huge strikeout numbers.\n\nOverall, there isn\u2019t much to say about this team heading into spring training. When the A\u2019s are competitive, Oakland fans have been revered for their energy and support for their team, but there\u2019s been a lack of reciprocation from ownership. Hopefully the move to Las Vegas will make the franchise more competitive, but as of now, Oakland is a baseball wasteland.\n```"}

Notably, graduate attacker Ella Heaney will return for one more year after completing her undergraduate studies in 2023. She started in all 20 of the Trojans\u2019 games last season and finished with 59 points, the second-highest on the team last season.\n\n\u201cMy team and the coaches made it an easy decision to come back,\u201d Heaney said. \u201cI\u2019m striving towards another year of awesomeness.\u201d\n\nIncluding Heaney, the Trojans will retain their top seven scorers from last season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hitting our peak at the right time,\u201d senior midfielder Claudia Shevitz said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to maintain our top form when it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Trojans will be without defenders Emma Wightman and Olivia Dooley, both of whom graduated. Wightman was an Intercollegiate Women\u2019s Lacrosse Coaches Association All-American last season, while Dooley forced a team-leading 44 turnovers.\n\nThe vacancies will require other players, such as junior defender Alexis Niblock and graduate defender Danielle Carson, to play bigger roles.\n\n\u201cNew people are ready to step up, and we\u2019re really excited for those players to get their opportunities,\u201d Munday said.\n\nIn the cage, senior goalie Kait Devir will return to document the team\u2019s season after posting a .453 save percentage with 116 saves last year. Devir contributed to the Trojans having the fifth-best scoring defense in the nation last season while vlogging the team\u2019s travels on YouTube.\n\nThe Trojans will kick off their season against the Army Black Knights on February 9. When USC plays its home opener on February 17, the team won\u2019t play at McAlister Field, the place that the Trojans have called home for the past 11 years. The new Rawlison Stadium will replace McAlister Field starting in 2025. So with the site under renovation for this season, USC will call two separate locations home: Dignity Health Sports Park and L.A. Memorial Coliseum.\n\nDignity Health Sports Park, home to the MLS\u2019s Los Angeles Galaxy and CSU Dominguez Hills, is located almost 13 miles away from McAlister in Carson, California. The Trojans will play five games at Dignity Health this season from mid-February to the end of March.\n\n\u201cWe have to adapt a little bit, but we\u2019re excited,\u201d Munday said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to play anywhere.\u201d\n\nUSC will begin conference play on March 16 against UC Davis, one of two new teams in the Pac-12. San Diego State is the other, whom the Trojans will play on April 27. Both the Aggies and the Aztecs joined the conference this year as part of an agreement signed in 2022 before the Pac-12 dissolved due to a mass exodus of its teams, USC included.\n\nUSC\u2019s final two home games (including Senior Day) and the Pac-12 Tournament will take place in the Coliseum, where the program played its first-ever game in 2013.\n\n\u201cBeing in the Coliseum for two really important regular season games and the tournament is really special,\u201d Shevitz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great legacy in the Coliseum, so we\u2019re super pumped.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans kick off their season at 2 p.m. in West Point, New York.\n```"}

With only seven weeks until Selection Sunday, the race for the best player in college basketball is heating up. Athletes from across the nation have shown their talent on the big stage. These players are the best of the best, and have been categorized into four tiers determining their ranking.\n\nHonorable mentions: These two players are leading top teams in the country, but have barely missed the podium. Cameron Brink, senior forward, Stanford women\u2019s basketball Brink has been a dominant force her entire collegiate career. Since enrolling at Stanford, Brink has dominated the paint, averaging three blocks and 8.7 rebounds in her career. She has also increased her scoring output every single season. This year, Brink is averaging career highs in nearly every statistical category, dropping 17.6 points, 11.9 rebounds and 3.5 blocks per game. Brink will be a formidable foe once she gets to the WNBA and is a projected top-three pick.\n\nRJ Davis, senior guard, North Carolina men\u2019s basketball After being a part of one of the most disappointing teams in all of college basketball last season, RJ Davis has erupted in his senior year, becoming a phenomenal point guard. Davis has solidified himself as one of the best scorers in the game, averaging a career high 21.5 points including a 36-point outing against Wake Forest. Davis and the Tar Heels look like they will go deep in March.\n\nPodium level players: Players on this level have outlasted tough competition, and have earned a spot in the third tier of college basketball players. Caleb Love, senior guard, Arizona men\u2019s basketball Love was RJ Davis\u2019 former backcourt mate at North Carolina, however Love entered the transfer portal after rumors of the two having a falling out. Love has flourished in his new role at Arizona, averaging career highs in both points per game and field goal percentage. Love scored 36 in a tough road game at Oregon two weeks ago, showing off his impressive offensive skill set. Head coach Tommy Lloyd has remade Love into a more confident player and the Wildcats are reaping the benefits.\n\nHannah Hidalgo, freshman guard, Notre Dame women\u2019s basketball Standing at only 5-foot-6, Hidalgo has already proved to be one of the best scorers in college basketball. Hidalgo has consistently scored 25 points on good efficiency all season, including 31 points against No.1 South Carolina and 34 against No. 11 UConn. The future of Notre Dame women\u2019s basketball is in good hands.\n\nAin\u2019t nothing wrong with second: These two are both in a tight race for the best player in college basketball, however are just slightly edged out by their competition. JuJu Watkins, freshman guard, USC women\u2019s basketball Watkins has been electric, winning Pac-12 Freshman of the Week every single week USC has played this season, while dominating the competition. Last week, Watkins nearly outscored the entire then-No. 4 Stanford women\u2019s basketball team, dropping 51 points to Stanford\u2019s 58, scoring 75% of USC\u2019s points. It was the most points by a D1 player this season. Watkins is an elite talent and has already broken countless records. She will be the best player in women\u2019s basketball, the only question is when.\n\nDalton Knecht, fifth-year guard, Tennessee men\u2019s basketball Knecht is incredibly easy to root for. Not heavily recruited out of high school, he started his career at a JUCO. He proved himself enough to get an invitation to the Big Sky conference, moving to Northern Colorado. Now in his fifth year, Knecht is at one of the best basketball schools in the country and is now one of the best players in the game. Knecht is averaging very similar stats to what he did at Northern Colorado, an impressive achievement considering the uptick in competition.\n\n\u201cIf you ain\u2019t first, you\u2019re last\u201d - Ricky Bobby This is the cream of the crop. These two should win National Player of the Year. Zach Edey, senior center, Purdue men\u2019s basketball Edey has had yet another dominant season for the Boilermakers. Averaging 23.4 points and 11.6 rebounds, he will undoubtedly carry Purdue to a high seed in March Madness. The star center has had a great year, although his team\u2019s history is scary. Purdue seems to fall apart on big stages, which begs the question whether he deserves this coveted crown. For now though, Edey still is near the top of the NCAA in both points and rebounds per game.\n\nCaitlin Clark, senior guard, Iowa women\u2019s basketball Clark is changing the narratives around women\u2019s basketball nearly by herself. She lives up to the hype. Her 32 points per game is out-of-this-world good. Her success has come efficiently too \u2014 she is shooting nearly 50% from the field. Clark\u2019s domination has not gone unnoticed by scouts, as she has been the presumed No. 1 in the WNBA draft for quite some time now. It would be a treat to see Watkins and Clark duke it out in March. Clark brings a fire like almost no other to basketball and may come in and immediately dominate the WNBA.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/05/here-are-the-top-10-looks-from-this-years-grammy-awards/", "response": "```\nHere are the top 10 looks from this year\u2019s Grammy Awards\n\nRain or shine, these celeb outfits made a mark on the red carpet.\n\nThe Grammys are the Super Bowl of music lovers \u2013 and fashion aficionados. But after a chaotic night filled with unexpected surprises, including, but not limited to a Taylor Swift album announcement, a chair-smashing rampage from Travis Scott and an Album of The Year snub according to Jay-Z, most of the outfits celebrities donned on this year\u2019s red carpet were left in the dust. The best looks withstood the night\u2019s shock-factor both inside and outside the Crypto.com Arena as torrential rainfall pummeled cities across the state. These outfits, which endured the elements, are deserving of their own award, so here are the top 10 looks of the night.\n\n10. Janelle Mon\u00e1e\n\n10-time Grammy nominee Janelle Mona\u00e9 is known for her attention-grabbing, out-of-the-box fashion choices. Sporting her signature black-and-white color palette for this year\u2019s red carpet, Mona\u00e9 sparkled in a black sequin embroidered Giorgio Armani Priv\u00e9 gown with silver embellishments and a sharp, plunging neckline. Mona\u00e9's look struck the perfect balance between her bold, expressive fashion sense, and the level of classic elegance traditionally expected at the awards show. While the singer-songwriter, nominated for album of the year and best progressive R&B album for their 2023 release \u201cThe Age of Pleasure\u201d did not walk away with the win in either category, their dazzling red carpet ensemble was enough to leave a lasting impression, even without a gold-plated trophy in hand.\n\n9. Alessandra Ambrosio\n\nTapping into the metallic trend that recently graced the Golden Globes red carpet, Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio wore a form-fitting Avellano silver ensemble with a long train. Complemented by a slicked-back hairstyle, the former Victoria\u2019s Secret model\u2019s clean-cut look turned heads. Although Ambrosio walked the carpet without a nomination \u2014 or a presence within the music industry whatsoever \u2014 the model managed to pull off one of the standout ensembles of the evening. Her gown offered a break from the complex patterns and beading that dominated this year\u2019s ceremony.\n\n8. Olivia Rodrigo\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\u2019s first-ever red carpet look at the Grammys, nearly two years ago, was unforgettable. In fact, the black and pink crystal-embellished Vivienne Westwood gown she wore in April of 2022 held a display at the Grammy Museum in downtown L.A. While the artist\u2019s choice of attire Sunday night may have appeared underwhelming in comparison to past red carpet looks, Rodrigo\u2019s natural elegance in this vintage Versace gown, a piece from the label\u2019s spring 1995 collection, was still praiseworthy. The gown, which the three-time Grammy winning artist playfully paired with a chunky blue sapphire ring and ruby earrings, featured a cascading pattern of red beading, and straps encased by metal rings. Despite not being one of the night\u2019s more exciting ensembles, the stylistic choice to opt for a clean, classic look reflected the singer\u2019s growing maturity as a lyricist and musician.\n\n7. Chlo\u00eb Bailey\n\nWhile Chlo\u00eb Bailey may have only shown up at the awards ceremony mainly in support of her sister Halle Bailey, who was nominated for Best R&B Song for her track \u201cAngel,\u201d the singer and actor\u2019s look still outshined most of the nominated celebrities who walked this year\u2019s carpet. With a history of sparkling from head-to-toe on the Grammys red carpet, this year was no exception \u2013 Bailey arrived in an intricately embellished, one-shouldered gown designed by Gaurav Gupta, complemented by gold platform pumps and a new cinnamon hair color. Even without a nomination, Bailey dazzled in this unforgettable, neutral-toned glitter ensemble.\n\n6. Madison Beer\n\nCounting on singer-songwriter Madison Beer to bring the coquette bow trend to the red carpet is always a safe bet. Known by many for the large hair bows and \u201cbabydoll\u201d attire she sported during her highly successful Life Support Tour that spanned from late 2021 to early 2022, Beer\u2019s attire, a custom Marmar Halim gown with a corseted bow bodice and full skirt, was not an out-of-character fashion choice. Beer\u2019s simple-yet-chic look embodied the color of the night \u2013 various shades of white \u2013 as worn by other notable musicians in attendance including Taylor Swift, Summer Walker and Boygenius. The artist\u2019s stunning, billowing gown served as proof that a red carpet look does not need to be over-the-top to make a statement.\n\n5. Paris Hilton\n\nAlmost any time Paris Hilton decides to grace the public with her presence, she will pull out all the stops in terms of style. Channeling \u201cmermaid goddess\u201d in this Reem Acra gown with seafoam green embellishments and side cutouts, Hilton brought a much-needed lively pop of color to the red carpet. Pairing the dress with a rhinestone-encrusted handbag from her own line to complete the ensemble, Hilton proved once again that she can and will deliver on a cohesive yet show-stopping look, while maintaining an element of fun with her wardrobe.\n\n4. Coco Jones\n\nWhile singer-songwriter and actress Coco Jones may have been a first-time Grammy nominee, she is no stranger to embracing a lavish look on the red carpet. The artist arrived in a dazzling light blue Celia Kritharioti gown, and left with the Grammy for Best R&B Performance for her track \u201cICU,\u201d beating out fellow nominees including Chris Brown and SZA. One of the most flattering looks of the night, this shimmering gown\u2019s balance of form-fitting and flowy create a cohesive silhouette that appears to be perfectly tailored for Jones. Accessorized with a Swarovski x SKIMS body chain, this breathtaking ensemble is the perfect combination of classic elegance and modern radiance.\n\n3. Paris Jackson\n\nCovering over 80 tattoos is no small feat. But leave it to the \u201cKing of Pop\u2019s\u201d daughter, Paris Jackson, to pull it off for the purpose of her Grammys red carpet look. Counterbalancing the white gown trend traceable across other celebrities\u2019 red carpet looks, the actor and model made a statement in an all-black asymmetrical Celine dress with a midriff cut-out. Jackson\u2019s attire exudes class and confidence, without overdoing it. Jackson\u2019s cohesive look on the red carpet was an unexpected standout from the night, but an effective reminder that sometimes, less is more when it comes to color and embellishment.\n\n2. Halle Bailey\n\nSparkling alongside her sister, Bailey looked angelic on the red carpet, embodying her Grammy-nominated track\u2019s title, \u201cAngel.\u201d The Best R&B Song nominee, who arrived fashionably late to the event, donned a glittering custom floor-length Gucci gown, accessorized with custom Pandora and Grete Henriette jewels. Bailey glowed on the red carpet in this opulent get-up, which featured a plunging neckline and reflective crystals from head-to-toe. While the artist may not have walked the Grammys stage to claim the award in her category, which ended up going to 24-time Grammy nominee SZA, the \u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d star\u2019s perfectly tailored, head-turning sheer ensemble was not overshadowed.\n\n1. Tyla\n\nAs it turns out, perhaps the best look at the biggest night in music was donned by an artist that didn\u2019t even walk the pre-show carpet. The \u201cWater\u201d singer\u2019s vibrant attire featured criss-crossing cutouts with crystalized net detailing and a thigh-high slit, complemented by a pair of strappy Rene Caovilla stilettos. Tyla\u2019s whimsical, fairylike ensemble offset the outright questionable choices that some celebrities, like Doja Cat, fearlessly embraced in their fashion statements. The singer-songwriter walked away as not only the Academy\u2019s first-ever African Music Performance Award recipient, but one of the best-dressed celebrities of the entire evening, with many fashion publications still praising her playful yet elegant look even the day after the event. While this year\u2019s red carpet looks certainly lacked in comparison to previous years, these celebrities still dazzled the night away.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Paulena Edelman February 05, 2024 at 12:02 pm PST\n\nThis year\u2019s 66th Grammys, like all the previous ones, provided two shows in one \u2013 the actual awards ceremony and the red carpet extravaganza. Whether watching in an elegant dress with an intricate updo at the Crypto.com Arena or from the comfort of a couch with a bowl of popcorn, many viewers anticipated Taylor Swift\u2019s fashionably late arrival.\n\nSwift, directed by her long-time stylist Joseph Cassel Falconer, wore a strapless, floor-length gown by Schiaparelli. She also donned black gloves reaching mid-way up her upper arms and accessorized by layering five necklaces, one of which was a watch choker.\n\nWhile Swift showed up in the antithesis of a black gown \u2014 the color scheme expected by the majority of the Swiftie population \u2014 her outfit choice still appeared to support the numerous Swiftie speculations about the seemingly inevitable \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d announcement. Seeing Swift wearing white sent fans into a spiral on social media, especially X, with Swifties immediately coming up with new theories.\n\nHer outfit seemed to be on theme with the recent change in her social media profile pictures from a colored photo to black and white and with the glitchiness of her website. Earlier in the day, Swift\u2019s website was down and showed an error message, including an anagram for the words \u201cred herring.\u201d\n\nThe Swifties may not have gotten the announcement they expected, but Swift did not disappoint with the reveal of her new album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d In retrospect, Swift\u2019s past Grammy looks, like her 2021 Oscar De La Renta dress, have complimented her better. However, her outfit was not lacking in elegance or easter eggs, giving her a one-night pass from critiques of needing a new stylist.\n\nA few celebrities weren\u2019t so lucky as they ran a little too far with the Grammys\u2019 trend of \u201canything goes.\u201d\n\nDawn Richard arrived on the red carpet wearing a fitted, red gown by Khosrov with major embellishments. Sprouting out of the straps of her dress were numerous red tree leaves, all coming together to form a canopy above Richard\u2019s head. The leaves captured the eye, drawing attention away from Richard and creating an overpowering look.\n\nYolanda Adams walked the red carpet wearing a satin, hot pink blazer dress with roses scattered across it in various locations. Underneath the blazer, she wore a sequined pantsuit resembling the color of Oscar the Grouch. Lastly, in an attempt to tie the whole look together, Adams wore satin pink heels, albeit a different shade of pink from the blazer.\n\nIce Spice matched her fire orange hair to the pieces of fur adorning the collar, middle of the top, and sleeve cuffs. Her casual denim outfit by Baby Phat was accessorized with a large belt buckle, what appeared to be a leather watch strap dangling from her right shoulder and a homemade-adjacent leg slit in the front.\n\nJacob Collier made his appearance in a suit clashing with a multitude of patterns. Underneath, he wore a hot pink turtleneck. Every aspect was fighting for attention, leaving the viewer unsure of which aspect to take in first.\n\nLauren Daigle wore a one-shoulder dress fashioned from navy blue tulle and an array of brightly colored threads. Some of the threads looked to be forming an embroidery pattern, while others looked tangled and haphazardly hot-glued. She accessorized with a Western-looking hat, pigtail braids, and layered numerous bracelets, presenting a very unclear aesthetic.\n\nSummer Walker, adorned in feathers head-to-toe, wore a strapless white gown by Usama Ishtay and a floppy hat to match. The ginormous hat and copious amounts of feathers drowned out the singer. Her outfit choice does beg the question... was she eating feathers all night?\n\nCharlotte Lawrence & Doja Cat were seemingly on the same dress code page. Lawrence and Doja Cat were in opposing colors, Lawrence in black and Doja Cat in beige. Lawrence wore a sheer off-the-shoulder dress by Rodarte. The floor-length gown was embellished with lace applique and silver glitter threading throughout. Doja Cat\u2019s Dilara Findikoglu gown followed the wildly popular corset trend, featured a train and looked to be made from organza. Ultimately, they both left little to everyone\u2019s imagination.\n\nView the full scope of red carpet looks here.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/05/shes-a-hater-experts-weigh-in-on-nikki-haleys-presidential-bid/", "response": "```\nUSC Center for the Political Future hosted a panel about the 2024 presidential primaries.\n\nUSC Center for the Political Future hosted a series of panels regarding the 2024 presidential election on Jan. 30. From left to right: John McConnell, Jane Coaston, Bob Shrum, Carissa Joy Smith, and Chris Cadelago. \n\nBy Shruthi Narayanan February 05, 2024 at 11:49 am PST\n\nA USC Center for the Political Future panelist said Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is staying in the race because \u201cshe\u2019s a hater.\u201d \u201cI think she recognizes that she will not win the nomination, but she is representative of a large constituency of people who do not like Donald Trump,\u201d said Jane Coaston, a libertarian New York Times podcast host and Center for the Political Future fellow.\n\nCoaston used sports to explain what she meant by Haley being a \u201chater\u201d: no matter the successes that your rival has, you still hate them, she said. \u201cShe understands that there is a constituency for her... she knows that for the eight people among the GOP who are going to vote for Trump, there are two who will never do so,\u201d Coaston said about the former South Carolina governor and Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nShe added that Haley is the first person who is responding to Trump \u201ccalling her birdbrain\u201d and \u201cmaking fun of her birthplace.\u201d \u201cShe is responding by saying, \u2018no, I\u2019m not going to just accede to this,\u2019\u201d Coaston said.\n\nThe USC Dornsife Center for Political Future hosted the annual Warschaw Conference on Practical Politics on Jan. 30 at USC. The four-panel event covering topics related to the 2024 presidential election was hosted jointly with POLITICO and Unite America.\n\nIn the first panel, \u201cPrimary Colors,\u201d panelists spoke about the presidential primaries with a focus on the Republican primaries. Elle Turp, a Canadian who did a Master\u2019s degree in American politics and attended all of the panels at the event, found this to be the most insightful moment of the panel.\n\n\u201cI thought it was such a great analogy... such a good representation of politics nowadays. And she explained it in a way that was so easy for people who aren\u2019t necessarily interested in politics to actually understand, like people who like sports,\u201d Turp said. \u201cThe second she said it, people understood.\u201d\n\nThe first panel was moderated by Bob Shrum, the director of the USC Center for the Political Future. Joining Coaston, the other panelists were Chris Cadelago, POLITICO\u2019s California bureau chief; John McConnell, a former presidential and vice presidential speechwriter; and Carissa Joy Smith, the vice president of FOX Government Relations.\n\nTwo Republican primaries had occurred as of the time of the panel: the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary. In both of them, former president Donald Trump significantly won. McConnell added during the panel that the primaries are likely already over.\n\nIn an interview conducted afterwards, Cadelago noted the opposite of what was said at the beginning of the panel \u2014 that the primaries are far from over, using Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign as an example.\n\n\u201cI think we have to really keep an open mind about what possibilities might be out there,\u201d Cadelago said. \u201cAnd not just think that because things are going one way right now that that will continue.\u201d\n\nCoaston said in an interview after the panel that she finds the primaries interesting because it shows \u201cwhat people are valuing in their decision process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think too often we forget that politics is a process. What we\u2019re trying to do is elect people who are going to do things that are good for people,\u201d Coaston said. She elaborated using another analogy, this time with pancakes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, I don\u2019t really care how you make me pancakes, I would like pancakes. We focus too much on the process of making pancakes and not enough on pancakes.\u201d```"}

Here is what you missed.\n\nSZA accepts the award for best R&B song for \"Snooze\" during the 66th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Victoria Laursen February 05, 2024 at 10:27 am PST\n\nThe 66th Grammy Awards took place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. There were so many fantastic and questionable moments at the award show, from Dua Lipa opening the show by debuting her new song \u201cTraining Season\u201d to Celine Dion\u2019s surprise appearance awarding Album of the Year. Here are some of the highlights and can\u2019t-miss moments from the awards show.\n\nBest Moments\n\n1. Taylor Swift makes history\nIt comes as no surprise that Taylor Swift won two Grammys: Best Pop Vocal and Album of the Year. Swift\u2019s win for Album of the Year was her fourth time winning the coveted award, making her the only artist to ever win the award four times. Before winning this award she was tied with Frank Sinatra, Paul Simion and Stevie Wonder. In additional Swiftie news, the singer announced her new album \u201cThe Tortured Poet Department\u201d set to come out April 19, while accepting her thirteenth Grammy, which is her lucky number.\n\n2. Special performance from Joni Mitchell\nJoni Mitchell has been an icon in the music industry since her debut in the 1960s for her folk music. Mitchell, 80, made her performance debut at the Grammys on Sunday. Not only does her age make this performance extra special, but also since she suffered a brain aneurysm in 2015. After surgery, Mitchell initially \u201clost her ability to speak and walk,\u201d according to Premier Health. Mitchell\u2019s ability to regain singing skills is impressive, and her performance did not disappoint, the crowd gave her a standing ovation. The night was extra special for Mitchell since she won Best Folk Album.\n\n3. Memoriam Tribute remembers icons\nEvery award show typically has an \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d tribute to honor those in the industry who have passed the year prior. While the concept is nice, this part of the ceremony tends to be dull, with simply a slideshow and sad music in the background. This year, the network stepped it up by having multiple artists such as Stevie Wonder, Annie Lennox, Jon Batiste and Fantasia Barrino perform. These performers sang covers by Tony Bennett, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Tina Turner and many more. Oprah Winfrey even made an appearance during this segment when announcing the Tina Turner tribute. The segment was overall lively and truly was a celebration of life.\n\n4. Tracy Chapman\u2019s comeback\nOne of the most stunning performances of the night was by Tracy Chapman of her famed song \u201cFast Car\u201d with Luke Combs. Chapman has been out of the public eye since her last tour in 2009, and it\u2019s been 15 years since she last released an album. Chapman performed with Luke Combs since Comb\u2019s cover of the hit reached the number-one spot on the Billboard Hot Country Songs. The stage design was minimalist which allowed for their voices to shine and the crowd loved their performance.\n\n5. Women dominated nominations and wins\nThe 2024 Grammys was female-dominated, from the performances to the nominees to the winners. Record of the Year and Album of the Year had all female nominees, except for one male, Jon Batiste. This is noteworthy since the Recording Academy has predominantly overlooked women in all categories in its history. To have a majority of female nominees for Record and Album of the Year is amazing. Out of a total of 49 categories, 25 of those were won by a female, which was a lot larger than past years.\n\nWorst Moments\n\n1. Dave Chappelle\u2019s win sparks controversy\nThe comedian Dave Chappelle is always in some controversy; when has he ever done anything that wasn\u2019t controversial? He won for Best Comedy Album for \u201cWhat\u2019s in a Name?\u201d against other comedians such as Chris Rock and Trevor Noah, the evening\u2019s host. The presenter of this award, Rufus Wainwright, accepted the award on Chappelle\u2019s behalf since he wasn\u2019t in attendance. In the comedy special, Chappel defends another one of his comedy specials, \u201cThe Closer\u201d which targeted transgender people. He stated that he is on \u201cteam TERF\u201d which is an acronym for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d LGBTQ+ advocate, Dr. David J. Johns, has expressed on social media that it is \u201cdeeply disappointing that Netflix allowed Dave Chappelle\u2019s lazy and hostile transphobia and homophobia to air on its platform.\u201d\n\n2. Killer Mike won...then got handcuffed\nThe winner of Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song was Killer Mike, who was awarded these wins during the untelevised portion of the Grammys. The show started at 5 p.m. PT and according to Variety, he was detained at 4:22 p.m. He was escorted by police out of the award ceremony after LAPD confirmed he was being arrested for misdemeanor and battery. The rapper\u2019s lawyer made a statement stating that the rapper was later released and told Variety Mike was planning on celebrating his sweep.\n\n3. Meryl Steep missed a chance to get closer to EGOT status\nMeryl Steep is a legend of Hollywood, she has won an impressive amount of Oscars and an Emmy, but this legend hasn\u2019t gotten that title of an EGOT-winner yet. Streep was nominated for Best Audio Book, Narration and Storytelling Recording, which Michelle Obama won (You can\u2019t be mad at Michelle). Unfortunately, Steep did not get one step closer to winning the EGOT title, but we can hope it\u2019s still a possibility.\n\n4. Jay-Z\u2019s acceptance speech was a hot mess\nWhile Jay-Z was accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, he didn\u2019t give a well-put-together speech. The main points in his speech were criticizing the Academy for traditionally snubbing Black artists and boycotting the Grammys. He definitely made some great points, but he didn\u2019t have to drag Beyonc\u00e9, we all remember how many Album of the Year\u2019s she\u2019s lost. Overall, his speech was chaotic and didn\u2019t live up to the prize he was receiving.\n\n5. Award ceremonies are tiring\nAll award shows tend to be extremely long, this year\u2019s ceremony was three and a half hours long. There isn\u2019t much flexibility for these live shows, since they incorporate performances, acceptance speeches and crowd work. Even though Trevor Noah did a fantastic job hosting, his crowd work can leave viewers with second-hand embarrassment or simply bore them; if the chemistry isn\u2019t there, it doesn\u2019t work. The pre-taped video segments before the performances were also unnecessary; it made the show much longer than it needed to be.\n```"}

It\u2019s called the \u2018Tortured Poets Department.\u2019 I\u2019m going to go and post the cover right now backstage.\u201d Just as she promised, the album art was posted on her social media channels just seconds after she accepted the award. \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and poetry...,\u201d read the caption.\n\nThe singer-songwriter also won Album of the Year on Sunday, making her the only artist to snag the coveted award four times in her career. The announcement of her 11th studio album came as a surprise to Swift\u2019s dedicated fanbase, who expected the singer-songwriter to announce the release of \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d at the awards show.\n\nTheories and speculation about Swift\u2019s every move, outfit, social media habits and more circulated on social media days before the show and came to a head on Sunday when Swift\u2019s website was reportedly \u201cdown.\u201d The site posted an error message earlier on Sunday, with one notable line of the message that the letters \u201chneriergrd,\u201d which fans understood to be \u201cred herring\u201d once unscrambled.\n\nAfter online discourse about the website exploded on Sunday morning, Taylor Nation, which is essentially an extension of the star\u2019s media team, liked tweets about the website intentionally displaying the error message. The website\u2019s message, along with many of the other moves Swift had been making as of late, indeed turned out to be misleading fans into thinking about \u201cReputation.\u201d\n\nThe first \u201cReputation-coded\u201d hint for many fans came as many of Swift\u2019s friends, including her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, changed their profile pictures on social media to have a black and white filter, \u00e0 la the original album cover for \u201cReputation.\u201d Swift completed the cycle of the black and white transition on Sunday morning, much to the delight of her fans, but the switch still alluded to her announcement, as the \u201cTortured Poets Department\u201d art sticks to a black-and-white scheme.\n\nThe many snake-inspired green and black looks Swift has worn over the past couple of months also alluded to an upcoming release of the re-recorded fan-favorite album. Even with the meticulous tracking of Easter eggs and hints that all happened to be a \u201cred herring,\u201d fans are buzzing about the announcement \u2014 some with excitement, and some with disappointment.\n\nThe official account for Rolling Stone Magazine on X posted \u201cyou have got to be f***ing kidding\u201d immediately following the announcement. Some Swifties, who laud the 2017 album as their favorite, echoed the sentiment. Still, the majority of fans reacted positively to the announcement, eager to hear new music from the self-proclaimed \u201cChairman of The Tortured Poets Department.\u201d\n\nPOV: Taylor announces TS 11 and you\u2019re in a room full of swifties #Grammys #TaylorSwift #GRAMMYs2024 #thetorturedpoetsdepartment pic.twitter.com/uLgJcVeUGs \u2014 Nicole (Taylor\u2019s Version) (@swiftienikki21) February 5, 2024\n```"}

The 150-lap race around a quarter-mile track is unlike any other race in the NASCAR Cup Series and is by far the shortest track used by the racing association \u2014 the next shortest track is Martinsville Speedway, which is just over a half mile. But now, with the contract between the Busch Light Clash and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum ending after three years and the Auto Club Speedway \u2014 which hosted NASCAR races for over 20 years \u2014 situation still in flux, NASCAR\u2019s future in Southern California is unknown.\n\nThis comes after NASCAR courted Southern California residents, some of whom had never watched a race prior to the Clash coming to the Coliseum, for three years. Now, that fandom might be ripped away if NASCAR chooses to move the Clash to another venue.\n\nWith the sport\u2019s future in Southern California unclear and uncertain, drivers commented on the Clash at the Coliseum after potentially their last spin around the famous stadium.\n\n\u201cI think it was a success,\u201d Denny Hamlin (No. 11), the winner of the 2024 Clash, said. \u201cCertainly, you can\u2019t argue it from a viewership standpoint. I certainly think it\u2019s got merit in going different places. But I think L.A. was very good to us, and I think we were good for this community as well. If you look around at the stands, it\u2019s more diverse than what you see at most racetracks.\u201d\n\nBefore the Clash was at the Coliseum, it was held at Daytona and the jump to L.A. instantly improved the race\u2019s ratings. The 2022 version of the Clash reached 4.28 million household viewers, the best audience for the Clash since 2016. While viewing numbers dipped in 2023, the fact the 2022 edition could garner that much support in its first year at the Coliseum surprised drivers.\n\n\u201cI would have never expected the first year that it would have been as legit as it is and the atmosphere is great. I was not expecting the atmosphere to even be this cool tonight,\u201d Kyle Larson (No. 5). \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a place for this style event, I think, in our sport. ... They\u2019ve proven that they can do it. They\u2019ve proven that they can get a crowd.\u201d\n\nThe event provided those large crowds with something different and reached a whole new group of people. With how small the track at the Coliseum is, the cars are much closer to each other, inviting more bumping, scraping and jostling. It\u2019s a much different sport than driving at a racetrack like the Daytona International Speedway, a 2.5-mile track.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very entertaining. Sometimes it\u2019s real frustrating when you\u2019re out there because it\u2019s a tight bullring and you\u2019ve got big cars and they\u2019re sliding around,\u201d Joey Logano (No. 22), the winner of the inaugural 2022 Clash at the Coliseum said. \u201cBut I know from rewatching races and sitting in the grandstands for one of the [Last-Chance Qualifiers] last year or a couple years ago, it was like, \u2018this is really entertaining to watch.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Cup Series race was quickly followed up with the King Taco LA Batalla, a NASCAR Mexico Series race. Entry to the Clash and LA Batalla was free of charge after NASCAR moved both races from Sunday up to Saturday due to inclement weather, giving fans the ability to see two different types of racing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different demographic, and the way they kind of pulled the trigger on [Saturday] trying to get it in, I think that was really smart by NASCAR,\u201d Ryan Blaney (No. 12) said. \u201cMaybe it doesn\u2019t show in the stands just because of what it was, but it gets a lot of support, and then also to have the NASCAR Mexico Series here too, is good as well, to kind of grow their side.\u201d\n\nWhile NASCAR might not return to the one-of-a-kind track inside the Coliseum, it opens up opportunities for other seemingly crazy ideas for race locations. Before the home of USC football agreed to build a track inside the stadium, no one imagined a race track which does not even have enough space for normal pit stops would work. Now, NASCAR has the chance to take its ingenuity and find another unique host site, if it chooses to not renew its contract with the Coliseum.\n\n\u201cKind of opens up the box a little bit on where else we can do events like this,\u201d Kyle Busch (No. 8) said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s been a real test of whether or not we\u2019re capable at these types of tracks. It always kind of turns into a little bit of calamity there. It did a little bit there towards the end. We always kind of expect that.\u201d\n\nThere is no clear answer as to where the Busch Light Clash will take place next year, but at the very least, the Coliseum experiment showed NASCAR can be creative with its race designs and tap into new markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very diverse crowd out there,\u201d Larson said. \u201cI hope they can take this kind of model and move it around and grow it and try and broaden our fan base some.\u201d\n\nThe potentially final Clash at the Coliseum provided some surprises, and it will not be one to forget. The three-year experiment will be something to learn from. But for the time being, fans will have to wait to find out what the future of the Clash holds. The next big NASCAR race is more of a classic \u2014 the Daytona 500 takes place February 18 as Hamlin, Larson, Logano, Blaney and Busch will all look to stake their claim as the cream of the NASCAR crop.\n```"}

Armed with my laptop and a notebook, I sat down with an ambitious goal: watch the entire season from start to finish. That night, I was seeing most of the episodes for my second, third or even fourth time, but I hoped that this viewing would help me gain clarity on a show that has received thoroughly mixed feedback from long-time fans and new viewers alike.\n\nHowever, more than five hours later, as I flipped through my notes, I found them largely unusable. I hadn\u2019t written positively about the show, but I hadn\u2019t written negatively about it either. What I had written was a six-page catalog keeping track of where the show had chosen to stick to its source material and where it had chosen to deviate. I wasn\u2019t a viewer looking for enjoyment; I was a judge weighing two scales: accuracy vs inaccuracy.\n\nIt seemed I was on my way to some grand tally; I would add it all up and declare my ruling. Had the show stayed close enough to declare it a success, or had the beloved children\u2019s series stumbled yet again on its quest for the perfect adaptation?\n\nSince the release of the first \u201cPercy Jackson and the Olympians\u201d book in 2005, author Rick Riordan has taken what started as a bedtime story to his young son and grown it into an empire. The five-book series, which follows a young boy\u2019s attempts to navigate a magical and dangerous world after learning that his absent father is actually a Greek God, has been followed by three direct spin-off series, two loosely connected series (exploring Egyptian and Norse mythology), several stand-alone books and a multitude of short stories all existing within the same fictional universe.\n\nAccording to Riordan\u2019s website, \u201cover 190 million copies of his books are in print worldwide.\u201d Only five years after the first book\u2019s release, a movie adaptation of it, \u201cPercy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief,\u201d was released by 20th Century Studios. Directed by children\u2019s book adaptation veteran Chris Columbus (\u201cHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d), the movie was a financial success, grossing over $226 million worldwide on a budget of $95 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nDespite its financial success, the film received heavy criticism from fans, and only one more movie was made, leaving the series incomplete. Riordan himself has been public about his dislike of the films, which aged Percy up from twelve to sixteen and restructured most of the plot. On X (formally known as Twitter), Riordan describes the films as \u201cmy life\u2019s work going through a meat grinder,\u201d in a now deleted post.\n\nDespite this initial failure with the fanbase, another adaptation was quick to follow. \u201cThe Lighting Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical\u201d debuted in 2016, and after several versions and two tours, the show arrived on Broadway in October 2019. The show is proudly low-tech, with Percy\u2019s iconic water powers represented by toilet paper rolls attached to the ends of leaf blowers. With a one to two-hour runtime, depending on the version, the show cuts out much of the book, but what it keeps stays very similar.\n\nWith a heavy comedy lean, a rock music style, and an exemplary performance by Chis McCarrell as Percy, the show stole the hearts of many fans and has even been occasionally endorsed by Riordan, who, despite his endorsements, never saw the show.\n\nWhile the musical was a success, the fanbase was still unsatisfied, and when Disney acquired 20th Century Fox (who still held the film rights) in March of 2019, there were immediate requests from fans online for Disney to adapt the series. As of this writing, the hashtag \u201cdisneyadaptpercyjackson\u201d has over 30,000 posts on Instagram.\n\nFan\u2019s efforts paid off, and in 2020, Disney+ announced that the first book would be adapted into an original series. Riordan, credited on the show as a writer, creator and executive producer, heavily advertised the show on his social media and blog and stressed it as an adaptation that would \u201cstick to the book\u201d before its release.\n\nIn many ways, they stuck to this promise. This adaptation is notably the first to feature age-accurate actors to the book, include a few significant subplots, and stick to the book\u2019s \u2018road-trip\u2019 plot structure. In many other ways, however, the show shifts away from the book and the adaptations that came before it.\n\nThe show leans into its drama far more than its comedy, with the occasional joke breaking up a series of serious conversations and life-threatening situations. The show\u2019s characters, while age-accurate, are also deeply conflicted and complex. In the first episode, \u201cI Accidentally Vaporize My Pre-Algebra Teacher,\u201d Percy confesses to his mother that he has been having what he believes are hallucinations and openly expresses his fear that something inside of him has \u201cbroken.\u201d\n\nThe show also frames the Gods as being the main obstacle that the kids come up against. Rather than paralleling their parents, the kids are a closer comparison to the monsters. In episode three, \u201cWe Visit The Garden Gnome Emporium,\u201d Medusa tries to convince Percy\u2019s quest companion, Annabeth Chase, that her mother, Greek Goddess Athena (who turned Medusa into a monster), will cast her out after the slightest embarrassment. She compares herself to Annabeth, saying, \u201cI wasn\u2019t like you, sweetheart. I was you.\u201d Annabeth rejects this idea, but the show largely reinforces it, with most of Medusa\u2019s predictions coming true in the following episode.\n\nPercy is viewed as the story\u2019s hero not for his fighting prowess, which he largely lacks, but for having a personality and moral code that is completely opposite that of the Gods. Previous renditions have been about a boy trying to survive the next monster attack; the show is about a boy trying to survive his family with his good heart intact.\n\nThe show also made more minor changes, from character beats (usually timid Grover\u2019s bold conversation with the God Ares is an interesting example) to costuming. In my attempt to separate the adaptations into their own works, I hesitate to mention them. I do so only to note that these small production changes seemed to fuel as much discourse online as the significant, thematic changes.\n\nI would have considered it all white noise, people looking for something to be unhappy about, but Riordan\u2019s online defensive positions on such disparities seem to give them some legitimacy. \u201cThere simply aren\u2019t enough filming days to do everything,\u201d Riordan wrote in one Instagram post over a change that I, in all of my cataloging, had not noticed.\n\nBeyond these niche complaints, people inside and outside the fanbase have aired genuine criticisms over the show\u2019s odd pacing and occasionally awkward cinematography. If Riordan and the creative team behind the show plan to ride this out for the full five seasons, it might be wise of them to stop seeing the nitpicking as worthy of a response and start looking at what they can do to improve the show itself.\n\nNow, I return to my scales (if I ever left them in the first place) and find that there is only one thing in them: tipping them so heavily in the positive direction that no mistake can be made. If someone asked me to form a hypothesis as to why the Percy Jackson books have become so beloved, I could give them fifty pages. I could talk about the pacing, world-building, humor and characters. But, if an adult came to me and asked me why they should give the books to their kids, my answer would be very short.\n\nShow it to your kids because Percy Jackson will teach them that despite their youth, they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness; it teaches kids that they can be better than the adults in their lives. Percy Jackson tells them that they exist outside of the grade they got in U.S. History; it tells them that they are capable of changing their situation. That is what tips the scales for me: the message. The show is loyal to the message, and if a new generation of young kids can be empowered by it, I can undoubtedly handle how the characters pronounce \u201cThalia.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy James Bao\nFebruary 04, 2024 at 4:37 pm PST\n\nFreshman phenom JuJu Watkins doesn\u2019t need any breaks. She played all 40 minutes to lead the Trojans in a 79-69 comeback win against the Cal Golden Bears on Sunday, completing USC\u2019s first road sweep in the Bay Area since 2001.\n\nThe game against Cal was far from just a routine road matchup for USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb. It was a return to her former team, where she spent eight seasons from 2011-19 and took the Golden Bears to the Final Four in 2013.\n\n\u201cI thought [Cal] came out with a great gameplan, with great energy, the crowd was terrific,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt made me proud to have Cal in my history.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t looking too good for the Trojans in Gottlieb\u2019s return, as the Golden Bears quickly went on a scoring run to start off the game. The Cal big three of graduate guard Ioanna Krimili, junior forward Marta Suarez and graduate guard Leilani McIntosh all scored within the first three minutes.\n\nThe Golden Bears\u2019 barrage of 3-pointers from their trio fueled their quick scoring sprees. Kriimli led the charge with three triples, and the team sank six of their 10 total 3-pointers for the game in just the opening period.\n\nThe Trojans knew exactly what they had to do after trailing by 11 heading into the second quarter \u2013 find Watkins. Watkins, held to a mere two points in the first ten minutes, erupted just when the Bears thought they had her contained.\n\nThe nation\u2019s second-leading scorer reminded everyone why she\u2019s so dangerous. The talented guard weaved through defenders and found the bottom of the net repeatedly. Her 14 points, combined with graduate guard McKenzie Forbes\u2019 six points, narrowed an 11-point deficit to two by halftime.\n\n\u201cI know everyone\u2019s going to talk about Ju\u2019s 51,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cBut I was as impressed with today\u2019s performance, as she made every right read and a million great decisions.\u201d\n\nA full-court defense from the Trojans picked up the intensity, and it became evident that the Golden Bears weren\u2019t ready for the physicality. They committed five of their 14 total turnovers in the second quarter.\n\nGraduate guard Kayla Padilla shined in the third and shifted the momentum to the Trojans\u2019 way. She converted two shots from deep, one of which was an and-one that translated into a five-point play after Watkins made a jumper off of the missed free throw.\n\nDespite hot hands, the odds were still against USC, which trailed 61-58 after three quarters. The Trojans entered Sunday 0-4 this season when behind to start the final period.\n\nIt took a team effort to beat the curse. With the Golden Bears throwing their full house onto Watkins whenever she touched the ball, other Trojans opened up and Watkins found them. Forbes and Watkins both finished with a game-high five assists.\n\n\u201cWe had fight,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI thought we had contributions from everyone.\u201d\n\nCal constantly tried to channel Watkins to her weaker side, but that allowed her to drive to the basket for either an easy dish to junior center Rayah Marshall or a layup.\n\nWatkins had yet another impressive outing, racking up a game-high 29 points, four rebounds and five assists. The Trojans took a two-possession lead with one minute left in the game as the Bears desperately looked for opportunities.\n\nMissing their final attempts, Cal resorted to late-game fouling; free throws from Forbes and senior guard Kayla Williams sealed the comeback win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to get a Bay sweep \u2014 it\u2019s really significant for me and the team,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nUSC (16-4, 6-4 Pac-12) will look to continue its win streak against Arizona State on Friday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.\n```"}

Makk\u2019s two aces in the last game helped sweep the match from UNLV\u2019s feet in under 30 minutes, giving freshman Volodymyr Iakubenko and graduate student Samuel Rubell the momentum to pull off a close 7-5 win that clinched the doubles point for the Trojans.\n\nUSC\u2019s momentum didn\u2019t stop there.

More cities across the U.S. are cracking down on homeless tent encampments that have grown more visible and become unsafe. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)\n\nBy Abigail Rawlinson February 04, 2024 at 4:12 pm PST\n\nThe United States Supreme Court is set to review the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, a critical homelessness case, during its current term. The court has not taken up a similar case about homelessness in many years.\n\nThe city of Grants Pass, Oregon, located off of the I-5 freeway in the southwest corner of the state, is home to a homeless population of about 600. The city\u2019s local municipal code includes several provisions relating to homelessness, particularly concerning camping and outdoor sleeping and such permissible locations, which, if violated repeatedly, permit the city to issue fines or to bar individuals from city property.\n\nJohnson v. City of Grants Pass concerns the constitutionality of such codes. In 2018, the 9th Circuit, in Martin v. City of Boise, held that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Martin ruling, a group in 2018 filed Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, stating that the cities\u2019 local camping and sleeping ordinances and fines conflicted with the findings of Martin, particularly given the inequity of fewer beds than the number of homeless people in Grants Pass.\n\nIn the filing, the plaintiffs challenged five municipal ordinances: \u201can \u2018anti-sleeping\u2019 ordinance, two \u2018anti-camping\u2019 ordinances, a \u2018park exclusion\u2019 ordinance, and a \u2018park exclusion appeals\u2019 ordinance.\u201d\n\nWhen heard by the 9th Circuit, the lower court affirmed its Martin decision that these ordinances were unconstitutional and Grants Pass could not punish homeless people since they exceeded the number of homeless individuals than what local shelters could accommodate.\n\nNow, the Supreme Court will hear Johnson v. City of Grants Pass this term and will rule on the constitutionality of the local ordinances and cities\u2019 ability to fine or publish homeless people for camping or sleeping in public spaces.\n\n\u201cThe Court\u2019s ruling will have a tremendous impact on the 250,000 people who sleep outside on a given night,\u201d said The National Homelessness Law Center in a press release. \u201cWe are confident that the court will affirm what we have said for years: the solution to homelessness is housing, not jail cells or courtrooms.\u201d\n\nGiven the considerable interest in the case, cities, activist groups, and key stakeholders will be listening to hear how the conservative majority of the court will rule when arguments proceed.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nFebruary 04, 2024 at 12:11 am PST\n\nAfter losing the lead early, Denny Hamlin stormed back to win the 2024 Clash at the Coliseum in a two-lap shootout. The biggest story of the day wasn\u2019t necessarily Hamlin\u2019s win, but the mere fact that the race happened. Originally scheduled for Sunday, NASCAR moved the Clash forward more than 24 hours to avoid tomorrow\u2019s storms, a move which even drivers didn\u2019t expect.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome. I was not planning on racing anything other than a heat race today and had no thought that \u2014 like running the whole race was actually an option,\u201d Kyle Larson (No. 5) said. \u201cCliff [Daniels, Larson\u2019s crew chief] had asked me if I had heard the rumors or whatever around 11:30 or so, and that got me excited.\u201d\n\nHamlin, the driver of the No. 11 car, started the race from pole position and lost the lead to Joey Logano (No. 22) on the first lap, but regained it very quickly and controlled the early stages. The race quickly became processional, with the front of the field largely settling in until Hamlin caught lapped traffic.\n\nTy Gibbs (No. 54) managed to push past his teammate on lap 50 and quickly opened a gap to second. After losing the lead, Hamlin plummeted, falling all the way to seventh before the first caution of the race came out at lap 70.\n\nWith five laps before the halftime break intended for the canceled Machine Gun Kelly concert, the race found its first chaos of the day. Gibbs was eaten up on the restart, with Logano taking the lead on the inside and Kyle Busch (No. 8) getting around Gibbs on the outside. With only one turn before the end of the first half, John Hunter Nemechek (No. 42) was helped to face the wrong direction, bringing out another caution.\n\nThe caution left one more lap on the board before the break. That gave drivers the chance to shake things up a bit more, but Logano was able to keep the lead.\n\nChaos continued when the race resumed. Logano narrowly kept the lead on the restart before Tyler Reddick (No. 45) accidentally spun his teammate, Bubba Wallace (No. 23). On the following restart, Logano couldn\u2019t keep the lead. Gibbs squeaked ahead before yet another caution flew.\n\nAfter that restart, Gibbs was electric. He quickly opened up a gap of around half the frontstretch to Logano in second, which was well-timed as it coincided with the longest green flag run of the second half. From the restart on lap 78, the race stayed green until 140.\n\nThe restart allowed Hamlin, who had gradually worked his way through the field under green, to pounce on Gibbs, taking the lead with 10 to go. Although he locked his brakes on almost every lap, Hamlin held the lead until Gibbs, the long-time leader, found himself facing the wrong direction after contact from Larson.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know [my brakes were] locking. I could feel it locking up but I didn\u2019t see the smoke or know how bad it was,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cOnce I did it one good time, that was it. I was destined to do it just about every corner unless I really backed up my braking, and then I was going to get run over anyway. I just said, \u2018screw it. Hopefully the tire stays together.\u2019\u201d\n\nHamlin faced immediate pressure from Busch in second and Ryan Blaney (No. 12), who started last after only making the race because he was guaranteed a spot as last year\u2019s champion, in third. Despite his brakes still locking at every opportunity, he managed to hold the two off to win the third rendition of the Clash at the Coliseum.\n\n\u201cI only controlled a couple of the restarts, but obviously I didn\u2019t do a great job because I kept overshooting the corner,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cThe restarts are tough, especially at this track where you have high braking. The second- and third-place car don\u2019t care about your agenda, and they\u2019re just going to run through you and force you up off the bottom, and that\u2019s how most of the passes get made here.\u201d\n\nWhile it was less of a race of attrition than last year, this year\u2019s Clash still featured copious contact. Blaney credited staying away from the trouble with his last-to-third drive.\n\n\u201cWe did a good job all night just kind of staying clean, and our car was fast,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cI think every time I\u2019ve been spun backwards about two or three times, so it\u2019s not nice to have that one at the last one.\u201d\n\nThe stands were far emptier tonight than in previous years, but Hamlin said that didn\u2019t sour the event.\n\n\u201cI think we should consider tonight a success, only because if it didn\u2019t happen tonight, I just didn\u2019t think it was going to happen at all,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cThere would be some people that were upset about not being able to use their ticket for tomorrow, they weren\u2019t going to use it Monday, either, and Tuesday I\u2019m not sure was an option.\u201d\n\nLarson agreed.\n\n\u201cHappy that they were able to do that, and obviously I\u2019m sure they take a huge financial hit, NASCAR does, but I think at the same point, the crowd is awesome out there for a spur-of-the-moment race and free admission and all that, so hopefully a lot of these fans who have never been to a race before will now fall in love with the sport and venture out and kind of grow from there. Maybe this could accidentally work out really well for NASCAR.\u201d\n\nNASCAR\u2019s contract with the Coliseum has ended; this race\u2019s future in flux. Auto Club Speedway\u2019s renovation is expected to stretch beyond the 2025 season. It remains to be seen when the sport will return to Southern California.\n\nThe NASCAR season kicks into gear February 18 with the Daytona 500, its flagship race.\n```"}

After months of anticipation and stress, SJM fans have secured access to the highly anticipated book, \u201cHouse of Flame and Shadow.\u201d \n\nSarah J. Maas, dubbed \u201cBookTok\u2019s reigning romantasy queen\u201d has built three separate worlds spanning three different series and 16 books. Her first book, \u201cThrone of Glass\u201d was published in 2012 when Maas was just 26. Now, 12 years later, Maas has created an empire and amassed a loyal following. With over 38 million copies of her books sold, she continues to thrill \u201cromantasy\u201d fans around the world.\n\nWhile official book sales have not been released, it\u2019s clear that copious amounts of copies have been sold. According to Goodreads, just one day following the release of HOFAS, there were 41,700 people reading it. Two days later, that number jumped to 106,000 people. During the first half of 2023, Sarah J. Maas\u2019 sales increased by 79%, resulting in the \u201cHarry Potter effect\u201d for Bloomsbury Publishing, according to Time.\n\n\u201cBooktok,\u201d a community on TikTok, has accumulated over 220 billion viewers.

In theory, the reader would have their SJM knowledge refreshed and be prepared to read HOFAS starting on Jan. 30.\n\nSome fans joked about taking off work, with one TikToker even drafting an email to her boss through ChatGPT. Others made jokes a reality and took a day off, according to an attendee who spoke to Vulture at the midnight release at the Union Square Barnes & Noble.\n\nMaas and Bloomsbury Publishing first began teasing fans in late August, posting a video of people at Waterstones reciting the first line of the book. On Jan. 10, Maas released another line. Finally, on Jan. 25, Maas shared the ultimate teaser, releasing the prologue and first chapter on her website. This, along with a timer counting down on her website, sent fans reeling.\n\nAt the stroke of midnight on Jan. 30, 2024, fans held \u201cMidnight Maas\u201d and attended book release parties. Despite frigid temperatures, people waited outside for the chance to celebrate at various locations. At one such location, the Book Club Bar in New York, Maas made a surprise appearance, thrilling her fans.\n\nAfter a fun night of drinking, trivia and bonding, readers got down to business. Despite HOFAS having 102 chapters, 839 pages, and an audiobook length of 29 hours and 42 minutes, fans were not deterred from devouring the book in a short amount of time. Merely hours after the release, fans were already posting reviews on various platforms, including Goodreads and TikTok.\n\nNow it\u2019s my turn... homework? Check. Pilates? Check. I\u2019ve officially reached the long-awaited moment I\u2019ve been preparing myself for.

In anticipation of the 66th GRAMMY Awards airing this Sunday, Bailey shared her insights and practical advice during a masterclass hosted in Los Angeles on Friday as part of the annual \u201cGRAMMY Week\u201d celebration. The session was exclusive to members of GrammyU, a program connecting aspiring creatives with music industry professionals. Moderated by GRAMMY winner and singer-songwriter Muni Long, Bailey discussed her roots in singing, her blossoming acting career and how she maintained authenticity throughout different artistic forms of expressions. Here are the biggest takeaways from the intimate conversation with Bailey.\n\n1. Remember Your Roots\n\u201cAnchor yourself with love for your artistry, that\u2019s what matters the most,\u201d Bailey said. In her advice to aspiring artists, she underscored the importance of sticking to one\u2019s roots and not letting the allure of the industry\u2019s glitz and glam be a distraction that divert them from their authentic selves. For Bailey, this translates to tuning out all distractions, finding solace in her garage with only her pen, notepad and true thoughts \u2014 a process fueled by an unwavering love for music. \u201cThings [in the industry] are changing every day but if you find that love for what your passion is, then you should stick to that.\u201d\n\n2. Embrace Change\nBailey started her career at the young age of 11, alongside her big sister Chloe, and the duo posted singing covers on YouTube that garnered millions of views. The singer gushed about the secure feeling of working with her sibling, emphasizing the importance of nourishing a bond like that with someone, especially when making art. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to have a partner to encourage you and that\u2019s what [Chloe] has always been for me,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool to be able to do that with somebody that you can fully trust and that believes in you at times when you need it the most.\u201d Getting the role of Ariel in the live-action remake of \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d was a pivotal moment for Bailey, as it started the transition from being part of a powerful duo to navigating solo ventures. \u201cIt was a gradual transition that I had to become okay with but it was needed for both of us to find out who we were on our own,\u201d she said.\n\n3. Trust In Yourself\nIn an industry that is inherently competitive, Bailey candidly advised the audience to not get discouraged by the inevitable rejections and to have faith in their talents. \u201cBeing creatives, sometimes you walk into rooms with opportunities and people that are important and you want them to like you and accept you but if you can find that within yourself and know that, that\u2019s enough,\u201d she said. For those aspiring to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, Bailey\u2019s guidance is straightforward: \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d She encouraged them to approach the journey like a marathon in which they\u2019re only sprinting forward and past all distractions. \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody stop you, don\u2019t let opinions of others stop you and don\u2019t let your own self doubts stop you.\u201d\n\nThe GRAMMYU Masterclass is available for playback on the Recording Academy\u2019s YouTube channel.\n```"}

After suffering its longest losing streak since 2015, USC (9-13, 3-8 Pac-12) was due for redemption. And the Trojans achieved just that on Saturday at the Galen Center, tearing apart the Oregon State Beavers 82-54.\n\n\u201cGood team win,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cThe guys played very hard defensively; I thought the energy was great.\u201d\n\nThe Beavers came out on top in the two teams\u2019 last conference matchup on Dec. 30 in Corvallis, Oregon. But USC holds the historical advantage, winning 11 of the last 16 matchups against Oregon State, seven of which were at home.\n\nAs the whistle was blown and the ball landed in the hands of freshman guard Bronny James, the first possession of the game turned into a ferocious two-handed slam for freshman forward Arrinten Page, setting the tone for 40 minutes of USC dominance.\n\nThe Trojans could not have asked for a stronger start. Page\u2019s electrifying dunk translated into an offensive outburst for the cardinal and gold. Capitalizing on the momentum, USC went on a 10-0 scoring run behind deadeye shooting from fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis and sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers, who each hit a 3-pointer.\n\n\u201cBoogie was terrific,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe shared the ball; he made the right play at the right time over and over again.\u201d\n\nGraduate forward DJ Rodman had one of those nights. He drew two offensive fouls on the Beavers within one minute of checking into the game and tied his career-high 14 rebounds alongside 12 points and two assists by the end.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been focusing on rebounding more,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cI\u2019m not a high-volume scorer as everyone knows, ... but the one place I could make a difference was rebounding.\u201d\n\nFeeding off of Rodman\u2019s smart and physical play, USC continued to draw seven personal fouls from Oregon State and entered the bonus just seven minutes into the first period.\n\nFor the Beavers, all hope landed on the shoulders of sophomore guard Jordan Pope, who came in averaging 17.6 points per game and ranked top 20 in minutes per game. Despite shooting perfectly on the court, Pope found his opportunities stifled by Trojan double-teams and managed only four shot attempts with six turnovers.\n\n\u201cWe made [Pope] work,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nThe Trojans dominated the paint, outscoring the Beavers 40-16 under the basket along with 20 offensive rebounds.\n\n\u201cTonight, I thought we showed a lot of toughness defensively. First of all, to make them miss and then, secondly, to try and rebound the ball,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI thought we were flying around on defense, meaning we were rotating and had energy.\u201d\n\nHaving always been one of the better defensive teams, USC held Oregon State to 35% in field goal percentage and only 28% from beyond the arc. In their last five games, the Trojans have held their opponents to an average of less than 39% from the field.\n\nOffensively, USC averaged 62.5 points over the span of its six-game losing streak, but that number was shattered by a display of team effort, as the team put together 82 points in front of the home crowd.\n\nJunior forward Harrison Hornery racked up a team-high 14 points in only 14 minutes. He was joined by Sellers, Rodman and sophomore forward Kijani Wright, all of whom contributed 12 points to the scoring column.\n\n\u201cWe all had a feeling this morning that we were going to win this game,\u201d Hornery said. \u201cIt was just good to get out there to be aggressive and play my game.\u201d\n\nUSC thrives when scoring is shared. The Trojans have seen at least three players score 10 or more points in 15 games this season and were 9-6 in those stretches. When three or more players have scored in double figures over the last four seasons, USC has an impressive record of 71 wins and 17 losses.\n\nInjuries continue to take a toll on USC, with players missing a combined 40+ games this season due to injury or illness. Sophomore forward Vincent Iwuchukwu sprained his ankle after playing only six minutes; he put up five points and a rebound.\n\n\u201cI thought [Vincent] was dominant in his six minutes before he sprained his ankle. He was terrific on offense and defense,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nThe victory against Oregon State was much needed for USC, as it struggled to find its footing this season, but Enfield remains confident in the team.\n\n\u201cBasketball is supposed to be a competitive sport and have some fun doing it,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIf you lose too much, you don\u2019t have much fun. We hope this is a nice way to start this week on the road.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will look to begin a win streak against the Cal Golden Bears Wednesday at 8 p.m. in Berkeley.\n```"}

While some expressed excitement over the news, others had a different perspective. Regardless of their reactions, a common theme emerged from their comments \u2014 everyone is adapting. Here are their stories:\n\nFront Row Motorsport driver Todd Gilliland in front of his No. 20 car. Ford Mustang driver Todd Gilliland was excited for the decisions NASCAR made on Saturday. Moving up the race means more day for him to prepare for the Daytona 500, NASCAR\u2019s biggest race of the year. \u201cI feel pretty nervous,\u201d Gilliland said. \u201cWe\u2019ve studied a lot of stuff, and you want to be a part of the 23 guys that are ready to start this race. It\u2019s just our first one back, so probably a little bit more nervous than I should be, but it\u2019s all part of it. It\u2019s a good opportunity to get back into things.\u201d Gilliland advanced from the qualifying round to the main race but crashed out 71 laps in.\n\nEric Rodriguez and Rosie Gnazzo made the journey from Pennsylvania. Despite poor weather and the race possibly being canceled, they were looking forward to being part of the historic day. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy overwhelming.\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed that we were able to make it in and actually be able to see it for tonight,\u201d Gnazzo added.\n\nMichael and Deborah Yates made the trip from Oregon. From the jump, they were ready to see how the race would play out. \u201cI\u2019ve been a NASCAR fan forever,\u201d Michael said. \u201cOn the plane right down from Oregon, there\u2019s a bunch of people on the flight that were coming down,\u201d Deborah added. They planned multiple events on their trip, but the race made them modify their schedule, and they had to leave to attend a family event. Michael was upset that he missed out on this year\u2019s event: \u201cI didn\u2019t set my DVR for three extra hours, so I\u2019m not going to see any of it.\u201d\n\nChristopher John \u201cCJ\u201d Woliver, a social media producer for FOX Sports, said he anticipated that schedule changes would happen. The biggest challenge for FOX was TV scheduling. \u201cIt was supposed to be on Fox, but now it\u2019s going to be on FS1,\u201d Woliver said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moving parts right now, but everybody knows where to do, where to be and what to do and where to go. We\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\nKaitlyn Kumar, the Chief Engineer of USC Racing Club and her team were excited to attend the NASCAR event, after being granted VIP passes to go behind the scenes to meet racing team staff and technicians. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely thrilling,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cIt\u2019s so rare you get a chance to get a backstage pass and really see how these cars are made.\u201d Moving up the race means Kumar has to get her team together faster. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely all very last minute,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to distribute tickets to the rest of the team so that they can still attend this event.\u201d\n```"}

Martin Truex Jr. (No. 19) looks to defend his title at the Clash of the Coliseum Saturday. (Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nFebruary 03, 2024 at 5:03 pm PST\n\nThe Clash at the Coliseum is this Saturday, rather than the originally scheduled Sunday, in a surprise to most involved. But don\u2019t worry, the drivers will still be making their normally programmed left turns. Although the change that moved the race up by more than 24 hours came as a surprise, it hasn\u2019t perturbed drivers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already here to race,\u201d Ty Gibbs (No. 54) said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything... just hammer down.\u201d Justin Haley (No. 51) echoed his sentiment, saying it just meant he\u2019d fly home a day earlier.\n\nDespite the words from the drivers, this race will certainly look different than in years past. How will the action change? With significantly less preparation time on track, the possibility of chaos increases even further. In the past, drivers have certainly been willing to drive through each other. With the drivers less familiar with the track, mistakes could easily result in even more carnage.\n\nThe lack of running has an additional consequence: less rubber on the track. With a far greener track, drivers will have less grip and find it far easier to make mistakes. This week\u2019s weather will play another role there as well. It took longer for the track in the Coliseum to dry off than most other tracks, so even a light drizzle could create difficulties.\n\n\u201cThis is slick and the oils are still coming out of the asphalt, it\u2019s brand new. The wet spots that were on the race track were super, super slick, like ice,\u201d Joey Logano (No. 22), the inaugural winner of the Clash at the Coliseum, said. \u201cThat\u2019s all kind of new territory for us that we don\u2019t really know about yet, but I think we\u2019re going to have to try and see what happens.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of the opposite happening. Many other series have had recent banal races that were expected to be filled with chaos. With so much up in the air, drivers could take a more cautious approach and have an orderly contest.\n\nDifferent Fords\nThis is the first look we\u2019ve had at the new Ford car, whose body work was updated over the offseason as the initial design, which was supposed to resemble cars sold to the public, was at an aerodynamic disadvantage to the Chevrolets and Toyotas. With strong drivers, including the winner of the inaugural Clash at the Coliseum, among its lineup, Ford could have an even better shot than in years past.\n\nQualifying results:\nFirst row: Denny Hamlin (No. 11), Joey Logano (No. 22)\nSecond row: Ty Gibbs (No. 54), Alex Bowman (No. 48)\nThird row: Kyle Busch (No. 8), William Byron (No. 24)\nFourth row: Ross Chastain (No. 1), Kyle Larson (No. 5)\nFifth row: Bubba Wallace (No. 23), Justin Haley (No. 51)\nSixth row: Tyler Reddick (No. 45), Ryan Preece (No. 41)\nSeventh row: Brad Keselowski (No. 6), Chase Elliott (No. 9)\nEighth row: Michael McDowell (No. 34), Todd Gilliland (No. 38)\nNinth row: Noah Gragson (No. 10), Corey LaJoie (No. 7)\nTenth row: Martin Truex Jr. (No. 19), Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (No. 47)\nEleventh row: John Hunter Nemechek (No. 42), Chase Briscoe (No. 14)\n\nReigning champion Ryan Blaney (No. 12) will start the race in last as the highest-scoring non-qualifier from last season. The elimination of heat races led to some shock exclusions. Daniel Suarez (No. 99) didn\u2019t make the Cup Series race, meaning he will now only compete in the King Taco LA Batalla en El Coliseo. Chris Buescher (No. 17) had a fantastic second half of last year, but couldn\u2019t parlay that into qualifying for the Clash. Christopher Bell (No. 20) has made the Final 4 of the playoffs in consecutive years and has extensive short track experience, but couldn\u2019t put a lap together and qualified fourth-last.\n\nPrediction:\nWithout heat races, this section is far more bare than in years past. That said, I\u2019m picking Alex Bowman to win this year. The Hendrick Motorsports driver looked strong for much of last year and is known for winning in unusual manners. It\u2019s hard to get more unusual than this, so it could be his time to shine.\n\nThe Clash at the Coliseum may be unlike any other race on the NASCAR schedule and it may not award points, but don\u2019t let that fool you: both winners have gone on to win a championship that season, with Logano clinching the 2022 Series Championship and Truex Jr. taking the 2023 Regular Season Championship. This race, against all odds, is a yardstick for success.\n```"}

Instead of the Cup Series and Mexico Series races taking place on Sunday, both races will now be held Saturday evening. The Clash at the Coliseum is now set to begin at 5 p.m. on Saturday, over 24 hours earlier than originally scheduled. The King Taco LA Batalla en El Coliseo will follow at approximately 7:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cDue to the threat of unprecedented severe weather on Sunday, the NASCAR Cup Series and NASCAR Mexico Series race events for the Clash have been moved to Saturday night,\u201d event organizers said in a statement on X (formerly known as Twitter). \u201cThanks to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Los Angeles Public Safety for their partnership and support to make the schedule adjustment for tonight\u2019s event to ensure a safe experience for fans, competitors, and staff.\u201d\n\nPractice and qualifying for the Cup Series race is now scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ahead of the race, which will be broadcast on Fox Sports 1. Admission will be free for the public on Saturday, and those who purchased tickets and parking passes for Sunday will be entitled to a refund from NASCAR.\n\n\u201cWe understand weather conditions may worsen as the day progresses, so we encourage fans to make decisions in the best interest of safety,\u201d NASCAR\u2019s statement continued. \u201cWe appreciate our fans, partners, and everyone associated with this event on this unprecedented event.\u201d\n\nAccording to a NASCAR official, this change in plans was a surprise to everyone involved and came together at the last minute. Moving the races up to Saturday was previously off the table, and initial backup plans were to instead delay the event, according to the employee. Another employee added that he only found out through social media.\n\nDriver Chris Buescher (No. 17) said that drivers were also unaware of the possibility that the race would be moved up, but many racers weren\u2019t particularly surprised by the decision given the inclement weather.\n\nCurrent weather forecasts project rain will start around 7 p.m. Saturday night in Los Angeles and to continue through Tuesday. NASCAR COO Steve O\u2019Donnell commented that initial plans were to move up the races by two hours on Sunday, but as weather conditions developed, options to reschedule the event a day earlier picked up speed late Friday night and Saturday morning.\n\nDaniel Suarez (No. 99), who will be driving in both the Cup Series and Mexico Series races, mentioned that he preferred that the event be moved up, as opposed to being delayed multiple days.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart decision, and I\u2019m glad that NASCAR made the call,\u201d Suarez said. Suarez admitted that it might be a little tougher to pull double duty with the races now occurring back-to-back, but he appeared ready for the challenge after an offseason of training.\n\nAnother Cup Series driver, Justin Haley (No. 51), said that he is approaching the Clash with the same mindset. Even though the change was unexpected, it hasn\u2019t seemed to phase any racers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing, you just try to go out and do your best the whole time,\u201d Haley said. If anything, the absence of heats ahead of the main race will make this more of a normal weekend for drivers, Haley added.\n\nThe top 22 qualifying times will participate in the main Cup Series race, along with the highest-scoring driver from last season outside of that top 22. This will be the third installment of the Clash at the Coliseum and the first time it has been paired with a Mexico Series race. The event features 150 laps on a quarter-mile track inside the L.A. Memorial Coliseum.\n```"}

NBA fans have long called Paul George the smoothest player in the league, and now he has a theme song that shows why.\n\nPaul George gestures after sinking an and-one play during the second half of the Clippers' 128-117 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024, in Los Angeles. (AP/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore February 03, 2024 at 1:06 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find an NBA player who makes the game of basketball look as easy as Paul George. Basketball fans across the country have taken notice, assigning Erykah Badu\u2019s \u201cDidn\u2019t Cha Know\u201d as George\u2019s \u201ctheme song\u201d due to their similarly smooth styles. Standing 6-foot-8 and weighing in at 220lbs, George is a forward with guard skills as his handle is elite, he can get to the basket at will and can score at all three levels whenever he wants. The thought is that the song has a calm and relaxed feel to it, just like George\u2019s play on the court.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s seen \u201cThat one Paul George edit\u201d on their TikTok, Instagram and/or YouTube feeds is most likely familiar with the craze. George was asked about the recent trend following the Clippers\u2019 Jan. 16 victory against the Oklahoma City Thunder. George scored 18 of his 38 points in the fourth quarter and scored 11 of Los Angeles\u2019 final 14 points to secure the victory.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m smooth,\u201d George said when asked about the trend postgame. \u201cI tell people I always look at basketball as dancing anyway. I\u2019m always down to tango.\u201d\n\nGeorge has definitely been down to tango for the Clippers this season. He has played in 44 out 47 games for the Clippers and is having a tremendous statistical season. On a team loaded with stars such as Kawhi Leonard, James Harden and Russell Westbrook, George is putting up 23 points, six rebounds and four assists per game. George is shooting 46.3% from the floor, and if that mark stands for the remainder of the season, it would be the second-most efficient shooting season of his career, his best since the 2021-22 season.\n\nPG-13 has also been a major contributor to the Clippers\u2019 top-ranked three-point shooting this season, shooting a career-best 41.2% from downtown. Some of the most important games in a team\u2019s season can come down to converting from the free-throw line. The Clippers never need to worry when they need Paul George to knock down free throws \u2014 he\u2019s shooting nearly 91% from the charity stripe this season.\n\nPaul George has been playing in the NBA since 2010 and has built up quite the resume. An eight-time NBA All-Star with six All-NBA Team appearances, George also won the league\u2019s Most Improved Player award in 2013 and has made four all-defensive teams. PG-13 was also a part of Team USA\u2019s gold medal-winning team at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBecause of George\u2019s individual success in the NBA, many of today\u2019s younger players grew up admiring his style of play. One notable example is Charlotte Hornets rookie Brandon Miller. Miller was the second overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, and during a pre-draft interview, Miller was asked to weigh in on the GOAT debate. The vast majority of fans center this debate around Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James and Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan, but Miller\u2019s take on the GOAT debate is one of the more unique ones out there.\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t think LeBron is the GOAT of basketball,\u201d Miller said. \u201cMy GOAT of basketball is Paul George. I grew up watching him, so it was never just LeBron. Another notable name that has given George a lot of praise is former NBA player Carmelo Anthony. Anthony believes that George\u2019s game serves as a model for young basketball players who are trying to enhance their skills in all aspects of basketball.\n\n\u201cWhen you create your player on 2K you\u2019re creating that,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cHe learned how to be a role player and gradually he became the PG that we love.\u201d\n\nWith Paul George having one of the best seasons of his career this season, the Clippers\u2019 chances of winning a championship have never looked better since Kawhi Leonard and George arrived in 2019. If you didn\u2019t know about PG-13\u2032s game before, now you know.\n```"}

Watkins has 51 points in USC women's basketball's 67-58 road win against Stanford Friday night. (Photo by Cam Kauffman)\n\nBy Will Camardella February 03, 2024 at 1:06 am PST\n\nShe may have played only 18 games on the collegiate level, but freshman guard JuJu Watkins is taking USC women\u2019s basketball to places it has not been in a long, long time. On Friday night, Watkins gave the Trojans a performance for the ages. The freshman phenom\u2019s 51 points were the most scored in a single game in the history of USC\u2019s program, surpassing Cherie Nelson\u2019s 50-point game against Cal in 1989. It was also the most points scored by any Division 1 college basketball player \u2013 men\u2019s or women\u2019s \u2013 in the 2023-24 season.\n\nSimply put, she was unstoppable on the offensive side, as the No. 15 Trojans earned a hard-fought 67-58 victory on the road over No. 4 Stanford.\n\n\u201cTonight, we saw something I\u2019ve never seen before in my life,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said after the game. \u201cThe most significant thing is that [Watkins] is coming off our team\u2019s toughest loss of the year and a performance she wasn\u2019t happy with. Her demeanor, from the second that game ended against Washington until now, is what sets her apart, to me, more than these numbers. ... What is so special about her is everything inside, and that came out today in a way that, if you love basketball, I don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t love this.\u201d\n\nWatkins\u2019 huge scoring night was not just a luxury; USC needed every point she had to secure its first win at Maples Pavilion since 2001. The Cardinal made their defensive prowess felt in the very early stages of the contest, with the Pac-12\u2032s blocks leader, senior forward Cameron Brink, completely locking down the paint. Brink rejected three Trojan shots within the first five minutes of the game, and USC failed to score for three straight minutes when Watkins was on the bench.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, Watkins truly answered the Trojans\u2019 call for offense when she went on a 7-0 run by hitting a mid-range jump shot, draining a three off her steal and ripping the ball out of Brink\u2019s hands on her way to a breakaway layup. That period was her most dominant, when she scored 13 points on 6-of-7 shooting. At halftime, Watkins had 25 of USC\u2019s 31 points, and, at points in the third quarter, she was out-scoring Stanford by herself.\n\nBrink and junior forward Kiki Iriafen\u2019s lockdown defense in the paint kept Watkins, who is usually an elite finisher at the rim, far away from the hoop, but she was unconscious from mid-range. Throughout the night, she used her stepback move to create just the slightest bit of separation between her and her defender and used that space to drain shot after shot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy at all,\u201d Watkins said about her performance. \u201cStanford\u2019s a great team, so to come here and get a win means a lot to the team. We battle every day in practice; we battled every day in the summer. A lot of that has really helped me transition from high school to college. I\u2019m just grateful for my coach and my teammates, who I wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without.\u201d\n\nDefensively, the Trojans knew they would have their work cut out for them against a Cardinal team averaging over 80 points per game. The name of the game for Gottlieb\u2019s team was to keep Brink and Iriafen, averaging a combined 46.5 points per game, out of the paint. Overall, that effort was a rousing success, as USC forced both players into awkward shots far from the rim, which led to very inefficient nights for both players. Combined, they shot just 31% from the field, causing Stanford to go on numerous scoring droughts while Watkins continued to build the lead.\n\n\u201cI think we took a lot of bad shots, to be honest with you,\u201d Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer said. \u201cOur shot selection and inability to play with any flow was very disappointing. We cannot expect to beat a really good team taking the shots that we took.\u201d\n\nWhile the defensive result may have looked according to plan for the Trojans, the path there was anything but. From the first quarter, USC\u2019s frontcourt found itself in foul trouble, battling the Cardinal\u2019s bigs for every rebound and battle in the paint. By the home stretch of the fourth quarter, junior forward Rayah Marshall, junior center Clarise Akunwafo and graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis had all fouled out. Yet, the Trojans held on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the way our frontcourt battled,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cYou never draw it up that way, but we felt a magic in [the foul outs]. We felt like we had to find a way to get it done. I think [Stanford] was out of sorts a little bit because of what JuJu was doing. I hoped we could keep scoring because I was nervous about the inside, but I had all the confidence in the world that our players\u2019 mentality was right.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s ten-point lead after 30 minutes did not last long, as Stanford slowly crawled back to within striking distance. As Watkins was being double- or triple-teamed on every possession, leading to some costly turnovers, the Cardinal got within two points of the Trojans as the game entered its final stretch. Watkins had only scored four points in the quarter thus far; the team needed another source of offense.\n\nWith less than two minutes to go, graduate guard McKenzie Forbes answered the bell. Forbes may not have expected the ball to be passed to her on the perimeter with five seconds left on the shot clock, but she had it nonetheless. She took one dribble inside the 3-point arc and, with Stanford graduate guard Hannah Jump\u2019s hand right in her face, launched up a prayer. Somehow, the circus shot fell right as the shot clock expired, getting the USC lead right back to two possessions.\n\n\u201cI just knew I had to get it up,\u201d Forbes said of her circus shot. \u201cI was trying to get fouled a little bit, but, thank the basketball gods, it went in.\u201d\n\nForbes was not done securing the victory after that. With under a minute left, she ran from the right side of the lane after a missed floater to the left corner to track down her own missed shot, securing an extra possession and forcing the Cardinal to begin fouling. Those late-game fouls by Stanford secured USC\u2019s victory but also ensured that Watkins\u2019 performance would officially be cemented in the record books.\n\nWatkins was sent to the free-throw line four times in the final two minutes of the game and made 7-of-8 in that span. Her very last free throw was her record-breaking 51st point of the contest, and the entire Trojan bench erupted into celebration the second the ball fell through the net.\n\nReflecting on what that record meant, Watkins said, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t really think about it too much. I have a long way to go to consider myself in a category with Cheryl [Miller,] Lisa [Leslie] and the greats. I\u2019m just blessed to be in this environment, and I\u2019m just soaking it all in. But, we have a game on Sunday, so I\u2019m gonna take it all in, then head back to the gym.\u201d\n\nThe win snapped a three-game road losing streak for USC and marked its first Pac-12 win away from Galen Center all season. Overall, the Trojans improve to 15-4 on the season and 5-4 in the Pac-12. The Cardinal fall to 19-3 on the season and 8-2 in the conference after losing their first Pac-12 home game since February 2020.\n\nUSC will finish its Bay Area road trip on Sunday at noon against the Cal Golden Bears.\n```"}

The Trojans soared their way to a 3-0 victory against the San Diego Tritons in the second part of their home-and-home on Feb. 2 at Galen Center. They looked to seek vengeance after a 3-2 loss on the Tritons\u2019 home court on Jan. 29.\n\n\u201c[The Trojans] locked in and competed at a higher level,\u201d USC head coach Jeff Nygaard said. Key players to Friday\u2019s win were two sophomore outside hitters: Dillon Klein, who led the charge with 11 kills and 14 points, and Riley Haine, boasting nine kills and 12 points overall. Freshman setter Caleb Blanchette also put up 19 assists.\n\nIn the middle of the first set, the Trojans looked like they had it in the bag, with solid kills from Klein and freshman middle blocker Wesley Smith. Even though the Tritons slowly shrank their 17-13 deficit to as close as one point (22-21), the Trojans never let them run away with it. USC sealed the first set with a 25-21 victory.\n\nHaine was an impenetrable wall, preventing Triton hitters from finding open gaps in the defense and also punishing their overpasses. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some physicality at the net both offensively and defensively,\u201d Nygaard said.\n\nThe second set was a decisive 25-13 victory for USC, with Klein finding the unguarded spots on the court. The Trojan defense also racked up an impressive eight blocks, frustrating the Tritons and causing them to total 10 attack errors in that set alone. USC\u2019s previous loss to San Diego was marked with defensive errors, as the Tritons had 14 aces.\n\nPostgame, Klein noted, \u201cWe didn\u2019t [serve] receive as well as we had wanted on Wednesday, but today, we really played well.\u201d\n\nSan Diego got the early lead in the third set but when Smith hung mid-air, not just once but twice, to send the ball straight down into the ground, the momentum shifted in the Trojans\u2019 favor.

(AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington February 02, 2024 at 9:55 pm PST\n\nOn Top of the World\nHouston continues hot streak in conference play\n\nDespite having a 19-2 record with a 14-game win streak to begin the season, the Houston Cougars have yet to top the AP Poll this season. For the last ten years, the Cougars benefited from playing inferior regular season competition due to their American Athletic Conference membership, which has never produced a Final Four team. However, Houston is currently playing its first season as a Big 12 member\u2014college basketball\u2019s most competitive conference\u2014and they are proving that their recent success is real, not just a product of their former conference.\n\nAfter opening with three straight conference wins, this week Houston hosted the Kansas State Wildcats, who reached the Elite Eight last season. The Wildcats and the Cougars both have elite defenses that consistently outrebound opponents, so Saturday\u2019s game was shaping up to be a close-fought, strength vs. strength matchup. Instead, Houston took a 20-point lead into halftime and ended the game having outrebounded Kansas State by double digits. Junior forward Ja\u2019Vier Francis didn\u2019t attempt a field goal, but led the way with eight rebounds and anchored a team-wide defensive masterclass. For the first time in conference play, Kansas State was held to fewer than 59 points, finishing the game with 52.\n\nOn offense for Houston, L.J. Cryer had an off shooting night, going 3-11 from the floor. The Cougars relied on guards Jamal Shead and Damian Dunn to lead the way. Shead scored 17 points, and Dunn provided 13 points off the bench too. Ultimately, the game was never competitive; Houston opened the game on an 11-0 run and never lost the lead.\n\nMonday night was a different story. The Cougars went into Moody Center to face off against the Texas Longhorns, who were 10-2 at home coming into this game. Unlike Kansas State, Texas boasts one of the country\u2019s best offenses. Their lowest scoring output this season was a 65-point effort in a loss to the then No. 8 Marquette Golden Eagles. As such, the question coming into the game was how the Longhorns would fare against one of the country\u2019s elite defenses.\n\nIn the first half, Texas scored only 25 points and Houston had a comfortable eight-point lead going into the break. However, over the next ten minutes, Dillon Mitchell converted on three layups, including one that tied the game at 46 apiece. The Longhorns extended their lead to six points with about eight minutes left in regulation, but Jamal Shead hit back-to-back 3-pointers to tie the game back up. With 1:25 remaining and the Cougars down by two, Shead missed two consecutive looks in the paint before J\u2019Wan Roberts tied the game with a clutch tip shot. Neither team scored in the final minute of regulation, sending the affair to overtime. Roberts\u2019s heroics continued with a go-ahead layup and Houston survived for their fifth-straight win.\n\nHouston has proven the doubters wrong this season by quickly earning sole possession of first place in the Big 12, which is even more impressive considering Kansas has earned a share of 17 of the last 20 Big 12 regular season titles since Bill Self\u2019s tenure began. Houston plays the Jayhawks on the road this Saturday and has a chance to add a rare blemish to Coach Self\u2019s impressive conference success.\n\nCarolina in My Mind\nNorth Carolina finally shows weakness in the ACC\n\nThe ACC possesses a murderer\u2019s row of college basketball\u2019s most successful teams: Virginia, Louisville, Syracuse, Miami, Duke and North Carolina. In recent years, however, the ACC has been the weakest of the Power Five conferences and it\u2019s unlikely that more than three ACC teams\u2014North Carolina, Duke and Clemson\u2014will earn a bid to this year\u2019s NCAA Tournament. A loss in the ACC play will be devastating to a team\u2019s tournament r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and will affect seeding come March. If the Tar Heels don\u2019t earn a 1-seed, this week will be a key reason why.\n\nNorth Carolina opened conference play undefeated through eight games, including a massive road win against the Clemson Tigers on Jan. 6. The Tar Heels surged up to the No. 3 rank in the AP Poll and entered the week with hopes to sweep a road trip against two opponents unlikely to play in March. On Jan. 27, they faced off against the now 12-8 Florida State Seminoles. Early in the second half, North Carolina was down 46-38 before going on a 23-6 run over the next six minutes and 19 seconds. Although the Tar Heels\u2019 comeback win was impressive\u2014by a final score of 75-68\u2014they benefited from a massive free throw disparity. North Carolina scored 19 points from the line, whereas Florida State only made five.\n\nNorth Carolina has a stronger offense compared to the Seminoles, but their weak first-half performance and reliance on free throws will not be good enough to beat the nation\u2019s top teams. On Tuesday night against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, their free throw luck swung in the opposite direction. Both teams shot 17 free throws, but the Tar Heels converted a paltry 52.9% of them to Georgia Tech\u2019s 88.2%. However, the real story of the game was North Carolina\u2019s inability to convert on shots from the field. Leading scorer RJ Davis posted 28 points on 45.8% shooting, but none of his teammates reached double figures and they combined for 45 points on 32.1% from the floor.\n\nThe Tar Heels led by 11 points with five minutes remaining in the first half, but the Yellow Jackets responded with a 12-1 run to tie the game. Both teams went on runs in the second half, with Georgia Tech taking an eight-point lead via a Tyzhaun Claude free throw with five minutes to go. From there, North Carolina clawed their way back. After a Yellow Jacket missed three-pointer, RJ Davis grabbed a tipped rebound just short of the half-court line and drove to the rim to give the Tar Heels a one-point lead with about 30 seconds left. However, on the next possession, Georgia Tech guard Naithan George drove across the court to make the game\u2019s final basket: a right-handed layup across his body. The Yellow Jackets won 74-73.\n\nNorth Carolina still looks like one of the best teams in the country, but their recent weak performances against mediocre Power Five opponents suggest that they will be vulnerable to an off night in March.\n\nCinderella Watch\nRichmond wins eleventh straight, could bust brackets in March\n\nAlmost one-fifth of the 362 D1 basketball programs will play in the NCAA Tournament, but most of them will hail from a Power Five conference. However, quality teams do exist outside of the brand name programs that could shock the world and ruin brackets. Past \u201cCinderellas\u201d include Fairleigh Dickinson, St. Peter\u2019s, Loyola Chicago and Oral Roberts, among others. Normally, these mid-major programs must win their conference tournament in order to receive a spot at March Madness because they don\u2019t have enough \u201cquality\u201d opponents in their regular season.\n\nFor example, despite a 16-5 record and an eleven game win streak, the Richmond Spiders are projected not to make March Madness unless they win the Atlantic 10 Conference tournament. This week, the Spiders proved why they should be in no matter what.\n\nOn Saturday, Richmond faced off against the No. 16 Dayton Flyers in a battle for first place in the Atlantic 10. Dayton already had quality non-conference wins against the St. John\u2019s Red Storm, SMU Mustangs and Cincinnati Wildcats, whereas Richmond was looking for its signature win. The Spiders were down nine points six minutes into the game and had yet to score a point, but after taking an 18-15 lead, Richmond found their footing and ended the half up by five.\n\nThe second half was competitive, but Dayton never led by more than a possession. Once the Spiders gained a 40-37 lead, there were no more ties or lead changes. All five of Richmond\u2019s starters scored in double figures, and the Spiders dominated in the paint, outscoring Dayton 30-18. The game ended with Richmond victorious, 69-64.\n\nLater on in the week, Richmond blew out the Fordham Rams on the road by an 83-69 score for their eleventh consecutive win. Regardless of whether or not they win their conference tournament, Richmond has now proven that they are worthy of dancing. Per KenPom, the Spiders rank among the top 40 most efficient defenses and on offense, they turn the ball over at the lowest rate of any team. If Richmond wins the A-10 tournament, their first round matchup in the NCAA Tournament will be in grave danger of an upset.\n```"}

The purple and gold experienced a high on Saturday, Jan. 27 after the Lakers beat the Golden State Warriors 145-144 in a double overtime thriller. However, the Lakers followed that electrifying win with a 135-119 loss to the Houston Rockets the following Monday and then a 138-122 loss to the Atlanta Hawks on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nThen, with their two best players out, the Lakers defied the odds to beat the Boston Celtics 114-105. LeBron James led the Lakers to victory against the Warriors with a stellar performance. James led the Lakers in points, rebounds, and assists. He finished with 36 points, 12 assists and a career-high 20 rebounds. Center Anthony Davis followed James\u2019s lead with 29 points, 13 rebounds and 4 blocks of his own, while guard D\u2019Angelo Russell contributed 28 points.\n\nBoth teams had similar field goal percentages: the Lakers shot 49% from the field and the Warriors shot 46%. In such a competitive and close game, the stat sheet had minimal discrepancies between the two teams. What stands out from the Warriors game was how valiantly the Lakers fought for the win. In an impressive effort, Warriors guard Stephen Curry led his team\u2014with 46-point performance\u2014to a 15-point lead in the third quarter. And the Warriors would maintain a lead until the 1:43 mark in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, the Lakers stayed tough and\u2014perhaps more importantly\u2014engaged throughout the two overtimes. They weathered the Steph Curry storm by playing with heart and together. In the second overtime, four different Lakers contributed to the 15-point total in that period, while Curry contributed 10 points of the Warriors\u2019 14-point haul in the second session.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those wins where it just showed our character,\u201d Lakers head coach Darvin Ham said to the media post-game. \u201cOur group is really coming together. Just the way they competed, the way they shared, did the little things... this was a really, really gutsy win. Everybody participated... we needed one of these.\u201d\n\nAll of that effort and momentum must have missed the first couple planes out of California. The Monday night matchup between the Lakers and Rockets had none of the electrifying excitement of the Golden State matchup, perhaps showing that the overtime minutes sapped the Lakers of their energy. The Lakers only had a one-point lead early in the first quarter and they would never lead the game again.\n\nJames, Russell and Davis all led the Lakers with 23 points each. James also had 10 assists and shot 60% from the field. It was a game marred with defensive breakdowns and half-efforts. Rockets guard Jalen Green led his team with 34 points while center Alperen Sengun was closely behind with 31. One of the game\u2019s most impressive performances came from Rockets rookie forward Cam Whitmore, who scored 20 points off the bench. 12 of those points came in the first quarter alone and he finished the quarter with back-to-back transition dunks.\n\nIn the paint and on defense are where things got ugly. The Lakers only had 35 rebounds compared to the Rockets\u2019 56 and allowed Houston 19 second-chance points. Houston had 68 points in the paint while the Lakers had 56. The Lakers attempted a fourth-quarter comeback push with James leading the way. His six points in the fourth and forward Rui Hachimura\u2019s 11 points had Houston\u2019s once-30 point lead cut down to just 10 late into the quarter, but in the end, it didn\u2019t matter. The Rockets beat the Lakers 135-119 in Houston.\n\nRussell summarized the struggles of the game simply. \u201cWe did a lot of different things today,\u201d Russell said to the media. \u201cCouldn\u2019t find a way to respond... we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nSpoiler alert: they didn\u2019t figure it out. Not immediately, at least. The next day, the Lakers lost to the Hawks by 16 points\u2014the same differential as the Rockets game. Davis was out for the game and in his absence, guard Austin Reaves led the team with 28 points and James finished with 20.\n\nThe Lakers opened the first quarter with promise, holding a six point lead until the 7:48 mark. The Hawks would tie the score five times before taking the lead late in the first and from then on, they never trailed. The Hawks matched the Lakers in their shot efficiency, but from behind the arc, the Hawks shot 42% while the Lakers finished with 53%. However, that bright spot was eclipsed by a familiar lack of effort and hustle, as the Hawks had 21 second-chance points and 26 fastbreak points.\n\nTo their credit (kind of), the Lakers finished with 22 fastbreak points and nearly matched the Hawks\u2019 points in the paint\u201466 for the Lakers and 68 for the Hawks\u2014even with Davis out for the game. Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young finished the game with 26 points, 13 assists and shot 66% from three. Atlanta guard Dejounte Murray had 24 points.\n\nAfter the game, Reaves acknowledged both Atlanta guards as exceptional players who make defense tough. \u201cWe just have to be better as a collective group,\u201d Reaves said to the media. \u201cWe have to be physical and create indecision for them instead of just letting teams play so freely.\u201d\n\nCoach Ham pointed to defensive breakdowns as the catalyst for the Hawks finding their rhythm and taking over in the first quarter. The Lakers dug themselves into a hole that is hard to get out of most games, but especially so for the second game of a back-to-back. Ham called the circumstances \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like that all year though,\u201d Ham said to the media. \u201cit\u2019s different circumstances... you can use them as excuses or you can say, hey the whole league goes through it. Got to look ourselves in the mirror and man the hell up.\u201d\n\nFor their next game, the Lakers could have made plenty of excuses. They had a day of rest before facing their next opponent: the Boston Celtics, holder of the NBA\u2019s best record. To make matters more difficult, James and Davis were both out for the game. What was a set-up for disaster ended in Lakers glory.\n\nWith their two best players out, the Lakers beat the Celtics 114-105, only the third loss for Boston at home. Reaves led the team with a season-high 32 points, supported by 70% shooting from behind the arc. Stepping into the starting lineup, center Jaxson Hayes had 16 points and 10 rebounds, along with several hustle plays to extend some key possessions for the Lakers.\n\nAll of the starting five scored in double digits, with Hachimura coming off of the bench to contribute 16 points as well. The Lakers would hold the lead for most of the game, only giving the Celtics a one-point lead at the 9:59 mark in the second quarter. After that, the Lakers never ceded control.\n\nSimilarly to their win over Golden State, the Lakers\u2019 effort on both ends of the floor secured their win. They shot 52% from three compared to Boston\u2019s 33%. They fought for tip-ins and 50-50 balls, scoring 21 fastbreak points and forcing 15 Celtics turnovers.\n\nComing off of his season-high performance, Reaves told the media post-game that hustle plays from Hayes and the rest of the team were the keys to winning the game. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t nothing special. It wasn\u2019t like we was out there running a million sets,\u201d Reaves said. \u201cWe went out there and competed our ass off. We gave it 110%.\u201d\n\nCeltics forward Jayson Tatum scored 23 points, center Kristaps Porzingis had 17 points and on the same night he was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve player, forward Jaylen Brown finished with just eight points on 4-12 shooting.\n\nThe win against the Celtics brings the Lakers\u2019 record back up to .500 at 25-25. They are currently ranked ninth in the Western Conference. The Dallas Mavericks are in the eighth spot, ahead of LA by two games. The Lakers\u2019 will stay in the Empire State to face the New York Knicks on Saturday, Feb. 3 in Madison Square Garden at 5:30 p.m.\n```"}

Seven-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has been linked with a shock move from Mercedes to Ferrari next year. (AP Photo/Toru Takahashi, File)\n\nBy Marco Haynes February 02, 2024 at 4:28 pm PST\n\nFormula One saw an \u2018unexpected move\u2019 when seven-time World Champion, Lewis Hamilton switched racing teams from Mercedes for Ferrari, signing a multi-year contract beginning during the 2025 season, according to Formula One. He spent 11 years at Mercedes winning six world titles. In August 2023, the 39-year-old had agreed to a two-year contract with Mercedes that included an option of a release clause. Hamilton has now decided to exercise that option allowing him to leave the team.\n\nHamilton joined Mercedes in 2013 from McLaren and became one of the most successful drivers in F1 history, accruing 103 wins and 104 pole positions. His seven championships are only matched by Michael Schumacher.\n\n\u201cMercedes has been part of my life since I was 13 years old. It\u2019s a place where I have grown up, so making the decision to leave was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make,\u201d said Hamilton in his statement on the Mercedes website.\n\nFerrari, one of F1\u2032s historically successful teams who has not won a title since 2007 will see the British driver replacing Carlos Sainz at the start of the 2025 season. Current Mercedes team principal, CEO of the team and part owner, Toto Wolff spoke on Hamilton\u2019s move explaining he holds nothing against him and respects how difficult the decision is for him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found a friend, we\u2019ve built a relationship over the last 10 years, and he faced a very, very difficult situation, taking a decision of where to drive, maybe for the first time since 10 years without being able to brainstorm with me,\u201d said Wolff in an interview for F1\u2032s Youtube channel. \u201cAnd therefore, I will always respect the difficulty of the situation that he faced ...But I hold no grudge.\u201d\n\nWe asked students at USC about their reactions and thoughts after Lewis Hamilton\u2019s move to Ferrari.\n\n\u201cOh, it was kind of a shock to me. I wasn\u2019t really expecting it. I think it\u2019s going to be really good for him and also good for the fans to see how Lewis can perform in the Ferrari car,\u201d said world bachelor in business student Matthew Chen. \u201cHe\u2019s been with Mercedes for so long. I just think it\u2019ll be exciting and definitely good for the sport.\u201d\n\nChen continued explaining his excitement for Hamilton to compete again for the podium and rival Red Bull driver Max Verstappen.\n\n\u201cThe past few years when Max Verstappen started dominating. I think with this move, everyone\u2019s just really eager to see if Lewis can take back the throne,\u201d Chen said.\n\nAnother student reflected that Hamilton\u2019s move won\u2019t benefit F1 due to his age.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see any benefits to Formula One. Like again, Hamilton is someone who\u2019s kind of at the end of his career... I don\u2019t see Hamilton winning anything anytime in the future,\u201d said Rishik Chadha, a graduate student pursuing his master\u2019s degree in finance.\n\nFerrari will have a strong lineup in 2025 as Hamilton will partner up with young star Charles Leclerc in what could be the final chapter in the seven-time champion\u2019s career. Hamilton will compete in his last season for Mercedes in 2024 as the F1 season starts on March 2 with the Bahrain Grand Prix.\n```"}

The U.S. Department of Education said Thursday, Feb. 27, 2020 it found systemic failures in the University of Southern California's handling of allegations of sexual abuse by a longtime campus gynecologist and ordered the school to overhaul its procedures for preventing sex discrimination, conduct a formal review of how employees responded and allow compliance monitoring for three years. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)\n\nBy Kelsey Goldbach February 02, 2024 at 3:05 pm PST\n\nThe criminal case against former USC gynecologist George Tyndall, who died last year, was dropped Friday when Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler accepted Tyndall\u2019s defense team\u2019s request for dismissal. The 76-year old died on Oct. 4 last year of natural causes, with a medical examiner confirming through autopsy that there was no foul play.\n\nBefore he was suspended from USC in 2016, Tyndall worked in the USC Student Health Center for 27 years. Despite having accusations of inappropriate conduct against him dating back to 1991, Tyndall continued to work at USC until a nurse formally filed a complaint in 2016.\n\nThe criminal case, brought initially in May 2018 by five former students and later settling at 16 plaintiffs, cited numerous cases of sexual assault and misconduct from 2009 through 2016. Despite this, Tyndall didn\u2019t surrender his medical license until after his June 2019 arrest, according to a release from the Medical Board of California.\n\nTyndall was charged with 18 felony counts of sexual penetration of an unconscious person and would have likely stood trial in 2024.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Tyndall left USC in 2017 with a financial settlement of an undisclosed amount.\n\nFolt, who took over USC long after the Tyndall scandal, has not commented since before Tyndall\u2019s death.

As free agency begins to cool down, team rosters are taking shape and talent continues to emerge across the league. Is it too soon to start placing bets on this year\u2019s MVP? The MLB MVP award is given to one player in each league who showcases peak performances across the 162-game season. MVP winners are characterized by their durability, superb counting stats and importance to their team.\n\nOutfielder Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. of the Atlanta Braves won the National League MVP for the 2023 season. Acu\u00f1a Jr. is a dynamic player who made MLB history with a record-breaking 73 stolen bases and 41 home runs, becoming the first player to surpass 70 and 40 in those categories in the same season. Acu\u00f1a finished the 2023 season with a .337 batting average and a .416 on-base percentage.\n\nShohei Ohtani, then the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 star pitcher and designated hitter, won the American League MVP award by a landslide. Ohtani\u2019s two-way ability makes him a once-in-a-generation talent at the professional level. He won his first MVP in 2021 and became the only player in MLB history to win a second unanimous MVP with his 2023 win.\n\n\u201cSo I wanted to come back stronger and try to win it this year, and I know my rivals, Semien, Seager, they had great seasons, and congrats to them for winning the World Series,\u201d Ohtani, speaking through his interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, told MLB Network when he was announced the AL MVP. \u201cI think it\u2019s awesome. My goal was to try to come out on top, and this kind of pays off all my hard work,\u201d.\n\nIn addition to both the reigning MVP winners, this year\u2019s frontrunners are Juan Soto, Aaron Judge and Mookie Betts. Again, maybe it\u2019s too early to make picks, but is it ever really too early? Not for the true baseball heads.\n\nShohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Dodgers (NL), Pitcher and Designated Hitter\nOhtani ended the 2023 season with a .304 AVG and .412 OBP putting up 44 home runs\u2014and that\u2019s just his stats as a DH. He also had a 3.14 ERA with 167 strikeouts. It\u2019s no surprise he won last season\u2019s MVP, but where does he land now? Given that Ohtani will not be pitching during the 2024 season as heals from elbow surgery, his stats will not look the same as last year. Though he\u2019ll likely produce similar offensive results, he won\u2019t have much to show defensively, which was key to his 2023 campaign. This puts him at a slight disadvantage, however, Ohtani is no stranger to adversity and his work ethic is clearly effective.\n\nWith Ohtani out of Anaheim, there\u2019s now a big opening in the AL for a new most valuable player. Juan Soto, New York Yankees (AL), Left Fielder\nOne player who could fill that open position is former San Diego Padres left fielder Juan Soto, who was traded to the Yankees for the final year of his current contract, worth $31 million. In the 2023 season, he batted a .275 AVG with a .410 OBP and 35 home runs. The numbers speak for themselves. Yankees manager Aaron Boone agrees. \u201cHe\u2019s as good an offensive player as there is,\u201d Boone said of Soto before the trade was completed. \u201cHe is a machine offensively\u2014on base, power, and has accomplished a ton already at a young age.\u201d\n\nThose numbers aren\u2019t too far behind Ohtani and now that Soto will be playing alongside 2022 AL MVP Aaron Judge and AL Gold Glove Award finalist Alex Verdugo, he could potentially have the support he\u2019s needed. This fresh start could launch Soto\u2019s comeback the same way Cody Bellinger\u2019s trade to the Chicago Cubs did for him.\n\nBryce Harper, Philadelphia Phillies (NL), First Baseman and Outfielder\nHarper had a stand-out season in 2023, helping the Phillies advance to just short of an NLCS victory alongside shortstop Trea Turner and outfielder Kyle Schwarber. He posted a .293 AVG with a .401 OBP and 21 home runs. In the postseason, Harper recorded a .286 AVG with a .455 OBP and 5 home runs. Harper is now about halfway through his 13-year contract with the Phillies, meaning he\u2019s had plenty of time to build chemistry with his teammates and find his stride with the franchise. He has shown consistent growth and success since he emerged from the shadows in 2015, winning his first MVP award while with the Washington Nationals, and at the time, becoming the youngest to win unanimously.\n\n\u201cObviously, he\u2019s a Hall of Fame-type talent,\u201d Harper\u2019s agent Scott Boras said. \u201cHe wants to keep his personal pursuits in the game there...He\u2019s been there five years, he\u2019s kind of shown them who he is, and why he\u2019s a franchise player.\u201d He continues to prove that he is a next-level talent with more potential to unlock.\n\nThe 2023 Silver Slugger Award winner is in a good position to carry over his momentum from last season, so will he lead the Phillies to the World Series? If so, an MVP may follow.\n\nCorey Seager, Texas Rangers (AL), Shortstop\nIf the fact that he\u2019s the 2023 World Series MVP isn\u2019t a strong enough argument, maybe his 2020 World Series MVP trophy adds to it. Seager is one of four players in MLB history to win two World Series MVPs, joining Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson and Reggie Jackson. But a regular season MVP still evades him.\n\n\u201cWhen I won in L.A.,\u201d Seager said, \u201cit was a long time since they\u2019d won. I saw what that did for a fan base. When I heard (the Rangers) had never won, it was extremely exciting for me to be part of something and to be able to be on the ground floor and build that.\u201d\n\nSeager was undeniably a huge factor in the Dodgers\u2019 2020 World Series win when he batted .400 with 8 hits, 2 homers, 5 RBIs and 7 runs scored in 6 games against the Rays. Fans had d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu this past season watching Seager post similar numbers as when he led the Rangers to a World Series ring. In five games, he had a batting average of .286 with 6 hits, 3 home runs, 6 RBIs and 6 runs.\n\nHe is currently healing from left sports hernia surgery which is worrisome, but Rangers general manager Chris Young says there\u2019s still potential for Seager to play on Opening Day. The majority of Seager\u2019s contract with the Rangers remains, but now that he\u2019s achieved another Series Title for two longing fanbases, will he let off the gas? Could this be a setback and impede Seager\u2019s 2024 season? Or will it be an ever larger motivator to rise above expectations?\n\nOr perhaps none of these players will capture a 2024 MVP. The league is chock full of talent young and old that figures to make it an exciting awards race.\n```"}
