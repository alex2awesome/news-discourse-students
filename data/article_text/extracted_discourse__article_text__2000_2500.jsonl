The TPLF is a left-wing, ethno-nationalist, paramilitary group which ruled Ethiopia from the early 90s until 2018. The war has seen as many as 600,000 people dead, displaced millions and sparked one of the world\u2019s most dire humanitarian crises. Amnesty International has investigated and reported instances of targeted attacks and massacres of civilians which could amount to crimes against humanity perpetrated by forces on both sides. Most of the fighting took place in the northern Tigray region of the country and civilians there faced the brunt of the violence.\n\nAs communities return to this devastated region and try to put the pieces of their lives back together, the process of grieving continues for members of the Tigrayan diaspora. Salem Tewelde: We had this three-day mourning period a couple of weeks ago where the government released names of all of the martyrs in the Tigray genocide. And everyone found out about someone in their family who had been killed as a part of the Tigray genocide.\n\nThis is the voice of Tigrayan American, Salem Tewelde. She and I went to college together and have been speaking about the impact the war has had on her life since the summer. Tewelde: And I called my mom, and I was like, hey, what did you guys learn? And she said that five of my dad\u2019s nephews had been killed. So just like reconciling how much loss there was in my family and, you know, a total of seven people killed in our family. And there are some people in our Denver community who heard that weekend that their entire family had been killed in Tigray.\n\nThis summer I also spoke with Tewelde\u2019s cousin, Jerusaliem Gebreziabher. They both described the slow and unpredictable trickle of information that broke through the communication blockade that was in place during much of the war. Jerusaliem Gebreziabher: And when I go back, it will have to be with my mom to bury her mother. I got a phone call in February of 2021 from someone who ran across the border to tell me to tell my mom that her mom died, and they didn\u2019t have very much else to say.\n\nGebreziabher said it will be a long time before she\u2019s processed her grandmother\u2019s death. Gebreziabher: I really was looking forward to the day where I could be a support for her and learn from her, learn more about farming and gardening. I think that I\u2019m still processing that loss even though it\u2019s been like two years-ish. And I think I\u2019ll make more sense of it when I\u2019m back in her town and like, burying her for real.\n\nGoing forward, Tewelde says she\u2019s finding inspiration in the strength of her family in Tigray who have turned to rebuilding. In a video that circulated among her diaspora community this month, Tewelde\u2019s aunt spoke with local leaders about the persisting needs of everyday Tigrayans and her worry that national politics were moving on to ports and trading routes too quickly. [Speaking in Tigrinya] Tewelde: She was like, What? Why should we be concerned about the Red Sea and having access to a port? She was like, our concern is Western Tigray, is the displacement of Western Tigrayans and the occupation and the protracted violence that\u2019s still ongoing there.\n\nFor herself, Tewelde says, she\u2019s processing her own grief through solidarity. Tewelde: The urgency of the moment, of course, is really activating people. And my hope is just that we really think about, like how far we are willing to extend our solidarities. And why, if ever, do we think our solidarities have an end? Have a boundary?\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Jules Feeney.\n```"}

Photo courtesy of Frederic J. Brown / AFP.\n\nBy John Broadway November 07, 2023 at 6:38 pm PST\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the day \u201clegends never die\u201d became a phrase etched in my consciousness. The day was Sunday, Jan. 26, 2020. It was an abnormally cloudy morning for the typical sunny Southern California. As I began an early morning drive, I was in high spirits despite the overcast sky. I remember telling myself that nothing could ruin my mood that day. Fate proved me wrong. I arrived at my friend\u2019s house in Long Beach, expecting a day full of activities. Before we left to get some food a pall cast over us. I got the news that no Angeleno could have ever believed; Kobe Bryant, alongside his daughter Gianna \u201cGigi\u201d Bryant, was pronounced dead alongside seven others after a fatal helicopter crash in Calabasas.\n\nOnce I processed my emotions, I knew I couldn\u2019t continue my day as if nothing had happened. I even canceled a date, so I could visit the Staples Center knowing there would be a memorial for him there. When I approached the arena, I faced a mass of fans littered in the street. Many were gathered as they looked up at a massive electronic billboard spanned from multiple levels of a downtown skyscraper. The usually colorful billboard was all black apart from a picture of Kobe accompanied by \u201cAugust 23, 1976\u2013January 20th, 2020 Mamba Forever.\u201d I joined the crowd and happened to settle next to an elderly woman. I held back my tears while hers streamed freely. We caught each other\u2019s eyes for a moment \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, man\u201d she wept. Something in my spirit whispered to me to hug her. I wanted to but chose not to out of respect. I always think back to that moment. How could someone be so moved to want to hug a stranger after sharing a space with them for a couple of seconds? I find this a testament to Kobe\u2019s cultural presence among Angelenos.\n\nOur shared love and grief for him brought strangers together in ways that very few things can. Los Angeles\u2019 love for the Black Mamba is also reflected in the community\u2019s resistance to one of his most iconic murals removal.\n\nMamba Mentality\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the day I first laid eyes on the Kobe and Gigi mural plastered on the exterior of Hardcore Fitness. The sun crept into the sky, as it illuminated idle downtown streets. I rode my bike home after my usual early morning gym session. As I cruised south on Grand St. past Hardcore Fitness, I quickly slammed on my breaks. The stunned nature of the mural compelled me to dismount and I took a picture. I stood before the mural awed by the artistry. I loved the way they gazed at each other as they stood above milky clouds with crisply detailed angel wings on their back. What added to its sense of beauty was the fact that I encountered this mural after I engaged in a habit \u2014 early morning workouts inspired by my pursuit of Kobe\u2019s \u201cMamba Mentality.\u201d\n\nThe mural evokes the energy of \u201cMamba Mentality,\u201d a mantra that inspires me and others in the community to embark on a relentless quest to be the best version of ourselves. While I spoke to Kimberly Serani, a KTLA reporter and Hardcore Fitness gym member, she attested to this feeling. \u201cEven when I don\u2019t wanna come to the gym in the morning when I look at the mural, basically it\u2019s like an endurance boost and it reminds me of everything that I can do for myself and the community,\u201d Serani said.\n\nCecilian Moran, the owner of the gym, told ABC7 that her landlord wants the mural gone to make way for advertising. Despite the mural being listed as a location in Apple Maps and drawing fans from around the world to the building. But as another L.A. legend, Nipsey Hussle, once said \u201cthe highest human act is to inspire.\u201d And I can definitively say this mural does that.\n\nThe team behind KobeMural.com, an organization that tracks Kobe Bryant murals, created a change.org petition to save the mural. There are over 90,000 signatures. One signatory, named Sherry Hueul, left a particularly meaningful comment. \u201cKobe will always be considered a son of Los Angeles. The mural is a symbol of our hearts. He had a profound positive influence, as a dedicated husband, father, friend to those who knew him...He has inspired thousands if not millions of hearts around the world. The mural depicts the love he shared with his daughter...It brought fathers and daughters closer.\u201d Hueul commented.\n\nThe site of a contested Kobe Bryant mural in Downtown Los Angeles. Photo by John Broadway.\n\n#GirlDad\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the day I was inspired to become a girl dad. One sunny afternoon I walked to the USC village field to play catch with some friends. Something about tossing a football always brings me back to the childhood joy I felt when I would do the same with my father. I imagined how it would feel to one day play catch with my son. With the backdrop of the viral #girldad trend in my mind, my thoughts wandered to whether I would be as excited to play catch with my daughter. The trend started days after Kobe\u2019s death when Sportscenter host Elle Duncan shared a story about Kobe. \u201cI\u2019d have five more girls if I could. I\u2019m a girl dad,\u201d Kobe said.\n\nThe story prompted proud dads to share pictures on social media with their daughters. Raising a girl in a violent, patriarchal society brought an extra layer of fear and apprehension to the idea of parenting a daughter. But then I started to think about the role fathers play in raising women who can defy patriarchy and live life on their terms. I thought about Kobe and his relationship with his daughter Gigi likely instilled the confident fierce nature she exuded. What if I raised a daughter who would know how to love herself because of how I loved her? If I raised a daughter, would she command respect because she respects herself? Would she be a well-adjusted bada\u2014 who did not take sh\u2014 from anyone? Suddenly, the thought of being a #girldad energized me. For the first time, I was excited for an opportunity to forge a relationship with a daughter one day, like Kobe and Gigi\u2019s bond.\n\nIt stems from the same relationship that is immortalized in the mural as Kobe and Gigi look lovingly at each other. Moran told The LA Times she lost her father in 2019. She shared how that makes the mural so meaningful for her. \u201cI fell in love with the idea of having [Kobe] looking after Gigi. I feel that\u2019s how my father was looking after me,\u201d Moran told the LA Times.\n\nGigi and Kobe Bryant. Courtesy of Kobe Bryant via Instagram.com.\n\nCommunity\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the days after Kobe\u2019s death. One day, the grief hit me particularly hard. I could barely focus at work, so I decided to seek out the comfort that came with communal grief. I left the building where I worked Downtown and headed to the Staples Center where fans grieved. On the way I took a moment and appreciated the iconic United Artists across the street which had \u201cR.I.P Kobe\u201d spelled out on the marquee. City buses passed and bore the same words on their digital destination sign. In the distance, City Hall shined with purple and gold lights as a nod to the colors the Laker legend donned for 20 years. People had already spray-painted his name on property throughout L.A. The entire city grieved.\n\nStill, as I approached L.A. Live, it was clear that nothing could match the atmosphere that existed across the street from the arena where Kobe dazzled fans for decades. Hundreds of fans flocked in variations of Kobe jerseys and shirts. There was a designated space for people to write notes and messages to Kobe on the ground and along a huge paper wall. The space was decorated with a sea of flowers, wreaths, jerseys and other gifts. These funeral adornments dwarfed anything I had ever seen.\n\nWhen I joined the chants of \u201cKobe\u201d that intermittently erupted amongst the crowd, an unexpected rush of appreciation warmed me like a winter coat. The unity in the community was new to me. I would have never imagined other mourners would support, affirm and uplift my process. That moment showed me the power of community.\n\nThe Kobe and Gigi mural represents that community. Based on the words of Louie Palsino, the muralist who painted the work, he might agree. \u201cThe community, when we did it, so many people from around the world came out and watched me do it,\u201d Palsino continued in an interview with the LA Times, \u201cI always considered that piece like a group effort. There were people bringing me food, feeding me. It was awesome, man, just the energy that people were putting out there was just great. It was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I got to share that moment with everybody.\u201d\n\nPalsino\u2019s experience with the mural demonstrates how meaningful art can be for a community. The property owner may prioritize his financial gains over the intangible, but ignore the positive impact that this mural has on his neighbors \u2014 the inspiration of the Mamba Mentality, the loving affection of a girl dad and the shared grief in the city of angels.\n\nGaming company NBA 2k recently reached a deal with the landlord to keep the mural up for another year. While this is good news, for now, the community may find itself in this same place next year. Nevertheless, even if the mural meets its end, as long as the impact that Kobe had is carried in the hearts and minds of our community, the legend of the Black Mamba will never die.\n\nIn the days after Kobe\u2019s death fans wrote notes to the basketball player on the ground outside of Staples Center.

Kessler, a part of the \u201cWe Are Pro-Israel\u201d counter protest, got into an altercation with a pro-Palestinian protester. Though the details are still unclear, the autopsy revealed the cause of death was blunt force head trauma, and the injuries were consistent with a fall. Kesler was pronounced dead early Sunday morning as a result of sustained head injuries. There is an ongoing investigation surrounding the altercation. The Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Department identified the suspect as a 50-year-old man, who has been complying with police during the investigation. Police reported that there have been 21 protests surrounding the Israel-Hamas war since October, however this is the first time it has made way to physical violence. No arrests have been made and the Ventura County police department is asking those present at the time of the incident to send videos of the altercation.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a Los Angeles area fire weather watch that will go into effect at noon tomorrow and will remain until 6 p.m. on Thursday.

But not everyone is too happy, as protesters took to the streets last week to speak out against the building\u2019s development.\n\nProtesters march on a street in Boyle Heights. (Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Amrita Vora, Riley Rodriguez and Lindsey Miller November 07, 2023 at 6:05 pm PST\n\nAs USC is looking to expand their research facilities in Boyle Heights at the USC Health Sciences Campus, the issues of gentrification start to rise. 50 protesters marched last week in East LA to oppose the seven story, 202,000 square-foot building that USC is trying to implement. The protesters want respect, and the community wants to be heard. This isn\u2019t USC first rodeo in terms of expanding their campuses without listening to input from members within that community. When the university expanded its new and improved USC Village in 2017, more families and community members faced displacement causing them to face economic issues. In both of these instances, USC is \u201cpricing out\u201d residents. In this case, the residents of Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, Romona Gardens and El Sereno will be affected by the gentrification.\n\nThe university plans to build the \u2018Discovery and Translational Hub\u2019, which would include laboratories, a lecture hall and a cafe. Thomas Buchanan, the vice dean at the Keck School of Medicine discusses what the hub will comprise of.\n\nThomas Buchanan: This is going to be right in the center of our campus. So, it\u2019s physically a hub, but also operationally a hub where we link up community patient and population research with basic research to develop new treatments and diagnostics and then test those and initially get them to the clinic in our hospitals and clinics.\n\nHe adds that a new building is imperative to continue the research that USC is doing.\n\nBuchanan: So, the only way we can grow in the research program and grow that impact that we want to have is by building a new research building...So basically, we want to expand our ability to do cutting edge research and therefore expand its impact. We have about a little over 200 research teams now doing federally funded research at USC. We want to double that in the next 7 to 10 years.\n\nBuchanan adds that one of the aims is to benefit the surrounding communities.\n\nBuchanan: We want to make sure that the research we\u2019re doing is done with the communities that surround them at our campuses so that the results will be applicable to them. As we get more precise on how we should treat people from different backgrounds and also how we treat individual patients.\n\nCinthia Gonzalez, a tenant coordinator for the East Side opposes this development.\n\nCinthia Gonzalez: So as a coalition, we stand against any development and particularly development in our surrounding areas to Boyle Heights that have no real solutions and no real plan on how to include the neighborhood. And our are deep concerns of gentrification.\n\nGonzalez emphasizes how concerned she is because she states that residents are not being prioritized. She adds that there have been conversations with the university regarding the building of the hub.\n\nGonzalez: We\u2019ve had concerns and many different and conversations with the U.S. prior to this development, transnational hub development. And none of the concerns that we have brought up based on what the community is saying, based on community members themselves, is taking into consideration.\n\nGonzalez led a march against gentrification to show the public that there are actual people being affected...It all correlates really down to how or how corporations and landlords see people as profit and don\u2019t see them as human beings that need housing.\n\nBuchanan, however, notes that it is not the university\u2019s intent to cause problems in the surrounding areas.\n\nBuchanan: But it\u2019s certainly not our intention to take anybody\u2019s homes away. It\u2019s not our intention to make anybody\u2019s life worse. We are doing this from those of us that come to work every day thinking about how to do research for better health... We want to make sure that we\u2019re doing that with and for our local communities. So, this building is really about that. And I hope that the community will understand that we\u2019re not building the Death Star in East Los Angeles, where we\u2019re basically here to build something that\u2019s really going to be highly beneficial to the communities. And we\u2019d like to work with them to make sure the building has as little impact as possible in their lives, but to make sure the building goes up and can have what we know will be beneficial effects for health of people in general, but especially being relevant to the people in our communities.\n\nThe planning commission will next meet on December 7th regarding USC\u2019s permit.\n```"}

(Photo by Estelle Atkinson)\n\nBy Estelle Atkinson November 07, 2023 at 6:01 pm PST\n\nClarissa Valdovinos, an executive secretary who has worked at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) for over a decade, says Board President Cynthia McClain-Hill reprimanded her for taking a pre-approved day off from work to celebrate her birthday. Valdovinos believes this to be an act of retaliation against her after she reported a fellow employee for sexually harassing her, she said in a press conference Tuesday. \u201cShe ridiculed me. She discussed the way I dress,\u201d Valdovinos said of McClain-Hill\u2019s response to the alleged harassment.\n\nValdovinos is one of four plaintiffs seeking monetary damages and a jury trial for labor law violations and sexual harassment against the City of Los Angeles and the Department of Water and Power. The announcement came just hours after disbarred lawyer Paul Paradis was sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for accepting a kickback of more than $2 million in a collusive lawsuit against the DWP.\n\nIn a Victim Impact Statement, Tamerlin Godley, a litigation partner at Paul Hastings LLP acting on behalf of the DWP, wrote that \u201cParadis betrayed the public trust and manipulated numerous individuals for his personal game. Others have and will be held to account for their actions, and so should Paradis.\u201d\n\nThe official complaint made against DWP, City of L.A. by plaintiffs Rodriguez, Vicino, Woodard and Valdovinos\n\nArlene Rodriguez, another plaintiff, said that while working as executive assistant to the DWP general manager, she was \u201csubjected to flagrant and continued sexual harassment.\u201d The official complaint lists several comments allegedly made to Rodriguez by Utility Administrator Brian Gibson, including \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate to call the GM\u2019s Assistant \u2018cute,\u2019 but I have to risk it,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re making me feel like a dirty old man\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m an old man with delusions of grandeur.\u201d Rodriguez said that no action was taken when she reported this harassment. Instead, according to the complaint, McClain-Hill began to retaliate against her in June 2021. Rodriguez has been subjected to payroll audits, and McClain-Hill has been hostile to her in meetings.\n\nAlso alleging sexual harassment is DWP\u2019s former director of security and emergency management, Christopher Vicino. His allegations land on McClain-Hill herself. He alleges she told him, \u201cDon\u2019t you look good in your tight little suit,\u201d while the pair were in an elevator together on a fact-finding trip in Israel.\n\nThe complaint also accuses McClain-Hill of policy violations, alleging that she had invoices re-written so as to avoid paying for meals, merchandise and gifts enjoyed at the Accenture International Utilities and Energy Conference.\n\n\u201cWhile we cannot comment on pending litigation involving employment matters, Board President McClain-Hill denies the misuse of any ratepayer funds,\u201d a DWP spokesperson wrote in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cIn the circumstance mentioned in the litigation, she was advised that the appropriate course of action to avoid taking an impermissible gift of meals while attending a business-related conference in her capacity as Board President was to submit for reimbursement by LADWP.\u201d\n\nL.A. city officials also declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nVicino is claiming wrongful termination, having been removed from his role in March 2023. Part of this claim rests on his efforts to report a cyber intrusion conducted by DWP contractor and Paradis-owned utility solutions company, Aventador (renamed Ardent Cyber Solutions LLC). The company was also the subject of another DWP scandal.\n\nAccording to a plea agreement for one felony charge of making false statements signed by former head of DWP David Alexander, Paradis successfully bribed Alexander to secure a no-bid contract for Aventador with the DWP.\n\nAfter Aventador conducted the breach of the DWP network, Vicino requested that the company prepare a report for auditing purposes, according to the complaint. Aventador allegedly refused. Vicino made the same request of Alexander, who also allegedly refused.\n\nEarly the next year, in January 2019, Vicino\u2019s staff prepared a report documenting the exercise, which he claims was submitted to a confidential server accessible by Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) auditors. Soon after, Aventador submitted a technical report themselves.\n\nAccording to the complaint, in June 2020, when the WECC conducted an audit, the documentation of the intrusion was missing and the auditors were not in possession of the technical report from Aventador.\n\nA couple of months later, Vicino made a complaint about the \u201cdeliberate omission\u201d of this report. After his initial complaints, an audit of Vicino\u2019s own division regarding overtime hours was allegedly proposed by McClain-Hill and performed by the DWP\u2019s Inspector General.\n\nWhen presented to the department\u2019s board, the audit stated, \u201cfalsely,\u201d the complaint alleges, that \u201cthere was evidence of overtime being incurred even though no work was performed.\u201d\n\nVicino sought to clarify his overtime statistics, requesting they be compared to those of other similar divisions within DWP.\n\nAs the FBI was investigating the matter for evidence of \u201cbribery, kickbacks and extortion\u201d adjacent to the scandals involving Paradis, Vicino said he met with DWP general manager Martin Adams and told him that he was going to tell the FBI that the missing document was being withheld.\n\nVicino then \u201casked Adams if he was going to be fired for this.\u201d Adams said no, but Vicino was fired just weeks later in what the complaint calls an act of retaliation and wrongful termination.\n\nThe fourth plaintiff, Woodard, was also terminated after assurances were said to be made by Adams that her \u201cposition would be safe\u201d following complaints she made that McClain-Hill was advocating for Dakota Communications, a minority-owned consulting firm, to be reconsidered for a contract with DWP. The firm had failed to submit mandatory forms and, as Woodard said in an interview for the subsequent investigation, had been disqualified.\n\nWoodard complained that McClain-Hill\u2019s actions were unethical.\n\n\u201cThe common theme is each of my clients has reported wrongdoing, and thereafter they suffered retaliation,\u201d said Bradley Gage, the attorney representing the plaintiffs. Gage said he is seeking, beyond justice for the victims, that the FBI and other federal investigators continue to push forward, as he believes \u201cthis is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nGage said claims made as recently as Paradis\u2019 sentencing Tuesday may indicate that more indictments are on the horizon for the DWP.\n\nIn some of his last moments in court, Paradis accused former City Attorney Mike Feuer, who has denied knowledge of the billing scandal, of perjuring himself, lying to the grand jury and investigators. He also told the court, \u201cWhat I did was wrong, and I accept the consequences. I\u2019m a changed man, a broken man.\u201d\n```"}

For some people, cooking a Thanksgiving feast for an entire family can be stressful. But for students like Kailyn Bryant, whose a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics, and law, her family tradition includes a friendly cooking competition.\n\nKailyn Bryant: There\u2019s a lot of chefs in my family, so they kind of like, are competitive when it comes to food. So Iike, if it\u2019s a big Thanksgiving, then everybody would try to make the best macaroni or the best, like ham or turkey. So I guess kind of just, well me, I\u2019m not ever in the kitchen. But like, taste testing is like one of my favorite things because I just judge, like, oh, that\u2019s not okay. But, you know, I just keep it pushing, but overall, it\u2019s fun to be with my family.\u201d\n\nFor some USC students, traveling back home is not an option for the short break, so they will have to start traditions with their friends. Pratham Aggarwal, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, is looking forward to spending time with friends from school since he is unable to return home to his family in India.\n\nPratham Aggarwal: I think just being around someone\u2019s family, because I do miss my family a lot as well. So I think like being around, like that whole vibe of being with the family is something that I\u2019m looking forward to more than the food.\n\nHowever, students like Sophomore, computational neuroscience major Zenmarah Duriusseau says that she likes to enjoy her family traditions without acknowledging the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nZenmarah Duriusseau: I don\u2019t really like Thanksgiving just because like the real meaning behind it. It\u2019s just really just horrible. But I mean, it\u2019s kind of like a national cookout holiday for me, I guess. So my family, parts of them are Creole, so we don\u2019t really do like the traditional, like Turkey and like all that stuff. So we\u2019ll have like jambalaya and like gumbo and just like a little like different types of food like that.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019m looking forward to eating all of my families New Orleans styled dishes and setting up the Christmas tree with hot chocolate and Christmas music blaring in the background.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Monique Davis.\n```"}

Democratic President Joe Biden has repeatedly backed Israel, and in turn, received criticism from his constituents. We talked to USC student Talia, a senior communications major about how Biden\u2019s stance might affect his campaign during the 2024 Presidential Election.\n\nMany people who historically vote democrat never felt passionate about him to begin with. Rather, they felt he was a last-resort to avoid another Trump presidency. So, many of his voters were already apprehensive about Biden\u2019s stances, and expected to disagree with him on many issues, even the war.\n\nTalia: My opinion, my opinion is very different from Biden\u2019s, but at the same time, I feel like I\u2019ve always had pretty different opinions than he did. He used to work as a segregationist. So he\u2019s never been somebody that I really wanted to support. But I voted for him, like literally out of fear of having Donald Trump in office. So it\u2019s like lesser of two evils actually just turned out to be just as evil, you know.\n\nBut for many, including Talia, Biden\u2019s support toward Israel was the last straw.\n\nTalia: I think I mean, I think right now we\u2019re seeing a really this is kind of been a catalyst for people being like, yeah, actually I never really supported that guy. I don\u2019t support that guy and I won\u2019t support him again. But I do think that among me and my friends, it\u2019s been always kind of like, well, he said he would forgive student loans. He never did that. He said he would make efforts to improve just overall life for people. And he hasn\u2019t done any of those things. So it\u2019s kind of as if he\u2019s had all these unfulfilled promises and now we\u2019re seeing that he can send $14 billion to Israel no problem.\n\nVoters have already vowed to abstain from re-electing Biden in 2024. This is especially apparent on Biden\u2019s Instagram page. Talia scrolled through the comments on Biden\u2019s most recent post and shared her impressions.\n\nTalia: I think it\u2019s going to hurt him a lot. When he posted something on his Instagram. All of the comments were like, we\u2019re not voting for you. I can\u2019t support you anymore. I can\u2019t believe you do all these things. Literally, almost every single comment I saw was pretty anti-Biden at this point in time.\n\nNext year, voters will visit the ballot remembering Biden\u2019s stance regarding the war between Israel and Hamas. Talia believes that former Republican President Donald Trump might have the upper hand following recent global events.\n\nTalia: Trump does have a pretty he\u2019s kind of antiwar like on a very, very soft note, I think he\u2019s a little more antiwar. And it\u2019s mostly to protect his own economic interests because, war is expensive, you know?\n\nIn a party whose young people overwhelmingly support Palestine, Biden will have to find a way to regain the support of his gen-z voters. Based on how the last month has gone, it appears that continuing to send money to Israel may not be the best way.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nolan Ezzet.\n```"}

Finishing off what most anime viewers call a masterpiece of a show, it\u2019s the second half of the final chapters. The 85-minute-long episode follows after part 1, an hour long special, that was released March 4th of this year. But on USC campus, students like Malik Mixon, dreaded the 9 month wait.\n\nMalik Mixon: I kind of feel like they were milking it, obviously, in my opinion. Like I\u2019m watching. I think the final part, part one or something like that, or is like, I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s the end. But then like they\u2019re like, Nah is another movie. I\u2019m like, Bro. So now I got to wait another six months or another year just to watch the final part. But Mixon also sees value in the long wait.\n\nMixon: I think I feel like that time was like, well, it\u2019s been like it went by fast and I feel like I think they actually put their time into it. So I think it was worth the wait.\n\nEven with the wait, USC students like Joshua Morgan think that \u2018Attack on Titan\u2019 is anime perfection.\n\nJoshua Morgan: I would describe it as a heartbreaking philosophical masterpiece. Masterpiece? I don\u2019t know the dude\u2019s name, but it was very dark. But it was very, very good.\n\nAgreed to be one of the best anime shows, others on campus like Mika Shardarbekova, who hasn\u2019t seen the finale yet, but plans to watch later on for her own reasons.\n\nMika Shardarbekova: I haven\u2019t seen it, but I need to see it to see the finale, because I heard they changed the manga ending, so I just want to see what it is.\n\nOthers like USC student and \u2018Attack on Titan\u2019 fan, Aditya Thiyag, believes that there\u2019s a difference between the anime and manga when it comes to the final episode like the author\u2019s intentions.\n\nAditya Thiyag: I believe that his ideas were better translated into an anime format than they were in the manga, which felt a little more rushed.\n\nDescribed as \u2018peak fiction\u2019 by Mixon, USC and \u2018Attack on Titan\u2019 holds a similarity in the mantra of \u2018Fighting on,\u2019 according to Thiyag.\n\nThiyag: So the saying, \u2018Tatakae\u2019 is a very important one in the world of attack on Titan. It\u2019s mostly said by the protagonist, Eren Yeager, who believes in his mission of, you know, which starts out being killing all of the titans but ultimately can be reduced to I\u2019m fighting on so I can protect the ones that I love. And throughout the entire course of the show, no matter how much Eren goes through, that throughline is still there. That mission, that focus is still there. And I feel like that can be translated to USC students because regardless of what each of us are fighting for, whether it\u2019s something in our personal lives, whether it\u2019s change we\u2019re hoping to create in the world or even in our academics or athletics, I believe that if all of us have that mentality of, you know, sticking to it, fighting on, as long as we\u2019re focused on what we want to do, then the through line of fighting on remains like the focus and remains what\u2019s really important.\n\nMixon relates to this theme of fighting on.\n\nMixon: With me as an athlete, I kind of feel like they mean the same thing to some degree. You know, at the end of the day, like, no matter like what life throws at you, you still have to fight on and keep pushing.\n\nMixon offers advice to those who plan on watching now that it is over and believes that \u2018Attack on Titan\u2019 is worth a shot, even if you aren\u2019t someone who watches anime.\n\nMixon: If you don\u2019t watch anime, watch it because it will make you like anime and give it a chance. Cause I think a lot of it, I think Attack on Titan is the best piece of fiction I\u2019ve ever, like, watched or at all compared to everything that I do watch. So, give it a shot and it\u2019ll change your life.\n\nHere at USC, we say \u2018fight on\u2019, but as \u2018Attack on Titan\u2019 fans, we say, \u2018tatakae!\u2019 For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Spartacus Smith.\n```"}

But it seems as if the road to being crowned champion isn\u2019t as easy as many thought it\u2019d be.\n\nOver the years, super teams have had the reputation of struggling from the start, with some not winning a championship at all. Examples include the Brooklyn Nets and the Oklahoma City Thunder who have had teams revolving around at least two all-star players, but failing to win a championship. Outside of basketball, there are teams like the Los Angeles Angels who have never seen the light of day when it comes to winning the World Series, even after having players such as Mike Trout, Shohei Ohtani and Albert Pujols.\n\nRecently, teams like the Los Angeles Clippers and the number-one-ranked Louisiana State University Tigers women\u2019s basketball team struggled in their debuts, after adding high-level talent to their already-established rosters. The Clippers added 10-time all-star James Harden to their star-studded roster containing Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard. The Tigers added Hailey Van Lith through the transfer portal to team up with Angel Reese and Flau\u2019jae Johnson and become back-to-back national champions.\n\nWith the Clippers losing to the New York Knicks in Harden\u2019s debut and the Tigers dropping their season opener against the Colorado Buffaloes, it caused some concerns given that both teams were favored heavily to win. Media outlets were quick to express their thoughts regarding these organizations following their losses. But it\u2019s still a bit early to determine a team\u2019s overall season success, given that the season just started for both teams.\n\nAs these teams look to bounce back from their losses, USC students explained their outlook on the reputation of super teams and their early struggles. Zach Bittino, USC freshman majoring in business administration, said the fall of these types of teams comes from the vibe that they get amongst each other. Bittino said he doesn\u2019t believe in the concept of a super team because of prior experiences and how many of them look out for themselves rather than the team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chemistry thing,\u201d Bittino said. \u201cThe big thing about team play is that you have to be able to work together and with my experience with super teams, everyone wants to play for themselves. They don\u2019t really understand how to play with each other yet.\u201d\n\nAndrew Harbour, USC freshman and member of the Trojan baseball team, disregarded any sort of idea behind super teams because of the ways in which he\u2019s seen them pan out. Harbour said he knows that, with players being who they are, it would lead to a lot of complications.\n\n\u201cMy feelings on super teams is that they never end well,\u201d Harbour said. \u201cToo many big personalities clashing. Too much going on. Kind of end up being failures.\u201d\n\nHarbour also said the fall of the super teams stems from not only the players, but the coaches as well. This leads to the results that many are able to see through the media.\n\n\u201cIt starts with the coaches and with the players to take the initiative and take the time to want to have a relationship with one another,\u201d Harbour said. \u201cThat goes a long way with what you see on the field and the overall performance as a team.\u201d\n\nMax Miller, USC senior and a member of the Trojan water polo team, said he knows what it takes to connect the minds of players. Miller said the ideal of being a great team with great players all depends on what the players are willing to do for each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had teams in the past that have had great players, but the cohesion wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Miller said. \u201cCommunicating is the number one thing with being on the same page. So spending a lot of time together so everyone gets to know each other works the best.\u201d\n\nNonah Waldron, a USC freshman studying business administration and member of the Trojan track and field team, acknowledged what the team goes through knowing that expectations are high.\n\n\u201cObviously they have rocky starts, but that\u2019s because you\u2019re putting together a team full of people who are used to being the best on their team,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cWhen you train with the best of the best, it\u2019s only gonna make you better as a collective.\u201d\n\nBut Waldron said success comes day by day, not in an instant. Waldron said she believes all players that have the same mindset will help the team achieve success, knowing everyone is on the same page.\n\n\u201cCreate shared goals,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cAnd when everyone reaches a consensus of one goal, one common goal, one common dream and everyone working towards one thing, then it\u2019ll come together over time.\n```"}

While it was an unnatural response in the world of sports, William\u2019s response came across as very human and relatable to any pet-owner.\n\nEveryone who owns a pet knows how it feels to have a bad day \u2014 whether it be at school or work \u2014 the only way to make it better is by going home and playing with your pet. In a study done by the University of British Columbia-Okanagan, research suggests that spending time with a pet can improve mental well-being. The reasoning for this is that when you interact with your pet, whether it be playing with them, scratching them or even cuddling them, you are releasing the \u201chappiness\u201d hormone known as serotonin. Not only does the hormone affect the owner\u2019s mood in a positive way, but it affects the pets\u2019 as well. Serotonin brings a pet and its owner closer together and helps them establish trust. This is the same type of hormone that bonds a mother with their child.\n\n\u201cPlaying and spending time with your dog is very therapeutic,\u201d said dog owner Wesely Anhart. \u201cYou know your dog is there for you all the time, and that they do not judge you. They have an unconditional love for you as their owner. They are your anchor in a way, and help keep you grounded.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, more and more people look to animals to help them deal with their mental health. A study done by The Assistance Dog Center in collaboration with CertaPet showed that owners of emotional support animals felt heightened levels of security and energy. Along with this, the study also showed a decrease in stress for the owners.\n\nKimberly Villanueva is a dog owner who knows well too much about the impact an emotional support animal can have on their owner. Villanueva has had a troubled past \u2014 she has attempted suicide twice and constantly struggled with depression and anxiety. That all changed seven years ago, though, when she rescued three-month old Penny. Penny coming into Villanueva\u2019s life was a match made in heaven for the two. Their bond quickly grew and they became inseparable. Wherever Villanueva goes, Penny is surely following.\n\nSince Penny\u2019s arrival, Villanueva\u2019s self harm has reduced by 100%. In Penny, Villanueva not only found a reason to live, but she also found her best friend. \u201cShe reminds me to take care of myself. She is the reason I get out of bed, because I have to walk her three times a day. When I feed her and she eats, she reminds me to eat too,\u201d said Villanueva. \u201cShe has completely improved my quality of life. I cannot imagine my life without her. Without a doubt, Penny saved me.\u201d```"}

Rahimi. Oral arguments in the case concluded Tuesday morning, raising critical questions about the court\u2019s evolving standard for revising gun regulations to align with historical firearm legislation.\n\nIn the landmark 2022 New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, contended that any firearm regulation must be rooted in historical precedent. \u201cThe government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation,\u201d Thomas wrote.\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer, however, expressed reservations about the court\u2019s extensive reliance on history. He argued that this approach is not only unnecessary but also impractical, given that judges are not historians and legal experts may struggle with contested historical questions when applied to contemporary issues.\n\nThe plaintiff in the current case, 23-year-old Zackey Rahimi from Texas, faces multiple charges, with his hearing centered around alleged firearm possession after a domestic violence protective order prohibited him from carrying weapons. Prosecutors claim that Rahimi participated in five shootings during this period.\n\nA decision in Rahimi\u2019s case could have far-reaching implications that potentially undermine a long-standing law designed to protect domestic violence survivors from the threat of firearms. Matthew Wright, the public defender representing Rahimi, argues that there is no historical basis for preventing non-convicted felons from owning firearms in their homes. He suggests that this issue should be evaluated independently from attitudes toward domestic violence.\n\nGun advocacy groups, on the other hand, are closely following this case. Some argue that overturning the domestic violence law could jeopardize the safety of domestic violence survivors, potentially giving more rights to gun owners than to those at risk.\n\nIn a statement from March For Our Lives, a student-led organization advocating for gun control legislation, Executive Director Natalie Fall warned of the consequences of overturning the domestic violence law. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Gun violence is a choice that our leaders are forcing on us,\u201d Fall said in the statement. \u201cForcing on young people. Forcing on domestic violence survivors. And it\u2019s a choice now that the Supreme Court has. Young people are inheriting our future now. This is the world we are inheriting. And we are not going to accept a world where the gun lobby has more rights than we do.\u201d\n\nHannah Messer, a USC sophomore studying English, said that it\u2019s now the younger generations\u2019 turn to take a strong stance on what they believe is right. \u201cI think that the law should be upheld to further protect domestic violence victims. It\u2019s important for the Supreme Court to remain consistent on its past rulings and gun regulation decisions.\u201d\n\nAs the Supreme Court deliberates on this pivotal case, the outcome may have far-reaching consequences for the intersection of gun rights, domestic violence protections and the historical context in which such decisions are made. \u201cThe irony should not be lost on us that while the survivors of the most horrific instances of violence bravely tell their stories outside today, arbitrary legal doctrines are being debated inside the cushioned seats of the Justices\u2019 chambers,\u201d said Makennan McBryde, Legal Associate at March For Our Lives. \u201cWe are standing here together today to show them just what is at stake in their decision.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/07/last-best-and-final-sag-aftra-strike-persists/", "response": "```\nLos Angeles \u2018Last, best and final:\u2019 SAG-AFTRA strike persists \n\nSeveral A.I. sticking points are in the way of an end to the actors\u2019 strike.\n\nSAG-AFTRA members on the picket line at Paramount Studios on Oct. 3. Photo by Anthony Clingerman.\n\nBy Tamara Almoayed and Anthony Clingerman November 07, 2023 at 4:16 pm PST\n\nNegotiations between the Screen Actor\u2019s Guild and prominent Hollywood studios have again stalled after the most recent negotiation Monday. The actor\u2019s union began a picket against Hollywood earlier this year following issues related to artificial intelligence, as well as other topics like residual pay and a simultaneous strike by the Writers Guild of America.\n\nThis week, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers presented what they called the \u201cLast, Best & Final\u201d offer to SAG negotiators this week, but the representatives announced the rejection of these terms in an online press release.\n\nArtificial intelligence is a primary concern for the embattled actors, as some journeymen have been forced to sign their digital likenesses away in perpetuity in order to find work. Some ethical concerns have also arisen regarding the use of deepfake technology, and the emulation of the deceased is yet another hot-button issue being debated in production circles.\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the National Executive Director for SAG-AFTRA, spoke during a press conference at the strike\u2019s onset. \u201cActors now face an existential threat to their livelihoods with the risk of generative A.I... the board has determined that union members should withhold their labor until a fair contract can be achieved,\u201d Crabtree-Ireland said. \u201cThey proposed that our background actors should be able to get scanned and get paid for one day... Their company should be able to use and own that image and likeness to use for the rest of eternity in any project for no consent.\u201d\n\nThere are precedents for the use of actor\u2019s likenesses after their death, as the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise has previously resurrected Carrie Fisher and Peter Cullen to digitally reprise their roles. The Fast and the Furious\u2019 7th entry also included a digital recreation of Paul Walker, and leveraged a CGI body double in order to finish his unfilmed scenes.\n\nThese concerns closely mirror the WGA\u2019s own protest against Hollywood decision makers, as the fear of generative A.I. replacing human writers provided a focal point for those negotiations. The final terms of that contract stipulated that artificial intelligence wouldn\u2019t be used for the writing or rewriting of material, and also restricted the training of deep-learning models on previously-written work. Writers are allowed to leverage these tools for their own creative processes.\n\nLisa Takeuchi Cullen, Writers Guild of America East President, called for solidarity with the striking actors in a press conference announcing the contract in July. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the AMPTP to put the rest of the town back to work by negotiating a fair contract with our SAG-AFTRA siblings,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cUntil the studios make a deal that addresses the needs of performers, WGA members will be on the picket lines, walking side-by-side with SAG-AFTRA in solidarity.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Hollywood and A.I. is sparking concerns among students hoping for careers in the industry. Ethan Holder, a junior studying musical theater at USC, acknowledged that A.I. has the power to eliminate acting as a profession. If it did, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a dream to chase anymore.\u201d He hopes an A.I. takeover doesn\u2019t come to pass. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same as watching a real human\u2014the likeness doesn\u2019t compare.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Griesser, a sophomore in Cinema and Media Studies, agrees with Holder, saying \u201cHonestly I\u2019m not super anxious about A.I. taking over the film industry... Ultimately A.I. cannot replace art and the fundamental human nature of creativity.\u201d\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA strike, which began in July, has disrupted the industry. It postponed multiple productions, decreased movie ticket sales, and cut into box office numbers. Further negotiations are expected to continue.\n```"}

The owner of the store, Anna Mayes, says if no action is taken to reduce crime in this community she will be forced to shut down her shop. Mayes has been the owner of Unique Fashion Mall for almost 30 years, and said she has never witnessed crime this egregious. \u201cSince the pandemic, since 2020, these things have gotten worse. I have never been attacked like this,\u201d she said. Mayes has had to deal with severe damage caused by these break ins, including broken windows, doors, and a smashed television. Video evidence of this destruction as well as security footage from the crime was shown by  ABC7  when they reported on the incident. Mayes' store having broken windows due to a burglary (Photo courtesy of Anna Mayes)  According to a police report from August, there was $2600 worth of goods stolen and $2000 of damage done to her store. In the most recent crime occurring in October, the two suspects were caught and arrested with bags of clothing that amounted to $10,000 in total, according to Mayes. She says that those who broke into her business were released from police custody, though she does not know who they are. The merchandise was later returned to her, but damage to her storefront will have a large impact on her business. Video surveillance footage of Mayes' store being broken into by a burglar (Photo courtesy of Anna Mayes)  An email from the public information office of the LAPD reads, \u201cOn October 14, 2023, there was a Burglary on 89th Street and Western Avenue that occurred at 12:44 a.m., and possible suspect was taken into custody.\u201d The surrounding area of Unique Fashion Mall has been experiencing an increase in crime and burglaries in recent months. According to the  CompStat crime statistics , 40 burglaries occurred in the Southwest area of Los Angeles just in the month of September. Compared to 2021, this year has seen just a 5% increase in burglary within the South L.A. area. Mayes discussed the importance of involving the government, including the mayor and city council, as this issue not only involves stores, but also cars, banks, housing, etc. Cheryl Williams works at the Al Wooten Jr. Youth Center, which is on the same street as Mayes\u2019s business. In a phone conversation, she said that crime in the neighborhood is neither increasing or decreasing. She also commended the city for clearing a homeless encampment on the street recently. Mayes said, \u201cthey [the homeless population] don\u2019t have a place to stay, don\u2019t have enough for basic necessities that they need to sustain themselves without... infringing on other people\u2019s livelihood and possessions, that they have to take care of themselves.\u201d In regards to making sure all people have access to essential needs and reducing crime, Mayes says, \u201cwe can if we work together, we really can.\u201d Currently, she is angry at the lack of attention and support that councilmen and the government are providing to this issue. Community Coalition, an advocacy and social justice  group  in South L.A, had no comment on the social determinants at play. As the issues surrounding crime continue to directly affect the store, Mayes is fighting to stay in business. She says, \u201cI want to stay in my community,\u201d but also recognizes the struggle she will continue to endure if the problems aren\u2019t addressed. After the damage to her window, Mayes had to put up plywood as a less expensive alternative to replacing the glass. In addition, stolen supplies and other broken items will need to be replaced. Editor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story stated that Community Coalition did not respond to Annenberg Media\u2019s request for comment. However, Community Coalition did respond and stated they had no statement to give on the situation. That sentence has been edited for clarity. \n```"}

Authorities did not rule out the possibility it was a hate crime and said Tuesday they are seeking more information from anyone who may have witnessed what happened.\n\nBoth protests occurred simultaneously at the intersection of Westlake Boulevard and Thousand Oaks Boulevard on Nov. 5. Around 3:20 p.m., the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s communication center received several calls stating that a battery had taken place at the protest location, according to the statement. Responding deputies and paramedics found Kessler with head injuries, which witnesses state were from when he fell backward onto the ground following a \u201cphysical altercation with counter-protester(s),\u201d according to the statement. Kessler was then taken to a local hospital to receive treatment.\n\nChristopher Young of the Ventura County Medical Examiner\u2019s office stated at a Ventura County press conference Tuesday morning that a CT scan conducted on Kessler following his arrival at the area hospital revealed a skull fracture, brain hemorrhaging and intracranial injuries consistent with a fall. Young also noted that Kessler had suffered non-lethal injuries to his face, but he said the autopsy conducted by the Ventura County Medical Examiner\u2019s office on Monday determined that Kessler\u2019s cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.\n\n\u201cThe injuries on the left side of Mr. Kessler\u2019s face were non-lethal and could be consistent with a blow to the face,\u201d Young said during the press conference. \u201cHowever, the lethal injury was the head trauma as a result of the fall.\u201d The press statement also mentioned that the Medical Examiner\u2019s office ruled the manner of death to be a homicide, which Young clarified was a medical term rather than any incriminating terminology during the press conference.\n\n\u201cThe manner of death of a homicide does not indicate that a crime has been committed,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt is simply stating that the death involved another person and does not hinge on who the aggressor is.

With 25 years experience in the field of employee wellness/health promotion, Julie has a passion for \u201cmaking the healthy choice the easy choice\u201d and creating cultures of health within organizations: \u201cThere are so many benefits to the employee and the employer \u2013 improved health, productivity, engagement, cost savings, recruitment and retention of talent, satisfaction ... I love seeing the impact of our work and how it can support not only the individual, but the community at large.\u201d\n\nJulie is the Associate Director of the Health & Well-being Program at the WorkWell Center, a hub located in the University Park Campus that focuses on ways to secure and enhance the wellbeing of USC employees. It was there that she launched the Healthy Campus initiative. The Healthy Campus initiative targets the three levels of culture: individual opportunities, interpersonal relations, and the physical environment. The subcommittees that make up the program tackle various dimensions of health, including mental and financial wellbeing, to empower USC staff and faculty ever since.\n\nWhile the programs rolled out by the WorkWell Center are designed for and by USC staff and faculty, it would be wrong to assume that they don\u2019t benefit other members of the USC family directly. Several materials and events are publicly accessible through the WorkWell Center\u2019s website, and students are welcome to join on many occasions. This potential to influence the university as a whole is one of the great aspects of Julie\u2019s work: \u201cI really enjoy working with partners across USC and looking at how and where we can infuse and embed well-being into our environment! It\u2019s a growing field and one that is much needed. And a lot of the work we do really looks at the entire campus systems ...

Echoing Julie, Lindsey points out the advantages of using EatWell resources as a student: \u201cThere\u2019s so much awful nutrition information out there in the world and on social media. On this page, everything is reputable, science-based. There\u2019s so much information that could be very beneficial for students, including also if they do have their own apartment kitchens. There\u2019s a YouTube cooking channel where actually all of these recipes are made by nutrition students. They\u2019re quick, easy, healthy. I think that\u2019s a really great resource, too.\u201d\n\nTwo new programs that support students, staff and faculty to Eat Well\n\n1. The EatWell Bites webinar series\n\nEatWell Bites is a 30-minute monthly online event hosted this Fall term. Each week has a new expert that comes in to discuss one aspect of nutrition and answer audience questions. According to Lindsey, the format reflects the ambition to tailor EatWell offerings around the needs of faculty and staff, including those who maintained a hybrid work schedule: \u201cWe also wanted to keep this at lunchtime and in a period of time that wasn\u2019t going to take up the entire lunch. So these are really only half an hour, and very interactive.

Following an upset win over Notre Dame on Saturday, Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney said, \u201cIf Clemson\u2019s a stock, you better buy all you freakin\u2019 can buy right now.\u201d That got me thinking: What do some of the head coaches\u2019 stocks look like right now, including Swinney\u2019s? Here\u2019s a list of some head coaching stocks to buy, sell or hold.\n\nJake Dickert, Washington State: Hold\nThis season has been quite the roller coaster for Washington State. Fresh off a 4-0 start and a win over then-No. 14 Oregon State, Dickert was putting together a season to remember for the Cougars. Then, all of a sudden, the brakes came off. WSU is on a five-game skid and will need to find a way to win two of its final three games against Cal, Colorado and Washington in order to make a bowl game. Still, given the mess Dickert inherited from the previous regime and how strong this season started, I\u2019m not willing to sell Dickert\u2019s stock just yet.\n\nEli Drinkwitz, Missouri: Buy\nWith just one season of head coaching experience, Drinkwitz was given the tall task of rebuilding the Missouri football program. Mizzou\u2019s gamble is working wonders in his fourth year at the post. Mizzou made a bowl game each of the last two seasons and now has a great chance to finish 9-3 in the regular season if the Tigers can knock off 5-4 Florida and 3-6 Arkansas. That would be Missouri\u2019s best finish since 2014.\n\nJedd Fisch, Arizona: Buy\nThe Wildcats have racked up three straight wins against AP Top 25 opponents \u2014 and it could\u2019ve been four if Arizona held on to beat USC in overtime \u2014 and find themselves in the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2017. Fisch has consistently improved the Wildcats in his three seasons as head coach, starting at 1-11 to 5-7 to now 6-3 \u2014 and if they had just won their two overtime games, Arizona would be in the College Football Playoff conversation right now. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a more impressive rebuild in all of college football right now.\n\nJimbo Fisher, Texas A&M: Sell\nFisher\u2019s tenure in College Station has been a complete dud. The Aggies haven\u2019t won a true road game in two years. They are 9-13 in conference play over the last three seasons. Fisher is 6-12 in his last 18 games against Power 5 opponents, tied for fourth worst among Power 5 head coaches. Through 67 games at A&M, Fisher had a worse record than his predecessor Kevin Sumlin. Need I say more?\n\nMarcus Freeman, Notre Dame: Hold\nAfter the Clemson loss, the general public seems to have lost faith in Freeman. Have those people forgotten that this program lost to Marshall last season? The Irish have already made great strides since Freeman\u2019s first few games in charge. Freeman is two easy wins away from having back-to-back nine-win seasons in his first two seasons as a head coach anywhere. Freeman needs to put together a 10-win season before I buy more stock, but I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll continue to improve as a head coach as time goes on.\n\nBrian Kelly, LSU: Hold\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase \u2014 LSU\u2019s defense is terrible. In the Tigers\u2019 three losses, their defense gave up an average of 47.3 points per game and the defense\u2019s season average of 28.2 points per game places 87th in FBS. LSU fans don\u2019t take losing well, so Kelly will need to fix the defense quickly or his tenure in Baton Rouge could easily spiral into disaster. Fortunately for Kelly, his offense is third in the country in scoring offense this season. Senior quarterback Jayden Daniels has been putting up numbers comparable to Joe Burrow\u2019s unbelievable 2019 season. The defense doesn\u2019t need to improve much in the offseason for LSU to reenter the national title conversation if that offense can continue to play at that level with a new quarterback in 2024.\n\nChip Kelly, UCLA: Sell\nAfter a deflating loss to Arizona, it\u2019s looking like same-old, same-old for UCLA. The Bruins have just one win over a team with a winning record this season.  Kelly is 6-28 against winning teams , per Bruin Report Online\u2019s David Woods. Barring disasters against 2-7 Arizona State and 3-6 Cal, UCLA will at worst be 8-4 at the end of the season, but that won\u2019t inspire many Bruin fans as the program heads to the Big Ten.\n\nBrent Key, Georgia Tech: Buy\nThe Yellow Jackets just need a win over Syracuse \u2014 which has lost five in a row \u2014 to make their first bowl game since 2018. Georgia Tech already has two upset victories over ranked opponents this season and has a chance to knock off Clemson if redshirt sophomore quarterback Haynes King plays as well as he did against North Carolina. Considering what Key inherited from his predecessor Geoff Collins, who went 14-32 in four seasons at GT, Key is already off to a great start in his first season at the helm.\n\nLincoln Riley, USC: Hold\nThe honeymoon period is over in the eyes of many USC fans. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about the program in the wake of defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s firing. Outside of the pandemic season, Riley\u2019s defenses at Oklahoma and USC have never been better than 60th in scoring defense. The success of his USC tenure could rest on nailing this coordinator hire.\n\nJonathan Smith, Oregon State: Buy\nIt\u2019s easy to criticize Jonathan Smith for the Beavers\u2019 two road losses this season \u2014 especially considering that Oregon State\u2019s two toughest tests are still ahead of them. Put this season in perspective, though, and what Smith is doing is incredible. This is Oregon State\u2019s best record through nine games since 2012 and this will be the first time since 2009 that the Beavers are going to a bowl game for three consecutive seasons. That this season looks like a let down from the Beavers\u2019 preseason expectations shows just how impressive Smith has been.\n\nDabo Swinney, Clemson: Sell\nClemson may have gotten a big win over Notre Dame over the weekend, but don\u2019t let that fool you. The Tigers are 5-4 and just 2-4 in ACC play. Clemson is still a team no one wants to face, but the program\u2019s prestige could quickly fade if Swinney doesn\u2019t change course to embrace the transfer portal and NIL. Only buy stock in Swinney if  Tyler from Spartanburg  calls into Swinney\u2019s weekly call-in show again.\n\nTroy Taylor, Stanford: Buy\nStanford is one of the toughest coaching jobs in the country. The university doesn\u2019t invest much in football, and it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get recruits and players from the transfer portal because of Stanford\u2019s high academic standards. David Shaw went 14-28 in his final four seasons before Taylor took over and Taylor isn\u2019t doing much better, currently sitting at 3-6. But with the way the team fought back to beat Colorado, nearly upset No. 5 Washington and took down Washington State, it\u2019s clear the Cardinal have more juice than the past few seasons. Look to see Taylor build Stanford into a respectable program over the next couple of years.\n\n\u201cShout\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

Nguannou was a -750 underdog going into this fight with analysts and fighters around combat sports believing he was outclassed before the fight bell even rang.\n\nThe fighters felt each other out during the first two rounds - Fury rattling off his trademark feints while Nguanno looked for comfort in the ring. Both landed several light blows but no serious damage. Fury must have believed that he would effortlessly defeat Nguannou, In preparation, Nguannon endured three months of training camp under the tutelage of former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.\n\nNguanno jolted the crowd when scoring a knockdown against Fury in the third round, countering with a big left hook off Fury\u2019s own to the temple. Fury\u2019s urgency picked up following the knockout, picking apart Ngannou with right jab and hook combinations. Ngannou looked to begin tiring by the seventh round whereas Fury continued finding success with the same one-two jab hook combination. Ngannou, however, displayed his ability to continue rolling with the punches.\n\nThe fight ended with Fury on a couple of cheeky punches in the tenth to get on the scorecard and escape with a victory. \u201cNo, that definitely wasn\u2019t in the script,\u201d Fury said in his post-fight interview. \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a fighter.

We can run it back again and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to get better. This was my first boxing match, I\u2019m not giving any excuse.

{"key": "/2023/11/07/pac-12-power-rankings-ucla-drops-out-of-the-top-half-arizona-and-utah-rise/", "response": "```\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. Just three weeks remain in the 2023 college football regular season, and it is becoming increasingly clear that the Pac-12 is a two-team race. Only Oregon and Washington have fewer than two conference losses, and both teams had very strong showings over the weekend. The middle of the pack in the conference continues to be up and down; Oregon State and Utah had big bounce-back wins while USC and UCLA once again failed big tests. Meanwhile, Arizona continues to win games, and there is a strong chance we see the Wildcats ranked on Tuesday night. With so few games remaining on the schedule, I punished the teams that have yet to have their signature win. Every single group has had at least one opportunity to take down a team I think highly of, and, if a team has not done that yet, it tells me that they are not a contender regardless of what their record says. With all that in mind, here are my rankings for Week 11.\n\n1. Oregon Ducks (8-1, 5-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nOregon continued to absolutely roll in a 63-19 drubbing of Cal on Saturday. The nation\u2019s top-scoring offense had nearly 600 total yards and averaged over seven yards per play at Autzen Stadium. What was remarkable about this game is that the Ducks got to 63 points in this game despite having one of its less clean offensive performances. Oregon had a lost fumble and an interception in the first half, and the team lost nearly 100 yards in penalties. Very few offenses in the country could put up a number like the Ducks did playing their cleanest football game. Washington may have had a more impressive win this weekend beating USC in Los Angeles, but Oregon has been a well-oiled machine that has barely had to sweat in the toughest conference in America. Despite having lost a game, Oregon is second in the NCAA in average scoring margin, defeating its opponents by an average of 31 points per game. That stat is even more impressive when you consider that Michigan, who ranks 53rd in the FBS in strength of schedule, is the only team ranked ahead of the Ducks, who have had the 11th toughest schedule in the nation.\n\n2. Washington Huskies (9-0, 6-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nAs flawed as I believe this Washington team is when held to the scrutiny of a National Championship contender, it is impossible to deny that it has risen up to every major challenge it has faced. One thing the Huskies were missing from their resume heading into the weekend was a ranked win on the road, but they got one in epic fashion on Saturday. If its performance against USC is sustainable, Washington may be a lot closer to becoming a team that can make noise in the Playoff than I had thought. In weeks past, a game where Ja\u2019Lynn Polk and Rome Odunze had a combined 134 receiving yards with just one touchdown would have been sure to doom the Huskies. However, Dillon Johnson finally broke through in the running game with a sensational 256-yard and four-touchdown performance. Yes, the Trojans have had trouble defending the run all season, but the difference in offensive approach is the true point of encouragement from Washington\u2019s perspective. Despite having favorable opportunities to run the ball in previous outings, the Huskies had stayed reliant on the deep shot to succeed. Johnson had the same number of rushing attempts in the USC game than he had in the previous two games combined. A more balanced offense will be critical for them to have a chance to unseat Oregon again in September.\n\n3. Oregon State Beavers (7-2, 4-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nOregon State picked up an important win on the road in Boulder in a week where it desperately needed to bounce back. The win was only by seven points, but the most positive sign in the last two weeks for Jonathan Smith is that the Beaver\u2019s defense is finally traveling. The unit allowed a combined 78 points in its first two Pac-12 contests away from Corvallis, but it has cut that number to 46 in the Beavers\u2019 two most recent road games. When Oregon State is at its best, its defense is winning up front, putting pressure on the quarterback and allowing DJ Uiagalelei to play with a lead. On Saturday night, Colorado\u2019s leading rusher was held to 17 yards, the Beavers sacked Shedeur Sanders four times and the Beavers never trailed. Uiagalelei is far from the top of the list of quarterbacks I would most want leading my team. He ranks ninth among 10 qualified Pac-12 quarterbacks in completion percentage. However, he has some really strong playmakers around him such as running back Damien Martinez and a defense that dramatically increases his margin for error. He will need to raise his game significantly if OSU is to knock off one of my top two teams to close out the season, but the rest of the team is solid enough to get the job done.\n\n4. Utah Utes (7-2, 4-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nLosing in Salt Lake City has been a rare occurrence for Utah over the past five years, so you do not want to be the team to play them the week after one of those losses occurs. The Utes showed no mercy to Arizona State on Saturday, dropping a 55-point offensive performance I genuinely did not believe they were capable of. Only Utah can put up 55 offensive points with as little flash as possible; it primarily relied on a physical run game that the Sun Devils could not even come close to stopping. Four rushers for the Utes, including quarterbacks Bryson Barnes and Nate Johnson, had at least 50 yards on the ground as they accumulated a whopping 352 rushing yards on 49 carries. The Utah defensive performance, in which they held ASU quarterback Jacob Conover to five \u2013 yes, five \u2013 completed passes on 22 attempts accounted for one of the largest yard differential I have ever seen. The Utes outgained Arizona State 513-83. This game reminded the country how few other teams in college football can impose their will on an opponent in the way we saw this weekend.\n\n5. Arizona Wildcats (6-3, 4-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nThe most disrespected team in the Pac-12 just pulled off another big win in its home building, as Arizona knocked off UCLA by three scores on Saturday night. The Wildcats\u2019 defense may rank in the bottom half in scoring in the conference, but it is hard not to be impressed with what the unit has done on a week-to-week basis. Arizona held Washington to 31 points, 10 below its season average, and is allowing just 13 points a game in its past three contests. The Wildcats held the Bruins to less than five yards per passing attempt and outgained them by 158 yards. Noah Fifita played another excellent football game, completing 25 of 32 passes for 300 yards and three touchdowns. In a conference filled with outstanding quarterback play, Fifita ranks second in completion percentage at 76%, only behind Bo Nix. The freshman has grown up in a hurry in his starting role, as Arizona continues to stack wins, and are now only behind Washington and Oregon in the loss column in the conference standings. With two of their final three games against Colorado and Arizona State, an 8-4 season is very much on the table for Jedd Fisch.\n\n6. USC Trojans (7-3, 5-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nDespite a maddening 52-42 loss to Washington that led to the long-awaited dismissal of defensive coordinator Alex Grinch, I elevated USC\u2019s position in the power rankings for the first time all season. Obviously, the Trojans\u2019 defense continues to be a disaster; a Washington offense near the bottom of the Pac-12 in rushing offense compiled over 300 ground yards on Saturday. However, I moved them up a spot because of my renewed confidence in what was always supposed to be the strength of this team: the offense. USC has put up high-scoring totals in previous weeks, but this was the first time since the Colorado game that I felt the offense truly looked in sync. Caleb Williams played one of his best games in a Trojan uniform, throwing for 312 yards and 3 touchdowns while slipping out of multiple near-sacks. It was the sort of quarterback performance that led NFL scouts to believe Williams would be the top pick in April in the first place. Austin Jones averaged 11 yards per carry in his first game as the lead running back in 2023, and USC got touchdowns from Raleek Brown and Darwin Barlow. I know how limited the Trojans are as a football team with a defense that is likely to finish as the worst in the history of the school. However, an offensive game like this finally made this team look closer to the one I expected to see before the season. Instead of being a really good offensive team with a horrible defense, at least they are an elite offensive team again. Any team with a unit that dominant should be in the top half of the conference in my eyes.\n\n7. UCLA Bruins (6-3, 3-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nUCLA may sit three games over .500, but we are still waiting to see Chip Kelly pull off a signature win. The Bruins\u2019 three Pac-12 wins are over teams that have a combined conference record of 4-15, and every time they have an opportunity to prove they can be a contender, their offense falls completely flat. This time, UCLA found the end zone just one time in Tucson in a loss that is likely to drop them out of the College Football Playoff Top 25. I thought the switch from Dante Moore to Ethan Garbers at quarterback had a chance to fix the Bruins\u2019 road woes, but Garbers struggled mightily on Saturday, only throwing for 143 yards and leaving the game in the fourth quarter due to injury. It has been a very backwards season for Kelly, once considered one of the best offensive minds in the sport. He has a top-three scoring defense in the conference, but his offense is only outscoring Utah, Arizona State and Stanford. UCLA will have three winnable games down the stretch, but its matchup in two weeks against USC will be its final chance to earn a win worth talking about.\n\n8. Colorado Buffaloes (4-5, 1-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nColorado certainly did not look great in a loss to Oregon State \u2014 it entered the fourth quarter with a grand total of five points. Shedeur Sanders continues to run for his life, and the Buffaloes cannot run the football. However, it is worth pointing out that Colorado\u2019s defense, which clearly seemed to be the liability early in the season, has made some strides in recent weeks. The Buffaloes allowed at least 35 points in five of their first seven games, but are only allowing 27 points per game in their last two matchups. The return of Travis Hunter \u2014 with a bye week before the UCLA game to help get him acclimated \u2014 has done the secondary a lot of good. They held the Beavers to a completion percentage below 50%. Hunter also continues to contribute on the offensive side, hauling in eight catches for 98 yards and a touchdown, all team highs. I still do not consider Colorado to be a bowl team this season; the offense has too many weaknesses and has not looked right in nearly a month. However, their defensive improvement shows the Buffaloes could be moving in a better direction as the season finishes out, which is a lot more than the team I had them jump can say.\n\n9. Washington State Cougars (4-5, 1-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nI am running out of ways to be shocked at how bad Washington State has played since conference play began. After a 4-0 start and a signature win over Oregon State that positioned them as a Pac-12 dark horse, the Cougars have dropped five straight games with their last two losses coming against some of the worst teams in the Power Five conferences, This week, Cam Ward and the WSU offense mustered up just one touchdown against the 3-6 Stanford Cardinal. Washington State gained just 57 yards in the entire second half with an offense that once looked like it could go toe to toe with some of the conference\u2019s best. The Cougars continue to be bad situationally, going 5-for-15 on 3rd down conversion attempts. Stanford\u2019s defense has allowed 34 points per game this year, and Washington State could not crack double digits. Despite this losing skid, the Cougars can still get into a bowl game with Colorado and Cal still on the schedule. However, if this team cannot play a complete game on both sides of the ball, I would not be remotely shocked to see either of those teams continue to pour it on them.\n\n10. Cal Golden Bears (3-6, 1-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nCal\u2019s era of good feelings after nearly upsetting USC was short-lived, as the Golden Bears allowed a season-high 63 points to Oregon in Eugene. Cal has played six conference games this season, and allowed at least 50 points in four of them. On Saturday, the defense allowed Bo Nix to throw for over 380 yards, the Ducks to run for another 150 and failed to record a single sack. In a Pac-12 with no shortage of suspect defenses, the Golden Bears have allowed the most points per game of any of them, giving up almost 37 per game. Fernando Mendoza was not special at quarterback, completing just 52% of his passes, and Jaydn Ott was not as special as he had been the week prior, failing to reach 100 rushing yards. If Ott does not have a massive day on the ground, the Cal offense is simply not going to have success. The good news for the Golden Bears is that they play Washington State and Stanford in the next couple of weeks. They have not had a loss yet this season to a team they should have beaten; these next two weeks will be a chance to keep it that way.\n\n11. Stanford Cardinal (3-6, 2-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 12\nGiven that it won the race against Arizona State for a second Pac-12 win, I moved Stanford out of the bottom spot in my rankings. The Cardinal have had plenty of embarrassing results, especially early in the season, but they have acquitted themselves well in three of their last four games. Holding Washington State to single digits is a feat worth being proud of, especially given offenses like USC, Washington and Oregon have had their way with the Stanford defense over the course of the season. Offensively, the Cardinal continue to be really inconsistent. In the last five games, they have gone back and forth between games where they score at least 30 points and games where they fail to find the end zone more than once. Strangely enough, they lost the game where they dropped 33 points on Washington but won the game where they barely squeaked out double-digits. Troy Taylor is an offensive head coach, so any signs of progress shown on that side of the ball would be welcome for Stanford fans.\n\n12. Arizona State Sun Devils (2-7, 1-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\nAs I\u2019ve written before, I find it utterly embarrassing when a team knows exactly what an offense is going to do to it going into a game and still cannot stop it. That\u2019s what happened on Saturday, when Arizona State allowed Utah, an offense that had not yet scored 35 points this season, to put up 55 against it. I highlighted the yardage disparity already when discussing the Utes, but suffice it to say that sort of differential puts a damper on all of the progress that Kenny Dillingham was supposedly making in his first season as head coach. It was one thing to take embarrassing losses early in the season, but getting blown out like that to Utah later on bothers me a lot more. This is the time in the year when every team should be playing its best football, and a blowout like this is a stark reminder of how far away the Sun Devils are.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy nikki thomas\nNovember 07, 2023 at 12:25 am PST\n\nDespite an unsteady start, USC men\u2019s basketball earned a decisive 82-69 win Monday over Kansas State in its Hall of Fame Series matchup at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis scored 24 points to lead the Trojans to their first victory of the season. The unranked Wildcats went 26-10 last season and advanced to the Elite Eight but were unable to defeat the No. 21 Trojans in their season opener.\n\n\u201cI think Kansas State is a very good basketball team,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said after the game. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for both teams to play in this environment.\u201d\n\nBoth teams looked shaky to start. USC shot 48% from the field in the first half and only 20% from 3-point range. But the Wildcats couldn\u2019t get their offense going against the struggling Trojans, shooting only 25% from the field and 19% from beyond the arc. Kansas State dominated the offensive glass with 16 first half offensive rebounds to USC\u2019s 3. A Trojan run put them up 40-30 at halftime.\n\nFreshman guard Isaiah Collier was an exception to USC\u2019s early poor shooting, notching 15 points in the first half. Collier was this year\u2019s consensus No. 1 recruit and was recently added to the Bob Cousy Award Watch List as one of the 20 strongest Division I point guards in the nation. USC got some major offensive help from team captain Ellis, who scored 13 before halftime. Ellis was added to the Jerry West Award Watch List last month. The award highlights elite shooting guards from across the country. He averaged 17.7 points per game last season.\n\n\u201cBoogie and Isaiah really controlled the tempo in the first half,\u201d Enfield said, \u201cbut we expect that of them.\u201d\n\nEllis and junior guard Kobe Johnson were key to the Trojans\u2019 second half success, when the cardinal and gold led by as many as 18 points. Johnson found his shot early in the second half and finished the game with 16 points, eight rebounds and four steals. Ellis led the team in points, adding eight rebounds and five assists.\n\n\u201cIt was a great first game to get in shape,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nUSC looked completely dominant in the second half until Collier fouled out with just under five minutes to go. Kansas State found life after Collier headed to the bench, igniting a 10-1 run and cutting the lead down to eight with 2:21 left in the game.\n\n\u201cI definitely made a lot of mistakes in this game as far as turnovers and fouls,\u201d Collier said. \u201cI just have to be smart down the stretch.\u201d\n\nThanks to buckets from Ellis, Johnson and redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan, USC held on for the 82-69 win. Collier shot 7-of-9 from the field with 18 points and 6 assists.

The duo had been together since 2019, when Grinch joined the Oklahoma staff as a defensive coordinator before following Riley to USC in 2021. \u201cI am disappointed it didn\u2019t work here,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep much, thought about it a little bit more Sunday and just felt like it was in the best interest of our program.\u201d\n\nThe team is coming off a tough home loss to the No. 5 Washington Huskies, where the USC defense gave up 572 total yards. USC has now lost three of its last four games against ranked opponents, including Notre Dame, Utah and Washington. In those three losses, the defense surrendered an average of 45 points and 435 total yards of offense.\n\n\u201cI knew it was the right decision at this point in time, but that certainly didn\u2019t make it easy,\u201d Riley said. Starting last year, Grinch faced lots of scrutiny from fans and analysts for the continued poor performances by the USC defense. Going into this year, the defense added two high-profile defensive lineman \u2013 Bear Alexander and Anthony Lucas \u2014 from the portal to help a run defense that conceded 159 yards per game on the ground in 2022. Yet, even with the new additions, the rush defense has somehow struggled even more this season, allowing opponents to run for an average of 187 yards per game.\n\n\u201cI know things defensively, through last year and through this season, have not been what either of us wanted,\u201d Riley said. Even with the lows of the defense, Riley was appreciative of Grinch\u2019s tenure at Oklahoma and USC. \u201cWe won a lot of games, a lot of championships and did a lot of great things together,\u201d Riley said.\n\nAs of right now, Riley has not made a decision past this year of who will be coaching the defense in 2024. Yet, Riley said he is determined to find the \u201cright person\u201d for the next defensive coordinator job. \u201cWe are all committed to playing great defense here,\u201d Riley said. \u201cOur goal here is to be an elite defense.\u201d\n\nThe team is moving forward with defensive line coach Shaun Nua and inside linebacker coach Brian Odom as interim co-defensive coordinators to finish the season. In addition, defensive analyst Taylor Mays has been elevated to an on-field assistant coach role. \u201cExcited for Coach Nua and Coach Odom for their opportunity,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThese situations keep challenging me, and I know I have to continue to get better ... to help put this program in the best position possible.\u201d\n\nEntering Week 11, USC now sits at 7-3 and is unranked for the first time in the Lincoln Riley era. While College Football Playoff and Pac-12 Championship hopes are fading, Riley\u2019s message to the team is \u201cbeing the best we can be to rally.\u201d USC will travel to Eugene, Oregon, for its final road game of the season to take on the No. 6 Oregon Ducks at 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Sarah Yoo)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nNovember 06, 2023 at 8:29 pm PST\n\nIt\u2019s been seven years since USC hoisted the College Cup trophy, and the road to ending the drought starts Friday. Following a disappointing, high-scoring regular season finale loss against then-No. 2 UCLA, the No. 8-seeded Trojans are geared up for their round one date with Grand Canyon at home. The two teams also met in the first round of the 2021 NCAA tournament, when the Trojans bested the Lopes 6-0.\n\nGCU has played very well as of late, and is undefeated in its last 10 matches. Grand Canyon heads into the tournament as recent Western Athletic Conference champions after a successful 14-4-4 season. Grand Canyon has been led by star senior forward Gianna Gourley. Gourley not only led the Lopes in goals this season with 21, but also the WAC altogether. Redshirt sophomore midfielder Leah Pirro helped contribute to Gourley\u2019s success, as she was also a leader in the WAC with 13 assists.\n\nFreshman forward Maribel Flores has been a catalyst for USC despite its recent skid, with three points in the Trojans\u2019 last three matches. Flores will hope to guide a USC offense that has slowed down since the beginning of the season but has still had consistent goal production. Also expect a big game from Trojans\u2019 junior forward Simone Jackson, who has scored four goals in USC\u2019s last eight matches, including one against the Bruins. Jackson leads the team in shots on goal and has been a force on the offensive frontlines.\n\nWith the exception of the UCLA game, the USC defense has been stout. Friday\u2019s game marked the first time the Trojans allowed more than one goal in a match since early September. Sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson and company will have to face a Grand Canyon offense that has been dominant as of late, though, with four goals in its recent win over Seattle University. The Lopes recently recorded eight goals, a season high, against Stephen F. Austin on Oct. 15.\n\nUSC must play aggressive defense, especially in its own box, to stop the Gourley-Pirro duo\u2019s unstoppable offensive prowess. While it is just the first round, and the Trojans are ranked within the bracket, they must not get complacent and repeat last year\u2019s result, when they fell to UC Irvine in a 2-0 shutout. A victory would put USC against either No. 1 BYU or Utah State in the second round. USC has advanced past the first round 13 times in its history and could increase that this year in its 22nd tournament appearance ever.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 NCAA tournament first round matchup with the Grand Canyon Antelopes will be on Friday at 3 p.m. at McAlister Field.\n```"}

Five-star recruit guard JuJu Watkins led USC with an impressive 32-point debut to kickoff her freshman campaign. \u201cThis is who she is. She\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cI have not seen a debut like this, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m as surprised.\u201d There were high expectations coming into this game for Watkins, as she was one of the most highly decorated high school basketball players in the country last year. Yet, the nerves of being a top recruit didn\u2019t seem to faze Watkins, who scored efficiently at all three levels. \u201cI\u2019m lost for words right now,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this whole team is like a bunch of ballers.\u201d Three Trojans finished in double digits. Junior center Rayah Marshall finished with 18 points and 17 boards, while graduate guard McKenzie Forbes \u2014 also in her USC debut\u2014 finished with 11 points and four rebounds. USC found itself down early to start the game, trailing all of the first quarter. The Trojans struggled to find any rhythm on offense with constant pressure from Ohio State\u2019s full-court 1-2-2 press, which resulted in four turnovers to begin the matchup. However, USC came out with a newfound energy to start the second quarter. Redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby scored five quick points to open the quarter, which gave USC its first lead of the game, 22-20. From there, the USC offense heated up, outscoring Ohio State 31-10 in the second quarter, which was orchestrated by the duo of guards Watkins and Marshall. Watkins was scoring at will, both getting to the rim and hitting mid-range shots. Marshall provided a spark on both sides, dominating the boards and disrupting Ohio State\u2019s offense with active hands to create two back-to-back steals. Marshall finished the first half with a double-double of 12 points and 10 rebounds. The duo combined for the same amount of points as Ohio State\u2019s whole team at the half (28). USC took a commanding 18-point lead into halftime, leading Ohio State 46-28. The second half didn\u2019t start USC\u2019s way, however. Watkins picked up two fouls that put her in foul trouble. Gottlieb made the decision to take Watkins off the floor to avoid a fifth foul. \u201cI was trying to manage the clock of when you put her back in,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIn the third quarter, we just were trying to figure out how to stop the bleeding.\u201d With Watkins off the court, USC was -14 in point differential. Ohio State took full advantage of her being off and rallied back from down 18 points. Back-to-back buckets in the final seconds of the third quarter from Ohio State graduate guard Jacy Sheldon gave OSU a two-point lead entering the fourth. Even with foul trouble for Watkins and graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis, Gottlieb elected to roll the dice and start both going into the fourth. The decision paid off, as USC took back control of the lead and didn\u2019t look back. USC had another huge fourth quarter, out-scoring Ohio State 27-16. \u201cI was really proud of our team,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI love the fight, the mentality of our team, top to bottom.\u201d The Trojans will be back in action on Friday for their home opener against Florida Gulf Coast at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.\n```"}

Grinch was fired after less than two years with USC. Now, defensive line coach Shaun Nua and linebackers coach Brian Odom are the co-defensive coordinators for the rest of the season. Defensive analyst Taylor Mays has also been promoted to an on-field role, according to ABC7 Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI just felt like it was in the best interest of our program, both for this year, because we have a lot to play for and we still have a really cool opportunity in front of us, and for the future that we needed to make the change. We weren\u2019t making the progress we were expecting that we\u2019d make,\u201d USC Head Coach Lincoln Riley said in a press conference Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI know things defensively through the end of last year and throughout the season, especially kind of mid-season on, have not been what either of us wanted, and that\u2019s obviously why we\u2019re here today,\u201d Riley continued.\n\nChanel Williams, a junior studying non-governmental organizations, said \u201cWe have a great offense, like it\u2019s amazing. We can have the best offense in the world, but if we have the worst defense, then it\u2019s not going to get us anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cA change was needed,\u201d said Andrew Ngo, a senior studying business administration. \u201cIt was just so crazy to keep doing the same thing over and over again and get the same result and that same result was not working for us.\u201d\n\nThe USC Barstool Instagram\u2014 a franchise account that focuses mainly on USC sports and culture\u2014 said that \u201cthe defense consistently fell short of expectations since Grinch\u2019s first game as defensive coordinator, and this season\u2019s performance was disappointingly subpar, deteriorating each week. Looking back, the players had become unreceptive to his coaching and a change should have been made after USC\u2019s breakdown against Tulane in the Cotton Bowl.\u201d\n\nBefore coaching at USC, Grinch was the defensive coordinator under Riley at Oklahoma. According to CBS News, Grinch led Oklahoma to a top-30 defense in 2020, but the team fell to 76th in 2021. Currently, USC has averaged 34.5 points per game and is \u201cthe bottom 30 in the country in nearly every defensive statistical category, including 120th in rushing defense and 107th against the pass,\u201d according to ESPN.\n\n\u201cI think right now, [firing Grinch] was the obvious choice to make,\u201d said John Bailey, a senior studying business administration. \u201cI think most of the discussion... through the rest of the season [will be] why it didn\u2019t happen earlier.\u201d\n\nCrash Collier, a junior in microeconomics, said \u201cIt was long overdue. Personally, I think it should\u2019ve happened after that triple overtime win over Arizona, maybe even the week before after Colorado almost came back and caught the Trojans... but better late than never, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that something will be fixed by the end of the season,\u201d said Julia Fung, a senior in international relations and global business and member of the Trojan Knights. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of disappointing that we put this much money and effort into a football team for it to have shortcomings in what this season turned out to be.\u201d\n\nUSC surrendered 101 points in the past two games, and currently, the team is ranked 87th in defensive efficiency. There are two more games left \u2014 Oregon and UCLA \u2014 but USC\u2019s chances of making the Pac-12 Championship Game are 8 to 1, according to Fox Sports.\n\n\u201cIf we were in a situation where we didn\u2019t have a whole lot to play for in terms of the conference championship, it might feel a little different,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut, we are still very laser-focused on these opportunities ahead.\u201d\n\nSome students were concerned as the Trojans approach their next two games against Oregon and their crosstown rivals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous about Oregon,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBut, I feel like our chances against UCLA are pretty good...I think it\u2019ll be a tight match but I think we\u2019ll come through in the end.\u201d\n\nThe Trojan Knights, a USC service and spirit organization, are already preparing to wrap Tommy Trojan in duct tape and bring out the Victory Bell for the USC-UCLA game, according to Fung, a member of the Trojan Knights\u2019 DEI committee.\n\n\u201cUCLA has had a really terrible season, like they haven\u2019t been able to find a strong quarterback, and they just lost to Arizona,\u201d said Fung. \u201cAnd that will be like two weeks out since firing Grinch, so I feel like that\u2019s a little bit more time to implement some well-needed changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth sides are going to be fired up, so I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Collier. \u201cI\u2019m nervous but at the same time, I\u2019m super excited, and I guess I also have confidence. I want to be able to flex on those Crosstown Bruins... Fight on!\u201d\n```"}

Course registration began October 23 on MyUSC. In preparation, some students used websites like Rate My Professor to get a preview of potential courses to take and what to expect with instructors in terms of rigor, grading and overall experience.\n\nFor some USC students, professors are the most important factor when considering courses. Pavan Magesh, a second year grad student in computer science, said it\u2019s crucial for students to \u201cdo [their] research on the professor. Sometimes the same course is offered by different professors, and you want to take the one who\u2019s better for you.\u201d Magesh, like many, refers to Rate My Professor to see students\u2019 previous experiences. However, he said many courses have no professor currently listed in the course selection page, which leaves him waiting to see the name of the professor before he actually registers.\n\nTaib Isa, a junior in pharmaceutical science, said that he consults Rate My Professor \u201cevery single time.\u201d \u201cIf their rating is below a four, I\u2019m not doing it,\u201d he remarked. Some students have also taken to Sidechat, a social media platform to anonymously post texts, images, polls or memes to share their concerns and struggles while registering. Some comments included: \u201cWhy are none of the GE classes opening up, WTF?\u201d \u201cNone of the classes I want are gonna open by the time I can sign up for them.\u201d One user uploaded a photo of the web registration page displaying a textbox that read, \u201cThe system is currently not available for class registration.\u201d\n\nStudents say these troubles extend to even major-required courses. \u201cSince I didn\u2019t transfer any AP credits, I was always put on the last registration day,\u201d said Isa. \u201cI never really got the courses that I wanted, and that sometimes became a hindrance, especially if they\u2019re major requirements. How can I have a major requirement and not be able to register for the class?\u201d\n\nEmily Rodriguez, a freshman studying mechanical engineering, said that her first time registering for courses went smoothly, but expressed concerns with Spring semester. \u201cI\u2019m a little worried now because I hear that it does bug out a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of people on there.\u201d\n\nDespite the frustration, students offered some tips that could make registration go more smoothly. Isa advised other students to download a Chrome extension that enables students to see which classes are full and get notified on whether or not a spot opens up. Additionally, the extension includes professor ratings and indicates any overlapping courses, which makes it easier to piece a schedule together. Anna Kasbayan, a junior studying biological sciences, recommended drafting multiple schedules in order to have \u201ca lot of different options in case classes get full.\u201d Freshman architecture major Jemima Chery said she agrees. \u201cMake sure to have everything scheduled way before your registration date,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if your registration date isn\u2019t coming up, look weeks in advance and check with your advisor to make sure that you\u2019re on track with courses.\u201d\n\nWhen Annenberg Media contacted the Office of the Registrar for a comment, a spokesperson, Frank Chang, declined an interview until November 16, the last date for Spring 2024 registration.\n```"}

The first title revolves around a night shift security guard, Mike Schmidt, that works at a pizza parlor called Freddy Fazbear\u2019s pizza. Schmidt monitors the four animatronic mascots, Freddy Fazbear, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny, and Funtime Foxy, that roam around via security cameras, and must avoid their detection. If he does not stay hidden until 6 .a.m., he is brutally stuffed into a spare animatronic suit.\n\nThe film took most of its inspiration from the first game title and was a box office hit, setting a new record for best opening weekend for the horror movie production company, Blumhouse. Despite negative reception from critics, the film is sitting at an audience score of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and received a lot of love from fans on the Internet.\n\nUSC students voiced their thoughts on the film and why it, and the rest of the franchise, became so popular. Freshmen John Flores and Erika Martinez attributed the success of the film to the FNaF fanbase largely consisting of younger kids.\n\nJohn Flores: I know my own nephews and nieces and siblings that are younger than me love that stuff. But, also I would say because it\u2019s a big meme too, like FNAF and not just like the games are old, definitely, but people deny them because it means like you see them all over, they they pop up over and over and over again in the Internet\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nErika Martinez: Most of the people watching the movie have been fans since, like, they were small, like, really small like since the game came out. And I feel like that kind of kept people in, especially since like people have been waiting for the movie.\n\nWe also spoke to middle school and high school students in the greater Los Angeles area, who had largely positive things to say about the movie. They described it as a \u201cgory, fun time\u201d with \u201cinteresting practical effects\u201d and \u201cfun jumpscares\u201d. Junior Gray Vasquez, a long time fan of the franchise, attributed the film\u2019s success to the franchise\u2019s position as an iconic part of the Internet.\n\nGray Vasquez: I feel like in its own really weird way. Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s is kind of a cultural icon and a lot of people grew up just at least knowing about it or like watching videos on YouTube about like the lure behind it because it\u2019s very convoluted and very in-depth for no good reason. people are showing out in swarms for this movie because to them it means a lot, which I think is really funny because it\u2019s five nights at Freddy\u2019s.\n\nNot all audience reception was glowing. Senior Corey Lee stated that he was very mixed on the movie overall.\n\nCorey Lee: I thought the script was kind of basic and clich\u00e9, and it was marketed as a horror movie, but it wasn\u2019t particularly scary. And I\u2019m a very scared person. I watched a lot of horror movies. I get scared super easily, but with this one, not as much.\n\nAlthough traditional horror film fans are not as enthralled with the movie, the large box office numbers are indicative of both a dedicated fanbase and satisfaction amongst the FNaF community.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Aditya Thiyag.\n```"}

Experts advise Californians on how to deal with allergy season.\n\nUSC Engemann Student Health Center. (Photo by Sareen Habeshian)\n\nBy Emilia Garza, Jinny Kim and Roman Marchetti\nNovember 06, 2023 at 5:05 pm PST\n\nThe Santa Ana winds \u2014 infamous for their health effects on Southern California residents \u2014 are heralding the start of allergy season. These seasonal dry winds occur when air from the Southwestern desert region of the United States flows westward through the mountain passages of Southern California, according to the National Weather Service. The Santa Ana winds increase risk of wildfires \u2014 and allergies.\n\n\u201cOne of the dangers when it comes to Santa Ana winds is that they carry all the particulate matter that we see associated with fires,\u201d Dr. Abisola Olulade told NBC San Diego. The winds also carry pollen and other dry particles that can worsen nasal allergies, triggering chronic drainage and congestion, according to Scripps Health. These allergy symptoms also leave people more vulnerable to developing sinus infections.\n\nOne quarter of adults experience seasonal allergies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. USC students are no exception. Maeve Humphrey, a senior studying biological sciences, said her allergies flare up during this time period.\n\n\u201cI have a super bad sore throat, stuffy nose, coughing and sneezing,\u201d Humphrey said. To remedy her ailments, Humphrey said she uses a ten milligram loratadine \u2014 an over-the-counter allergy medicine taken orally \u2014 as well as nasal spray every morning.\n\nHumphrey isn\u2019t the only student experiencing these symptoms. Alyssa Wood, a freshman studying psychology, said her \u201ceyes get really messed up\u201d due to the Santa Ana winds. Wood said she also has to use allergy medicine to combat her symptoms.\n\nThough allergy season is already underway, Keck Medicine of USC recommends taking medicine before you start to experience symptoms for the best results.\n\n\u201cMany treatments for seasonal allergies are safe and accessible without a prescription,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Hur, a rhinology specialist at Keck Medicine of USC, said in a Keck blog post. Hur mentioned over-the-counter medicine including antihistamine pills, steroid nasal sprays and sinus irrigations.\n\nKeck Medicine also recommended preventative measures for keeping out pollen, which Dr. Armin Bhasin, an allergy and immunology specialist from Mayo Clinic, corroborated.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to control your exposures,\u201d Bhasin said in a video posted in the Mayo Clinic News Network. \u201cIf it\u2019s a dry and windy day, the pollen is blowing. You want to run the air conditioning because, that way, you\u2019re recirculating the clean air.\u201d\n\nWhile over-the-counter medicine can help with allergy symptoms, Bhasin said contacting an allergist may be necessary if symptoms persist.\n\n\u201cThe best time to engage an allergist is really when you\u2019ve tried all the environmental control measures that you can, and you\u2019ve tried over-the-counter medications, but you\u2019re still symptomatic,\u201d Bhasin said.\n\nWith this expert advice in mind, USC students can protect themselves from the allergy season induced by the Santa Ana winds. Students can also contact USC Student Health through the MySHR portal or by calling (213) 740-9355 (WELL).\n```"}

Bass, alongside project funders, praised the 62-unit building, located on Kenmore Ave in East Hollywood, as a successfully expedited development in the initiative to create over 7,000 affordable homes in the city. The push is the result of Bass\u2019 2022 campaign promise to house 15,000 people by the end of year one. She described Los Angeles seniors as \u201cthe fastest growing sector of the unhoused population.\u201d At least 45 residents have already moved in, and the remaining tenants will enter the building in the following weeks according to Rebecca Louie, president of the project\u2019s developer Wakeland Housing. Having won the Southern California Association of Non-Profit Housing (SCANPH) Senior Housing Project of the Year award in 2023, each unit is equipped with a bathroom, kitchen, storage space and one bed. \u201cI think when people understand that our elders are the ones that are unhoused, it\u2019s going to make people more open to accepting housing in their neighborhoods. Especially when they see a beautiful facility like this,\u201d Bass said during Monday\u2019s speech. Karen Bass speaks at the grand-opening of the Wilcox affordable housing project in East Hollywood. According to Bass, development for affordable housing is often a lengthy process. This brought her to sign Executive Directive 1, calling on multiple city departments to expedite and prioritize the process. \u201cIt\u2019s urgency that is needed. Approval processes that used to take six months are now taking 47 days... When we expedite projects, we save lives and we save money at the same time,\u201d Bass said. Louie expressed her appreciation for the Bass administration\u2019s haste in creating more housing. \u201cShe\u2019s taking it seriously,\u201d Louie said. \u201cI\u2019m super appreciative of her \u2018get it done\u2019 attitude.\u201d For Louie, providing affordable housing opportunities will be a priceless benefit to the livelihood of LA seniors. \u201c40% of the seniors in the United States live purely just on Social Security income... Stop and think for a moment what it would be like to be living here on 1800 dollars a month,\u201d Louie said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find work when your address is a sidewalk, we know that homes are the answer.\u201d City council member Hugo Soto-Martinez, who represents District 13 where the new East Hollywood building is located, said he\u2019s satisfied with the city\u2019s work. \u201cI hope we celebrate what is today. We\u2019re going to light a candle to this issue because our work is rooted in love, it\u2019s rooted in community and really trying to make a positive change in society.\u201d \n```"}

Photo by Olivia Dansky.\n\nBy Liv Dansky November 06, 2023 at 2:23 pm PST\n\nThe land is nestled between the water and the mountains. It\u2019s dotted with rice fields, blanketed with grassy plains, crisscrossed with rivers, and overgrown with the flowers and plants that we, the calm caffeinators, prize above all else. This place of growth and abundance is Fujian. A province in the southeast of China, it\u2019s home to some of the most prized varieties of bold black, subtle white, floral jasmine, and earthy oolong teas. It\u2019s also where the Los Angeles-based company Teawaves got its start.\n\nJoey Zhou, co-owner of Teawaves, grew up among these gardens. For him, tea, family, and community are inextricably linked. \u201cTea is a way of life in Fujian. I\u2019ve been having tea with my parents every night after dinner since I was a young child,\u201d Zhou says. He turned his passion for tea into a business when he met kindred spirit Michael Graney at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School in 2020. Graney, originally from West Virginia, fell in love with tea and its culture when he lived in China on and off between 2012 and 2019. \u201cI wanted to bring the best part back [to the United States]. I sort of caught on that this is something they do a lot better than we do, and I wondered if we could introduce more people to it in a way that makes sense to them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two men bonded and formed a business plan, and the rest, as they say, is history. The diverse ecology of Fujian makes it one of the most interesting tea-growing regions in the world. Through his family connections, Zhou established partnerships with tea farmers and producers based in the Wuyi Mountains, the Anxi prefecture in Quanzhou, the coastal city of Fuding, the hills of Fuzhou, and across the border in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. \u201cThe farmers we partner with want to work with people they trust and people they feel can give their products a meaningful home,\u201d Graney said.\n\nTheir main goal in starting Teawaves is to make tea culture more inclusive. Graney and Zhou tell their customers that they don\u2019t need to purchase fancy tools or participate in elaborate ceremonies to partake; all that is required is a little patience and an appreciation for subtlety. While the duo operates a wholesale business online, most of their energy is devoted to connecting with the Los Angeles community directly through rented booths at Westside farmers markets. From Wednesday through Sunday, the Teawaves team can be found handing out samples of cold-brewed White Grape Oolong Tea, Hibiscus-Rose Tisane, and Tie Guan Yin (Lady of Mercy), among other flavors, to sweaty shoppers desperate for something cool and refreshing.\n\nJoey Zhou at the Brentwood farmers market. Photo by Olivia Dansky.\n\nFor Zhou and Graney, these farmers markets offer invaluable contact with their consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to get live feedback and interact with customers,\u201d said Graney. They\u2019ve also found that it\u2019s a great way to introduce Angelenos to flavors that aren\u2019t as easily found in the United States like their Peaked Brow White Tea, Osmanthus Oolong Tea, Golden Bud Black Tea, and Dragon Well Green Tea. \u201cOur hope is that our products facilitate meaningful connections and conversations,\u201d said Graney. \u201cWe want to share calm in this crazy world,\u201d said Zhou.\n\nFor information about where to find them and for updates on hosted events at local businesses, Teawaves posts updates to their Instagram account.\n```"}

The 17 goals include ending hunger and food insecurity while promoting nutrition and sustainable agriculture, ensuring equitable access to clean and affordable energy and promoting sustainable usage of natural resources to preserve animal life. This list of actions the U.N. says must be taken simultaneously to end \u201cpoverty and other deprivations,\u201d tackle climate change and foster equity. The website allows students to filter courses by a specific SDG or find a course that \u201cmaps\u201d SDGs. If a course\u2019s content features more than one SDG by entering the course ID, the hope is that students can choose courses that align with their sustainability interests. The program was launched late this  spring , but this fall is the first time many students will be able to use it during the course registration period. Students can focus their studies on \u201cparticular sustainability goals, and faculty can identify ways to incorporate sustainability into their classes,\u201d according to the  Sustainability Course Finder website . Each USC course was examined by a team of faculty and student researchers, including USC students Brian Tinsley and Alison Chen and environmental studies lecturer Dr. Julie Hopper, to see if the topics covered included SDGs by matching terms in course descriptions to over 4,250 keywords, according to the Sustainability Course Finder\u2019s  website . \u201cThis was never just a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 builder\u2014 it\u2019s about raising sustainability awareness in higher education,\u201d Tinsley told  USC News  back in May. The project was inspired by Peter Wu, a student at Carnegie Mellon who wrote similar code for the courses at his school. According to the program\u2019s  website , 61% of USC courses are SDG-related, with 3.1% of USC courses being specifically sustainability-focused. The data includes all courses except for directed research, master\u2019s thesis and doctoral dissertation courses. Additionally, the website shows the percentage of courses in each individual school that were related to the SDGs; The Leventhal School of Accounting is the only school whose courses are all SDG-related. \u201cI\u2019ve always found it tricky to pick out courses relating to sustainability when not all of them begin with the \u2018ENST\u2019 prefix,\u201d junior environmental studies major Emma Rohrer said. \u201cThe filter lets me explore a ton of courses that are relevant to my interests, without having to go through all of [Web Registration] to find them. The keywords are really helpful to get into the specifics of each class \u2014 there\u2019s so much more out there than I thought.\u201d While the course finder will help climate-focused students with selecting their classes, other students say they do not consider sustainability during registration. \u201cI don\u2019t care about [sustainability in the classroom] enough for it to affect what classes I take,\u201d junior health and human sciences major Jentrie Gordy said. The website emphasizes that the team behind the project encourages feedback from students and professors to improve accuracy. Students who wish to determine if their upcoming courses discuss the SDGs or want to tailor their schedule accordingly can access the website  here  and follow the relevant prompts.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/11/06/petition-calls-for-university-statement-on-death-of-former-usc-gynecologist-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/", "response": "```\nA former USC employee authored a petition demanding that the university comment on the disgraced gynecologist\u2019s pre-trial death and provide resources to victims coping with a lack of resolution.\n\nThe petition, created by former employee Zachary Ellison, demands that USC release a statement on the death of USC gynecologist George Tyndall before he could stand trial for alleged sexual abuse.\n\nBy Aidan Williams, Veronica Garza, Laurie Carrillo, and Marco Alvarez\nNovember 06, 2023 at 12:57 pm PST\n\nFormer USC employee Zachary Ellison recently authored a petition demanding USC release a statement on the death of USC gynecologist George Tyndall before he could stand trial for alleged sexual abuse. Ellison graduated with a Master\u2019s in public administration from USC in 2015 and was hired shortly after as the Executive Secretary of Academic Operations for the Office of the Provost until August of 2022. Ellison said he was let go after filing a complaint that USC had failed to make necessary institutional changes after the Tyndall scandal to protect students, staff, and faculty from sexual harassment on campus.\n\n\u201cI worked in the Provost office for seven years, and then they fired me after I filed my complaint and it gained publicity,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cI came back after filing my report to see seven emails stating I was in non-compliance with my employee contract, it was shocking.\u201d\n\nThe former staffer created the petition on October 17 titled \u201cDemand Justice for the Victims of George Tyndall and Change at USC,\u201d and advocated for USC to release an official statement regarding Tyndall\u2019s death. Tyndall, USC\u2019s only full-time gynecologist from 1989 to 2016, was found dead in his home on October 4, an LAPD report said. Tyndall resigned in 2016 after he was reported to the rape crisis center by a nurse and was set to stand trial early next year for the alleged sexual assault of 16 former patients over the course of seven years.\n\nUSC has yet to release a statement on Tyndall\u2019s death and his failure to stand trial, an act that Ellison says has, \u201cdelayed the communities\u2019 healing and mental health restoration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing stopping [USC] from issuing some type of statement about this and offering counseling services to people in the community and victims who want to talk about this and the lack of resolution,\u201d said Ellison.\n\nIn a statement to Annenberg Media, a representative for USC wrote, \u201cThe university has engaged in institutional change at the system and structural level, which we believe exceeds the expectations and requirements of the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights Resolution agreement.\u201d\n\nEllison, who now works as an independent journalist, hopes through his petition, which had 90 signatures as of November 6, that he can pressure USC into finally releasing a statement on Tyndall\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for USC to see that the community still cares about this,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cWe already have a fair amount of signatures so I am sure USC administration is now thinking maybe they should consider releasing a statement.\u201d\n\nThe petition also calls for USC to release a long-awaited investigative report looking at how Tyndall was allowed to continue practicing gynecology at USC, even after multiple sexual harassment complaints had been filed against him by patients. Former Chairman of the Board of Trustees Rick Caruso promised to release a report on the findings of the investigation shortly after Tyndall was dismissed in 2016, but never delivered on the promise.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like [USC] wasn\u2019t aware of George Tyndall and his misconduct, they simply didn\u2019t accept the gravity of what they were being told by victims,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cWe need to know how USC screwed it up so badly and what they are going to do going into the future to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, Ellison realizes that even if USC does comply with his and signees\u2019 demands, it will never make up for the lack of resolution and healing for victims that Tyndall\u2019s pre-trial death brought about.\n\n\u201cI think that for a lot of victims, him going to trial and going to jail was a lot more important than the money they got from USC,\u201d said Ellison, referencing the $1.1 billion payout by USC to former patients of Tyndall who were allegedly sexually abused. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that victims never got to see the day when Tyndall would pay for his misconduct.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Amr Nabil)\n\nBy Maddy Myer November 06, 2023 at 12:45 pm PST\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer. WWE returned to Saudi Arabia to host Crown Jewel on Saturday, producing some of the best matchups the pay-per-view has seen to date. Veterans like John Cena and Rey Mysterio passed the torch to the next generation with their matches, and consistent performers like Seth Rollins and Cody Rhodes kept up their momentum. For the women\u2019s side, Kairi Sane made her return to WWE during Iyo Sky and Bianca Belair\u2019s match. It will be great to see how she\u2019ll shake up the women\u2019s division in the coming weeks, but for now, here are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week, this time all stemming from Crown Jewel.\n\nLogan Paul vs. Rey Mysterio (WWE Crown Jewel, November 4)\n\nThis match started with Logan Paul absolutely dominating Rey Mysterio. Mysterio is known for his high-flying moves, but Paul kept him grounded for a good chunk of the match, while also doing some high-flying moves of his own. There were times Mysterio would try some offense, but with the size difference, Paul would easily catch him and deliver a move on his own, even bench-pressing Mysterio at one point. The tide finally shifted in Mysterio\u2019s favor after Paul hit his shoulder into the ring post, and Mysterio followed it up with an outside dive. After the dive, Mysterio kept the momentum up with a senton bomb and springboard crossbody back in the ring, but it wasn\u2019t enough to put Paul away. In the end, Paul received outside help with the likes of brass knuckles that he used to \u201cknock out\u201d Mysterio for the three count to become the new United States Champion.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only legend to lose at Crown Jewel, as Solo Sikoa absolutely dominated John Cena in their matchup.\n\nBianca Belair vs. Iyo Sky (WWE Crown Jewel, November 4)\n\nEarly on, Iyo Sky had a game plan for defeating the returning Bianca Belair. Sky targeted Belair\u2019s knee, which prevented some of Belair\u2019s power moves from connecting. Sky mostly relied on submission holds that could further target that knee. Eventually, the pace picked up as Belair stopped letting her knee bother her, and the match went outside the ring. Sky hit Belair with a moonsault from the top rope that knocked her down, but she recovered quickly, slamming Sky into the barricade. Sky rolled back into the ring, faking an injury of her own only for Bayley (Sky\u2019s Damage CTRL partner) to interfere with Belair. Belair took care of Bayley and was ready to return to the ring, until a returning Sane showed up and attacked Belair. Since the referee was distracted with Sky\u2019s \u201cinjury,\u201d none of this was seen, and by the time Belair returned to the ring, Sky hit Belair with a moonsault to win the match and retain her championship.\n\nSeth Rollins vs. Drew McIntyre (WWE Crown Jewel, November 4)\n\nMcIntyre had something to prove against Rollins, and he did just that throughout the match, often taunting Rollins and targeting his fragile back. Still, it was an impressive showing from Rollins, who only ran out of steam momentarily before showing McIntyre why he is the champion. Rollins tried to hit McIntyre with an outside dive early on in the match, which only resulted in McIntyre catching him for a belly-to-belly suplex on the floor. This was the start of the back torture Rollins would take throughout the match. Still, Rollins was able not to let that phase him much and had enough juice to deliver a senton and moonsault back-to-back on McIntyre once back in the ring. When it was time for Rollins to do one of his signature falcon arrow suplexes, however, McIntyre countered it with a suplex of his own. A few moments later, Rollins countered a McIntyre attack into a pedigree. Both men were countering left and right and even kicked out of each other\u2019s finishers. In the end, Rollins delivered not only the pedigree but also his main finisher, the stomp, to beat McIntyre.\n\nSoon after Rollins won, Damian Priest marched down with his money in the bank contract in hopes of cashing in on Rollins to win the Championship.

USC\u2019s roster features a slew of returning veterans and the No. 3 freshman recruiting class.\n\nBoogie Ellis and the Trojans head into this season with high expectations, looking to avoid losing in the first round of the NCAA Tournament for the third straight year. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)\n\nBy Dylan Luden November 06, 2023 at 11:55 am PST\n\nComing into the season ranked No. 21 in the nation, the buzz around USC men\u2019s basketball has never been louder. The incoming freshman class is loaded with the No. 1 recruit in the country in guard Isaiah Collier and four-star guard Bronny James. The returnees feature the Trojans\u2019 leading scorer from last year, fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis, and a preseason Pac-12 Second Team member, junior guard Kobe Johnson. Add in Washington State transfer graduate forward D.J. Rodman, and it\u2019s hard not to see why Trojan fans are hyped to watch their squad play at the Galen Center.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly one of the best rosters that USC basketball has put together under head coach Andy Enfield, and one that could compare to USC\u2019s 2021 team that reached the Elite Eight. \u201cThis year\u2019s team is different, because our best offensive players are our guards and forwards,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cOn that team we had Evan and Isaiah Mobley and Chevez Goodwin. We were big in size but had a perimeter game as well. This team is a little different, but overall, equally as talented.\u201d\n\nThe key to success this year for USC will be the relationship between Collier and Ellis, with some national media outlets like Bleacher Report suggesting that they may be the best backcourt in college basketball. Ellis, who averaged 17.7 points per game last season, was named to the preseason Pac-12 First Team with Collier. The two have been forming a bond on and off the court, and it\u2019s shown so far during the Trojans\u2019 preseason trip to Greece and Croatia, and the rest of their scrimmages.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been connecting since day one in May,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWe work out every day together and push each other every day. We also have to show that we are the best backcourt in the country, we can\u2019t just talk about it no more.\u201d\n\nCollier showed out during the Trojans\u2019 scrimmage against UNLV back on Oct. 21, dropping 23 points, along with nine rebounds, six assists and four steals. He was also perfect on all four shots from 3-point range.\n\nBesides the two guards, the Trojans\u2019 roster features plenty of depth in both guards and bigs. Johnson and Rodman likely will start alongside redshirt senior Joshua Morgan in the frontcourt to round out USC\u2019s starting lineup to begin the season. Johnson took a big leap in all facets of his game last season, including being a defensive stalwart for the Trojans. Look for him to be more involved in the offense after shooting 47% from the field and 38% from 3-point range last season.\n\nRodman will bring tons of experience and leadership with him after averaging 9.6 points per game and 5.8 rebounds per game in 2022-23. Enfield mentioned at practice Friday that he saw great improvement in a lot of returning players, such as junior forward Harrison Hornery, sophomore forward Kijani Wright, sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers and sophomore forward Vincent Iwuchukwu.\n\nIwuchukwu may be the one to break out the most out of the group of returnees. He missed USC\u2019s first 16 games last season due to a cardiac arrest he suffered in July 2022, but averaged 5.4 points and 2.5 rebounds in 14 games. He\u2019s currently questionable to play Monday due to a back injury, but when he\u2019s fully healthy, he can be USC\u2019s big weapon off the bench.\n\nEnfield also expects contributions from his other freshmen, forwards Brandon Gardner and Arrinten Page. USC had issues guarding bigger players last year, but with much added length and strength, defense should be a key area for the Trojans this season.\n\nUSC is currently projected to finish second in the Pac-12 behind No. 12 Arizona and is one spot ahead of rival UCLA. Even though the Trojans aren\u2019t the favorites, they certainly have the chance of crashing the party in their last year in the Pac-12.\n\n\u201cYou can try to project all you want, but when the lights turn on, you have to know what to do,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cYou can\u2019t think about March Madness right now before you\u2019ve played your first game, because you have a lot to prove.\u201d\n\nUSC opens its season on Monday against Kansas State, an Elite Eight team from last year. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. in Las Vegas for the 2023 Hall of Fame Series.\n```"}

Although Arizona State\u2019s quick offense posed a challenge for USC, the Trojans proved themselves defensively and swept the Sun Devils 3-0 (25-23, 25-23, 25-16).\n\nThroughout the first two sets, the Trojans and the Sun Devils were neck and neck. The constant back-and-forth made it seem as though the match belonged to either team, but efficient communication, a sense of togetherness and overall high energy is what put USC ahead.\n\n\u201cI felt the energy. I thought we were going to win after the first serve,\u201d USC head coach Brad Keller said.\n\nFor senior outside hitter Skylar Fields, the second set of the match was monumental. With her second kill of the set, the outside hitter reached 2,000 career kills, an achievement that she attributes to her teammates, coaches and all who make up the USC women\u2019s volleyball community.\n\n\u201cBeing in an environment where people are constantly wanting to help me grow as a player has really helped me evolve,\u201d Fields said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool that I get all the kills, but I couldn\u2019t do it without my teammates passing me the ball and setting. So, I\u2019m glad I get to have this accomplishment, but I want to thank my teammates for that.\u201d\n\nIn her final season as a Trojan, Fields has proven to be a true offensive weapon for USC. Her athleticism and accuracy have allowed her to average about five kills per set. This has been critical in recent wins against Arizona and Utah, when she had a combined 43 kills. Today\u2019s match was no exception, as she scored 24 of the team\u2019s total 48 kills, making her the leading scorer.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a special player, a great kid, and she\u2019s a true leader,\u201d Keller said.\n\nThe third set is when the Trojan defense really came to play. With the help of freshman outside hitter London Wijay and junior setter Mia Tuaniga \u2014 who led the Trojans in digs \u2014 USC held Arizona State to just 16 points, securing the win.\n\n\u201cI think one of our main goals this week was ... being ready to react. We\u2019ve worked a lot on defense, and it\u2019s been proven throughout the week, so I\u2019m really pleased with how our team has been doing with defense for sure,\u201d said Fields.\n\nKeller also expressed that he was satisfied with his team\u2019s performance as a whole, following the match.\n\n\u201cThey were positive. They were relentless. They were resilient. This is probably the proudest I\u2019ve been of this team this year,\u201d Keller said.\n\nSunday\u2019s win at the Galen Center is further proof that home court advantage is important to the Trojan\u2019s success. The triumph over Arizona State pushes USC to a 10-0 home record that the team looks to maintain during its final home matches against California, Stanford and UCLA later this month.\n\nIn the meantime, USC women\u2019s volleyball must carry its high energy on the road, where it will face tough matches against Washington on Friday, Nov. 10 at 7 p.m. and Washington State on Sunday, Nov. 12 at 12 p.m.\n```"}

Now, after adding top recruit JuJu Watkins and some Ivy League veterans, USC has the potential to go even further.\n\nNow a veteran for the Trojans, junior forward Rayah Marshall can further establish herself as one of the best shot-blockers in the nation. (Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Will Simonds November 05, 2023 at 3:17 pm PST\n\nA year ago, the narrative heading into the 2022-23 USC women\u2019s basketball season was one of turbulence, transition and unknowns. Head coach Lindsay Gottlieb had just given birth to her second child and had missed much of the team\u2019s preseason. Gottlieb had added seven players from the transfer portal after losing her whole starting lineup from the prior season. And the program\u2019s top recruit, guard Aaliyah Gayles, had a long road ahead in her recovery from being shot several times at a house party in Las Vegas that May.\n\nNow, the vibe has certainly shifted. There\u2019s a new sense of confidence, stability and momentum around the program \u2014 three characteristics the Trojans\u2019 haven\u2019t enjoyed in years.\n\nLet\u2019s start with momentum. Last season, Gottlieb guided USC to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2014. Though the Trojans\u2019 run ended quickly in a heartbreaking overtime loss to South Dakota State in the first round, it was an important step in this program\u2019s quest to rebuild towards its glory days in the \u201880s. It also came somewhat ahead of schedule, as USC was picked to finish just ninth in its conference in preseason coaches and media polls \u2014 the Trojans went on to finish tied for fourth.\n\nNow, Gottlieb and her squad are ready to take another step. \u201cI think this group comes in with already higher goals. We have a ton of respect for how hard it was to do what we did last year,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cNow, that lays the foundation for the bar to be raised. This team isn\u2019t going to be satisfied just to make the tournament. We want to win games.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s team laid the groundwork on the defensive end of the floor. The Trojans were a dominant defensive squad, allowing just 55.1 points per game, which led the Pac-12 and was a top-15 mark in the country. Led by assistant coach Beth Burns\u2019 hard-nosed defensive system, the group took a lot of pride in mucking games up and allowing few easy shots anywhere on the floor.\n\nGraduate guard Kaitlyn Davis, an offseason transfer from Columbia, perhaps explains the mentality of last year\u2019s team as well as anyone. \u201cIt was a tough team \u2014 full of dogs,\u201d she said, meaning that as the highest of compliments. \u201cHard workers, people that are willing to get the job done, and just underdogs. They came in with an underdog mentality, and that\u2019s something I really wanted to build on top of.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where stability comes in, as USC\u2019s returning corps are some of its strongest defenders, which should uphold this team\u2019s floor in the upcoming season. Two players come to mind: junior forward Rayah Marshall and senior guard Kayla Williams. The scrappy Williams started all 31 games for the Trojans and led the team with 48 steals while pestering opposing point guards for approximately 25 minutes each night. Meanwhile, the 6-foot-4 Marshall is establishing herself as a premier two-way player, after a season in which she averaged a double-double.\n\nDespite finishing second in the nation in blocks per game (3.5), Marshall still has room to grow, even on the defensive end. During Pac-12 Media Day, she emphasized her offseason improvement in keeping blocks in play to force live-ball turnovers and transition opportunities.\n\nBehind Marshall, USC will need some growth from 6-foot-6 backup junior center Clarice Akunwafo to maintain its high defensive ambitions. Her offensive game still has a ways to go, but Akunwafo showed flashes of being a legitimate presence around the rim last season. With several other talented centers in the conference, Akunwafo is ready for the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy in on what coaches teach me every single day,\u201d Akunwafo said. \u201cMy goal is to do everything I can for the team: rebound, talk and have energy.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, look out for another versatile returning defender, redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby. After seven starts last year and some encouraging performances, Bigby will compete for minutes at wing alongside some incoming transfers \u2014 more on them in a bit.\n\nPerhaps the most relieving example of stability within the program comes in the form of Gayles\u2019 progress over the last 18 months. Gayles, the No. 8 overall recruit in the 2022 class according to ESPN, has \u2014 miraculously \u2014 been cleared to play. She still isn\u2019t 100%, but frankly, USC will be happy with whatever production they get from her, and her first minutes this season will be incredible to watch. Gayles clearly still has a massive effect on her team off the floor anyways; countless teammates, coaches and staff members have raved about the joy and positivity she brings day after day.\n\nWhich takes us to that last tenet mentioned earlier: confidence (and just overall good vibes). What else might give a team confidence? Bringing in the consensus No. 1 overall recruit in the country certainly doesn\u2019t hurt. USC\u2019s high floor as a result of its tenacious defense has already been established, but freshman guard JuJu Watkins can dramatically raise the ceiling of this program.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 offensive shortcomings last season forced them to drag opponents into the mud. They slowed games down to a halt and tried to win games in the 50s \u2014 or even 40s. It largely worked, as evident in wins such as their 55-46 slugfest upset of No. 2 Stanford in January. But it often wasn\u2019t particularly fun to watch.\n\nNow, Watkins\u2019 dynamic playmaking potential should allow USC to change its identity on the offensive end. The Trojans lacked much of a shooting threat from midrange last season, where Watkins should be able to fill in right away. Additionally, the skilled passer can open up more space in the paint for Marshall, who could be more efficient as an interior scorer.\n\nWhat might be the most noticeable change to USC\u2019s play style, though, will be a result of Watkins\u2019 abilities as a ball handler. \u201cI think our identity will be a little bit faster and better spaced on offense,\u201d Gottlieb said, a contrast to the Trojans\u2019 rather leisurely pace seen previously. And don\u2019t worry, Watkins fits the Trojans\u2019 established defensive intensity as well. \u201cI\u2019m astonished at how much she\u2019s improved on the defensive end from the start of practice,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason [Watkins] can\u2019t be the best two-way player in the country.\u201d\n\nOther offseason additions will contribute to this new offensive approach as well. Davis, for example, one of four graduate transfers brought in by Gottlieb, is used to playing at a fast pace from her time at Columbia. Her Lions squad averaged 73.6 possessions per 40 minutes last season, compared to the Trojans at 67.4. \u201cFor me, it hasn\u2019t been too much of an adjustment; more so, it\u2019s just me finding where I fit in this new system,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe other transfers and even the kids who have been here have done a good job adjusting to that. ... I like to run fast, I like to get out and push it.\u201d\n\nDavis can do a little bit of everything, as evidenced by her triple-double this past January against Dartmouth in which she recorded 19 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists and four steals. At 6-foot-2, she will be called on to support Marshall on the boards while still pushing the tempo and spacing the floor.\n\nA former Brown player herself, Gottlieb brought in two more grad transfers from the Ivy League that will boost the Trojans\u2019 outside scoring. Guard Kayla Padilla set several program records at Penn for 3-point shooting, including her 210 career threes in three seasons with the Quakers. Mackenzie Forbes is another dangerous threat out on the wing; she shot over 40% from three last season while at Harvard.\n\nEven though all three are making the jump from the Ivy League to the Pac-12 \u2014 arguably the best conference in the nation \u2014 Gottlieb is confident that Davis, Padilla and Forbes will fit in and produce immediately. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily have to be the go-to player at all times, because there\u2019s other good players around them,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think it\u2019s been fun for them to figure out what\u2019s needed from them on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nBehind Watkins, freshman point guard Malia Samuels, a four-star recruit, will serve as another distributor for the Trojans\u2019 shooters off the bench. Redshirt sophomore guard Dominique Onu, who sat out in 2022-23 after transferring mid-season from UCLA, will be another intriguing addition to the Trojans\u2019 lineup as a former top-30 recruit in 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fun, we\u2019re all learning, we\u2019re all growing as a team together,\u201d Akunwafo said. \u201cEach day we\u2019re getting better and better.\u201d\n\nUSC debuted at No. 21 in the preseason AP Top 25 poll, alongside five other Pac-12 squads. The Trojans will open their season Monday at 11 a.m. in Las Vegas against No. 7 Ohio State.\n```"}

Grinch, who has been tied to Riley dating back to his tenure at Oklahoma, has been criticized by fans and analysts since his time with the Sooners. As of week 10 this season, Grinch had the USC defense ranked 119th in the nation out of 130 eligible teams in total defense before his firing.\n\nThe announcement comes after the USC defense gave up more than 500 total yards and 27 first downs to No. 5 Washington, including 256 rushing yards and four touchdowns to Washington junior running back Dillon Johnson.

The Trojans offense came out swinging. After electing to receive the opening kick off, the Trojans capitalized on a 12-play drive with a two-yard rushing touchdown by sophomore running back Raleek Brown, taking the lead 7-0 with 8:56 left in the first quarter. This was Brown\u2019s first touchdown of the season, after many believed he would redshirt this season, filling in for absent junior running back Marshawn Lloyd.\n\nThe Huskies fired back like lightning, however, as senior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. marched his squad down the field in a hurry. Junior receiver Rome Odunze then took a wide receiver screen 15 yards into Trojan territory. Minutes later, junior running back Dillon Johnson waltzed into the endzone untouched, to then tie the game at 7 apiece.\n\nThis game featured a whole lot of back and forth, as there were only three punts during the game. Late in the second quarter, the Huskies tied the game 28-28 with just over a minute left to play. Just when it seemed this game was never going to have another stop, Washington came up huge as it forced a fumble on the Trojans 12-yard line. Two plays later, Dillon Johnson punched in his third rushing touchdown of the night to give the Huskies their first lead, 35-28, with 20 seconds left in the half.\n\nThe end of the half turned from bad to worse for the Trojans as junior quarterback Caleb Williams was sacked on the final play of regulation. Washington\u2019s offense showed to be too much for the Trojan defense in the second half. Despite a third-quarter interception, the USC defense allowed 17 second-half points.\n\n\u201cSome of our worst ball was on some of the biggest plays of the game,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cA couple other key third-down plays where we had chances to get off the field that we didn\u2019t, and did not make enough plays to get enough stops to win the game.\u201d\n\nLate in the second quarter, the Trojans had a chance to make a huge play on third down, but a missed sack led to a Patrick Mahomes-esque play by Penix Jr., where he found senior tight end Devin Culp in the corner of the endzone.\n\nThe USC defense allowed nearly 600 yards of total offense, including 245 rush yards and four touchdowns by Johnson.\n\n\u201cYou guys noticed when guys were there to make the plays and when guys weren\u2019t,\u201d junior linebacker Mason Cobb said. \u201cThe biggest thing for me was explosive runs; guys weren\u2019t ready to make the play.\u201d\n\nThe defense faces arguably the best rush offense in the Pac-12 on Saturday, Nov. 11 in No. 6 Oregon. Junior safety Calen Bullock said he believed the defense needs to get back to work in preparation for the Ducks.\n\n\u201cWe need to do our job,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWe need to put our head down and keep doing the same stuff; we\u2019ve been preaching it in practice, it just needs to be the same stuff,\u201d Cobb said.\n\nWith a trip to Autzen Stadium, one of the most hostile playing environments in the country, on tap for next week, Riley said he believes his team still has a fight in it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting like crazy to play as good as we can and not get wrapped up in the big picture stuff; there\u2019s too much left to play for,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to prepare hard \u2014 all of us \u2014 and obviously get past this one and move on to a big opportunity next week.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans drop to 7-3 on the year, losing three out of their last four games. While hope for a Pac-12 championship is not gone yet, the Trojans will have to win out the remainder of their schedule, as well as have some of the top teams lose if they want a chance to take home the conference title in the last season before the conference disbands.\n```"}

This collaboration ran for a week starting on October 23rd and is a collaboration between the Korean Culture Center of Los Angeles and the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance.\n\nDuring the week, Aiki and Odd taught classes to Kaufman students, Aiki spoke about her experience at a speaker event, and the pair led a dance workshop open to the general USC community. Aiki began as a competitive Latin ballroom dancer and first entered the global dance scene at World Of Dance in 2019 as part of the duo All Ready with Yang Salang. Here, they combined Latin dance with hip hop.\n\nHer first experience in the K-pop world was when she created the choreography for the supergroup REFUND SISTERS in 2020. However, she gained most of her fame when she appeared on Street Woman Fighter in 2021, a South Korean show that showcased eight female dance crews, where she competed with HOOK.\n\nSince then, Aiki\u2019s most notable choreography is her work with Bibi on her song \u201cVengeance.\u201d This piece became an internet sensation with K-pop idols, dancers, and even fans around the world doing the dance challenge.\n\nWhen planning the weeklong events at USC, Professor Hye Jin Lee from USC Annenberg was one of the primary organizers with experience, having previously worked on last year\u2019s KCCLA x USC K-pop Festa. \u201cKCCLA\u2019s K-pop Academy, which they do every year, they introduce K-pop dance and K-pop singing to K-pop fans,\u201d said Lee. \u201cBut they have never introduced K-pop dance to dance professionals.\u201d\n\nShe had been looking at the curriculums at other USC schools and noticed how Kaufman focused on exposing their students to a wide variety of dance genres. When deciding who to bring to Kaufman, Professor Lee stated that she \u201cwanted KCCLA to know that if we are introducing K-pop dance to Kaufman students, I want the best instructors... We need to bring the best because we are teaching the best dance students in the world \u2013 and somehow we got lucky and [KCCLA] got connected to Aiki\u2019s management company.\u201d\n\nThe weeklong visit from Aiki included classes for Kaufman students as well as speaker events and an open workshop for all students. During the Kaufman exclusive events, Aiki and Odd taught dances to students including the \u201cVengeance\u201d choreography during the Monday class. Lee described her experience watching the workshop saying, \u201cA lot of them, I think, are aware of K-pop but I doubt a lot of them realize that there\u2019s a place for them to be engaged [in K-pop]... To see them really getting into it was really a joyful experience to watch and witness.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cConversation with Aiki\u201d speaker event gave insight into her journey as an artist. When preparing for this event, Professor Lee described how there were many pieces to keep in mind. The audience members were a mixture of dancers and non-dancers, Koreans and non-Koreans, longtime Aiki fans and casual enthusiasts.\n\nOne of the choices Professor Lee made was to showcase clips of Aiki\u2019s work from World of Dance and Street Woman Fighter. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to just talk about what Aiki did, maybe the best way to do it is to show what she has done,\u201d Professor Lee said.\n\nThrough a translator, Aiki explained that as a choreographer, it is important that she stays true to her and HOOK\u2019s character by \u201cshowing the color of HOOK\u201d through every piece. Her dances feature comedy and display not only her vision but also the ideas of members in her crew. They showcase her style as a leader as well when choosing to use a HOOK member\u2019s choreography over her own for the finale of Street Woman Fighter.\n\nThis piece was about motherhood rather than the hard-hitting choreography viewers and judges anticipated for the finale. She reveals, \u201cUp to that point in the competition, it was my choice in the dance direction... If I was not a mother myself, I would not have done this piece but I understood the message of it... I knew we weren\u2019t going to win but wanted to have this performance.\u201d\n\nAiki is one of the few well-known professional South Korean dancers that is married and a mother. But even with balancing a personal life, Aiki was able to grow greatly in the dance community, especially after Street Woman Fighter that drew people of all skill levels to her workshops in Korea.\n\nNow, she sees herself as a teacher and also has interests in expanding into the world of musical performances. The final event of the week was the \u201cOpen Workshop with Aiki and Odd\u201d hosted at the Kaufman Courtyard. The event drew a wide variety of people ranging from Kaufman students to non-majors involved in dance organizations at USC like Chaotic 3, NSQK, and Spade A Dance, to even those with no experience whatsoever.\n\nAt the workshop, Aiki and Odd taught the popular K-pop dances to JEON SOMI\u2019s \u201cFast Forward,\u201d New Jean\u2019s \u201cSuper Shy,\u201d and PSY\u2019s \u201cThat That.\u201d For Super Shy, Aiki and Odd also taught their own version of the choreography dubbed \u201cNot Shy.\u201d This version was essentially a more masculine, hip hop version of the original dance and all the participants laughed when Aiki explained that she wanted to teach the \u201cNot Shy\u201d version.\n\nFollowing those three dances, they did a \u201cRandom Play Dance,\u201d where a few random K-pop songs were played. Everyone stood in a semi circle, and people who knew the dance to the songs that came on were invited to come out and dance with Aiki and Odd.\n\nOne of the songs they played was \u201cSmoke,\u201d popularized by the new season of Street Woman Fighter and choreographed by Bada from the crew Bebe. As the pair taught the choreography, Aiki also interacted with the audience. She walked through the crowd and asked people questions such as \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite K-pop girl group?\u201d\n\nOne of the people who answered her questions was Blake Levins, a Kaufman minor and who is also in the USC dance team Chaotic 3. He shocked Aiki with his Korean proficiency. He had previously seen Aiki during a trip to South Korea and explained, \u201cI first like saw [Aiki] and her crew HOOK on [Street Woman Fighter], and I was just very intrigued by the amount of like personality, energy, and creativity that they put into their art and how much it seeks to connect with the audience. I really admire that about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think as a dancer myself, I really appreciate having opportunities where choreographers are brought from overseas or from just different kinds of areas or different focuses than what USC specializes in because it gives so much opportunity to grow and gain new perspectives. And I\u2019m sure people in Kaufman can elaborate on this more, but what I\u2019ve heard from them is like she was such a fun person to learn from,\u201d said Blake. \u201c[The Aiki events are] something that I really appreciate USC for doing as a dancer.\u201d\n\nAiki and Odd take individual photos with attendees at the end of the workshop.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/04/the-cookbook-recipes-to-nfl-week-9/", "response": "```\nThe NFL is a very strange place. The Denver Broncos, a team that gave up a near-record 70 points to the Miami Dolphins earlier this season, held Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs to nine total points. In the wake of Halloween, the Broncos feel right out of a Twilight Zone episode with how uncertain almost every week is for them. Despite Mahomes\u2019 greatness, the last two games in which he has not thrown a touchdown pass have both been against Denver. This week\u2019s Michelin Star Player of the Week is Will Levis. It must have been his iconic combination of mayo in the coffee and unpeeled bananas as a pre-game meal that had Levis balling in his NFL debut. The second-round pick completely took over the Titans-Falcons game, throwing for four touchdowns and 238 yards. Levis connected with all-pro receiver Deandre Hopkins for three of his four touchdowns. In just one game as a starter, Levis has already doubled Ryan Tannehill\u2019s passing touchdowns this year. I think the choice is clear: give Levis the keys the rest of the way.\n\nI can finally say I have had my first perfect three-course meal of the year. The Vikings handled business against rival Green Bay Packers but at the loss of starting quarterback Kirk Cousins. In a back-and-forth game, Geno Smith showed up when needed and delivered a game-winning drive to push the Seahawks to first place in the NFC West. But probably the biggest pick of the week was the Bengals going into Levi Stadium and putting it all together behind an elite performance from Joe Burrow. All three victories combined for the first-ever perfect three-course meal from the Cookbook.\n\nThe waiter has arrived, what\u2019s first on the menu?\n\nFirst Course | Miami Dolphins (6-2) vs. Kansas CIty Chiefs (6-2), 6:30 a.m PT, NFL Network Live aus Deutschland. It only took traveling 4,825 miles to Germany for the Cheetah to finally line it up against his former team. Hill has not missed a beat since joining the Dolphins in the 2021 offseason. Just last week, he became the fourth player in NFL history to reach 1,000 yards in the first eight games of the season. While the Chiefs certainly miss the cheetah-like speed that Tyreek Hill brought to the offense, they still have found themselves as the NFL\u2019s top offense in the last two years. Someone on the Chiefs is going to have to step up outside of Travis Kelce. In both losses for the Chiefs this season, he has either played badly or not touched the field. In a heavyweight matchup of this caliber, Mahomes is going to need a lot more than just Kelce carrying the load. As much of a star as Kelce is, he will be a focal point for the Dolphins defense, forcing Mahomes to look elsewhere. The Kansas City offense almost was non-existent last week versus the Broncos, recording a season-low 275 total yards of offense. It\u2019s clear the Chiefs are going to need to make a call to get Taylor Swift to Germany. The Dolphins\u2019 secondary is not as strong as in prior years, attacking that earlier can be a strong determinant in winning this game. In Tua\u2019s two biggest games of the season so far \u2014 against the Bills and Eagles \u2014 he has come up short. The Bills and Eagles defenses posed big problems for the Dolphins offense, sacking Tua a combined seven times. Every other game this season, Tua has only been sacked a total of four times. There is no doubt there are playmakers like Tyreek Hill, Jalen Waddle, and Raheem Mostert on the team, but keeping Tua upright for most of the game will help to develop any sort of passing game.\n\nFries \u2014 Tyreek Hill, Dolphins Receiver \u2014  As the Chiefs were, the Dolphins have become just as reliant on Tyreek Hill. His speed causes any defense to shake in their boots when he lines up on offense. I think many fans leaving the stadium after this game will be ordering themselves a No. 10 jersey.\n\nDessert \u2014 FINS UP.  I am riding with the Dolphins in this one. The firepower on the Dolphins offense will prove to be too much for a defense that just let the Broncos have their way all game last week.\n\nSecond Course | Dallas Cowboys (5-2) vs. Philadelphia Eagles (7-1), 1:25 p.m PT, FOX The Cowboys and Eagles are easily my favorite rivalry in the NFL. It\u2019s difficult not to love not only the two most hated teams but also fan bases in the league all in one location. In recent years, this matchup has been dominated by the Dallas Cowboys who have won four of the last five matchups. Dallas\u2019s strong performance against the Los Angeles Rams last week finally saw the Cowboys utilize Ceedee Lamb to his full potential. I said it on the show a  few weeks ago , the Cowboys will succeed if they get the ball to their playmakers. This is a trend that must continue Sunday if they want to come out victorious. On the other hand, the Eagles have been playing very complementary football, ranking top 10 in both rushing and passing offense. Deandre Swift and Jalen Hurts\u2019 run game has allowed for a more efficient pass attack for the Eagles. But what makes this team truly scary early on is their staple play the \u201cTush Push.\u201d The Eagles don\u2019t even have to hide it at this point because of how successful it has become. As of October 18th, the tush push has a 93.3% success rate according to The Athletic. In a game potentially decided by inches, the Tush Push will certainly be called quite a few times. For the Cowboys, it\u2019s about not overthinking things. The Cowboys put up a 33-point first half versus the Rams. The Eagles defense is better than that of the Rams, however, feeding Ceedee Lamb and Brandon Cooks are factors head coach Mike McCarthy can control. During his tenure, it\u2019s too often we see this offense get conservative in big games. In a huge divisional game that has playoff-seeding implications going forward, being conservative will find this team in the same spot they were three weeks ago versus the 49ers.\n\nMac and Cheese - A.J. Brown, Eagles Receiver -  Jalen Hurts and AJ Brown have been a match made in heaven since his arrival last season. In his time repping an Eagles uniform, he has 2,435 yards and 16 touchdowns, averaging 97.4 yards per game. The Cowboys\u2019 secondary will have their handful with Brown, along with DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert.\n\nDessert - HOW BOUT THEM BOYS.  Dak Prescott\u2019s 8-3 record versus the Eagles speaks for itself. I\u2019m trusting the Cowboys offense to continue the streak of getting the ball to Ceedee Lamb and other playmakers. Lamb has gone over 100 yards in each of his last two outings. Like last year\u2019s matchup in Dallas, I expect this to be another classic game added to a historic series.\n\nThird Course | Buffalo Bills (5-3) vs. Cincinnati Bengals (4-3), 5:20 p.m PT, NBC If I told you about this game a few weeks ago, you might\u2019ve asked why this game wasn\u2019t flexed out of Sunday Night. The Bengals, however, over the last month have brought their season back including a huge win on the road versus the 49ers last week. Joe Burrow looked like his vintage self last week, making big-time throws and minimizing turnovers. The Bengals will need that same Burrow if they want to win this game. Considering Buffalo\u2019s 5-3 record to start the season, Sunday Night is their first real test against a contender. It\u2019s been a strange year for the Bills, dropping games to teams like the Patriots and Jets. Some of the blame falls on quarterback Josh Allen, who already has eight interceptions on the season. His play has been very indicative of what the Bills season has been: sky-high performances and bottom-of-the-ocean lows. The number one job for Allen in this game should be protecting the ball. In a game that will certainly be back and forth, establishing a running game with James Cook and new-edition Leonard Fournette is key. The Bills have had minimal success with their run game this year with only one 100-yard game from Cook. Having it as an option on Sunday night can help to keep Burrow on the sideline.\n\nGarlic Bread - Trey Hendrickson, Bengals Defensive End -  If you want to talk about the definition of consistency, then Trey Hendrickson is your guy. Through eight games, Hendrickson has already matched last year\u2019s sack total with eight on the year. And how can you not love his \u201870s football style of no gloves and the occasionally taped fingers.\n\nDessert - WHO DEY.  I am riding with the Bengals in this one because of their recent successes. The Bills have been streaky and Allen\u2019s turnover problems will be food for a hungry Bengals defense that\u2019s created eight turnovers in the past three games.\n\nRecipe of the week In honor of an NFL game being played in Germany this week, we\u2019re going international with this gameday recipe. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t give you a German pint to try, but I can give you a good side to pair with a cold one.

(Photo by Omoye Ehimare).\n\nBy Ellie Moore November 04, 2023 at 3:40 pm PDT\n\nComing off a loss to Colorado and a win over Utah last weekend, the USC women\u2019s volleyball team was both ready to be back at home and prepared for a potentially challenging matchup on Friday. Arizona, though ranked last in the Pac-12, is known to be a physical team. That was proven on Friday night at the Galen Center: Arizona fought back, and though the Trojans won 3-0 (16-25, 18-25, 20-25), they were tested defensively.\n\nThe first and second sets were a constant back-and-forth, with both teams racking up points through kills and offensive errors. In the first set alone, junior setter Mia Tuaniga had two aces and 10 assists. Yet, somehow, Arizona was able to match their intensity. For a moment, it seemed like it could have been anyone\u2019s game. But as expected, USC bounced back and pushed even harder. In the second half of both sets, USC upped its game and stopped Arizona\u2019s rhythm.\n\nThough still lacking a perfectly polished defense, the Trojans were able to defend their now 9-0 record at home through pure grit and determination. \u201cThe attention to detail, the urgency, the push for every single point and the grind that I expect the group to do \u2014 they\u2019ve done it all week in practice. I expect them to do it on Sunday, and I was very, very encouraged with the level that we played at. I thought we made a lot of really cool plays,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said.\n\nSenior outside hitter Skylar Fields had herself a great game, notching 24 of the team\u2019s 40 kills and hitting .512. Fields is approaching 2,000 career kills, an incredible milestone for such a hardworking player. \u201cOur team goal for going into this game was like heavy communication,\u201d Fields said after the game. And for the next one? \u201cI think we\u2019re definitely gonna keep focusing on our side of the net. We know that ASU plays one of the fastest offenses in the Pac, so just really being good on defense and being disciplined.\u201d\n\nTwo additional contributors to the Trojans\u2019 success were freshman outside hitter London Wijay and sophomore libero Megan Verbiest. Wijay has proven herself to be a vital member of this team, with six kills to her name for the night and a fearlessness that shows itself every time she steps on the court. Verbiest radiated confidence, coming on for the first time in the second set to score her first of two aces.\n\nIn between the second and third sets, in honor of Homecoming Weekend, the 1980 and 1981 USC women\u2019s volleyball national champions were honored. These alumni were in Galen to watch the present and future of the program to which they brought so much prestige.\n\nThe third set was rougher, with Arizona coming back to exploit obvious holes in USC\u2019s defense. It took time, and certainly some motivational words, but the Trojans were able take their 12-7 deficit and turn it around. What is most important looking forward is how they will strengthen their defense to keep future opponents from capitalizing off of gaps and mistakes.\n\nKeller emphasized how hard the team has been working on their defense over the past three weeks. \u201cOn defense, you get to actually set up something and try to do something or create the pattern you want,\u201d Keller said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve just spent so much time over there and been vulnerable about what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not and just hammering those situations over and over again.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have had a tough season, grappling with the loss of players and injuries sidelining players for the entire year. One of the players they lost? Sophomore outside hitter Jordan Wilson, who spent her first year at USC before transferring to Arizona. In her first match back at Galen, Wilson proved to be a difficult opponent, always ready to go for the kill or make a block.\n\nBut Keller had nothing but compliments for his team and their ability to bounce back from what has been quite a difficult season. \u201cI think they\u2019re resilient and I love that about them. They don\u2019t give up, they don\u2019t quit and at the end of the day... they always show up.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans play again at the Galen Center on Sunday at 2 p.m., this time against No. 15 Arizona State. Expect a tense match. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a war,\u201d Keller said.\n```"}

(AP/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nBy Felipe Londo\u00f1o\nNovember 04, 2023 at 2:52 pm PDT\n\nAround a year ago, Tyson Bagent was preparing to face East Stroudsburg College as the quarterback of Division II Shepherd University. This week, he gets ready to face the New Orleans Saints as the starting quarterback of the Chicago Bears. From receiving negligible attention from FCS or FBS programs out of high school to becoming one of the best players in Division II history and securing a spot on the Bears\u2019 53-man roster for this season, Bagent\u2019s journey truly resembles that of a Hollywood movie. Let\u2019s dive into his story \u2013 how he got here, and what the future could hold for one of the NFL\u2019s most intriguing newcomers.\n\nBagent was born and raised in Martinsburg, West Virginia, a small town on the Northeast corner of the state about an hour and a half drive from Washington, D.C. He grew up no stranger to competition and sporting success; his father, Travis Bagent, is a 28-time arm wrestling champion and considered one of the greatest athletes in the history of the sport. Travis introduced Tyson to football at an early age and was committed to his son playing quarterback. So much, in fact, that he coached Travis\u2019 youth football teams up to high school and \u201cmade sure to throw the ball at a high rate,\u201d as he told The Athletic in December. It paid off, with Tyson earning the starting job at Martinsburg High School as a sophomore and never looking back. He finished his career with over 7,800 yards passing and 112 touchdowns, while earning the West Virginia Gatorade Player of the Year award his senior year.\n\nDespite his success, he was recruited by no Division I programs outside of Albany and Robert Morris, leading him to commit to Division II school Shepherd University, his parents\u2019 alma mater. Some may view Bagent\u2019s decision to turn down Division I programs for Shepherd as questionable, yet his decision paid off quickly, as he earned the starting quarterback job as a true freshman and shone immediately, receiving first-team all-MEC honors for the 2018 season. He continued this dominance throughout his next four years (2020 was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), finishing his collegiate career with over 17,000 pass yards and an all-division NCAA record 159 touchdowns on 68.9 percent completion while breaking almost every quarterback record in Shepherd History.\n\nTo this day, Bagent attributes his success to experience. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve played a million games at quarterback... I was able to win the job at high school in my sophomore year and then started every game through my senior year at college, so that\u2019s seven years of understanding what the week of preparation looks like,\u201d Bagent told Sky Sports in an interview in October. Throughout his scorching of the Division II landscape, Bagent earned a myriad of individual accolades like first-team DII All-American and PSAC offensive player of the year selections in 2021 and 2022 and the Harlon Hill Trophy in 2021 (Division II\u2019s Heisman). Truly, it\u2019s not hyperbole to say that Bagent hung up his Shepherd jersey as one of the greatest Division II football players of all time.\n\nIt was this unprecedented dominance that led Bagent to receive an invite to the premier collegiate showcase game, the Senior Bowl, after the 2022 season, something almost unheard of for a Division II quarterback. Yet despite the week being his first exposure to Division I level play in his career, Bagent outplayed the other two American team quarterbacks \u2014 Max Duggan, fresh off a College Football Playoff final appearance with Texas Christian; and University of Houston quarterback Clayton Tune, who went on to be drafted in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL draft.\n\nBagent was also invited to participate in the 2023 NFL Combine, and while he went on to be undrafted, he was picked up as a priority undrafted free agent by the Chicago Bears, who gave him a shot to earn a roster spot during training camp. And that he did. Despite the Bears signing quarterback P.J. Walker to a two-year, $4.15 million deal in 2023 free agency, a strong indication as to their commitment to his services as a backup, the team decided to cut him in late August and shift their focus to seventh-year veteran Nathan Peterman and Bagent, who beat out Walker as the third string throughout the offseason despite it being only his second experience playing around NFL talent.\n\nBagent continued to impress in practice, and by Week 4, was announced as the team\u2019s second-string quarterback, with Peterman relegated to the practice squad. The Shepherd product\u2019s upward trajectory continued, and in Week 6, as starting quarterback Justin Fields struggled to get up from a hard hit against the Minnesota Vikings, Bagent came in for relief. With Justin Fields week to week with a thumb injury, head coach Matt Eberflus announced Bagent as the interim starter prior to the Bears\u2019 Week 7 matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders. He became the first Division II quarterback to start an NFL game in 14 years, and led the Bears to only their fifth win since the start of the 2022 season, finishing a respectable 21-for-29 with 162 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBagent struggled the following week in primetime against the Los Angeles Chargers, throwing for two interceptions and finishing with a passer rating of 62, although that\u2019s to be expected \u2013 he is a rookie quarterback learning to play at NFL speed. Ultimately, Bagent may not be the Bears\u2019 future, or even be on the roster next year, yet his journey up to this point is a testament to his tremendous dedication and hard work \u2013 only 1.4 percent of collegiate football players make it to the NFL, and Tyson Bagent did it on the DII route. And with his decent performance to this point, he\u2019s on track to cement himself as a professional quarterback for years to come. He may end up as a journeyman backup, yet Bagent\u2019s career is trending to be a tremendous success.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever let anybody\u2019s opinion stop you from chasing what you want. That\u2019s really what it boils down to for me - just the work,\u201d he told Bears reporters in a press conference earlier this month. \u201cTirelessly working day in and day out and never stopping. And you know, great things can be a result of that.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Dylan Luden November 04, 2023 at 11:20 am PDT\n\nAfter upsetting UCLA last year at Soni McAlister Field, the USC soccer team couldn\u2019t pull off the upset in back-to-back years over the Bruins, losing 4-2 on the road at Wallis Annenberg Stadium.\n\nFrom the very beginning, both teams wanted to set the tone early by playing a brand of up-tempo, attacking soccer to try and score first. UCLA had most of the possession early on, quickly moving up the field using neat one and two touch passes. Even though the link-up play was excellent, UCLA had trouble breaking past USC\u2019s backline into the 18-yard box.\n\nWhen the Trojans would stop an attack from UCLA, they would try to move up the field and take advantage of the Bruins being up. During the 18th minute, UCLA caught USC\u2019s defense sleeping when junior defender Jayden Perry lofted a ball over the top of the Trojan defense into the penalty box from midfield.\n\nIt was a 50/50 ball for either UCLA junior forward Lexi Wright or USC sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson to pounce on. It was Wright who arrived first and chipped it over Dickinson on her first touch at a tough angle to give the Bruins a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe Bruins wasted no time after the first goal by moving up the field again once they retained possession, which led to chaos at the back. After a miscommunication between USC\u2019s backline, graduate forward Ally Cook stole possession away and quickly fired a shot from the top of the box into the upper left corner to make it a 2-0 UCLA advantage.\n\nAt this point, UCLA seemed fully in control of the game, and it would be hard to shake off the reigning defending champions. USC needed some sort of break in the action in order to stay in the game, and it came on a corner kick in the 29th minute.\n\nFreshman forward Maribel Flores whipped in a cross to the back post, where junior midfielder Aaliyah Farmer headed the ball towards goal. Graduate midfielder Kayla Duran tapped it in to narrow the deficit to 2-1.\n\n\u201cThey say sometimes that a two-goal lead is the most dangerous lead in soccer,\u201d USC head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cCould we have rallied back from that? For sure, but I thought we responded very well.\u201d\n\nRight when the Trojans thought they were back into the game, UCLA senior forward Reilyn Turner spun around to the outside and played a low cross into the box, where it was deflected in for an own goal by USC to make it 3-1 in the 33rd minute.\n\nAfter an action-packed first half between the two rivals, the second half became stagnant. Since UCLA had a two-goal advantage, the Bruins sat with the ball in their own end, passing between each other to bait USC into pressuring them around.\n\nUSC put pressure on to begin the half, but the pressure faded away a bit during the middle of the second half. Even though the ball was down in UCLA\u2019s end for most of the final 45 minutes, USC didn\u2019t have any clean looks in front of goal.\n\nWhen UCLA did push on the attack in the final stages of the game, the Bruins drew a penalty after a mistimed Trojans tackle. Substitute sophomore forward Bridgette Marin-Valencia just slipped one past the diving Dickinson to seal the game and make it 4-1 in the 81st minute.\n\nUSC had one last attacking chance towards the end of the game and made it count. Junior forward Simone Jackson cut in from the wing and took a shot on her left foot at the top of the box that glided into the bottom right corner to bring it back to a two-goal game.\n\nAfter being injured earlier in the season, Jackson scored her fifth goal of the season. If the Trojans want to make a deep run in the NCAA tournament, a fully healthy Jackson will be a huge X-factor.\n\n\u201cFor her confidence and the team\u2019s confidence overall, walking away 4-2 hurts less than a larger defeat,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWe know we have a lot of improvements to make, but certainly happy to get one at the end.\u201d\n\nUSC will wait until Monday, Nov. 6 at 1 p.m. for the NCAA Selection Show, when it will find out its opponent in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n```"}

While their College Football Playoff hopes may have disappeared, the Trojans still control their destiny regarding a berth in the Pac-12 Championship game. Those appearances should not be taken for granted, as the Trojans have only had two in the past five years.\n\nThe road will not be easy, as the Trojans will face three straight top-25 opponents. The first is No. 5 Washington, who comes to town with one of the best offenses in the country, as well as a potential Heisman-winner in senior quarterback Michael Penix Jr.\n\nIn Riley\u2019s weekly media availability, he discussed the opportunity ahead, and dove deeper into some topics related to the defense. Riley acknowledged the position the Trojans are in, and how they very much have a road to make this season a successful one. It starts this Saturday, and Riley believes the opportunity is not lost on the guys in the locker room.\n\n\u201c[The opportunity] is as good as anybody has anywhere in the country right now,\u201d Riley said. \u201cLosing to Utah on the last play of the game was heartbreaking, but that\u2019s why you try to win all those conference games before that, so that even if you drop one, you\u2019re still in a great position. We gotta not miss these opportunities that are right here in front of our face. And man, do we have a golden one right here. It should be a hell of a night in the Coliseum.\u201d\n\nLimiting Penix Jr., and an offense that is ranked up there with the top in the country, is going to be crucial for a defense that has struggled to limit some mediocre offenses, specifically in Cal and ASU. Speaking on the keys to limiting their production, Riley believes it starts with Penix Jr. and getting him out of sync.\n\n\u201cHe does a good job of getting the ball out of his hands and getting [it] to these talented playmakers that they have,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThey do a good job with motions and shifts and all that, changing the pictures formationally to try to challenge or stress defenses.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans allowed 49 points and 527 yards to a Cal offense that ranks eighth in the Pac-12 in total offense. A lot of their issues came in giving up big plays, which swung the momentum in the Golden Bears\u2019 way. Against Washington, those same mistakes will cost them, as the Huskies had 18 plays of 10 or more yards in last week\u2019s game against Stanford alone.\n\n\u201cI think the teams that have been able to slow them down have limited some of the big plays,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWhen they do make mistakes, you got to make them pay for it. When they put you in those positions, you gotta go win your battles.\u201d\n\nA big contributor at Cal was junior linebacker Eric Gentry, who had six tackles, a forced fumble and an interception against the Golden Bears. To Riley, Gentry\u2019s impact was felt heavily in Berkeley last weekend. The Trojans need that same type of performance this weekend if they hope to escape with a win.\n\n\u201cHe was very impactful in the game the other day,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHis good plays are really, really good. He had a couple of mistakes that he needs to be cleaner on. But you can\u2019t deny the impact that he\u2019s made. I think the end goal for him is to be able to make the impactful plays like he made last Saturday and then also do it playing a clean brand of football.\u201d\n\nKickoff between the Trojans and the Huskies is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. on Saturday at the Coliseum.\n```"}

This column has previously referred to the Associated Press Top 25 poll for rankings, but today and going forward will use CFP rankings, as will all other Talk of Troy articles for the remainder of the season (unless otherwise denoted).\n\nIt\u2019s that time of the week again, folks! After a week\u2019s hiatus, i\u2019m back to give you the rundown of the best college games in this week\u2019s slate. The past two weeks have been nothing short of crazy \u2014 Virginia knocking off UNC, Pitt upsetting Louisville, Penn State leaving the group of undefeated teams, the list goes on. But enough of the past, let\u2019s look to the future. Happy Saturday eve.\n\nGAME OF THE DAY \u2014 No. 8 Alabama (7-1) vs. No. 14 LSU (6-2)\nTuscaloosa, Ala. 4:45 p.m. PDT on CBS\n\nThis game is one of those contests that is so much more exciting due to the stakes for both teams. Nick Saban leads an Alabama team that is playing to prove the dynasty isn\u2019t over. But LSU takes the field desperate for a win as well \u2014 a W over the Tide would put them atop the SEC West rankings, and with no ranked opponents remaining on their schedule, make the Tigers a shoo-in for an SEC Championship slot.\n\nThe story of this game will be Jalen Milroe, Alabama\u2019s physically skilled but extremely inconsistent quarterback, matching up against an LSU secondary that has allowed the most passing yards this year of any ranked SEC team. The Tigers have taken a few blows personnel-wise this season. Safety Greg Brooks Jr. has been out receiving treatment for brain cancer, and starting corner Zy Alexander will be out Saturday with an ankle injury.\n\nMilroe is averaging 231 passing yards per game, and has had impressive performances against much better secondaries than LSU\u2019s. His season-high 321 yards and three touchdowns came against a Texas A&M unit that ranks 13th in the nation and best in the SEC in terms of passing yards allowed per game. The problem is, he\u2019s also had much worse performances against much worse secondaries. Against Texas, a unit with similar statistics to those of LSU (230.1 YPG to LSU\u2019s 238.5), Milroe had his weakest performance this year \u2014 barely completing 50 percent of his passes and throwing two interceptions in a 34-24 loss.\n\nOn the other end of things, Alabama will be forced to try and contain Heisman candidate Jayden Daniels, one of college football\u2019s best passers this season who has also shown the ability to extend plays with his legs and evade skilled pass rushers. The edge rush is the strongest part of the Tide defense, with linebackers Dallas Turner and Chris Braswell combining for 13.5 sacks and 28 solo tackles. If they can continue that dominance, it\u2019ll take some pressure off of Milroe to carry the team scoring-wise. But they\u2019ll sure have their hands full with Daniels, who currently leads the FBS in passing touchdowns (25) and yards per attempt (11.54), on top of averaging 65 yards rushing per game.\n\nIf the Tigers offense gets off to a hot start, I wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility of them putting the nail in Alabama\u2019s coffin in front of the Tide\u2019s home crowd.\n\nUPSET ALERT\nNo. 19 UCLA (6-2) vs Arizona (5-3)\nTucson, Ariz. 7:30 p.m. PDT on FS1\n\nArizona has been an easy team to root for over the past month. In a stretch of four-straight Top 25 matchups, the Wildcats pulled off two upsets and were one score away from two more. After nearly ending No. 5 Washington\u2019s perfect run in late September, they took No. 20 Southern California to double overtime, and then knocked off Washington State (ranked No. 19 in the AP Poll at the time) and No. 16 Oregon State in back-to-back weeks.\n\nUCLA has been hot this year, especially on defense. They\u2019re a top 10 unit in the country statistically, allowing fewer rushing yards than any other team in FBS. Luckily, the run isn\u2019t what Arizona\u2019s offense relies on, and UCLA is so-so at defending the pass. Arizona\u2019s offense found a second wind when Noah Fifita took over at quarterback, starting with the Wildcats\u2019 near upset of Washington. In just four games as starter, the freshman has tallied 1,221 yards and 11 touchdowns to only three interceptions on an impressive 75.8 percent completion.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a big week for Arizona in front of their home crowd, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Fifita lead the Wildcats to a third straight upset over a UCLA team that has been inconsistent on offense all year.\n\nON THE RISE\nNo. 25 Air Force, 8-0 vs. Army, 11:30 a.m. PDT on CBSSN\n\nIt\u2019s time I finally give some props to Air Force in this column. The Falcons\u2019 No. 25 ranking marks the program\u2019s debut to the CFP poll, and their 8-0 start has the college football world buzzing. Yes, they have yet to play a ranked opponent, but still, their stats are impressive. The Falcons currently rank as CFP\u2019s third-best defense statistically, allowing just 237.9 yards per game. That relies on one of the best rushing defenses in the game, second only to the stellar UCLA unit mentioned earlier.\n\nGoing up against a 2-6 Army team that relies on the run offensively, Air Force should cruise to 9-0 and continue to slip their way up the rankings to a bowl berth. Pay attention to this squad \u2014 a major or semi-major bowl win could be what it takes to see them ranked in the AP preseason poll next year for just the second time in program history. Air Force football is most definitely on the rise.\n\nSOMETHING TO PROVE\nNo. 20 Southern California, 7-2 vs. No. 5 Washington, 4:30 p.m. PDT on ABC\n\nIf you read my last column, you know how down on Southern Cal football I am at this point in the year, and that was before the Trojans got embarrassed by No. 18 Utah in the Coliseum. Let\u2019s be very blunt here \u2014 this will not be an easy game for USC. Washington\u2019s Michael Penix Jr. leads the country in passing yards and has taken Caleb Williams\u2019 spot as Heisman frontrunner. Washington ranks fifth in the nation in total offense, with an average of 501.2 yards per game, and the Trojans\u2019 biggest struggle all year has been defense. USC ranks bottom-20 defensively of 130 FBS schools, allowing 420.9 yards per game.\n\nAdd in the fact that the Trojans\u2019 golden boy Caleb Williams seems to have fallen off his pedestal (he threw three interceptions in the first half against Notre Dame and failed to find the end zone through the air against Utah), and things are looking concerning. The Trojans need to win this game, at this point, to even stay ranked through season\u2019s end. We could be in for a shootout in Expo Park.\n```"}

USC takes on UW\n\nThe Trojans and Huskies will battle it out on Saturday for first place in the Pac-12.\n\nSenior receiver Brenden Rice leads USC receivers with nine touchdowns this season. (Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Cam Kauffman\nNovember 03, 2023 at 6:15 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s a battle of the Heisman winner versus the Heisman hopeful this weekend at the Coliseum. On Saturday, USC takes on Pac-12 rival Washington in what could be a potential 2023 versus 2024 Heisman matchup between USC\u2019s junior quarterback Caleb Williams and UW\u2019s senior quarterback Michael Penix Jr.\n\nNo. 24 USC had its preseason hopes set on a College Football Playoff appearance, but it hasn\u2019t played its best football the last four weeks, which could be a problem against the powerhouse that is Washington. The Trojans started out the season with a commanding 5-0 record, averaging more than 53 points per game and holding its first four opponents to 28 or less. In its sixth through ninth games, however, USC has gone 2-2, with those two wins coming by just three combined points.\n\nWashington comes into the game ranked No. 5 nationally, but its previous two performances have looked anything but top-five worthy. In fact, Washington barely eked out a 42-33 win at Stanford on Oct. 28. Against Arizona State on Oct. 21, the Huskies, who have had one of the most high-octane offenses in the country, only managed 15 points. Needless to say, the 8-0 Huskies may be looking a bit more human, and therefore beatable, as a team coming into Saturday. But, again, Penix is still performing like a top Heisman candidate nonetheless.\n\nHe\u2019s averaging 368 pass yards per game, has thrown 24 touchdowns and has completed 69% of his passes. Penix has also thrown at least four touchdown passes in five of Washington\u2019s eight games this season.\n\nAs for USC, it\u2019s going to take a Heisman performance from its star quarterback if the Trojans want to stay in the win column. Williams is averaging 294 pass yards per game, has thrown 25 touchdowns and has completed 68% of his passes, putting him in many top-10 lists to repeat as Heisman.\n\nThe burden, however, should not just be on Williams. It also falls on the nearly abysmal USC defense, which currently allows 174 rush yards and nearly 250 yards in the air per game. Unfortunately for USC, most of Washington\u2019s potency on offense comes from its passing game, as two Huskies average more than 100 yards receiving per game. Both of those receivers, junior Rome Odunze and sophomore Ja\u2019Lynn Polk, have seven receiving touchdowns apiece.\n\nAs for USC, its receivers will need to make some big plays for long yardage to stay in the game. To win, it\u2019s likely that Williams\u2019 favorite target, Brenden Rice will need to add a couple more touchdowns to the nine he currently has. As for the run game, Washington has allowed an average of 135 rush yards per game, so if redshirt junior MarShawn Lloyd can have a big performance for the Trojans once again, USC has a shot.\n\nUSC takes on Washington Saturday at the Coliseum at 4:30 p.m.\n```"}

Orkin based its ranking on the number of new rodent treatments performed over a year-long period and stated that the list \u201cindicates the efforts that residents and businesses of the top cities have taken to treat rodent issues.\u201d L.A. ranked right behind nine-time first-place winner Chicago, but leads New York City which settled for third place.\n\nThe news took USC students by surprise, who were unaware of the magnitude of rodents in the city. Junior computer science student Nick Marker believes the infestation of rats in L.A. is tiny compared to NYC. \u201cI personally don\u2019t mind the rats and the ones in New York are huge and scary. The ones here are tiny, so I don\u2019t obviously love them but [I\u2019m] not afraid,\u201d Marker said.\n\nSenior astronautical engineering student Andrew Pena said L.A. is fairly dirty as a whole. \u201cI used to think it was just my neighborhood because it was really trashy, but I think most of the city is pretty dirty,\u201d Pena said.\n\nRats not only can cause damage to property, but they also carry many diseases including Hantavirus, Leptospirosis and Monekypox, according to the CDC. Alexis Mesa, a junior majoring in law, history, and culture, said it\u2019s \u201csickening\u201d that L.A. ranks so high. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting, I feel like around here on campus I don\u2019t see a lot [of rats] but I understand why. I feel like in a lot of low-income communities around, trash pickup is rare. Generally in downtown L.A. I don\u2019t think waste management is that good,\u201d Mesa said.\n\nAccording to Orkin, every fall, mice and other rodents invade an estimated 21 million homes in the United States. They typically enter homes between October and February looking for food, water and shelter from the cold. In addition to posing health issues, rodents are also capable of causing structural damage. They have strong jaws and are well-suited for burrowing. A variety of potential threats, including electrical wires, gas lines and water pipes, can be chewed.\n\nPena expressed that money can be an important solution to the problem of rats. \u201cJust more funding, I\u2019ve never seen them clean the streets at all. So I don\u2019t know whose jurisdiction that goes upon. But they just need to get somewhere to clean,\u201d Pena said.\n\nThe County of L.A. Public Health advises removing any sources of food and water and getting rid of items that can provide rodents shelter, so they will be less likely to nest and breed in your yard. Cracks around doors, vents, windows, and other such openings should be covered with \u201crat proof\u201d materials, such as sheet metal. Fall has kicked in, but is your house rat proof yet?\n```"}

Whether it be the Predator and its nerve-wracking clicks or the Xenomorph with its slobbering jaws, they are icons of cinema and represent the moments when a character designer can dig into their most grotesque imagination. However, there is only one movie monster famous enough to have his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: Godzilla. And oddly enough, he was not even a product of Hollywood.\n\nThe reptilian titan stands hundreds of meters tall, breathes nuclear fire and crushes any and everything in his path. November 3 is Godzilla Day, and this month is big for the King of the Monsters. In the U.S., the latest installment in Legendary\u2019s Monsterverse franchise will be released on November 17 with \u201cMonarch: Legacy of Monsters.\u201d Meanwhile, the reptilian icon finally made his return to Japanese theaters this weekend with \u201cGodzilla Minus One,\u201d the first live-action film since 2016\u2032s \u201cShin Godzilla.\u201d\n\nThe classic monster (or kaiju as they are known in Japanese) has a long, eventful history, and after watching all 36 feature-length movies starring the character, I decided to take a deep dive into its beginnings, legacy, and future. While these movies are most known for their disaster elements, sci-fi stories, and iconic monsters, many of them are used to mirror the issues of our human reality.\n\nI became a Godzilla fan in 2014 with the release of Gareth Edwards\u2019 \u201cGodzilla.\u201d While it got mixed reviews, it was successful enough for me that my pet goldfish is named \u201cGodzilla,\u201d and some of the only physical disks left in my house are one\u2019s featuring the titular character. I fell down a rabbit hole, traveling back to 1954 with the release of Ishir\u014d Honda\u2019s \u201cGodzilla,\u201d a film that packed an entire generation of trauma into a single, powerful creature feature.\n\nCinematic Fission\n\nMade nine years following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Honda created \u201cGodzilla\u201d as an allegory for post-war nuclear anxiety. Godzilla started as the ultimate enemy: the personification of a disaster that wiped out thousands of civilians in 1945. Here, Godzilla wreaks havoc across Japan following being woken up by hydrogen bomb tests. The film wrestles with the debate on whether to study or kill the beast, eventually settling on the latter, as an eyepatch-wearing scientist named Serizawa creates an oxygen-based weapon to put an end to Godzilla\u2019s rampage.\n\nThematically, the original film remains perhaps the richest study of post-war terror even to this day. It speaks on the collective scars left on a nation, and tells of how they are able to overcome even the greatest of disasters. However, the cautionary tale also paints a bleak picture in the modern point of view, as thousands of nuclear weapons remain in stock across the globe, not to mention the growing reliance on nuclear power.\n\nPast that initial film, however, Godzilla would morph into something different.\n\nThe Showa Era: Rubber suits and smog\n\nThe first 15 films in the Godzilla franchise are those released during Japan\u2019s Showa Era, or in the time of the reigning Emperor Hirohito. They would provide a single timeline documenting Godzilla\u2019s various run-ins with recognizable creatures including Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, and various aliens hell-bent on taking over Earth (there are at least three of these).\n\nA good majority of these movies are the definition of camp. They are a far cry from the dark, thematic powerhouse of the original, and opt to tell simpler stories of Godzilla. Sometimes, he fights a mechanized doppelganger and other times, his freakish son helps a young boy overcome a bullying problem. Watching the Showa Era films in succession plays out almost like serialized television, most closely resembling the genre of tokusatsu, the classic superhero genre characterized by spandex, practical effects, and big explosions.\n\nAt one point, Godzilla himself seems to become a superhero, making a heroic turn in \u201cEbirah, Horror of the Deep\u201d to defend against a large lobster. From that moment on, a large part of Godzilla films portray the creature less as a threat to humanity, but as a force of nature, whose trail of disaster is balanced out by a desire to protect his world. This would even be translated into Legendary\u2019s Monsterverse, portraying Godzilla as this restorer of balance who awakens every so often to take out enemy monsters.\n\nIt is this change in characterization that would shift Godzilla\u2019s role in the media for the future. While most of the Showa Era consist of cheesy films that portray a pair of men in rubber suits slapping each other around, there are some exceptions: films that seem most in-line with the original film\u2019s thematic weight coupled with an additional artistic voice.\n\nPerhaps the best example of this is \u201cGodzilla vs. Hedorah.\u201d From its opening minutes, audiences can already tell that something is unique. It begins with vibrant reds over black splatters as a horrifying, but catchy song about pollution plays over the credits. The film is about pollution, featuring a creature that feeds on the world\u2019s filth and only grows bigger in its form. The imagery is gruesome, showing people turning to bone after breathing in Hedorah\u2019s poisonous smog. The only solution is Godzilla.\n\nThe environmentalist stance the film took was radical, and fits within Godzilla\u2019s original purpose as a vessel for tackling real-world issues. Although, within the fun of the previous movies there are hints of existential questioning, none of them put the problem front and center like \u201cGodzilla vs. Hedorah\u201d does. It serves as a reminder of Godzilla\u2019s symbolic power, even as a man in a suit.\n\nThe Heisei Era: More human than we think\n\nThe Showa Era would come to an end with 1975\u2032s \u201cTerror of Mechagodzilla.\u201d It would be nine years before Godzilla\u2019s first reboot, \u201cThe Return of Godzilla.\u201d Like many other franchises, the studio went the route of ignoring the past 14 movies and making a \u201ctrue\u201d sequel to the original. With it, directors aimed to return audiences to the mystery of Godzilla, and sought to reintroduce the creature for a new audience.\n\nWith it would come a whole new wave of bizarre lore that fits uniquely within this timeline of Godzilla. There is even a recurring cast member in Miki Saegusa, a woman with the power to telepathically link to kaiju like Godzilla. While we saw a bit more of a comical personality in Showa Era Godzilla, Saegusa serves as a character who can connect to these creatures. Through her, the films add a new sense of depth to these monsters. The people in suits became less obvious to viewers, yet ironically, feel far more human.\n\nThe best example of this is in \u201cGodzilla vs. Biollante,\u201d where a scientist quite literally turns his dead daughter into a massive plant creature as a means of preserving her soul. Other films would be familiar. Once again, aliens and time traveling invaders are featured throughout this era. We would also see the return of Godzilla\u2019s son, but the movies remove the Showa Era\u2019s doting father to make room for something more animalistic.\n\nThis would all culminate in the final film of this era, 1995\u2032s \u201cGodzilla vs. Destoroyah.\u201d For the first time, Godzilla has found an enemy he cannot defeat: chronic disease. In this unexpected legacy sequel that sees references and returning cast members from the original 1954 film, Godzilla spends his final days overloading on nuclear power and fighting a prehistoric crab. While he wins the day, he succumbs to his illness and causes a meltdown. In its final moments, the human characters are relieved to have prevented a nuclear disaster, but there\u2019s a sense of sadness. Despite originally being introduced as this terrifying monster to kill, people like Saegusa shed tears for Godzilla. You realize that through the franchise\u2019s ups and downs, you went on this journey with Godzilla. It is hard to say goodbye, but his legacy lives on.\n\nThe final shot of the film is one of the series\u2019 most memorable. A blinding light encompasses the screen as a silhouette of Godzilla\u2019s son roars, and you realize that it has come time for a new era to begin.\n\nThe Millennium Series: Rebooting the reptile\n\nThe Millennium Series is the start of standalone Godzilla films. While many of the movies share similar Godzilla designs with a more spiky, reptilian look, they are all meant to live within their own continuity. I like to call this period the era of Godzilla \u201cpostmodernism.\u201d There are a few \u201cversus\u201d films that feel right at home with the Heisei Era, but most of this series\u2019 short run stands as a reversal of what came before.\n\n\u201cGodzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack,\u201d for example, ditches everything the audience knows about Godzilla. There is no nuclear power and swaps science fiction for the supernatural. Instead, it opts to create Godzilla to be the product of a different kind of post-war trauma: the spirits of Pacific War victims. He is portrayed almost like a slasher villain, making vengeful kills against Japanese citizens. On the flip side, all of Godzilla\u2019s classic enemies, including the hydra-like King Ghidorah, are shown to be protectors of the Earth who fight against Godzilla in order to put the ghostly legion to rest.\n\nThis would continue with the Mechagodzilla duology, including \u201cGodzilla Against Mechagodzilla\u201d and \u201cGodzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.\u201d In contrast to the supernatural story told previously, they create a mecha movie, featuring soldiers in high-tech uniforms fighting in a massive robot against Godzilla.\n\nA key feature of the Millennium films is a return to Godzilla\u2019s villainous roots. As opposed to the heroics of Heisei Era or Showa-Era Godzilla, he is always a threat, and his enemies are shown to be human allies. The Millennium Era would culminate with \u201cGodzilla: Final Wars,\u201d a celebration of the monster\u2019s legacy, and also perhaps the most maximalist the franchise has ever been.\n\nInstead of the real-world settings these films have come to embrace, the film drops us into a \u201cMatrix\u201d-inspired dystopia set to hard rock. The film adapts the series\u2019 love of alien invasions for the early 2000s, retrofitting it with black leather and rectangular sunglasses. Godzilla runs through a gauntlet of iconic enemies while a team of humans fight their own battle against skin-wearing gray men.\n\nThe Millennium Series sets a trend for future Godzilla work and establishes a precedent that the creature can be more than just monsters fighting each other, but they can be a space for unique stories and interpretation.\n\nThe Reiwa Era: Less is more\n\nThis brings us to today. Japan is currently in its Reiwa Era, and there is only one feature-length Godzilla film (excluding a three-part Netflix animated trilogy). The recent films have seemed to avoid picking up a continual timeline and instead have continued the Millennium Era\u2019s self-contained storytelling. With them comes experimentation and a return to thematic storytelling.\n\nHideaki Anno\u2019s \u201cShin Godzilla\u201d is the first of this era. Rather than being in any Godzilla continuity, it is part of a separate series started by Anno titled the \u201cShin Japan Heroes\u201d that sees unique takes on Japanese icons, including Kamen Rider, Ultraman and Anno\u2019s very own \u201cNeon Genesis Evangelion.\u201d\n\nThe film has been seen by some as a celebration of Japanese nationalism, showing the politics behind stopping a rampaging monster and the inaction caused by red tape. It modernizes the nuclear conversation, placing it in the context of a post-Fukushima Japan as the leaders look to avoid another nuclear disaster in their country.\n\nHow fitting that the way Godzilla falls is through the power of a city. A train line and cranes are creatively used to freeze the creature, as the urban combat allows the literal country of Japan to defend itself against destruction. Anno\u2019s themes of human potential are a common thread through his \u201cShin\u201d movies and this is no different. The film is less about Godzilla but more so how the creature is a vehicle for human survival.\n\nRed, white, blue and Godzilla\n\nGodzilla in \u201cMonarch: Legacy of Monsters\u201d (Photo courtesy of Apple TV+)\n\nBut even outside of Japan, Godzilla has an undeniable presence abroad. While 1998\u2032s \u201cGodzilla\u201d ended with mixed reviews and a mutated iguana, the recent Monsterverse has found some success. The cinematic universe is surprisingly, one of the less controversial and consistent franchises out there, focusing on a heroic Godzilla fighting against CGI renditions of classic characters.\n\nThe films lack the themes or depth of some of the Toho films, likely because of the missing cultural connection, but they provide a new take of the monster. Not only do they emphasize the majesty of Godzilla, but these stories represent the monster on a world stage. Beyond being a Japanese product, the films reveal how he can quite literally appear any and everywhere at will. His next outing will be in \u201cMonarch: Legacy of Monsters\u201d followed up by \u201cGodzilla X Kong: A New Empire.\u201d\n\nPlus one and so much more\n\n\u201cGodzilla Minus One\u201d just smashed into Japanese theaters. The film once again takes a new direction for the classic monster. Setting him in post-war Japan opens the opportunity for further exploration of the creature beyond the present day and serves as a direct contrast to Anno\u2019s contemporary take on the monster.\n\nIn its almost 70-year history, Godzilla has worn many faces. He is a demon of nuclear power, a superhero in a rubber suit, the ghosts of Japan\u2019s past, a keeper of nature\u2019s balance, and even an anti-bullying PSA. Every generation can impart their own ideas onto what the creature represents, whether it be post-war anxiety, nationalism, or environmentalism. For fans across the globe, the creature means something different to each individual.\n\nFor me? Godzilla is a myth whose lack of consistency in origin and narrative are what make him fascinating. Despite being the King of the Monsters, he is a reflection of our human consciousness with all our anxieties and aspirations told on film.\n```"}

(Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy David Herrera II and Ye Ji Jong\nNovember 03, 2023 at 3:34 pm PDT\n\nTrojans will get an extra hour of sleep this Sunday, when clocks will shift back to standard time and out of daylight saving time. But why does the United States adopt this concept of warping time? In the northern hemisphere days are longer in the summer and shorter in the winter, and daylight saving time shifts clocks an hour forward to maximize light in the summer months. This quest to utilize all possible bright hours is scheduled from the second Sunday in March through the first Sunday of November. The extra hour of light is added in the afternoon to avoid sleeping through it in the morning. Warmer temperatures use daylight saving time, while the rest of the months use standard time.\n\nDaylight saving time was first adopted by Germany in 1916 for the purpose of conserving energy and maximizing war production in the midst of World War I. The U.S. adopted the idea two years later and has been using daylight saving time for over a century now. The two states that choose not to save daylight are Arizona and Hawaii. Arizona found it impractical to have the sunset at a later time during the hottest months of the year and Hawaii\u2019s close proximity to the equator creates no difference in how much sunlight the state receives throughout the year.\n\nOn the other hand, most states are attempting to push for a permanent daylight saving time. In the Senate, the Sunshine Protection Act was proposed for a second time by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Last year, the act passed unanimously in the Senate but stalled and expired in the House. Representatives were hesitant to pass the bill since it proposed permanent daylight saving time rather than a permanent standard time while Sen. Rubio of Florida argued that it would be economically beneficial.\n\nHealth experts lobbied against the bill since under permanent daylight saving time, winter sunrises would be as late as 9 a.m. in some states, which could mean commuting to school or work in the dark. They also argued that standard time is more natural for the body\u2019s circadian rhythm leading to healthier sleep patterns.\n\nStudents at USC also expressed their ambivalent opinions on this issue. Malaya Galindez, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences, shared how daylight savings made her more prone to feeling dismal and unmotivated. She said, \u201cHonestly... I feel like it makes me less productive. But I do like having that extra hour of sleep, but I feel like it wears off pretty quickly... I... just end up waking up earlier... I feel like it doesn\u2019t really have a huge impact on my day to day life.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Alex Zhu, a masters student studying analytics, said that from his time living in Massachusetts and China, the shift was neither drastic nor did it make a difference. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m just completely neutral on it. If we have it, we have it. If we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nOn the federal level, the Sunshine Bill is stalling, but in 2020 voters in California passed a proposition that gave the state lawmakers the ability to change daylight saving time measures and, it\u2019s now up to them to take action and rally enough votes. If they obtain the needed two-thirds majority, they would only be allowed to switch to permanent standard time due to the Uniform Time Act of 1966. State lawmakers have not taken any action since the legislation was passed, so Californians continue to wait for either the federal or state governments to end springing ahead and falling behind every year.\n```"}

The combination of Cedar Fair, the owner company of Knotts, and Six Flags will increase their overall value by $200 million over a three-year span.\n\nBoth parks experienced a record drop in attendance during their two-month coronavirus closure, which Dornsife student Ciara Stephans explained. \"Their revenue probably has decreased since people are not going outside due to the virus and a new variant, especially in California.\"\n\nTo make up for their near $456 million in net revenue loss, this consolidation will raise the value of the two companies to about $8 billion. This deal has raised concerns from thrill-seeking students and staff about the affordability of these parks.\n\nMax Bross, a senior at the School of Public Policy, shared his worries about the impact of this merger. \"It would probably raise the price of tickets as well. Um, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m assuming that it would definitely bring in more consumers to the park, but if that were to be the case, then a lot of people who can\u2019t afford to go to the more expensive parks that rely on Six Flags may have nowhere to go.\"\n\nGisselle Aquion works at USC and echoed these sentiments. \"Not everyone can afford to go to these amusement parks. It\u2019s not everyone has the money. I feel like aside from purchasing and admission tickets, there\u2019s food inside, drinks that you need to purchase.\"\n\nThat said, the new funds from the merger will allow more resources for renovations that students like Bross say the parks desperately need. \"I can tell because a lot of the food just isn\u2019t great. They don\u2019t have like a lot of updated technology.\"\n\nStephans remembers her experience in dealing with technical issues at the parks. \"I think they could spend more time with the rides like there\u2019s been numerous times where I went to Six Flags and the Goliath was like a stopped.\"\n\nEven with this swift change in the industry, students hope that the parks will stay true to what brings them back every year. Bross: \"I usually go play like four or five times a year. Six Flags is that I think it has more of an identity to it. It has a really like old feeling, and it\u2019s the theme throughout the entire park is very consistent and I really like it.\"\n\nDespite the ups and downs, members of the USC community will continue to enjoy the new Thrill Capitals of the World. The announcement brings new anticipation, and we\u2019re all just waiting for the drop.\n```"}

(Photo by Kassydi Rone)\n\nBy Kassydi Rone\nNovember 02, 2023, at 6:29 pm PDT\n\n\u2018Mama always says there\u2019s an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes. Where they going, where they been.\u2019 Forrest Gump said it on a park bench. Stuart Weitzman lived it for more than five decades in the designer footwear industry. As former CEO and Creative Director of the Stuart Weitzman brand, the fashion mogul referred to his designs as \u201chis children... like a part of his DNA.\u201d\n\nWeitzman\u2019s vibrant perspective translated into the intergenerational audience of fashion enthusiasts, undergraduates, and alumni alike, who gathered at the Friends of the USC Libraries Lecture Hall for the speaker event coordinated by Visions and Voices on November 1. Although Stuart Weitzman the brand now belongs to Tapestry \u2014 formerly known as Coach, and now a parent company to Stuart Weitzman, Kate Spade New York, and Coach New York \u2014 Stuart Weitzman the man still very much has his heart and soul (and sole) in shoemaking at 82 years old.\n\nPromptly at 5:00 p.m., Weitzman took the podium at the center of the room, making shoe contact before eye contact with those in the front row. He sported a salmon-toned button-down, white ankle-length trousers, and contrary to his iconic high-heeled designs, a pair of gray and white On Cloud tennis shoes.\n\n\u201cI think there are more people here than at Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u201d Weitzman said. The tension of meeting an idol seemed to dissipate from the room, and the eager crowd shared laughter with Weitzman like old friends.\n\nImmediately, he delved into the first of his truisms \u2014 dubbed \u2018Stu-isms\u2019 by his employees \u2014 gesturing to a four-letter word on the screen to his left, written in a font as bold and black as his signature glasses frames. RISK.\n\n\u201cIf you think as an artist or a creator, [risk] is your best friend,\u201d Weitzman said. \u201cYou measure them, but you take them.\u201d\n\nAs a University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business alumni, Weitzman became acquainted with the idea of risk early on in his career. He often asked himself, \u2018What am I going to do to get noticed?\u2019 It was when he realized that while no two dresses on the red carpet were the same, but six or seven pairs of shoes were identical, that the idea for custom-made celebrity shoes was born.\n\nWeitzman\u2019s first major celebrity moment was in 1983, when Aretha Franklin thanked him for her shoes during her acceptance speech for \u201cFavorite Soul Album\u201d at the American Music Awards. According to Weitzman, 13 million women had tuned in for that speech, and only a month passed before he was known as the \u201cshoemaker of the stars.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s any other confirmation needed that risk pays off, take a look at UPenn\u2019s Stuart Weitzman School of Design.\n\nIMAGINATION.\n\nWeitzman\u2019s background in business also aided him in consulting qualified designers for his advertising campaigns. Many recognize his \u201cA Little Obsessed With Shoes\u201d ads at first glance, which took a vastly simplified design approach compared to other footwear companies. Rather than spending copious amounts of money on high fashion models, this advertising campaign took ordinary sights and incorporated high heels into their structure.\n\nThe first one featured a jack o\u2019 lantern with shoes for eyes and a mouth for the fall season, but they eventually became as personable as the one showcasing his Dalmatian with heels as reimagined spots etched onto the fur. His dog received so much traction that thousands of mothers began asking for copies of the advertisement to give to their daughters.\n\nWeitzman reaped the benefit of being those young women\u2019s first exposure into a luxury shoe brand, even if they couldn\u2019t purchase them yet.\n\n\u201cDo not lose your imagination, it\u2019s what separates you from your competitors,\u201d Weitzman said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I titled this event \u2018An Entrepreneur\u2019s Journey on the Road Less Traveled.\u2019 Take that road. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re just going to be another page.\u201d\n\nINSPIRATION.\n\nWeitzman\u2019s gladiator sandal took inspiration from the Tevas he saw clients wear. Some of his luxe ankle boot styles give a Doc Marten feel. His quintessential 5050 over-the-knee boot pays homage to Julia Roberts in \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d and has made its way from the street to the stage at Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 tour.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to copy, but there are lots of places to be inspired,\u201d Weitzman said. He urged attendees to pay attention to what catches their eye in films, works of art, and wider pop culture. Listing well-known figures from Marilyn Monroe to Michelangelo, Weitzman finds muses for his artistry just about anywhere.\n\nYOU CAN\u2019T DO IT ALONE.\n\nWeitzman mimicked a knife to the chest as he recounted the time he was approached at a wedding with, \u2018My mother wears your shoes.\u2019 It had been over 15 years of the business, and he wanted to prioritize getting the next generation of women in his shoes. He strategically leaned into the realm of television to get his brand out on the town in addition to the red carpet.\n\n\u201cIf I could get Jennifer Aniston in my shoes, I could get all the women 20 to 30 years old,\u201d Weitzman said. Aniston ended up purchasing a pair of his Alex Swamp Espadrilles from a Weitzman store, making them the shoe of the summer.\n\nIn other star-studded news, Weitzman made Megan Markle\u2019s shoes for the \u201cSuits\u201d series. Collaboration, however, extended beyond celebrities and into architecture. He worked with Iraqi-British architect, Zaha Hadid, to build a custom retail store in Milan. The look of this very store is what allowed him to expand into the Asian market, gaining the coveted spot next to the escalator in the IFC Mall of Hong Kong.\n\nBE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY.\n\nBefore and during his retirement, Weitzman believed in philanthropy. One of his favorite traditions was to have celebrities design a singular pump that reflected their personality and use them in his annual celebrity shoe auction. He has also partnered with models such as Gigi Hadid, to collaborate on a mule design with proceeds designated to a specific cause. In her case, Stuart spearheaded their design of the \u201cEYELOVE\u201d collection, which both honored her Palestinian identity with the element of the \u201cevil eye\u201d and their wishes to build schools in Ghana, Guatemala, and Laos with the education charity Pencils of Promise.\n\nWeitzman\u2019s love for community was especially evident in the opportunity for three students to model his shoes, his decision to stay overtime to answer questions, and his seat at a roundtable dinner with a select group of students after the event.\n\nAt the heart of every truism shared was his passion for creative expression. From parading around in his mother\u2019s pumps at age five to proposing to his wife with custom heels, Stuart Weitzman\u2019s career was sustained by out-of-the-shoe-box ideas.\n```"}

The female student was returning to her apartment near campus from a club in West Hollywood. According to the email, the Lyft driver raped the student in his car when they arrived at her apartment.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said the investigation was ongoing and an arrest had not yet been made. In a statement to Annenberg Media, Lyft said that its thoughts were with the victim, though it could not confirm the details of the report.\n\n\u201cBased on the information available at this time, we have not identified a report or ride matching the description and can\u2019t confirm it involved the Lyft platform,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe have reached out to law enforcement and stand ready to assist with their investigation.\u201d\n\nThe report left many USC students feeling on edge. Junior international relations and global relations major Kimya Jalinous called the allegation \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take a lot of Lyft rides by myself and kind of just trust the Lyft system,\u201d said Jalinous. \u201cIt was concerning to see I couldn\u2019t trust Lyft to provide a safe ride.\u201d\n\nSome students, such as freshman economics and math major Emily Lai, said they plan to make changes to how they use ride sharing apps such as Lyft.\n\n\u201cSeeing that announcement in my email feed was scary,\u201d said Lai. \u201cI\u2019ll never go out in a Lyft by myself again. I\u2019ll probably bring a friend with me next time.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2019 report commissioned by Lyft, there were more than 1,000 sexual assault reports each year between 2017-2019. Uber reported 5,000 sexual assault claims during a two-year period. Nonprofit Helping Survivors of Sexual Abuse said the number of assaults were due to what the organization described as \u201clenient\u201d vetting processes for drivers that only include a cursory background check to screen for criminal histories and pending investigations.\n\nNeither Lyft nor Uber have announced plans to alter their screening practices. DPS recommends that while using rideshare services, students should locate safety features on the app, keep their phones accessible at all times and look at the driver to verify their identity. Lyft riders are also able to connect through the app with an ADT security professional, who can discreetly contact the authorities. Students also can do a live chat with DPS through the LiveSafe app.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The article previously stated \u201c2,000 sexual assaults are reported\u201d in the 2019 report. This number was corrected to \u201cmore than 1,000.\u201d\n```"}

After many concerns from fans regarding his reduced play time this season to keep him fresh, James played a season-high 42 minutes as he led the Los Angeles Lakers to a 130-125 overtime victory over their inner-city rivals, the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe game wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing for the Lakers as the Clippers game out firing early on. Could the recent trade acquisition of James Harden have boosted the Clippers\u2019 spirits even without him playing? Who knows. All that matters is that Kawhi Leonard looked fully healthy and ready to lead a Clippers team with championship aspirations. Leonard had 18 points in the first quarter, which is the most first-quarter points he\u2019s had in his entire career.\n\nThe Lakers offense looked stagnant in the first half. There was too much ball-watching happening \u2014 everyone would stand out on the perimeter waiting for the ball handler to kick it to them instead of making themselves open. On the defensive side, the Clippers were scoring at will in that first half. They were getting inside with ease and were hitting over half of their threes.\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 shooting in the first half wasn\u2019t terrible, but wasn\u2019t great, either. Austin Reaves had a rough going at first, but James was able to pick him up as well as the rest of the Lakers as they were down by 13 at the half.\n\nHalloween was on Tuesday, but it seemed like some witch stuck around to cast a spell that made both teams switch identities at halftime. Instead of the Lakers\u2019 offense looking sluggish and the defense being non-existent, the Clippers were actually the ones that looked that way to begin the second half.\n\nThe Lakers continued to get high-percentage looks thanks to their outstanding defense. James didn\u2019t play a ton in the third quarter, but their frontcourt took the reigns and provided a boost with James out. The combination of Anthony Davis, Christian Wood and Jaxson Hayes provided stout defense around the hoop with Davis tallying four blocks in the game.\n\nD\u2019Angelo Russell stepped up big for the Lakers on the offensive side of the ball as he and Davis had 27 points each. Reaves also stepped up his offensive play in the second half, but provided tremendous value on defense all game with three steals. Cam Reddish, who started in place of the injured Taurean Prince, also had three assists and looked solid on both ends.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Paul George took over for the Clippers. With 14 seconds left, Reddish skims George\u2019s elbow on a shot behind the 3-point line to cause a foul. Down by three, George made all three free throws to tie the game and send it to overtime after Russell couldn\u2019t make the go-ahead shot with the clock winding down.\n\nThe Lakers continued playing great offense and defense in overtime, constantly attacking the boards. Wood especially honed in on that aspect and sealed the game with an emphatic put-back jam. He would finish the game with a double-double alongside Clippers\u2019 Russell Westbrook.\n\nEven though the performances of Leonard (38 points) and George proved that the Clippers will be a threat to win the Western Conference this season, the Lakers came out on top in this first matchup between the crosstown rivals.\n\nAfter just playing the Orlando Magic last game at home in the Crypto.com Arena, the Lakers will look to ride their momentum as they travel to Florida to face the Magic on Saturday at 4 p.m. The Clippers will also travel cross country this weekend as they play the New York Knicks Monday at 4:30 p.m.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nNovember 02, 2023 at 5:04 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League. Welcome to The Silver Shield, a weekly column covering the NHL\u2019s controversies, news and stories. My name is Kasey Kazliner, and I\u2019m a freshman from the Bay Area. I\u2019ve been a hockey fan for as long as I can remember and have supported the Sharks through all of the annual disappointment. I\u2019m proud to be a fan of a sport that truly deserves more recognition, especially in California.\n\nThe Sharks suck, again\nI didn\u2019t choose to feature the Sharks this week just because I\u2019m a fan. In fact, I really wish that I didn\u2019t have to portray them in such a negative light. But, here we are. The Sharks are the worst team in the NHL and are the only one without a win, with a 0-8-1 record thus far. San Jose is coming off of four straight non-playoff seasons after being among the league\u2019s best for quite some time. In search of a new identity after the departures of iconic names such as Brent Burns and Joe Pavelski in recent years, the Sharks look like a trainwreck through nine games.\n\nWell, why are the Sharks so bad? The answer to this question is more complicated than you might think. San Jose\u2019s schedule has been about as rigorous as can be to start the year. With games against the 2023 Stanley Cup champion Golden Knights, runner-up Panthers and perennial powerhouses Avalanche and Lightning, the Sharks were set up for failure as soon as the schedule was released. But, let\u2019s not cut the Sharks too much slack. San Jose is lacking any sort of goal production. Even though last year\u2019s team was uncompetitive, it at least featured defenseman Erik Karlsson, a guy that could rack up points on a night-to-night basis and give the Sharks some light. Following the departure of Karlsson, the Sharks have no one to boast about. San Jose\u2019s -16 goal differential in five-on-five play is the worst in the NHL, and only two members of the team have more than a single goal thus far.\n\nYou can\u2019t really blame the goaltenders for this lackluster start. In the Sharks\u2019 matchup against the Avalanche, Mackenzie Blackwood saved 51 shots, the most by a goaltender in his debut with a new team, ever. However, in typical Sharks fashion, the team found a way to blow a late lead and let their goaltender down in a shootout. The other half of the goalie tandem, Kaapo K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen, hasn\u2019t received any favors either. Against Carolina, the Sharks\u2019 defense allowed 40 shots, but didn\u2019t score any goals of their own. K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen\u2019s 37 saves and stout .925 save percentage went to waste, since the Sharks couldn\u2019t capitalize.\n\nNumbers can tell the story. The Sharks have averaged 3:30 of possession in the offensive zone at even strength, but have allowed opponents to have 6:53 per game. The offense simply isn\u2019t clicking in San Jose.\n\nAside from all of the negativity, young talent has had glimmers of success and has shown that this team has the capability of being a contender again someday. Youngsters Filip Zadina, Fabian Zetterlund, William Eklund and Thomas Bordeleau have all shined so far. If San Jose can manage to develop these up-and-coming players like how it has done in the past, the Sharks should have a solid team in the next five years or so.\n\nIn the meantime, though, fans must endure the suffering. Well, actually, with only around 14,000 fans showing up to the Shark Tank every night, the third lowest in the NHL, fans have had enough. If the Sharks want to legitimize themselves as a premier Bay Area sports team, amid unparalleled levels of support for the Warriors and 49ers, San Jose must make changes. Fast.\n\nLooking ahead, we should expect San Jose to be a desperate seller come the trade deadline. While both players have contract clauses that could complicate possible trades, veterans Logan Couture and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hertl, who have been with the Sharks for years, are rumored to be seeking out other options. San Jose is a team that craves nostalgia and fears rebuilding, but now is the time to tear it all down before it gets worse.\n\nOilers vs. Flames: outdoors and in style\nBoth Alberta teams have struggled this season. The Edmonton Oilers, in particular, have been a major letdown following a 109-point campaign last year. Through eight games, the Oilers are 2-5-1 and have been awful defensively. The ridiculous 8-1 loss to the Canucks on opening night was indicative of Edmonton\u2019s struggles in its own zone. Yes, I know that Connor McDavid has dealt with an upper body injury, but he\u2019s still played in six of their eight games.\n\nThe Flames are coming off of a below-average season, when they missed the playoffs following the departure of former all-star Johnny Gaudreau. Right now, Calgary sits at 2-7-1 and is only above the Sharks in the Pacific. The Flames were on a four-game skid heading into the Heritage Classic.\n\nBefore I get into what actually happened in the Heritage Classic, I want to talk about the uniforms. Personally, I always look forward to the annual outdoor games in the NHL, specifically because of the exclusive jerseys worn in each of the games. Edmonton rocked beautiful royal blue and orange jerseys that paid tribute to the Edmonton Mercurys, a defunct team that won gold in the 1952 Olympics. The oil-drop logo in the middle with the curved script below it fits very nicely. Calgary gave homage to the also defunct Calgary Stampeders (the hockey team, not the current CFL team) of the 1950s and 1960s. The jerseys feature a cream white base, with red stripes and the iconic flaming \u201cC\u201d logo in the middle. While I personally like the Oilers\u2019 look better, both teams played in style.\n\nThe Oilers and Flames met at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, home of the CFL\u2019s Elks. Connor McDavid returned from injury and had an assist, and five different skaters scored for the Oilers. Edmonton was also on a four-game losing streak coming into the game, but snapped it with a 5-2 rout over its local rival. The game was pretty back-and-forth starting out, with the Oilers going up 3-1 at the first intermission. Calgary cut the deficit to one in the second, but Edmonton ran away with the game in the third. The Oilers\u2019 offense was rock solid in the win. Evander Kane led the way with two assists and a goal.\n\nThe Flames and Oilers won\u2019t meet again until late January. Meanwhile, the NHL\u2019s next outdoor game will be a Winter Classic matchup between the Kraken and Golden Knights at T-Mobile Park in Seattle on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nAdam Johnson dies tragically, and too soon\nFormer Penguins center Adam Johnson passed away last weekend at the age of 29 after his throat was cut by an opposing player in an Elite Ice Hockey League game in England. Police in South Yorkshire are investigating the incident. While Johnson only played 13 games in the NHL, he scored his first and only goal with Pittsburgh in 2019. The Penguins honored him at center ice on Monday along with the opposing Ducks. Pittsburgh will sport \u201cAJ47\u2032\u2032 decals on its helmets in honor of Johnson. His death warns the NHL that without proper neck protection, this could happen again. Hockey is a beautiful sport, but it makes the case as the most dangerous. May Johnson rest in peace.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

After beating the Vancouver Whitecaps 5-2 in the Game 1 of the first round, LAFC have made my assertion that the Canadian club has a frisky squad look silly. But in my defense, the MLS\u2019 new playoff format didn\u2019t help my case. Instead of a two-leg playoff format \u2014 or even just having all single-elimination matches \u2014 the league has rendered the second halves of some matches almost meaningless.\n\nAfter a close first half ended 2-2, LAFC galloped out to a two-goal lead by the 64th minute. In that situation, what\u2019s really the incentive for the losing team to bust its lungs late in the match, when injury is most likely, with a home-field advantage looming in Game 2? I\u2019m not accusing the Whitecaps of throwing away the rest of the match, but the incentive is just not the same as an aggregate affair where every goal counts.\n\nIf the MLS wants to pry some viewers away from European soccer with its playoff format, it has to match the intensity of the Champions League knockouts or a late-stage FA Cup tie immediately from round one. The current format doesn\u2019t do that.\n\nBut I digress. LAFC played a great game! As has been true for most of the 2023 season, when Denis Bouanga has a good day, the result goes LAFC\u2019s way (I swear I wasn\u2019t trying to rhyme). The Gabonese forward and MLS Golden Boot winner donned his shooting boots again, scoring two crucial goals. His first came in the 29th minute, putting LAFC ahead 2-1, and the second effectively secured the win, giving LAFC a 4-2 lead.\n\nHis first finish was a display of preposterous confidence. On the run, he takes one stride to the right, around a Whitecaps centerback, and just unleashes a 16-yard belter into the top right. The second came in luckier fashion, with a low long shot that trickled past an unprepared goalkeeper. But hey, if you put it on frame, it always has a chance to go in.\n\nHe also effectively created LAFC\u2019s third by tapping the ball over his own head to create a left-footed volley, on which Ryan Hollingshead, the MLS\u2019 scoring-est defender, tapped in the rebound.\n\nApart from a defensive brain fart on the Whitecaps\u2019 first goal, LAFC had a resolute performance that sets them up perfectly to seal the series in two games. But again, the Whitecaps have firepower. The team\u2019s leading scorer this season was Brian White with 16 goals, fifth-most in the MLS. Their best player and talisman Ryan Gauld had an MVP-caliber campaign in 2023 with 11 goals and 13 assists, showing his ability to both score and create. He assisted the Whitecaps\u2019 second goal in this match, so he\u2019ll have some momentum going back to his home ground.\n\nAdditionally, the Whitecaps only lost three MLS home matches all season, compared to LAFC\u2019s four dropped matches at BMO Stadium (the black and gold did have more wins, though). All this is to say: LAFC cannot afford complacency. If the team hopes to advance in this series and give itself the best chance of winning the MLS Cup, LAFC must take care of the ball in Vancouver and capitalize on the chances that present themselves.\n\nIt sounds so simple, but head coach Steve Cherundolo\u2019s crew have lost matches this season with their at times breakneck, reckless speed. For L.A.\u2019s sake, hopefully calmness prevails in British Columbia this weekend.\n\nAngel City extend Tweed\n\nAs everyone should\u2019ve expected, Becki Tweed has become Angel City FC\u2019s permanent head coach, removing the interim title. Tweed took over the team in June after the firing of former head coach Freya Coombe, who had failed to take Angel City to the playoffs in 2022 and whose team looked horribly off the pace to start this season.\n\nTweed, who had been an assistant under Coombe, clearly found something in that squad that her predecessor had failed to do, losing just one regular season match in four and half months, qualifying ACFC for its first playoff appearance.\n\nFor anyone who has watched the team or spent time around the club in the last few months, this was not a surprising decision. As I wrote previously, Tweed seems to command tremendous respect in the dressing room and, having watched her preside over a press conference, absolutely looks the part of a top-level coach.\n\nIn the club\u2019s official announcement, Tweed alluded to the team\u2019s potential for next season and desire to take the next step. \u201cWe\u2019ve set a standard, and now we have to move the needle a little bit more and raise that standard,\u201d Tweed said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s exciting. Every single person, player, staff member, feels like the work is not done.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right to be excited. The team has immense potential next season. Another year of development for Alyssa Thompson, a defender of the year candidate in Sarah Gorden, Savannah McCaskill\u2019s best professional season \u2014 all the ingredients are there.\n\nTweed also gave credit to her staff and the relationships they\u2019ve developed. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve achieved as a staff and how close we have become and how much we challenge each other and hold each other accountable, it\u2019s always collective effort.\u201d\n\nWith expectations raised, all eyes will be on Angel City to take the leap from playoff hopeful to contender next season.\n\nOrange County fall in conference semis\n\nI had hoped that Southern California might see two championship soccer runs, but we\u2019re down to just the one. Orange County SC lost 2-1 in extra time to Phoenix Rising FC in excruciating fashion.\n\nThe brilliantly named Danny Trejo (a former LAFC guy) struck first blood for Phoenix just seven minutes into the match when he caught OCSC ball-watching on an over-the-top pass. Orange County equalized 17 minutes later through Thomas Amang, whose teammates set him up for a simple tap-in after he made the correct run on goal.\n\nBut with just five minutes remaining in extra time, Phoenix found their own Emil Cuello alone on the edge of the box, and it was game over.\n\nEven in a loss, our guy Milan Iloski was all over this match. He hit the post twice in regular time and attempted an audacious bicycle kick in the second minute of extra time. Stay what you will about Iloski\u2019s shot efficiency, but he has undeniable style, confidence and ability.\n\nIt will be a joy to watch him play in Europe (if I ever figure out where to stream the Danish league). So long, OCSC, our little USL Championship sojourn was fun. I hope to pay closer attention next season and maybe make it down to Irvine for a match.\n\n\u201cBeckham\u201d delivers a delicious serving of nostalgia\n\nAs an American soccer fan, English football history is typically something you have to seek out and learn for yourself. It\u2019s not passed down through generations like the Michael Jordan-era Bulls or the 49ers teams of Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. And no matter how much you try to immerse yourself in the history, if you didn\u2019t live through it, you probably don\u2019t understand the magnitude of it.\n\nThat\u2019s why I found the new Netflix docuseries \u201cBeckham\u201d so compelling. I didn\u2019t just learn more about his life and Manchester United in the \u201890s \u2014 I felt it. The way director Fisher Stevens and his crew crafted this show, I became surprisingly emotional when David Beckham and Diego Simeone recounted their European Cup rematch following Beckham\u2019s red card against Simeone\u2019s Argentina in the 1998 World Cup.\n\nAnd that World Cup was four years before I was even born.\n\nAfter four paragraphs, you might be wondering, \u201cJack, that\u2019s cool and all, but what does this have to do with L.A.?\u201d Well, the Galaxy wouldn\u2019t be the MLS\u2019s most iconic club if the most famous player hadn\u2019t decided to trade playing at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u for the bright lights of Los Angeles.\n\nActually, let\u2019s take that one step further: Beckham played a pivotal role in making the MLS as an entity what it is today. It\u2019s fitting this docuseries came out in 2023, the same year that Lionel Messi joined Beckham\u2019s Inter Miami and the MLS.\n\nBecause without Beckham\u2019s trail blazing, Messi or a player of his caliber would never have made a move to America. \u201cIt\u2019s a gamble to try to become the Messiah of American soccer,\u201d Franklin Foer, the author of the book How Soccer Explains the World, says in the fourth episode, referring to Beckham\u2019s MLS move. \u201cHe was risking everything by coming here.\u201d\n\nBy taking that risk and giving the MLS its first true European superstar still on the fringes of his prime, Beckham paved the way for Messi to be a sure thing. The Argentinian maestro may have faced some skepticism for his transfer to Miami, but no reasonable person doubted it would be successful. Messi had just won a World Cup six months earlier, after all.\n\nBeckham\u2019s transfer proved not just revolutionary for the attention (and presumably, dollars) he brought to MLS, but for him as a businessman as well. He exercised his contract option to purchase an MLS expansion club for $25 million, which pales in comparison today to the $500 million San Diego FC\u2019s owners paid for the most recent expansion team.\n\nAnd now, after just three seasons of play, Beckham\u2019s club signed the new greatest player to ever grace MLS. What did George Lucas say? \u201cIt\u2019s like poetry. They rhyme.\u201d\n\nNext games (there\u2019s only one team left): LAFC: Sunday, Nov. 5 vs. Vancouver Whitecaps (away)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

This weekend, she\u2019ll be hosting her first tournament, serving as event director for Los Angeles Hotwheels 6th Annual Wheelchair Basketball Tournament. Being on the sidelines for years, Margie knew she wanted to contribute to the wheelchair basketball community in the best way she could as an able-bodied person. Hosting this tournament, one of Margie\u2019s goals is to bring more awareness to adaptive sports.\n\n\u201cI love this community. That\u2019s been my focus. I want more people to know about this and more people to come to tournaments,\u201d she said.\n\nMargie is not the only member of her family that is involved with wheelchair basketball. Max Amenero, her younger brother, now coaches with his father, also named Max Amenero, making L.A. Hotwheels a family affair. Max joined his father as a coach in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt was something really organic where I wanted to attend practices at a young age,\u201d he said.\n\nMargie and her brother gained their love and passion for wheelchair basketball through their dad. At seven months old, their father, who was born in Peru, contracted Polio, a virus that can lead to nerve damage, paralysis, and in extreme cases, death. For many years after contracting the virus, he used crutches to help support him getting around. When he was 16 years old, the elder Max moved from Peru to Los Angeles. His experience of moving to the U.S. introduced him to new opportunities and greater accessibility in his daily activities.\n\n\u201cLiving for a handicap is a lot better here than Peru in many many factors,\u201d he said. \u201cSidewalks, ramps, flexibility, everything.\u201d\n\nHe reflected on some of the challenges at his first high school in Los Angeles: \u201cIt was kind of hard for me to walk from one classroom to another or to go up to the second floor to look for a classroom,\u201d he said. \u201c[My first high school] recommended me to a school in Los Angeles for handicap students.\u201d\n\nHis new school led him to discover wheelchair basketball. \u201cWhen I came here from Peru, I didn\u2019t know anything about it. I wasn\u2019t even using a wheelchair,\u201d he said.\n\nNot only did this new school introduce him to using a wheelchair, but it also exposed him to the sport of wheelchair basketball, and he has been playing ever since. Many of his teammates on the L.A. Hotwheels met during high school, but there is an interesting dynamic as he serves as both a teammate and coach.\n\n\u201cMost of these players on my team are my friends. I have known them for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get too tough on them, and then you can\u2019t be too weak.\u201d\n\nHis methods have proved to be successful, as the L.A. Hotwheels have made their way to the championship tournament for the past six years, coming in second place last year. In order to make the championship tournament, teams must play in at least 10 games throughout the season, which spans from September through April.\n\nFor the elder Max, wheelchair basketball is about empowerment. \u201cYou meet new friends during new challenges. And that\u2019s what wheelchair basketball is about,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting people to be happy to build their lives.\u201d\n\nHis son, the younger Max, added that not everyone who plays got here the same way. \u201cOn our team, we\u2019ve been affected by anything from motorcycle accidents, to gunshot wounds, to medical conditions such as polio.\u201d\n\nThe L.A. Hotwheels compete under the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA). The NWBA is a multi-tiered system and has teams for children, college students, adults and veterans. Margie emphasized the importance of the NWBA and what it does for athletes in wheelchairs.\n\n\u201cWheelchair basketball focuses a lot on the community. It is a really good way for players to get physical therapy and even mental therapy,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the seven-month-long season, the L.A. Hotwheels will travel around the country to various tournaments to build community, comradery, compete and get a bid to Nationals. At this weekend\u2019s tournament in Cudahy, Margie is expecting eight teams from across the country to compete, including the Dallas Mavericks, the University of Arizona and the Golden State Road Warriors.\n\nYou can keep up to date with the L.A. Hotwheels and their tournament this weekend through their Instagram and Facebook.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Michel Euler)\n\nBy Mark Armendariz-Gonzales November 02, 2023 at 4:34 pm PDT\n\nIf winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup was the defining moment of Lionel Messi\u2019s astonishing career, then securing his eighth Ballon d\u2019Or was the cherry on top. To nobody\u2019s surprise, the Argentine captain was declared the 2023 best male football player by the French news magazine \u201cFrance Football.\u201d Messi received more votes than Norwegian striker Erling Haaland and French forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 adding another golden ball to his already luxurious trophy cabinet.\n\nIn the history of the Ballon d\u2019Or, there is a \u201cbefore Messi\u201d period and an \u201cafter Messi\u201d period. Before Messi, the most the award had been given to a single player was three times. This record was held by Dutch forwards Johan Cruyff and Marco Van Basten and French midfielder Michel Platini. After winning his first golden ball in 2009, Messi put an end to this record with ease as he would have a historic run winning the next three awards.\n\nAt just 25, Messi had already become the award\u2019s most victorious recipient. For the next decade, Messi would share the Ballon d\u2019Or stage with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as the award would mainly go back and forth between the two soccer superstars. Ronaldo currently sits in second place for most golden balls with five of them. Messi added three more golden balls to his resume in 2015, 2019 and 2021. With a total of eight golden balls now, Messi not only has more than every player, but he has more than any country passing Portugal, Netherlands, France, and Germany who all have seven awards each.\n\nAlthough Messi stole the headlines, there were many other awards given during the ceremony in France. Messi\u2019s Argentina teammate Emiliano Mart\u00ednez was awarded goalkeeper of the year for his heroics during the World Cup, as he helped his country win two penalty shootouts and made a crucial save in the dying minutes of the final. English midfielder Jude Bellingham was awarded the Best Young Player award as he has been unstoppable as of late and shows clear signs of being in the running for a future Ballon d\u2019Or. Haaland was given the award for top striker in Europe after having an amazing season winning the treble and breaking the Premier League record for most goals in a season with 36. Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmat\u00ed was awarded 2023 best female football player. Bonmat\u00ed won the Champions League with FC Barcelona Femen\u00edl and helped Spain achieve their first-ever women\u2019s World Cup title. Bonmat\u00ed became the third Spanish player to win the award after her club and country teammate Alexia Putellas won the past two.\n\nWhen winning an award of this caliber, along with the admiration comes the controversy. Messi was the clear favorite for the award this year, but many were up in arms about Haaland not taking the Ballon d\u2019Or. Although Haaland did have a record-breaking season and did secure a treble with Manchester City, the World Cup is still the most prestigious title in soccer. Haaland was not able to keep his country qualified in the tournament, while Messi is one of the sole reasons Argentina won the 2022 tournament. Throughout seven matches, Messi showed up time and time again in the big moments for Argentina, providing three assists and scoring seven goals. Messi scored three goals and provided an assist during the semis and final of the World Cup, while Haaland was a ghost scoring no goals and providing no assists during the two-leg semifinal and final of the Champions League. We also have to keep in mind that Haaland is currently playing in the prime of his career at the age of 23, while Messi is in the twilight of his career at the age of 36. What Messi is accomplishing at this age is incredible and probably will never be done by another footballer.\n\nPep Guardiola, former coach of Messi and current coach of Haaland, probably said it best when speaking to the press on who should win the award this year. \u201cAlways I said the Ballon d\u2019Or should be in two sections; one for Messi, then after another one so Haaland should win. The worst season for Messi is the best for the rest of the players,\u201d said Guardiola.\n\nMessi took the stage to receive his eighth Golden Ball and gave his acceptance speech, it was a very bittersweet moment because it could be the last time he would ever step foot on that stage to receive this award. At his age and especially playing outside of Europe now, it will be very difficult for Messi ever to win another Golden Ball. Although he may never win another Ballon d\u2019Or, Messi is very likely to win an even more prestigious award. The Super Ballon d\u2019Or is an award also given by \u201cFrance Football,\u201d and has only been given once to forward Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano back in 1989. The award is given to the best player of the previous three decades in football, and with 2030 right around the corner, it is very likely Messi will become the award\u2019s second-ever recipient. With 44 titles under his belt, including four UEFA Champions Leagues, one Copa America, one FIFA World Cup, and now a record total of eight golden balls, Messi has truly completed the sport.\n\n\u201cUndisputed the greatest of all time,\u201d said Mynor Guzman, secretary of FC Barcelona supporter\u2019s club. \u201cThere is no discussion after winning a World Cup and an eighth Ballon d\u2019Or. We are talking about a unicorn here.\u201d\n```"}

Little Amal is a 12-foot puppet that represents a 10-year-old Syrian refugee. According to Amal\u2019s team, her name means \u201chope\u201d in Arabic, and they imagine that she is from a small village close to Aleppo, Syria. She walks around the world searching for acceptance, her parents and a new home.\n\nAmal\u2019s website explains that the walk with Amal is a celebration of art and shared humanity that unites communities, refocuses attention on the urgent needs of refugees and highlights the rich cultures and contributions immigrants bring with them. Amal walks for the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people of all ages roaming the world in search of safety.\n\nBruna D\u2019Avila, the creative producer of the Walk with Amal project, explained the project\u2019s significance to her as an immigrant. \u201cI have been very lucky to have been able to come to this country through education and through other resources and jobs and all of that,\u201d said D\u2019Avila. \u201cTo see other sides where people are fleeing from war, fleeing from danger, to find a better life in the United States; it\u2019s something that was really important for me because not everyone has the privilege to be able to find all the right steps to go through immigration like I did.\u201d\n\nAmal\u2019s team said that she was designed and built by the Handspring Puppet Company of South Africa, creators of the award-winning puppets for the hit show \u201cWar Horse.\u201d They said Amal is inspired by a character in Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson\u2019s play \u201cThe Jungle,\u201d a story about a refugee camp in Calais, France.\n\nThe project started back in 2021 when she crossed the border of Syria and Turkey. She journeyed through cities, towns and villages across Turkey, Greece, Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the UK in 2021, and Ukraine, Poland and the Netherlands in 2022. According to her team, Amal\u2019s journey is far from over and her long path is one many refugees continue to tread everyday.\n\nFor her United States tour, Little Amal started in New York and will end in San Diego, completing a quest consisting of 45 cities spanning 6,000 miles, and over 120 events spreading awareness of unaccompanied refugee children. She participated in events with cultural, political, spiritual and other leaders, as well as artists and immigrant groups, among others.\n\n\u201cI think that what this project does really well is decentralize where art usually is, which is why we have our very high cadence of three events a day in all these cities,\u201d D\u2019Avila said. \u201cAnd with that, we\u2019re able to really bring art to the community and not ask the community to come to us.\u201d\n\nAmal is visiting many places that have served as arrival posts for generations of immigrants, and others that have attracted migrants. D\u2019Avila explained that L.A\u2019s high population of migrants and people from all over the world points to their goal to connect with those communities and to spread awareness and hope.\n\n\u201cI always say that if people were as welcoming to their neighbors as they are to Amal, the world would be a much better place. I really wish everyone was welcomed the way that we\u2019ve been welcomed in these cities, and that\u2019s the feeling we want to pass along,\u201d D\u2019Avila said.\n\nLittle Amal gathers crowds from near and from afar, with her message of connecting people with diverse backgrounds. \u201cI think it means a lot to the community,\u201d said Heather Davis, an event attendee. \u201cI came all the way out from the high desert just to see this demonstration.\u201d\n\nDavis emphasized the impact Little Amal has. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of like a journey of grief and healing, but I didn\u2019t realize how real it was until I saw her right now.\u201d\n\nAmal Walks Across America raises money for kids through the Amal Fund. They have a partnership with Choose Love, an organization involved with refugee awareness, such as legal advice, fundraising and supplies distribution.\n\nLittle Amal is far from finishing her global tour. Her next stop is San Diego, where she will cross the border into Mexico for another seven cities: Tijuana, Monterrey, Mexico City, Tapachula, Oaxaca, Guadalajara, and Zapap\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cA lot of the crises that are happening [in] the U.S. on the border here are also happening in Mexico,\u201d D\u2019Avila said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re there to explore, welcome, shine light, and hope there as well.\u201d\n\nIf you wish to follow Amal\u2019s adventure, her story will be shared across her social media platforms on Instagram, Tiktok, and her website.\n```"}

But why?\n\nJames Harden gets the ultimate reward for quitting on his third team in three years.\n\nJames Harden (13) tries to drive past Philadelphia 76ers' Ben Simmons (25) during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Saturday, Feb. 6, 2021, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan November 02, 2023 at 1:19 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Third time must be the charm, right? James Harden, the six-time All-NBA First Team-er and 10-time All-Star, quit on his third team in three years to force a trade to the Los Angeles Clippers, a historically underachieving and unlucky franchise desperate for a Finals appearance. Sure, Harden has one of the ten most impressive resumes of any active player in the league. But what makes General Manager Trent Redden \u2014 and really, team owner Steve Ballmer \u2014 think that a 34-year-old Harden puts this squad over the edge? It\u2019s not like the Clippers had a young core before this trade. The team\u2019s three most important players pre-trade \u2014 Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Russell Westbrook \u2014 are all 32 or older.\n\nWe shan\u2019t let our eyes deceive us. Harden has already shown us the kind of player he is, regardless of situation. As a team\u2019s primary star, Harden posts exceptional regular season numbers. Case in point, his 2017-18 and 2018-29 seasons in Houston, when he won the MVP award for the former and then improved his points per game average from 30.4 to 36.1 in the latter. But in Houston, everything ran through Harden \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t enough. He never played in the Finals as a Rocket. His 2018 team took the Warriors to Game 7 of the conference finals, but Harden earned a (deserved) reputation for coming up short in knockout games. In that Game 7, Harden posted 32 points but was horribly inefficient, shooting just 41.4% from the field and a putrid 15.4% from three on 13 attempts with five turnovers, too.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget what happened last season in Philadelphia, either. The Sixers had the Boston Celtics dead to rights in the second round. Up 3-2 in the series, the Sixers went back to the Wells Fargo Center with a chance to put the series to bed and posted a measly 86 points. Harden shot 4-16 in that game, missing all of his six threes, and again had five turnovers. And yes, turnovers are going to happen when you have the ball as much as Harden, but when your average field goal percentage is 36.3% in Game 7s, a 1.6 assist-to-turnover ratio is nothing to write home about.\n\nSo, let\u2019s return to the original question: why would the Clippers make a move for Harden, sacrificing one of the team\u2019s last first-round picks for the next five years in the process? The only reasonable answer is Steve Ballmer\u2019s desperation. Desperation and disregard. Desperation for a championship and desperation to put butts in seats when the team\u2019s new stadium opens for the 2024-25 season. And a disregard for proper team-building and for the new second-apron salary cap restrictions. Ballmer is the NBA\u2019s richest owner, and has shown a willingness to spend whenever he thinks it\u2019ll help the team. Fans should applaud that mentality \u2014 there\u2019s nothing worse for fans than stingy team owners with net worths in the billions that cry poverty when asked about their refusal to upgrade.\n\nBut by acquiring Harden, Ballmer is missing the forest for the trees. The Clippers have long been the Lakers\u2019 little brother in Los Angeles. The team doesn\u2019t have as fervent a fanbase or anything close to the same history of success. If Ballmer wants to build a team that the city can get behind, he has to focus on building a team that can dominate the NBA \u2014 and more importantly, the Lakers \u2014 for the long term. You know the easiest way to gain fans? By winning consistently for a long time. Continuing to mortgage the future for two, maybe three seasons of Harden does not set the team up for long-term success.\n\nEven if the Clippers advance to the second round or the conference final and sign Harden to an extension, what\u2019s stopping him from throwing another temper tantrum in two seasons? Sure, for the remainder of the season, Harden fills a need for the Clippers. He will immediately become the team\u2019s primary ball-handler and probably allow Leonard and George to play fewer minutes per night in this new anti-load management era. As a regular-season primary guard, Harden still has value to offer. He averaged 10.7 assists per game last season in Philadelphia and shot a respectable 38.5 percent from deep on 7.2 attempts per game. His playmaking ability certainly helped Joel Embiid win the 2022-23 MVP award.\n\nHarden\u2019s ball dominance makes Westbrook slightly redundant, but you trust head Coach Ty Lue to figure out how to stagger those minutes effectively. But the Clippers\u2019 ultimate goal is winning championships and it\u2019s hard to see how Harden advances that goal. He gives up on teams as easily as any star in the league. He has routinely failed in clutch playoff situations. If the Clippers thought they needed another guard, why not wait to see if you can acquire Tyus Jones at the trade deadline? If they needed another floor-spacing shooter, why not snag Joe Harris on an expiring contract? Except, we already know why. It\u2019s because those moves aren\u2019t sexy. You can\u2019t open a stadium with Tyus Jones.\n\nIn five years, the Clippers won\u2019t cry about what they lost in this trade. Robert Covington, Nic Batum, Marcus Morris and KJ Martin are all role players, three of whom were past their primes anyway. In the wins and losses calculus of the 2023-24 season, the Clippers probably gained some regular season wins. Big whoop. Make no mistake: this trade doesn\u2019t put the Clippers over the line for a championship. Even worse, it sets them up for an implosion of epic proportions in the next 12-24 months. If the Harden-in-Los-Angeles experience returns anything less than the best outcome, Ballmer might have an even worse attendance problem at the Intuit Dome than he\u2019s trying to prevent.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Jensen Tan November 02, 2023 at 1:06 pm PDT\n\nAfter devastating years of college football, especially USC\u2019s 4-8 season in 2021, despair lingered among many Trojan fans who packed the Coliseum. However, that changed when Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley announced that they would join the USC Trojans ahead of the 2022 season. Hope in the football program returned to USC, and the thought of the Trojans reaching national prominence became more realistic. The return to the Pete Carroll glory days seemed to be right around the corner so where did it all go wrong?\n\nWell, USC started off strong in 2022, after finishing the regular season 11-1, with only a defeat to the Utah Utes. The Trojans were ranked as high as No. 4 in the AP Top 25 poll. They then faced the Utes again in the Pac-12 Championship game, ultimately falling short 47-24 and failing to receive a spot in the College Football Playoff. Then-sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams shined and proved that he was a worthy quarterback as he totaled 4,537 passing yards and 52 total touchdowns on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy.\n\nDespite this newfound success in Trojan football, there were obvious improvements needed in the defense if the Trojans had any chance in the 2023 season. This season, the Trojans looked the same, as they blew out teams such as San Jose State, Nevada and Stanford early on. After that, the Trojans needed to be more consistent. In its next three games, USC beat Arizona State 42-28, Colorado 48-41 and Arizona 43-41. That led to its first loss against Notre Dame 48-20, another against Utah 34-32, and barely scraping by against the Cal Golden Bears 50-49.\n\nWilliams is shining once again and continues to produce the numbers that the Trojans expected him to; however, their unprepared defense means winning by close margins or losing entirely. Therefore, our expectations that the Riley era would bring USC football back to its roots: winning Pac-12 Championships, national championships and Rose Bowls may need to be reevaluated.\n\nWhile Riley has a solid quarterback in Williams, the defense needs profound changes and adjustments if the Trojans ever have a chance at heading to the Playoff. Currently, Williams has 2,646 yards, 25 passing touchdowns and nine rushing touchdowns. However, the defense finished 93rd in scoring defense (29.2 points) and 124th in yards per play allowed (6.53) last season. This season, USC allows 32.8 points per game (113th) and 5.90 yards per play (95th).\n\nThe Trojans will need significant changes in their defensive strategy to finish the rest of the season, and for next season, they need to meet the expectations that fans had when Riley took over the program. The Trojans\u2019 matchup against the 8-0 Washington looks more frightening after the last few games USC has played. If USC doesn\u2019t make major changes, Washington may cause a severe blow to the Trojans\u2019 season.\n\nThe expectations of the Riley and Williams era that we all thought didn\u2019t seem unreachable. Perhaps the era needs more time to adapt to bring USC back to a championship and less pressure on the quarterback so that the Trojans can flourish in the next game and in the future.\n```"}

If a teen or adult collapses in a non-hospital setting, the procedure can be used to keep the heartbeat stable before calling 9-1-1.\n\n\u201cA lot of times when someone is injured, they go down and they need compressions, and people are afraid to do it,\u201d said Savannah Gore, the USC Occupational Health & Injury Prevention Safety Specialist. \u201cSo we\u2019re just trying to make people a little bit more aware of what they can do, and an easier way to do it, to help save a loved one.\u201d\n\nUSC students and staff members from both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses, including Gore, and across Los Angeles, are leading training initiatives as a part of LADPH\u2019s \u201cHeart Heroes\u201d campaign.

County residents trained by Heart Heroes partners so far, Ho said the campaign has served as a means of \u201cgetting members of the community to learn about different ways that they can take care of themselves and also their friends, neighbors and community members.\u201d\n\n\u201cLearning more about where it\u2019s available in your community, and participating when your schedule permits, [is] always a good thing,\u201d Ho said. \u201cYou have this skill, you have it for life.\u201d\n\nTo sign up to be a CPR trainer, and to get involved with the Heart Heroes campaign, visit USC\u2019s website.

Photo by Veronica Sierra\n\nBy Katherine Contreras Hernandez\nNovember 02, 2023 at 12:24 pm PDT\n\nIn the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year, La Casa was temporarily relocated to the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs as their original spot was undergoing an expansion. Students have eagerly been awaiting to utilize the new space and the time has come.\n\n\u201cThe old La CASA area was very small, it could get really hot and a lot of times students would come in and there weren\u2019t enough seats for the students,\u201d Gabriella Marquez, cultural ambassador for La CASA, said. \u201cNow they can feel they\u2019re important, we have more places for students to sit, a new conference room and now students are even here at 8 a.m. when we open.\u201d\n\nThe space located on the fourth floor in the Student Union building is also designed to be accessible to all Latine students, providing many resources. \u201cWe have two Latinx-identified counselors who meet with students Monday through Thursday, [students] can utilize the kitchenette, we have nap pods in here as well. And we also have a dedicated staff member who is here to answer any questions that they have,\u201d says Assistant Vice Provost Naddia Palacios.\n\nEven before it\u2019s reopening, students were already taking advantage of La Casa\u2019s resources, \u201cI actually recently went to La Casa to go pick up some Blue Books since midterms have been coming up and buying them can add up...so I\u2019m grateful that they have that available to me,\u201d says Lidia Hernandez, a first-year at USC.\n\nThe sheer existence of La Casa has been eagerly appreciated, and its reopening is key in making Latine students feel at home at USC. \u201cIt\u2019s comforting to know that there\u2019s a designated space for people like me who have similar experiences,\u201d Emily Rodriguez said. \u201cHaving a space where there\u2019s the ability to have a community, especially amongst Latine students at a PWI is extremely important.\u201d\n\nThis is a sentiment spanning grades, as second-year Kimberly Reyes said, \u201cI grew up in South Central, so just entering USC, even though it\u2019s in South LA, it\u2019s just really different and it\u2019s sometimes hard to find someone you relate to so I feel like having a space like La Casa is something I really need and it will help me feel comfortable in this environment.\u201d\n\nStudents can look forward to upcoming events like La Hermandad, which is a group that aims to provide Latine men with a space to discuss their experiences as men of color on November 7th. These events are places where we can further connect and form further solidarity with each other. \u201c[I\u2019m] also [excited to meet] other Hispanics here on campus, because I feel like unless I\u2019m looking I won\u2019t find them,\u201d Lidia Hernandez said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m excited for about La Casa is that I know I\u2019ll find them when I head to the space.\u201d\n\nFor more information on La CASA, visit their website.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel November 02, 2023 at 7:49 am PDT\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d is a column by Kyle Frankel about fantasy football. There really never is a boring week in the NFL. However, there are absolutely boring games, and we got treated to one for the ages this past Sunday. Before I say this, understand that as a Jets fan, this is not an accolade I take lightly. I\u2019ve seen more terrible football games than anyone should have to in their lifetime. The Jets-Giants game this past weekend might have been the worst I\u2019ve ever seen. The Jets walked away from the battle of New York with a 13-10 overtime victory, but don\u2019t let that fool you. Punters Jamie Gillan of the Giants and Thomas Morstead of the Jets combined for 24 punts, which is the most in an NFL game since 2003! I think that just about tells you all you need to know.\n\nEarly game injuries left the Jets with a makeshift offensive line and the Giants with third-string rookie quarterback Tommy DeVito thrusted into his first NFL action. The catch is his head coach literally wouldn\u2019t let him throw the ball. DeVito finished the game 2-for-7 for -1 yards \u2014 a truly one of a kind box score. Now the end was definitely a roller coaster. The Giants missed a late field goal in an attempt to take a six-point lead and Zach Wilson, shortly after taking sacks that almost cost his team the game, led a 24-second, 58-yard drive with no timeouts. As time expired, Jets kicker Greg Zuerlein drained the game-tying field goal, and he would later do the same to seal a walk-off win in overtime.\n\nNow that I was finally able to get my thoughts out on that brutal victory, let\u2019s get into the good stuff. Be my McBride If you weren\u2019t expecting to see Cardinals Trey McBride in this column, then you simply didn\u2019t pay attention to the slate this weekend. The second-year tight end has been trending in the right direction the last few weeks with his targets steadily increasing, and he finally broke out on Sunday. McBride set career highs in targets (14), catches (10) and yards (95), with a touchdown for good measure. This all added up to 25.5 PPR fantasy points, making him the highest-scoring TE of the week. While this was an outlier on the season, his increased role in the offense over his last few games and performance against the Ravens this past Sunday indicate that he should continue to see his fair share of opportunities. Further, the deadline deal sending quarterback Josh Dobbs to Minnesota points to starter Kyler Murray returning from injury in the next week or two, which should make this offense significantly better. If you don\u2019t have a steady starter every week for your tight end position, McBride is a great guy to take a chance on filling that role. He\u2019s also widely available, only being rostered in 7.9% of ESPN leagues prior to waiver claims going through.\n\nLook to Commanders for a QB reinforcement Who else, just like McBride, balled out in a loss in Week 8? None other than Washington\u2019s sophomore signal caller: Sam Howell. The Commanders fell to the Eagles 31-24, which is their second time losing to the division rival in a one-score game this season. Despite not getting the win, Howell was stellar. The quarterback completed 75% of his passes for just shy of 400 yards and four touchdowns while only tossing one interception. This all summed up to 30.98 PPR points, the highest score from a quarterback this week. It was his best game all season, but Howell\u2019s been a consistent producer throughout the year, notching three outings of over 20 points and ranking as the eighth-best QB in total points in standard PPR formats. One huge improvement on Sunday was his ability to limit sacks. They have plagued him this season, as he\u2019s well on pace to break the single-season record for sacks taken by a quarterback. However, against the Eagles on Sunday, Howell only got taken down behind the line of scrimmage once, the lowest for a game in his career. With guys like Kirk Cousins sidelined, he\u2019s the perfect replacement if you find yourself in a QB predicament. Howell is only rostered in 30.4% of ESPN leagues at the time of writing.\n\nThat\u2019s about all for this week. It\u2019s slim pickings on the waiver wire, but I will leave you with one final thought. Don\u2019t be afraid to buy low on guys out with injuries. If your team is in a good spot and you want to take some chances, feel out the owners for De\u2019Von Achane and Justin Jefferson in your league. Obviously, you\u2019ll still have to give up quite a haul for players of this caliber, but it\u2019s probably your only opportunity to snag them at a discounted cost. \u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

There were over 20 ofrendas that paid homage to different people and pets who have passed. Reporter Madison Hogue tells us about the sights and scenes of today\u2019s celebration of life.\n\nOne of the 20 ofrendas at the Gloria Molina Grand Park Dia de los Muertos exhibit. (Photo by Cam Kauffman)\n\nBy Madison Hogue November 01, 2023 at 7:47 pm PDT\n\nWalking up to the memorials on the gravel path of the park one is immediately greeted with the sound of Spanish music on the speakers and the fountain roaring. All around there are altars decorated in colorful flags with flowers, photographs, and candles. This is the 12th annual Dia de Los Muertos at the Gloria Molina Grand Park. The alters represent the belief in Mexican culture that loved ones who have passed come back to life on this one day. One special alter is highlighting the victims of the Maui Fire and Monterey Park shooting.\n\nWhile the traditions of the day differ in Mexico, it is important to see Los Angeles celebrating the culture today, as said by Fidelina Romero. Fidelina Romero: \u201cIn Mexico, they go to the cemeteries that clean the graveyards and they take music. So it\u2019s different.\u201d Romero is a Spanish teacher at Fairfax High School. She brought around 25 students from the Latino Student Union to the park today. Fidelina Romero: \u201cWe wanted to expose the students to the culture because not a lot of them know about this place and Olvera Street, and especially during the celebration, we wanted them to see and learn a little bit more about it.\u201d\n\nThe park was filled with visitors admiring the alters. Crista Campos is the marketing manager for park. Crista Campos: \u201cI\u2019m actually from Oaxaca, and that\u2019s kind of where I grew up on this. Because I\u2019m not able to go back home right now, it\u2019s that I get to see a little bit here and it\u2019s just a nice little piece of home to be to be here at the park.\u201d\n\nWhile on a break from jury duty, Jennifer Patton who is the CEO of Inspire Change Collective is examining the ofrendas by soaking in the beauty of the colors and the photos of passed loved ones on display. Jennifer Patton: \u201cI heard this phrase, it\u2019s like it\u2019s the love that you didn\u2019t get to share when they were here. So I think that there\u2019s a really beautiful aspect of people getting to express that love, even if they\u2019re not here physically because you have that sense of them being here spiritually.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Fox is a tourist from Seattle who stumbled upon the alters today, but it ended up being exactly what she needed. For Elizabeth who lost her father and brother this past year, this was a great way for her to start the day and celebrate the lives of her family members. Elizabeth Fox: \u201cVisiting the altars and hopefully be there for the procession tonight. And just in thoughts and prayers and. You know, just celebrating with other people. There are people that have passed away and just a special day of remembrance.\u201d\n\nThe Dia de Los Muertos alters will be open for the last day tomorrow from 9am to 9pm with a special showing of the 1960 Mexican film, Macario.

And for candidates running for President, image matters more than ever. The average U.S. president is about two inches taller than the average American man who is 5\u20329\u2032'. So, do voters like tall presidents? One study found... it definitely does. Voters see tall politicians as better suited for leadership because they\u2019re seen as physically imposing, according to that study, published by Social Science Quarterly. Barack Obama is 6\u20322\u2032\u2032 and Donald Trump 6\u20323\u2032\u2032, while President Joe Biden is 6 feet tall.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of speculations over what kind of shoes the Florida Governor wears. A hashtag \u201cbootgate\u201d took social media by storm as posts mocking DeSantis have been racking up millions of views. Rumor has it that DeSantis has adopted a wardrobe trick to juice his stats. He is known for wearing black cowboy boots. Thanks to this trick, DeSantis has allegedly added over two inches to his height.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, only six presidential candidates who were shorter than their opponents won their elections between 1916 and 2012. Here is Kamy Akhavan, Executive Director of USC Center for the Political Future. Kamy Akhavan, Executive Director of USC Center for the Political Future: \u201cIt is true that, at least during the age of television, taller candidates tended to do better than shorter candidates. That is a fact.\u201d\n\nDeSantis has been vigorously denying the rumors. But shoe experts say that they believe he is wearing height-boosting insoles to pump himself up against a potential Donald Trump primary frontrunner. Zephan Parker, a bootmaker said in an interview for Politico that he has made height-increasing cowboy boots for a number of politicians, including DeSantis.\n\nStature, height and body language are soft weapons that politicians use to dominate their opponents during debates. Luke Lamontour, who is a Junior majoring in French, says voters might not think that height and appearance matter that much, but they do. Luke Lamontour:\u201d I think that appearance plays a lot in personal bias and in what we support and what we like.\u201d\n\nBut physical features are not everything as Akhavan says. Kamy Akhavan: \u201cThe perception of tallness is more in the mythology categories than in the reality category. But correlation is not causation, and many factors will determine a candidate success and people who are not 6 feet and above have wielded tremendous global power.\u201d\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Thomas Legrand.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert).\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier November 01, 2023 at 6:56 pm PDT\n\nAfter losing 3-2 against Colorado and picking up a 3-1 victory over Utah last weekend, the USC women\u2019s volleyball team (14-8, 8-4 Pac-12) returns home to Galen Center for the weekend. The first matchup will be against Arizona on Friday at 7 p.m., followed by Arizona State on Sunday at 2 p.m.\n\nHead coach Brad Keller knows that the physicality and discipline of the two schools will make for a competitive weekend. \u201cI think they are who they are. One team is super physical, one team is super disciplined in their systems and what they do,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThat makes a lot of training, a lot of preparation for this week to try to get in tune with both of those teams.\u201d\n\nFollowing the retirement of Arizona head coach Dave Rubio, the Wildcats promoted Charita \u201cRita\u201d Stubbs to take his place. Despite having talented players at all positions, Arizona is in last place in the Pac-12, going 6-17 overall and with a 1-11 record in conference play.\n\nEven with Arizona\u2019s record, Keller knows that USC needs to be ready for when the Wildcats come to town. \u201cI think Rita\u2019s the spark plug of the program. I think she\u2019s gonna do great things there at Arizona. I think that she\u2019s just the right person for that job,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI don\u2019t put a whole lot of stake into what she\u2019s gonna be doing or what that is, because we gotta take care of things on our side.\u201d\n\nFriday night will be former USC outside hitter Jordan Wilson\u2019s first time back at Galen Center since transferring to Arizona in June. Wilson played the 2022 season with the Trojans. The sophomore had 20 kills against USC when the teams met in Tucson on October 8, when USC walked away with a 3-2 victory.\n\n\u201cI feel like Jordan\u2019s Jordan, she\u2019s really good, she\u2019ll be ready to play. She\u2019s a baller, and she\u2019s gonna go off for more kills, so you just have to be ready for the whole team,\u201d Keller said.\n\nIn addition to Wilson, former USC associate head coach JJ Van Niel will also return to Galen Center on Sunday for the first time since accepting the head coaching position at Arizona State last December. Under Van Niel, the Sun Devils are currently ranked 15th in this week\u2019s AVCA rankings after sweeping then-No. 3 Stanford at home last Sunday to improve to 21-3 on the season. ASU currently holds a 9-3 conference record and defeated USC 3-2 in Tempe on October 6.\n\n\u201cI think that JJ\u2019s done an amazing job at Arizona State, obviously, with a big pin in [senior opposite hitter Marta] Levinska and running a lot of very super fast systems and they\u2019re very good at the serve-pass game,\u201d Keller said.\n\nDespite the familiar faces returning to Los Angeles this weekend, junior setter Mia Tuaniga is more focused on getting two wins with her teammates this weekend and building a strong resume in the final stretch of the season. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. If you\u2019re not wearing an SC jersey right now, then I\u2019m not paying attention to you,\u201d Tuaniga said. \u201cMuch love to both of them, but when it comes to game time, if you\u2019re not wearing an SC jersey, I\u2019m not looking at you.\u201d\n\nDespite the stiff competition that is coming to town, USC is 8-0 on its home court this season. Playing at Galen Center helped the Trojans in some of their more difficult matches this season, most notably in the five-set reverse sweep upset over then-No. 4 Washington State.\n\n\u201cI just think home court matters a lot because you get an extra day. ... It\u2019s local,\u201d Keller said. \u201cLocal food, local bed, local pillow. It\u2019s home-cooking as we say, and I think that matters when you\u2019re trying to get on the road or wherever it is, it\u2019s just a little more familiar. It\u2019s not always been the case for us, but this year it has been, so I will double down on that, and hopefully we can get two more here this weekend.\u201d\n\nTuaniga also acknowledged the value of having USC fans supporting the Trojans at Galen Center this season. \u201cI think our fans have been holding it down for us, being home, I think it means a lot. Especially, you know, we\u2019ve been traveling for a little bit, so to come back and to play for L.A., to play for our program, here at home, means a lot.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans look to remain perfect at home this weekend when the Wildcats and Sun Devils make their final visit to L.A. as members of the Pac-12.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Viralyft)\n\nBy Selina Kausar November 01, 2023 at 5:44 pm PDT\n\nA small British company is taking on one of the largest tech giants in the world. On Monday, Threads Software Limited, which has owned the \u201cThreads\u201d trademark for more than a decade, threatened further legal action if Meta doesn\u2019t stop using the name within the next 30 days.\n\n\u201cTaking on a U.S. $150 billion company is not an easy decision for us to make. Our business now faces a serious threat from one of the largest technology companies in the world,\u201d the managing director of Threads Software, John Yardley, said in an official press release. \u201cWe recognize that this is a classic \u2018David and Goliath\u2019 battle with Meta. And whilst they may think they can use whatever name they want, that does not give them the right to use the Threads brand name,\u201d Yardley said.\n\nThreads Software Ltd., based in Surbiton, England, uses AI to help businesses streamline their communications. It offers an \u201cintelligent message hub\u201d solution for phone calls, emails and other messages.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, we have made a large investment in the Threads name and we did not want to potentially have to write-off this investment simply because Meta happened to like the name we had already coined for a messaging service,\u201d the company wrote on their website.\n\nIn the press release, they also stated that lawyers acting on behalf of Meta made four offers from April 2023 to purchase the \u201cthreads.app\u201d domain. Threads Software declined all offers, making it clear that the domain was not for sale.\n\nThen, in July, Meta\u2019s Threads platform was officially announced, and at the same time Threads Software also found their Facebook account shut down.\n\nAccording to Michael Overing, a professor at USC Annenberg and an expert in digital law, Threads Software may also have frustrations and no longer being able to access the Facebook platform.\n\nMeta\u2019s Threads was launched as a competitor to X, formerly known as Twitter. Exclusively available to current Instagram users, Threads allows people to share their thoughts through text posts, images and videos.\n\nThreads immediately launched in 100 countries but is still not available in Europe as it awaits regulatory clearance from the European Commission over its data collection policies.\n\nWhile Threads initially amassed over 30 million users on its launch day, making it the fastest-growing platform in history, its user base had fallen by over 80% in August.\n\n\u201cI used it for the first 30 days then moved on,\u201d Joseph Rudd, a British content writer for a social media agency, said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many big creators or influencers to follow on there. Engagement is relatively low... and there aren\u2019t any kind of creator analytics.\u201d\n\nAlongside a dwindling customer base, Threads has also faced the wrath of various competitors over the last few months. Elon Musk challenged Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight over claims Zuckerberg poached former X employees to help him build a \u201cTwitter clone.\u201d Musk threatened to sue Meta for stealing trade secrets, but neither the cage fight nor lawsuit materialized.\n\nThreads Software\u2019s press release offers an inside look at how these types of negotiations usually take place. Notably, they were not the first to be approached by Meta, either.\n\nAt the time of Threads\u2019 launch, a women\u2019s fashion brand called American Threads held the @Threads Instagram handle, forcing Meta to use @threadsapp instead. But a month later, the retailer\u2019s Instagram account changed handles to @Americanthreads with no explanation, giving Meta full control over the @threads handle.\n\nThis is similar to how Meta gained control of the @Meta Instagram handle last year, too. That username was first used by a motorcycle magazine that now goes by the name Vahna. The magazine has never commented directly about how their username switch came to be but wrote in a now-deleted blog post that, \u201cWith the flip of a switch, our identity was suddenly watered down, and we watched our name circle the drain and wash away with something we had no control over.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Threads Software will win this case is difficult to ascertain, said Overing. \u201cWhen it comes to trademark, it\u2019s really about whether the consumer has been misled, and that\u2019s a hard thing to prove. They\u2019d have to find a way to show that people were honestly trying to access the British Threads but were directed to the Meta app instead. In line with the Trademarks Act of 1994, if two products exist in the same category and people are confused about who created it, then infringement could be found in favor of the British company.\u201d\n\nWhether Meta would have to change their name in not only the U.K. but the U.S. as well, Overing is less sure. \u201cIf they have a win from the UK court and bring it over to the U.S. They can say the U.S. should follow what the British court did. But in reality, Meta has a lot more money and lawyers and so it\u2019s not going to be as easy of a battle here as it may be in the U.K., he said.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of that is because [the U.S. has] more rules surrounding how you make a determination of an infringement. It\u2019s less likely that in the United States that anyone has heard of this small British company.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg is confident Threads\u2019 user base will pick back up again as they continue to add more features to the app.\n\n\u201cI revisited it about a week ago,\u201d Rudd says. \u201cI\u2019ve been following people in the hiking/mountaineering space, and it\u2019s a nice change of pace to Instagram.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely this will hurt Meta, even if they lose in the U.K.\u201d Overing adds. But it appears that Threads Software isn\u2019t going to give in easily. If Meta does not stop using the name Threads in the U.K. within the next 30 days, Threads Software said they will seek an injunction from the English Courts.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Drake Lee, Nathan Silva, Jack Smith, Ruben Flores, and Alia Noll\nNovember 01, 2023 at 5:33 pm PDT\n\nConstruction on the fourth floor of the Student Union has finally wrapped up, and the newly renovated space has opened its doors to students. After five months of renovation, the Student Union held a grand re-opening Tuesday afternoon of its new spaces for the LGBTQ+ Center, Latinx/Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs (La CASA), Asian Pacific American Student Services (APASS) and more.\n\n\u201cWe went on a campus tour in 2019, and we started going around and looking at student space,\u201d USC President Carol Folt said at the re-opening. \u201cAnd, you know, it needed work. Even though beautiful, wonderful things were happening in all our cultural centers. Even when the space isn\u2019t good, people make it great and that is also something we have to remember, this isn\u2019t the new beginning. This is just the extension of all those wonderful things.\u201d\n\nThe renovations doubled the physical space for La CASA and APASS, added 300 square feet to the LGBTQ+ Center, and revamped the Native American and Pasifika lounge. Conference rooms and sleeping pods were added for student use, along with counseling offices for embedded counseling and mental health services, a full service shared kitchen, a dedicated space for the Justice, Education, Diversity and Inclusion Peer Education program, and a newly established Gender Equity Programs Office.\n\nIn addition, all of the centers received new furnishings and decorations to bring new life to the rooms, all with the central motto of \u2018You belong at USC.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou know what is wonderful about the space, what I was told people wanted, was that each space honors a culture or a set of identities in very specific and particular ways,\u201d Folt said. \u201cYet each space is also meant to honor that intersectionality and have open spaces and to be places where people are welcome, however they get there.\u201d\n\nThe fourth floor was renovated in 2020 as part of a phased approach. Additionally, both the Daily Trojan and El Rodeo were reallocated on the fourth floor, along with receiving updated equipment.\n\nMegan van der Toorn, Director of SEIP Intercultural Services and the LGBTQ+ Student Center, says that the reconstruction was a result of the increasing number of students wanting to gather in the communal spaces, as well as student advocacy to open university space to more identity groups.\n\n\u201cOur goal really is to have students find meaningful spaces, meaningful communities,\u201d said van der Toorn. \u201cSo that might be in the physical spaces that we hold, in the ability to find folks who hold similar identities and lived experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping to make a big university a little bit smaller,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know 40,000 students can be overwhelming for folks, so our goal is to create salient communities for folks in one of our centers, and multiples of our centers, to help folks feel like they belong and that they can thrive here at USC.\u201d\n\nNaddia Palacios, the assistant vice provost for student affairs, student equity and inclusion, said that student advocacy has played a role not only in pushing for improvement of existing spaces, but also the carving out of new ones. Recently formed community spaces such as the Native American and Pasifika lounge and the Middle Eastern & North African Student Lounge, a subset of the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, were both created after students came forward asking for a space of their own on campus.\n\nPalacios emphasized the communal feeling she\u2019s hoping USC Student Life can foster across the different identity spaces.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that in the past three years, we\u2019ve made significant efforts to be more inclusive in our space allocations and include as many communities as possible,\u201d Palacios said. \u201cBut we also want to reiterate that all the spaces are available for everyone. They still have access to the kitchen, and to all the other centers. They shouldn\u2019t feel like that is the only space on campus that they can utilize.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, she wanted to make sure that all students know they are welcome to explore the newly renovated areas, and that the student union is really a place for all Trojans to explore and enjoy.\n\n\u201cThere are sleeping pods; there\u2019s spaces for students to study; there\u2019s conference rooms \u2013 and we\u2019re really looking at this as a way for all students to be able to access the spaces,\u201d Palacios said. \u201cGranted, they are within the student equity and inclusion umbrella but we welcome all students to come and utilize all the spaces that we were able to renovate and expand.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Angelina Hicks)\n\nBy Angelina Hicks\nNovember 01, 2023 at 4:39 pm PDT\n\nMariah Carey has defrosted. It\u2019s that time of year when Carey\u2019s iconic \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You,\u201d released in 1994, returns to the radio waves and music charts. Many people consider Nov. 1 the official first day of the holiday season. With Halloween already a distant memory, store shelves are stocked with winter holiday decorations, gift supplies and other cheery items. This phenomenon has been dubbed the \u201cChristmas creep\u201d \u2014 retailers introducing holiday-themed merchandise before the traditional holiday shopping season, which usually starts on Black Friday, or the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nJames Ellis, former dean of USC\u2019s business school and current marketing professor, said the holiday season is a huge deal for stores and other retailers looking to make their end-of-the-year profit goals. He said some companies make up to 35 percent of their annual profits during the month of December, a factor driven mainly by holiday shopping.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many stores that do after-Thanksgiving sales to try and boost their sales,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSo in the first three weeks that they have right now, they\u2019re just going to put it out and let people look at it and get a sense that it is the holiday period.\u201d\n\nSome psychologists have discussed how decorating early for the holidays can lift people\u2019s spirits and spike dopamine, which promotes feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. While holiday festivities can bring warm, joyful feelings of happiness and nostalgia to many people across the U.S., for retailers, this feeling translates to dollar signs as more people buy holiday items in October and November.\n\n\u201cPeople like to get in the holiday spirit early, especially when things are so difficult globally and geopolitically,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThe one thing the holidays do is lift people\u2019s fears and make people more philanthropic, more giving and more family-oriented.\u201d\n\nSurveys conducted by the National Retail Federation found that Americans spend an average of nearly $900 on gifts, decorations, food and other key seasonal items. Nearly all U.S. adults \u2014 92 percent \u2014 say they plan to celebrate winter holidays such as Christmas, Hanukkah or Kwanzaa this year.\n\nItzel Ivarra, a junior studying health and human sciences, said Nov. 1 is fair game to get the festive season started.\n\n\u201cFor Thanksgiving, you don\u2019t need to plan as much as you do for Christmas,\u201d Ivarra said. \u201cChristmas is just more of a recognized holiday. The feeling of Christmas is spread out through more than just December.\u201d\n\nA survey of 1,000 Americans conducted by Home Depot and Wakefield Research last year found that 55 percent of respondents also begin their holiday decorating and festivities before Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cPassing by houses, I don\u2019t think anyone decorates for Thanksgiving,\u201d Ivarra said. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas lights. By the time you put up Thanksgiving decorations, you\u2019d be taking them down pretty soon to be putting up Christmas decorations.\u201d\n\nOther holiday shopping promotions are beginning soon. Popular Starbucks holiday items and cups are returning Nov. 2, including a new Iced Gingerbread Oatmilk Chai and other seasonal favorites like the Peppermint Mocha. The Dunkin\u2019 Donuts holiday items officially launched on Nov. 1, including a new drink \u2014 the Spiced Cookie Coffee.\n\nLars Perner, a business professor at USC and expert on holiday shopping, said the \u201cChristmas creep\u201d keeps retailers competitive.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that, whether things were on sale or not, there really wasn\u2019t a lot of holiday shopping or merchandising going on until Black Friday, the Friday after Thanksgiving,\u201d Perner said. \u201cBut in recent years, that\u2019s crept back further and further.\u201d\n\nPerner said that up to 50% of toy sales in the U.S. occur during the holiday season \u2014 a huge motivating factor for online and brick-and-mortar stores to get their holiday items out earlier. Perner also emphasized that Thanksgiving is happening on the earlier side this year. Since Thanksgiving falls on the fourth Thursday in November, the actual date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is Nov. 22 and the latest is Nov. 28. This year Thanksgiving is on Nov. 23, leaving slightly more time for holiday shopping afterward.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think that a few days would make a huge difference in the total amount of holiday merchandise you sell, but it actually does have quite a considerable impact,\u201d Perner said.\n```"}

In August, CSU Interim Chancellor Jolene Koester released a video addressing the bargaining issues. \u201cCSU is committed to fairly compensating you, our faculty and staff,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cWe have made offers of significant multi-year compensation increases to both faculty and staff bargaining units, and we\u2019ve done this at a time when the state is facing a revenue shortfall.\u201d\n\nThe California Faculty Association (CFA) is seeking a 12 percent pay raise, as well as increased parental leave and other benefits. According to a brief from CSU, their initial counter was a five percent general salary increase for the current year. In response, the CFA released a statement on their website saying, \u201ctheir 5-percent GSI counteroffer means very little to the large percentage of faculty who can\u2019t afford to live in California even on a full-time salary, and it does not keep up with inflation.\u201d\n\nKoester informed viewers that 75 percent of CSU\u2019s costs are dedicated to employees\u2019 salary and benefits, and warned faculty of the possible repercussions of overextending costs. \u201cIf we extend ourselves further, each of the 23 universities will be put in a position where they\u2019re going to be forced to make difficult and painful decisions. They\u2019re going to have to reallocate their already limited financial resources to meet their increased costs of operation,\u201d Koester said.\n\nAs of last month, CSU has increased their tuition by six percent, starting next year with costs increasing over the next five years. The CFA responded to Koester saying, \u201cwhile management claims poverty, raises student fees by 34 percent over the next five years and refuses to pay the most disadvantaged faculty a living wage, they are somehow able to conjure up the money to offer our presidents upwards of a 29 percent pay increase and our new chancellor Mildred Garc\u00eda a total annual compensation of $973,000, almost 30 percent more than the previous chancellor.\u201d\n\nMichelle Ramos Pellicia, CFA CSU San Marcos E-board Chapter President and professor at CSU San Marcos, shared the personal impact the situation has had. \u201cI see it in my colleagues. I want to be working in an environment that is safe for our colleagues and for myself, and having a police force militarized in full gear is very scary,\u201d Ramos Pellicia said. \u201cIt\u2019s not creating a safe campus, for me it creates a campus that I dread to walk in.\u201d\n\nThrough personal experience and the shared experiences of her community, Ramos Pellicia said she feels the insecurity and threats from all around. One of her main concerns is making sure that her colleagues are working in a nurturing environment where they feel safe in every aspect of their life. \u201cWe should be living in spaces where it is safe and clean to use the bathroom and not risk your safety.\u201d Ramos Pellicia said. \u201cWe need to be working in a job where you can take a whole semester for parental leave to take care of ourselves and the life that we\u2019re bringing to our families.\u201d\n\nThe CFA is planning to go to the Chancellor\u2019s office and rally in front of the Board of Trustees on Nov. 7, while simultaneously educating members and students on the issue at hand. \u201cWe will decide when we\u2019re going to strike and it\u2019s going to be at a time when it works for us.\u201d Ramos Pellicia said. \u201cNot for management, but for us.\u201d\n```"}

With the football team struggling, the addition of Bronny James on the basketball team and performances by celebrity artists at the basketball events, have students redirected their enthusiasm toward USC basketball rather than USC football? USC has traditionally been known as a football school, from the excitement and school spirit that goes into cheering in the Coliseum to the fun that students have at the tailgates.\n\nArjun Bedi, an international student from Mumbai, India said, \u201cOne of the major reasons I wanted to study at USC was the allure of the \u2018American football experience.\u2019 I had heard so much about it and couldn\u2019t wait to experience that level of school spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur basketball team looks very promising, unlike our football team at the moment, so I\u2019m definitely ready for basketball season,\u201d said Elizabeth Griesser, a sophomore student majoring in cinema and media studies. \u201cThat being said, I\u2019m still a big fan of our football program and will continue to support it \u2014 even if things don\u2019t start to look up soon.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trojans started off the season strong as one of the top 10 teams in the country with a 5-0 record, two consecutive losses and the struggle to beat 3-5 Cal on Saturday has Trojan fans heavily concerned. USC basketball, on the other hand, has been on the come up. Performers like Saweetie and Zack Bia performed at the HoopLA event -- a show combining hoops with live performances, which attracted major crowds.\n\nHas the pomp surrounding the basketball team shifted the students\u2019 attention away from football?

She is interested to see if the football team will change their dynamic and \u201cgo up from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are still a lot of exciting games for the rest of the season,\u201d Weisiger said. \u201cIt could be really cool to see if they actually do well.\u201d\n\nWeisiger said she believes that both HoopLA and Bronny have brought a lot of attention to USC basketball.\n\n\u201cI think they just want to see [Bronny] in action,\u201d she added. \u201cHoopLA was just really good spirit for the school and makes everyone more excited to be like \u2018oh yeah, basketball games are fun; this environment is really fun.\u2019\u201d\n\nJessica Mulvihill, a junior studying economics, said she has turned her attention towards USC basketball this year due to the \u201carrival of new players and the excitement surrounding it\u201d.

The park features 19 altars carefully curated by local artists to memorialize deceased family members, celebrities and pets. A 20th ofrenda, called the community altar, honors the victims of gun violence in Monterey Park and those who died in the Maui wildfires in August. Community members are encouraged to add photos of deceased loved ones to the community altar.\n\nAlthough the exhibit opened to the public on Oct. 21, the park\u2019s marketing manager, Crista Campos, said most of the foot traffic comes during the final two days of the event on Nov. 1 and 2 \u2013 the official Dia de los Muertos. \u201cThis has been a tradition for the park to bring communities together and celebrate a tradition that is known for Mexican culture,\u201d Campos said, noting that 2023 marks the 12th year the park has put on the event.\n\nBeyond just attracting Angelenos, the ofrendas also brought in visitors from different cities and states, including partners John Curtis and Elizabeth Fox from Seattle. Fox, who lost her father and younger brother this past year, said she enjoyed reflecting on their memories in a positive light, as Dia de los Muertos is traditionally meant to be a celebration of life, rather than a lamentation of the dead.\n\n\u201cDeath can be such an overpowering emotion and experience,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI really enjoy sharing it with other people in a festive way and just being a little lighter on the thought of death.\u201d Curtis, whose late father grew up in L.A., said he frequently thinks of his father and enjoyed celebrating him at the Grand Park event.\n\nFor visitor Jennifer Patton, whose family is from Honduras, she came to the park Wednesday morning to visit the ofrenda dedicated to deceased pets in honor of her dog that she had for 12 years. The ofrenda included a rainbow bridge that symbolizes helping the animals\u2019 spirits pass over to a better place after they die.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of grief, it\u2019s the love that you didn\u2019t get to share when they were here,\u201d Patton said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really beautiful aspect of people getting to express that love even if they\u2019re not here physically because you have that sense of them being here spiritually.\u201d\n\nDia de los Muertos festivities will continue throughout Los Angeles in the coming days on Olvera Street, including face painting, community altars on display, entertainment and a nightly procession.\n```"}

But where did the googly eyes come from?\n\nOn the r/USC Reddit page, user emo-otter posted \u201cDay 1 of putting googly eyes around campus before getting in trouble\u201d on Sept. 9, 2021. It seems that emo-otter is still active, as he posted \u201cButterfl-eye (Day 31 of putting googly eyes around campus before getting in trouble)\u201d on Saturday, Oct. 7. Emo-otter, or Nevaeh Li, a sophomore at USC studying interactive media and game design, shared his insights about this two year project with Annenberg Media.\n\nLi said the idea originated from TikTok videos showing people putting googly eyes on everything, but he wanted to do something special at a university setting. \u201cI\u2019m definitely considering the fun part of it. If I just put it on a random pillow or a random chair, that\u2019s not going to be that funny. I\u2019m looking for things that are missing their eyes. The second aspect I look for is, are they USC enough?\u201d\n\nVarious sizes of the googly eyes that Nevaeh Li uses for his project. (Photo by Ziqi Wang)\n\nAfter he posted the googly eyes on Reddit, Li said he received many positive responses: \u201cI never thought it would go viral. Not viral viral, but 300 likes is a lot for me. Reddit is famous for people bickering over stupid things, but I feel like this is a moment where people can just be silly.\u201d Comments under reddits included \u201camazing work\u201d and \u201cI love this.\u201d \u201cYou brighten my walks around campus,\u201d commented Reddit user lazato42 on Sept. 22.\n\nThe influence of the googly eye project reached faculty and staff of the USC community across various platforms. Connor Morrissette, senior staff writer for USC Football, tweeted \u201cThe Trojan sword has eyes today\u201d on Sept. 19. It was retweeted by USC Trojans Football. On that day, a video showed the googly eyes watching over athletes walking past after finishing their training.\n\nThe Trojan Sword with googly eyes on it, Sept. 19. (Photo courtesy of Nevaeh Li)\n\nAccording to Li, the project started off as a \u201csilly idea,\u201d but it turned out to be more long term. \u201cAs a freshman, I was mildly depressed clinically. This project really made me climb out of my bed to do things. But I do feel like some people are getting joy out of my project,\u201d Li said.\n\nChloe Kwan, a sophomore studying interactive media and game design who joined Li for the project, agreed. \u201cIt brings joy to people, but it also gives me and Naveah the opportunity to explore the campus while searching where to put the googly eyes on,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen more of campus because of these updates than I did in two years here,\u201d commented Redditor momsbiryani on Oct. 2 under the post \u201cTirebiter (Day 30 of putting googly eyes around campus before getting in trouble).\u201d\n\n\u201cI do have basic industry standards of putting googly eyes,\u201d Li said. He doesn\u2019t put the eyes on signs that are crucial for people to get around. \u201cI don\u2019t want to actually interfere with just putting them everywhere so that [people] can\u2019t see where they\u2019re actually going. It\u2019ll be annoying.\u201d\n\nAccording to Li, there\u2019s a secret schedule for putting up the googly eyes. He wishes to keep the project mysterious, even though he is no longer anonymous. Usually the googly eyes are taken down within a few hours after he puts them up, which adds a discovery and timeliness element to the project.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re just doing something that\u2019s mysterious while, at the same time, legal,\u201d Li said, \u201cI feel like some people just like that sense of mystery in our life because in school, life can get really boring and everything is predictable. But if you see a pair of googly eyes popping out like \u2018Whoo!\u2019 Then you\u2019ll have something different in your life.\u201d\n```"}

Durazo: \u201cToday is a very important day to show the hotel industry and everyone, the community, that these workers will not give up. They don\u2019t want to end up on the street as homeless families. They need we need to address poverty in a deep way that we can\u2019t stop homelessness if people can\u2019t pay the rent. They want to be able to pay the rent, so they need the wages to be able to pay the rent.\u201d\n\nThese workers are asking for a 40% increase in their wages that are currently around $25 an hour. Maritzia Morales is the current office coordinator at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and commutes an hour from South Central to get to work every day. With her 5 children and numerous grandchildren, her current pay is not enough to support her family.\n\nMorales: \u201cIn my side, I feel like this is crazy because they have money to pay lawyers and extra lawyers against the coworkers. So if they have the money to pay them, why can they not give us our increases?\u201d\n\nIn addition to the increase in wages, the workers are striking for a healthcare and retirement plan as well.\n\nGeneral Manager of the Biltmore Hotel Jimmy Wu spoke with us about leading his hotel into being one of only three hotels to make deals with the workers after three months of striking. Wu: \u201cWe have peace and we have harmony so we can move on and we can focus on the business.\u201d\n\nBut hundred of other hotels in Los Angeles and Orange Counties have yet to make deals. Maria Hernandez who is the organizer of Union Here Local 11 says there is still work to be done to support these workers in their negotiations.\n\nHernandez: \u201cIf there was progress, we would not be out here right now. We have about 50 hotel across the region. Thousands of workers are gathering right now at Pershing Square because they mean business.\u201d\n\nUntil negotiations are met, these workers will continue to be on the streets with horns blaring and drums beating to protest their unjust wages.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Madison Hogue.\n```"}

Israel began retaliatory strikes against Gaza following an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, a militant Palestinian organization recognized by the U.S. as a terrorist group which governs the Gaza strip.\n\nThe march, which began at the Hoover and Jefferson campus entrance, snaked through the university towards Wallis Annenberg Hall before doubling back to the Tommy Trojan statue in the center of campus. A rearguard of a few students dragged several long sheets of paper for the entirety of the march\u2014lists representing the 8,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, reported as killed in Israeli airstrikes by the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe demonstration was the latest of several student events in support of either Israel or Palestine in recent weeks, and the second of the day following a public display near Trousdale Parkway for the more-than-200 hostages taken by Hamas during the initial attack on Israel.\n\nOutside of Wallis Annenberg Hall, leaders of the protest gave speeches regarding misinformation in the media. Many wore face coverings, and did not publicly disclose their identities. One of the leaders accused both the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media\u2019s video production of spreading misinformation surrounding pro-Palestinian supporters and creating \u201cdownright dangerous comparisons between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and terrorists and Nazis.\u201d\n\nThat organizer then read from a prepared statement in front of Annenberg Hall where the Annenberg Media newsroom is located. The person called on USC-based media \u201cto protect both pro-Palestinian contributors and writers.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s essential to create an environment that fosters diverse perspectives without endangering these same individuals,\u201d he said.\n\nThe protestors called for equal coverage in the media regarding pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media to take responsibility for the impact of their content. Let\u2019s work together to ensure accurate, fair and respectful coverage that upholds the principles of journalism.\u201d\n\nGennie Obayd, a University of Arizona student who participated in the protest, said it was important as a Muslim to support other Muslims facing oppression. Obayd said her identity as a woman, a Black woman, and a Black Muslim woman had exposed her to multiple facets of prejudice in the United States.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to change myself a lot for America because there are parts of this country that I do love,\u201d she said, \u201cHowever when they give $10 billion to the oppressor and when they willingly allow 8,000 plus Palestinians to die, and the count of Israelis is about 1,400, and this is just only in this Hamas war, it\u2019s hard to support this country as an American.\u201d\n\nThe USC Department of Public Safety estimated around 100 people participated in the march. After the conclusion of the protest, a small group of the demonstrators who identified as Muslim, including some protest leaders, joined together in front of Tommy Trojan for the Maghrib prayer, one of the five daily prayers that are mandatory in some sects of Islam.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt\u2019s office sent out a campus-wide email Tuesday morning, signed by other top administrators, addressing student concerns surrounding islamophobia and antisemitism. \u201cOver the past three weeks, we\u2019ve been in conversation with many faculty, students, staff, alumni, and parents who have been personally and profoundly impacted by the violence in Israel and Gaza,\u201d the statement says. \u201cUSC publicly and unequivocally denounces antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, and xenophobia. Hate speech is antithetical to our values and any threats of violence are unacceptable.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Annenberg Media acknowledges the criticism levied against us by the Students for Justice in Palestine. In our coverage across all platforms, each piece undergoes a formal review process by editors and producers who act on guidance from the Equity Board and also work with Annenberg faculty. The newsroom stands by the totality of this coverage. We will continue to cover all voices fairly and work diligently to represent how students across our campus are feeling about this conflict. We will reiterate that when referencing Hamas, a Palestinian militant group and U.S. recognized terrorist group, we do not conflate it with all Palestinians. We also acknowledge that not all individuals calling for peace in Gaza are advocating or supporting the actions done by Hamas.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/10/31/the-real-scary-side-of-halloween/", "response": "```\nThe real scary side of Halloween\n\nGhosts and goblins are far from the scariest parts of the holiday \u2014 that is accompanied with real frights such as crime, negative environmental impacts and danger to wildlife.\n\nJack-o-lanterns are a common Halloween decoration. Photo courtesy of Taylor Rooney on Unsplash\n\nBy Keely Roy October 31, 2023 at 6:52 pm PDT\n\nWhile Halloween tends to be a light-hearted holiday characterized by children dressing up in cute costumes and going from house to house asking for candy, it has a dark side. While the holiday has drastically changed from its origins when the Celts actually celebrated the evils of the world, its modern appearance \u2014 the one associated with carved pumpkins and children in costumes \u2014 is not as harmless as it seems.\n\nHalloween weekend has largely been associated with increased crime rates and this past Halloweekend was no exception. According to an article by the LA Times, authorities reported 11 dead, with over 70 more injured in shootings taking place across the nation at Halloween outings. The pairing of Halloween and crime is no new fad \u2013 unfortunately, the Halloween season is one often accompanied by an increase in gun violence, theft and driving under the influence.\n\nWith the festivities starting during what some call Halloweekend, which kicked off this Friday, so did the violence with various shootings taking place across the country. That includes a mass shooting outside a bar in Tampa, Florida. A Halloween house party in San Antonio, Texas turned violent leaving a couple dead and their 13-year-old injured. As of now, 11 are confirmed dead and an estimated 70 more are injured from shootings related directly to Halloween parties.\n\nJayce Woodward, a sophomore communications major at USC, echoed some of the fears of those who were hoping to go out and enjoy the festivities. \u201cI feel like if I went out now, if it was like a big place, I would definitely be scared,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cAnd honestly, maybe [I will] not even go. It depends what it is. I would have to see relative size, but definitely pepper spray always.\u201d\n\nElla Rae Peterchak, a USC sophomore studying global geodesign, said she plans accordingly knowing the risks. \u201cI definitely make sure to go with a group of people and also make sure that we have each other\u2019s locations and have a plan before we go out,\u201d Peterchak said.\n\nHalloween night hasn\u2019t even taken place yet, and that\u2019s when Halloween-related crime is expected to reach its height. According to data by Travelers insurance, on average crime-related insurance claims increase by 24% on Halloween, which is the highest of any individual day of the year.\n\nUSC public safety Chief David L. Carlisle had some advice for students who still want to join in on the fun while remaining safe. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go out, go with a group, take advantage of the free Lyft rides offered to our students,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cNot walking alone after dark is good advice in any big city. It\u2019s not unique to USC. If you\u2019re going to go to a social event where alcohol is served, don\u2019t drink from a source that you didn\u2019t see... Don\u2019t drink and drive, which fortunately due to the free Lyft is not a problem here at USC. But I would just say make smart decisions.\u201d\n\nAnother scary part about Halloween is its future environmental impact. Halloween is one of the largest waste-contributing holidays. According to a study conducted by Hubbub, 83% of Halloween costumes used non-recyclable oil-based plastics which means they had no choice but to end up in landfills. The 5.4 million kilograms of textile waste that results from the throwing away of Halloween costumes does not even take into account the waste from the millions of dollars of individually-plastic-wrapped candy that also piles up in these landfills.\n\nThe even scarier truth \u2014 that costume you bought in 2022 might still be around to haunt your ancestors in 2200 as it can take up to 200 years for some of these polyester costumes to fully decompose.\n\nPeterchak is one student trying to enjoy the holiday festivities while limiting the negative impact she has. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll scrounge something up from what I have already,\u201d Peterchak said. \u201cAnd then sometimes I\u2019ll also buy a few things, but I try to limit the things I buy. The new clothing costume items that I wouldn\u2019t really use another time. Or if I do get new stuff, I try to buy something that I think I would wear again.\u201d\n\nFuture disaster is not the only concern as Halloween directly impacts not only people in these environments but also animals. From fake cobwebs to floating ghosts, while most decorations don\u2019t give most people a scare, they can be life threatening for our nonhuman neighbors. Specifically the fake spiderwebs that can be found in most neighborhoods draped over trees and hedges can be a real threat to wildlife as creatures can easily become stuck in these sticky thick webs.\n\nAlmost all types of small critters are at risk, but birds are at an especially high risk. While animal services has been called in to rescue trapped animals such as a screech owl found in a Novato family\u2019s front yard decorations a couple years ago, most animals aren\u2019t as lucky as they are unable to escape. Many die from starvation.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re putting something that is plastic and not a natural fiber in any shape or form ... into the environment, you are going to get animals tangled up in it,\u201d Alison Hermance told LA Times reporters. Hermance works for WildCare, a wildlife hospital and educational organization in the Bay Area. She noted that of all the holiday decorations, fake webs and string lights are the most perilous to wildlife and said the safest bet is to just avoid them altogether as they are also not easily reusable.\n```"}

Like people, like, Believe in Ghosts and stuff like that. So they just made a holiday of it.\n\nJessica: Oh, maybe it\u2019s a holiday that maybe witches made up a long time ago. I don\u2019t know.\n\nMathew: So I probably imagine that, you know, costume companies and, you know, eventually, you know, Hollywood is to come up with this idea of Halloween to make movies and make people buy costumes. Yeah. And the candy companies, too.\n\nThat\u2019s not entirely right. Ladies and gentlemen, gather \u2018round the virtual campfire because today we\u2019re delving into the wickedly wonderful world of Halloween! Let\u2019s take a spooky stroll through the history of this bewitching holiday.\n\nIt all started with the Celts, who knew how to throw a ghostly party. On October 31st, they\u2019d light bonfires and dress up in costumes to ward off pesky ghosts. Why? Because they believed that on the night before their new year on November first, the line between the living and the dead got blurred.\n\nBut then, the Romans crashed the party, bringing their own traditions, celebrating a goddess with a penchant for apples. That\u2019s where the tradition of bobbing for apples became a thing!\n\nFast forward to Pope Gregory III, who decided November 1 was all about the saints. Soon, All Saints Day picked up some Samhain (Sow-in) traditions, and the evening before it was dubbed All Hallows Eve. You guessed it, the birth of Halloween!\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before it became a day of treats, tricks, and all things spooky. A.D. 1000 rolls around, and the church introduces All Souls\u2019 Day to honor the dearly departed. Some say they were trying to replace the Celtic festival with their own similarly spooky celebration. Bonfires, parades, and dressing up as saints, angels, and devils? You bet!\n\nNow, let\u2019s hop across the pond to the good ol\u2019 USA, where Halloween got a peculiar American makeover.\n\nEarly on, colonial New Englanders weren\u2019t too keen on Halloween because of their strict Protestant beliefs. But down south in Maryland, it was a whole different pumpkin patch!\n\nAs European traditions mingled with American Indian customs, a uniquely American Halloween began to take shape. They had \u201cplay parties\u201d \u2013 think of them as the OG Halloween block parties. Folks would share ghost stories, predict the future, dance, and sing their hearts out.\n\nThe massive influx of Irish immigrants, fleeing the potato famine, gave Halloween a nationwide makeover. They brought their love for the holiday and a penchant for a good old-fashioned spooky soir\u00e9e, and thus, trick or treating came to be!\n\nThere you have it, the wild and wacky history of Halloween, from Celtic spirits to American celebrations. So this October 31st, when you\u2019re bobbing for apples and dressing up, remember, it\u2019s all part of this fantastic, centuries-old ghostly gala. Happy Halloween, folks!\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Lindsey Miller and Riley Rodriguez.\n```"}

On USC\u2019s campus, some groups like Hillel are acting in solidarity and show support through the symbolism of balloons. With balloons of blue and white, over two hundred photos of those kidnapped and held hostage in Gaza are displayed on the ground, a balloon attached to each.\n\nA USC student, Andrew Turquie, hopes for the safe return of the hostages. Andrew Turquie: We put up fliers to represent the 239 hostages held by Hamas in the West on Gaza. We\u2019re doing it to bring awareness and also to say that we want them to be brought home and to bring awareness on campus that Jewish students have a voice, and we are suffering as well, and that it isn\u2019t a zero-sum gain. One people are suffering doesn\u2019t mean the other aren\u2019t suffering who want to bring awareness to that.\n\nDescribing the peaceful display as a student expression of concern, the USC director of the Global Jewish Student Center, Rabbi Dov Wagner, thinks there is something important to take away. Dov Wagner: I think being focusing on the positives that you can do. Of course, there\u2019s different sides of the issue and innocent lives are being hurt and lost on both sides. And that\u2019s a tragedy, all of them. But I think the focus has to be too-- don\u2019t just rip somebody else down. Look for a way to express your empathy, your humanity and your concern and look for something positive that you can do as a result. To spread more light, to spread more goodness in the world.\n\nTurquie acknowledges that for many Trojans, this has been a very trying time. Turquie: I mean, it affects people a lot. And we were setting these up. Some guy comes, \u2018Hey, I know that kid from camp, can I put this balloon down?\u2019 So, you might not realize when you say things, but people are listening, and people are hurting.\n\nFor other USC students like, Virat Agrawal, the mixing of the entities involved is causing more harm than good. Virat Agrawal: I think people who are trying to mix what Hamas did and what the Palestinian causes is they are demeaning the Palestinian cause by doing this. Hamas is not doing anything good for the Palestinian people.\n\nDue to antisemitic incidents at colleges like Cornell University, the Biden Administration released a plan that will affect law enforcement security, discrimination complaints and cybersecurity.

The \u201cCruel Summer\u201d superstar began the journey of re-recording her first six studio albums in 2019 to own her own music. Her former label Big Machine Records denied her the opportunity to purchase the rights to her music. As each re-recorded album outperforms the original, Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Entertainment are introducing stricter clauses that demands longer wait times for future artists to re-record their music. The standard waiting period is five to seven years after the original date, but the new contracts can cause wait times of up to 30 years with the goal of preventing artists from outselling the original recording.\n\nAdjunct Professor at the Thorton School of Music and the Vice President of Digital at Pulse Music Group, Joe Poindexter said that this issue with re-recording is fairly new because of streaming platforms. Joe Poindexter: It\u2019s just I think it\u2019s important, too, that we realize, this issue of re-record is because of the world of streaming. This would have never been an issue if we didn\u2019t have the ability to get whatever we want, whenever we want it. And we have that ability now with streaming. This wouldn\u2019t have been the case if we were talking about physical product in stores.\n\nDespite the upcoming changes to these contracts, Adjunct Professor at Thorton and Munck Wilson Mandala attorney, Jane Davidson believes that future artists will not shy away from working with record companies. Jane Davidson: The majority of artists that I work with still have a level of interest in getting picked up by a major label. The main reason for that is the resources and connections that a major label would have are significantly more than you can handle on your own.\n\nAssistant Professor of practice in the Music Industry Department at Thornton, Andrew Leff believes that future artists will release music on their own to avoid record labels. Andrew Leff: In the year 2023, most record labels are actually irrelevant. Prior to 2000, the record labels ran the music industry, and you had no choice but to deal with them. If you wanted your song on the radio, you wanted your record in the store or whatever. Now, in 2023, what they are asking you to give up, which is your copyright in part to it in perpetuity, in exchange for what they\u2019re giving you, which is basically putting your song on Spotify and paying off some DSPs is really not worth that transaction.\n\nLeff says that despite the uproar of Taylor Swift\u2019s success, the entertainment industry will not be dramatically affected. Leff: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a big change on the industry in general, because one of the things about the re-record clause is very few artists actually take advantage of it. I know there\u2019s a lot of hoopla about the Taylor Swift stuff going on now, and people think that everybody\u2019s out there re-recording their catalogs when very like less than 1% of artists actually do. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a major effect on the vast majority of artists.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Monique Davis\n```"}

From costumes to candy, we talked to students about what they enjoyed most.\n\nBy Jack Noveck Holmes and Nolan Ezzet\nOctober 31, 2023 at 6:35 pm PDT\n\nHalloween is a staple for children all over America, and everyone has their own stories connected to the holiday. But the day means something different to everyone. We walked around campus to find out what Halloween means to different students.\n\nCostumes take planning, and that\u2019s not for everyone. But it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t put together a last-minute outfit. Benjamin Yu, a USC student, made a costume out of his existing wardrobe.\n\nBenjamin Yu: I just put on a University of Michigan Ann Arbor T-shirt and called myself a student there. And I went to, like, one party, met some people, and it was a ton of fun. And someone actually told me they liked my costume because their mom went there.\n\nOther people put a lot of thought into their costumes. Sarah Neff, also a USC student, had a killer costume for this year\u2019s Halloween.\n\nSarah Neff: So it\u2019s like the staff dress up thing and I\u2019m a pun: Holy guacamole.\n\nAmongst USC students, there are as many people who go all-out on their costumes as there are people who prefer not to dress up. Sarah says she just wants everyone to have fun while being comfortable.\n\nNeff: I think people should dress them like whatever makes them comfortable and there\u2019s no obligation to celebrate anything. But I do think it\u2019s I do value a little bit of spirit on Halloween, like the actual day, but I get the whole enjoying party on the weekends. You know, costume parties are pretty fun.\n\nPeople call it Halloweekend because some students get all the Halloween out of their system by Sunday.\n\nFor USC student Malaya Goldberg, weekdays are for studying.\n\nMalaya Goldberg: I just have a midterm tomorrow, so I\u2019m going to be staying in.\n\nHowever, not everyone grew up trick-or-treating and going to haunted houses. USC reports that roughly 25% of its student body are international students. And because Halloween is a western holiday, many Trojans are just now experiencing it for the first time.\n\nLary Liu is a Chinese student at USC who is excited to embrace the American tradition.\n\nLary Liu: Well, I didn\u2019t have a lot of experience with Halloween when I\u2019m when I was back home in China. And I it\u2019s kind of like a fresh experience for me. And I find that really interesting.\n\nWhether you\u2019ve never celebrated Halloween before or you go all-out every year, Halloween is what you make of it, and it\u2019s something everyone can enjoy.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nolan Ezzet.\n```"}

This year\u2019s spooky season started last weekend or Halloweekend as most of us like to call it. Campus was bustling with costumes ranging from the iconic Wizard of Oz \u2018Dorothy\u2019 costume to a pair dressed up as the \u2018Roman Empire.\u2019 But, we all know that nobody parties harder on Halloweekend than celebrities, who did not disappoint this year as they took to Instagram to show off their most glittery, glamorous outfits.\n\nThe Casamigos Halloween Party on October 27th in Beverly Hills boasted a star-studded invite list. Paris Hilton, Kelly Sawyer Patricof, and Jessica Alba all stunned as different versions of Britney Spears while Victoria Justice used her costume to pay homage to Cher. And while many people found themselves dressing up as Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, Justin himself was decked out in snorkel gear.\n\nOf course we could not mention Halloween without including the Kardashian-Jenner Clan whose costumes, year after year, rank on top. Kim Kardashian and her daughter North opted for a cute costume duo - dressing up as the iconic pair from clueless: Cher and Dionne. And while Kim adorned the famous checked black and yellow outfit and a blonde wig, Kourtney Kardashian dressed up as pregnant 2013 Met Gala Kim Kardashian. Kendall Jenner looked almost unrecognizable in her blonde curled wig and her sister Kylie accessorized herself in an all black costume. The duo took to TikTok to show fans their \u2018Sugar and Spice\u2019 costumes from Batman Forever. In true Jenner style, Kendall also had another costume, dressing up in a black turtleneck and blonde wig to represent Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThe Kardashians really do go all out! My personal favorite? It\u2019s Sarah Hyland and her husband Wells Adams. They dressed as seemingly ranch and ketchup, paying homage to the Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce memes. It\u2019s always fun to see what celebrities come up with for Halloween. Who knows what they\u2019ll all dress up as next year.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Amrita Vora\n```"}

The visual managed to draw the attention of students walking down the busy Trousdale Parkway, many of whom stopped to read the posters.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a political statement,\u201d said Andrew Turquie, a junior who helped organize the display. \u201cJewish people on campus are suffering, and Israelis are suffering.\u201d\n\nTurquie, who helped post the flyers that got torn down in last week\u2019s viral video, said one of his own friends ranks among the more than 200 hostages taken by Hamas \u2014 a U.S.-designated terrorist organization \u2014 during its Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel.\n\n\u201cJust because there are posters of Jewish victims doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not recognizing the fact that there\u2019s Palestinian suffering,\u201d Turquie said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go around tearing down someone else\u2019s posters.

On Tuesday, Israel claimed responsibility for an airstrike on a densely populated refugee camp that the country\u2019s military said killed a Hamas commander.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen all the hostages laid out before,\u201d said Carly, a student who observed the display at USC and requested to be identified only by first name out of fear of backlash. \u201cThe ones that are the most striking are the ones of children.\u201d\n\nTwo Department of Public Safety officers on watch said the students had acquired the necessary permits for the display.\n\nRabbi Dov Wagner, who runs the Rohr Chabad Jewish Center, said students would remove the posters before a pro-Palestine protest scheduled later in the day \u2014 an effort to \u201cturn down the temperature.\u201d\n\nBalloons on campus on Oct. 31 (Photo by Tomoki Chien).\n\nEarlier this week, federal officials said they\u2019ll partner with campus law enforcement to track antisemitic threats across the U.S. as university leaders grapple with a scourge of divisive, and sometimes dangerous, rhetoric. Notably, at Cornell University, online posts threatened to shoot, behead, rape and slit the throats of Jewish students.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League last week reported a nearly 400% increase in antisemitic incidents. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, for its part, said it has received the largest wave of complaints reporting Islamophobia since Donald Trump announced a plan to implement a travel ban on Muslim countries.

Skyler Pak, a #WeAreListening LIVE student organizer, describes today\u2019s event.\n\nSkyler Pak: It\u2019s meant to honor and amplify diverse voices within the Annenberg community, especially those that have been historically unheard in society. And it always features some sort of cultural cuisine and student performances and then discussions with your peers. The purpose of the mixer is to provide a safe space for inclusion at USC.\n\nSix students will perform live music at the event while people are encouraged to mingle and make new friends. Pak: We just try to make this, like, a safe, intimate mixer, to be honest.

Sayanti Ghosh: I loved the conversations, the community building aspect of this, how everyone gets to talk about their stories and share their experiences and the conversations we have. It\u2019s really inspiring to see, to hear everyone\u2019s stories, and I wanted to be a part of it. You know, share my story as well and be just a part of the community that we\u2019re building here.\n\nGhosh is a singer-songwriter from India. Ghosh: I come from India and I grew up in a very different culture from what I see here. And I don\u2019t necessarily think that all voices are represented in every area. That\u2019s why she thinks that events like this are so important to the USC community.\n\nGhosh: So, I think it\u2019s important to, like just give the opportunity to everyone who wants to be heard. And that\u2019s why I, I want to, like, bring diversity into my life and help build that aspect even in the community I\u2019m a part of.\n\nPak says that since the first #WeAreListening LIVE in October of 2022, students have been receptive to the events and the opportunity to connect with people they may never have met otherwise. Pak: There is so much beauty in, like having student organizations that - within your own cultural group and being able to have that common understanding, but then also like branching it out and figure out how to communicate across cultures. And I think we\u2019re seeing that at these events.\n\nYou can catch the tail end of the fourth #WeAreListening LIVE event, held today until 6pm in the East Lobby of the ASC Annenberg building.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Marie Louise Leone.\n```"}

And this number may be on the rise: According to Metro data, GoPass TAP card registration has increased 126% this year. Also increasing: Arrests. According to a Metro report from March, arrests have increased by 32% on rail services and 18% on bus services.

Within this partnership, Carvalho said since becoming superintendent, he and Bass have reduced the number of houseless encampments in close proximity to schools by 50%.\n\nBass highlighted the recent end of one encampment by Virgil Middle School, where \u201cover 50 people are now housed.\u201d\n\nAnother problem the district is hoping to tackle is absenteeism. \u201cWe cannot teach the absent child,\u201d Carvalho said, adding that the GoPass program is \u201cgoing to put a major dent on chronic absenteeism in our community.\u201d\n\nLast year, the rate of chronic absenteeism reached a staggering 50%, according to Carvalho. He said this figure has been reduced to around 20% this year.\n\nMoving forward with the expansion, Carvalho highlighted that \u201ca lot of folks don\u2019t realize that [they] also teach in excess of 30,000 adult learners.\u201d According to Carvalho, the district has a \u201cstrategic goal\u201d to double this figure.\n\nThe GoPass program is also open to participating community college students.\n\n\u201cEighty-five percent of the children in our community live at or below the poverty level,\u201d Carvalho said. \u201cThis is an equity builder.

This year\u2019s Trojan team is troublesome for the future of USC football. \n\nUSC head coach Lincoln Riley yells at a referee against Cal during the team's one-point win over the Golden Bears. (Photo by Bryce Dechert) \n\nBy Terence Holton October 31, 2023 at  5:40 pm PDT \n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d is a column by Terence Holton about the new look of college football. While USC\u2019s last season in the Pac-12 has been utterly underwhelming so far, I am already looking ahead to next season. The future, however, is not much brighter out in the Midwest. Both the Trojans\u2019 offense and defense have been pushed around by teams that should be inferior. Opposing offenses which have looked terrible in recent weeks suddenly look fantastic. Most surprisingly, USC has made bad defenses look good. This does not bode well for USC\u2019s realignment to the Big Ten. Big Ten programs are known for their hard-knock, rough-and-tumble football. MostBig Ten teams are molded by a punishingly stout defense with an offense that pounds the ball hard on the ground. As a Trojan fan, I am terrified of this. \n\nFirst off, let\u2019s talk about the USC defense. The USC defense ranks 104th in the country in rushing defense, giving up an average of 171 yards per game. Eight of the top 50 rush offenses in college football this season are teams currently or soon to be in the Big Ten. In 2024, USC plays six of those teams. This sparks more than just a little concern. The Trojans\u2019 defense has been known to miss tackles and let running backs break off for big plays. This season, USC has only played two teams ranked within the top 50 rushing offenses so far, and in those games, it allowed 247 yards to Utah and 235 yards to Cal. This is frightening. I fear next season I may have to watch helplessly as the Michigan offensive line bullies the USC defense into giving up an absurd amount of yards. \n\nNow how about the offense? Bluntly, the offense has looked like a shell of its former self. Suddenly, no one can get open, junior quarterback Caleb Williams isn\u2019t releasing the ball quick enough and the offensive line can\u2019t figure out how to block. The Big Ten is by far the best defensive conference in the country. Including incoming teams, the Big Ten has 12 teams ranked within the top 50 in total defense. Including Notre Dame, USC plays NINE defenses ranked within this season\u2019s top 50 in yards allowed per game in 2024. I\u2019m preemptively smacking myself in the head just thinking about these games. Let\u2019s also not forget, the Trojans will most likely be without Caleb Williams. Now, it\u2019s possible that freshman quarterback Malachi Nelson comes in and is a star immediately; however, it is a rough slate to throw a quarterback into in his first season as the starter. \n\nAs of right now, USC is not ready for the Big Ten. The Trojans are going to be hit by a bunch of cold-blooded, cheese-eating, corn-husking, tough football players. A whole lot has to change. As per usual, I have the solutions. First off, there must be a change in the defensive staff. I think the talent is there, but the coaching is not. Defensive coordinator Alex Grinch must be fired. I may sound like a broken record at this point, as I wrote an article on this very topic last year. However, it is truly the only situation I can think of where the defense gets much better. USC needs to go out and hire one of these Big Ten defensive coordinators. A house near the beach and a salary boost would surely sway one of these guys to bring their impressive defensive minds out west. \n\nSecond, the offensive line has to be better. Last season\u2019s offensive line was so good because they all played with one another for so long and knew how to play with each other. This year\u2019s offensive line was loaded with transfers \u2014 they just need time to gel together, then I believe they will be great. \n\nThird and finally, the offensive scheme needs to be better. The play calling the past few weeks have felt flawed and easy to predict, with not a lot going on. Perhaps it\u2019s my untrained eye saying that; however, I just feel like Lincoln Riley has been off a bit this season. I\u2019d like to see a lot more than just RPOs \u2014 run/pass options \u2014 and some more creative play calling. Let our quarterback unleash his arm. \n\nUSC will need to address a plethora of issues if they wish to compete in the Big Ten next year. \u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Expand Crocs are back, and students and celebrities alike are rocking them.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Unsplashed)\n\nBy Todd Takeuchi October 31, 2023 at 5:28 pm PDT\n\nWhether you\u2019re just walking casually or need to shift into \u201csports mode,\u201d Crocs are back! The classic footwear brand has returned as a go-to for those deciding what to wear out the door. Although Crocs seem to be continuing to rise daily, the brand went through a series of ups and downs ever since the company launched back in 2002. Crocs would then catch themselves struggling to bring in any sort of income years after the initial startup. From a series of announcements regarding foot issues with the heel strap, to the redundant design of the classic clog, consumers stopped purchasing Crocs because the brand wouldn\u2019t entice any sort of excitement with the products they were pushing out. At the point of near bankruptcy, Crocs shot back up in popularity following the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The brand looked to shift their marketing strategy, promoting their classic models to those looking to buy a pair of crocs as \u201cfashionable rather than just functional.\u201d\n\nAs social media influencers and celebrities started to rock the Croc clog around the streets, the craze for the product skyrocketed as people love to hop on what\u2019s trending through social media. Teyana Taylor modeled the Balenciaga x Crocs platform clogs during a photoshoot catered to the Balenciaga spring 2022 collection. Justin Bieber was later spotted wearing those same Balenciaga platform Crocs at the 2022 Grammy Awards. Even singer Post Malone shouts out Crocs in his song, \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be,\u201d released back in 2019 where he said, \u201cRichard Mille my watch, thousand dollar Crocs.\u201d Bretman Rock said that the platform Crocs make him feel like a \u201cbad b*tch\u201d and that he has been wearing more platform Crocs because, \u201cI\u2019m a short little girl, and I love a little height.\u201d\n\nWith collaborations ranging from Disney Pixar films to country artist Luke Combs \u2014 even KFC \u2014 Crocs are taking the world by storm now more than ever. As the numbers continue to grow, more ideas continue to filter through the drawing board and revenue continues to increase from the variety of consumers ranging from all ages. Ialeen Tejeda, USC freshman majoring in business administration, explained how she resorted to social media to make a decision on whether or not she should buy a pair. With a short time period of uncertainty, it didn\u2019t take long before Tejeda hopped on the trend and found herself with more pairs than anticipated.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m pretty easily influenced,\u201d said Tejeda. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that a lot of people were saying that they were comfortable. So I ended up buying some, and now I have a whole collection of them.\u201d\n\nVictoria Graveline Waiss, associate director of alumni engagement for the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC, stepped away from the traditional Croc clog. She\u2019s started exploring different models of the brand, ranging from slides, to heels and even platforms. She wanted to stand out from the norm and be seen as unique roaming around the USC campus.\n\n\u201cI do not have your traditional Crocs that you see all the kids running around with, I have the dressier line,\u201d said Graveline Waiss. \u201cWhen you work at USC, you are walking long distances. For me, it was definitely the need of something that looked cute, didn\u2019t look orthopedic but was still comfortable.\u201d\n\nJustin Braun, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences, prioritizes comfort in anything he puts on his feet. As a member of USC\u2019s track and field team, it\u2019s all about the recovery process knowing all the work that goes into being a student athlete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly for health reasons,\u201d said Braun. \u201cAs an athlete, I\u2019m trying to keep my toes spaced and open. A lot of the Nike shoes the team provides us kind of pinch your toes together. I\u2019m definitely going to look to buy some more Crocs.\u201d\n\nSarah Neff, content strategist for the Annenberg Inclusion Innitiative, saw the resurgence of Crocs as a nostalgia piece. Neff touched upon her first memories of Crocs back in the early days of her childhood and how she has always been with the brand.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in grade school, my aunt bought me my first pair of Crocs when I was seven. And then they died,\u201d said Neff. \u201cAnd then when they came back, of course it reminded me of my childhood. They\u2019re doing all these neat collabs and I really like when businesses can use creativity to fuel their products.\u201d\n\nThe creative possibilities seem to be endless when it comes to the next big thing for Crocs. The brand looks to continue their steady growth and popularity amongst the people and keep supplying the public with a variety of brand new ideas towards their classic models. Crocs looks to introduce their new collaboration line on Nov. 2 as they present their McDonald\u2019s collection.\n```"}

Expand Halloween movie viewing doesn't have to include jumpscares and screams. (Photo courtesy of The B's) \n\nBy Morgan McHose October 31, 2023 at  4:56 pm PDT\n\nIf you\u2019re not a horror fan, October can be an uncomfortable experience \u2013 from facing pressure to visit haunted houses to hurriedly closing your eyes and muting every unskippable horror movie trailer ad that inevitably pops up. But getting into the Halloween spirit doesn\u2019t have to mean scaring yourself silly. There are plenty of movies out there that embody the fun of the season without actively terrorizing their viewers. Here are five films you can enjoy today without quaking under the covers.\n\nClue (1985)\nThe classic comedy  does a great job of building suspense and simultaneously soothing viewers\u2019 fears with hilarious jokes and visual gags. The dialogue is witty, the story clever and the actors\u2019 line delivery will leave you in stitches. It\u2019s a perfect non-horror film for Halloween fans who appreciate the essence of a murder mystery without the gratuitous violence or gore. Following the plot of the titular board game, \u201cClue\u201d explores the secrets of an enormous, spooky estate that has become the scene of a murder. When everyone has means, motive and opportunity, how does this dinner party of morally dubious guests solve the crime before becoming the next victim?\n\nGhostbusters (1984)\n\u201cClue\u201d isn\u2019t the only \u201880s Halloween flick with more comedy than horror.  \u201cGhostbusters\u201d  is the quintessential Halloween comedy, and for good reason. The performances are stellar and the ghosts are iconic. And who could forget the scene-stealing final act villain? \u201cGhostbusters\u2019' has an  admittedly bizarre premise , as a trio of disgraced professors witness irrefutable proof of the supernatural and take the opportunity to launch a business eradicating ghosts from haunted sites. While this story likely could have taken a far more sinister route, the highs and lows of the profession are presented as much more funny than fear-inducing.\n\nHappy Death Day (2017)\nJumping ahead into this century, \u201cHappy Death Day\u201d is a  more recent Halloween film  that combines \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d with, well, a lot of murder. This one is definitely more violent than the previous suggestions, although I still didn\u2019t feel afraid. While there are some spooky moments, the majority of the film cares more about making you laugh and letting you solve the mystery alongside the protagonist. A callous sorority sister relives the day she dies over and over until she can unmask her killer and put an end to the cycle. Writing this out, it doesn\u2019t sound very funny, yet it\u2019s surprisingly comedic and even heartfelt in certain moments. If you can handle a bit of fear but stop short before horror, I think this is well worth a watch.\n\nTwitches (2005)\nIs any Halloween list complete without at least one Disney Channel original movie?  \u201cTwitches\u201d  is perhaps one of Disney\u2019s most mature Halloween stories, exploring themes like identity, adoption and the complexities of forging bonds with adult siblings who grew up apart. And, of course, they\u2019re also witches. \u201cTwitches\u201d encapsulates the nostalgia of the 2000s Disney Channel era perfectly. It\u2019s a fun flick with a healthy dose of Halloween magic and sisterly hijinks.\n\nWarm Bodies (2013)\nZombie films are a tough sell for anyone who is repulsed by the garden-variety horror flick. Zombies are typically decaying, thoughtless, rabid \u2013 insatiable hunger incarnate. It\u2019s scary and visually sickening.  \u201cWarm Bodies\u201d  is the exception, somehow managing to find and elevate the absurdity and levity of the genre. It\u2019s not completely sanitized and there is some gore that might not appeal to everyone.But at the core of this weird, weird film is an oddly sweet love story between a human woman and a zombie who mysteriously retained his humanity after death.\n```"}

(Photo by Kate Stuzin)\n\nBy Kate Stuzin\nOctober 31, 2023 at 4:46 pm PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles Regional Food Bank\u2019s 2022 annual report, released this month, reveals that one in five people in LA County face food insecurity, driven by high inflation and the end of pandemic-era aid. In 2022, 110 pounds of food were distributed, down from 133 million pounds in 2021 and 174.6 million in 2020.\n\nCEO of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, Michael Flood attributes this decrease to the end of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farmers to Families Food Box Program in May 2021. \u201cShortly after the pandemic hit with the shutdown of hotels, conventions, restaurants, schools, it led to a huge surplus of food and at the grower-producer level because their food had nowhere to go,\u201d Flood said. \u201cThat pushed the numbers. 2020 was a record year in terms of food distribution because of USDA efforts in identifying surpluses and getting it into our food bank.\u201d\n\nProduce is the number one category the food bank supplies through its 600 partner agencies and food bank distribution, Flood said. He recalled inflation becoming a noticeable factor for the food bank at the start of 2022 and specifically addressed its impact on produce in the mission statement of the 2022 report. \u201cWe changed our mission statement from \u2018food insecurity\u2019 to \u2018nutrition insecurity,\u2019\u201d Flood said. \u201cNutrition security is broader, it\u2019s calories and nutrients. People who struggle to meet their needs buy what they can afford, maybe more pasta, rice, and not from the produce section. In communities in South LA, there\u2019s not access to a full-service grocery store, and the restaurant offerings skew more toward fast food. We need to talk about not just food, but what types of food.\u201d\n\nIn October 2022, farm-level fruit prices surged by 11.5%, while farm-level vegetable prices soared by 22.4%, according to the USDA\u2019s Food Price Outlook report.\n\nVolunteers package yams on Saturday morning at the LA Regional Food Bank South LA Facility. (Photo by Kate Stuzin)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that the USC Dornsife has been tracking food insecurity and we work closely with the researchers there since the pandemic hit,\u201d Flood said. \u201cThey\u2019re determining ways to measure nutrition insecurity because it\u2019s newer.\u201d\n\nThe USC Institute for Food System Equity published their most recent study in September, revealing nearly one million households face food insecurity, a 6% increase from last year. While battling inflation, people also dealt with the loss of pandemic benefits from the SNAP CalFresh program in March 2023. This led to an increased dependence on food bank support, with Flood noting an immediate 9% increase in people seeking assistance from them.\n\nThe food bank has seen an increase in monthly visitors, serving 870,000 people since the beginning of the year, up from 800,000 served in 2022. The food they serve relies on a combination of USDA donations and private contributions, and Flood says they only purchase a small fraction of their supply.\n\nLow enrollment in CalFresh plays a role in increasing food insecurity. The Director of Marketing and Communications at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, David May, works with a team to contact potentially eligible people for CalFresh. \u201cWe know that the number of people in L.A. County who qualify for CalFresh is still higher than the number of people who are accessing CalFresh,\u201d May said. \u201cThere\u2019s people who would qualify and would be able to receive those benefits but may need help identifying how to secure access.\u201d\n\nAu Chung, a junior majoring in political science and public relations, began using CalFresh two years ago. Chung credits finding and applying to the program to their friends and wants to see the university take a more active role in the process. \u201cWhile I love that USC has a basic needs program, they weren\u2019t very helpful for me in the application process for EBT,\u201d Chung said. \u201cStudents are employed often during the school year and not during the breaks, so the school needs to provide resources to help students understand how the reporting for income goes during those periods because when you don\u2019t have an income, you don\u2019t qualify for EBT.\u201d\n\nFood insecurity is a huge issue for some USC students because of the combined high cost of living and tuition. Chung lives far from campus because of high rent prices nearby and still allocates half of his paycheck to rent. They compensate by using free food resources provided from campus organizations such as the LGBTQ+ center.\n\nThe Trojan Food Pantry, which opened in 2016, is another on-campus resource for students impacted by food insecurity. The pantry partners with the St. Francis Center to provide free groceries. \u201cThere isn\u2019t necessarily one of our partner agencies close to community colleges, so, we do a lot of mobile distributions at community colleges,\u201d Flood said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had discussions with USC\u2019s food pantry but we have no formal connection. If there\u2019s are anything on our side that could be helpful to the food pantry there, we\u2019re happy to help.\u201d\n\nAngel Bonilla, a sophomore majoring in business and accounting volunteers weekly at the Trojan Food Pantry. Bonilla said food insecurity on campus peaked at the beginning of the semester and the pantry ordered much more food to compensate for the demand. \u201cThe best way to address food insecurity is by taking it at a community level, just because even for people who are facing that need, it might be too much of an inconvenience to go if it\u2019s far away. The USC Food Pantry makes it a lot easier for students to reach those resources. What I\u2019d like to see is just more advertising. A lot of people don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\n\nFood bank volunteer Mary Connors separates and bags green bell peppers. (Photo by Kate Stuzin)\n\nThe pantry operates out of Tutor Campus Center 425A on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Between 100 and 200 students use the food pantry each day of operation, Bonilla said. Students can register here.\n\n\u201cI volunteered at the LA Food Bank a lot last semester,\u201d Bonilla said. \u201cI packed food into boxes, and you\u2019re pretty much by yourself doing, like a factory line. Here at the food pantry it\u2019s a lot more interpersonal. I get to see who I\u2019m affecting.\u201d\n\nVolunteers can work shifts at the food bank Monday through Saturday. The food bank had 16,700 volunteers in 2022, a noticeable increase from 12,000 volunteers in 2021, which Flood attributes to a more \u201csignificant need\u201d in terms of the work.\n\nMary Connors took up a shift last Saturday and has volunteered at the food bank facility in South LA since 2009. \u201cYou\u2019re making a direct impact on someone that needs it,\u201d Connors said. \u201cEverybody needs food. Food isn\u2019t a right or a privilege, it\u2019s a necessity, and so many people don\u2019t have access to it or can afford it.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Tracy Mejia)\n\nBy Tracy Mejia\nOctober 31, 2023 at 4:27 pm PDT\n\nThis year Halloween landed on a Tuesday, and students came to campus flaunting unique costumes. At the USC Village, there were some students dressed as video game characters, classic cartoons and other memorable costumes. Once an activity that was meant for kids, Halloween has turned into something fun and unforgettable that adults can also enjoy.\n\nSome students around campus were seen dressed as Tigger, Fred Flintsone, Ash from \u201cPokemon\u201d and so many more. Whether dressing up in an \u201ceerie-sistible\u201d costume or attending a Halloween party, students are celebrating this spooky holiday in their own way.\n\nKai Knight, a graduate student studying chemistry, dressed up as Blossom from \u201cThe Powerpuff Girls.\u201d She mentioned how she mixed up an old costume to make this new one. \u201cI bought the pink dress to dress up as Barbie and then I was like, \u2018What can go with this for a costume?\u2019 and now I\u2019m wearing it for Blossom,\u201d Knight said.\n\nThis year many people are wearing more than one costume for multiple Halloween celebrations. Knight said she had a costume for the weekend and the weekday.\n\nChelle Canles, a junior majoring in music industry, said she had two costumes prepared months ago, but in the end, she decided to go with something different. Canles dressed as a bunny fairy character based off the video game \u2018Danganronpa II,\u2019 but that wasn\u2019t the first costume she had in mind.\n\n\u201cI actually have a Wanda at home that I made months prior to Halloween,\u201d she said.\n\nHalloween originated with the ancient festival Samhain, which was primarily celebrated in Ireland. At the time, people would light bonfires and scare off the ghosts that came to the world of humans from other dimensions. Wearing unique clothing was also required during the Samhain festival, as it helped the Celts to ward off all the nasty spirits that came to visit living people.\n\nNow, most people don\u2019t put that meaning into Halloween anymore. But, following the traditions is the central part of the whole celebration, which makes people have fun while performing various scary tricks on each other. Now some people dress up to their favorite characters or to get attention.\n\nCanles mentioned she likes the attention she gets from her costume. \u201cIt\u2019s the one day that I can grab people\u2019s attention and be very open about it by dressing however I want,\u201d Canles said.\n\nAnother student who stood out from the crowd was Danni from Annenberg, who dressed as the Kool-Aid man. \u201cI picked this costume because it was just the largest costume I found,\u201d she said while chuckling inside the inflatable costume. \u201cI just wanted to take up space.\u201d\n\nThis year USC celebrated Halloween a few days earlier. Last Thursday, the university held a Trojan Halloween Party, with games, prizes and food for students to enjoy. They encouraged students to wear costumes.\n```"}

In this raw, thoughtful and detailed portrayal, the line between delusion and divine conviction is finer than ever in \u201cThe Mission.\u201d When it comes to grappling with relationships between colonialism and faith, or lack thereof, the film is an unflattering yet necessary mirror for even the most secular audience members.\n\nJohn Chau was a young Christian missionary who aspired to do what none of his predecessors had dared: embark on a theological quest to spread the gospel to the Indigenous people of remote North Sentinel Island. The voyage \u2014 disguised as a fantastical adventure in his mind, as evidenced through his diary entries read aloud by an actor throughout the film \u2014 became a fatal pursuit when the Sentinelese shot him with arrows.\n\nJesse Moss and Amanda McBaine, the husband and wife directing team behind the documentary, set out to delve deeper into the story that set the media ablaze in 2018. Instead of shoving a one-sided, vilified version of the events down viewers\u2019 throats for dramatic effect, Moss and McBaine gently place several perspectives into your hands for consideration.\n\n\u201cWe came to understand that John subscribed to two faiths: his Christian faith, but also the faith of the religion of adventure and exploration,\u201d Moss said at a University of Southern California screening.\n\nThe film is a metaphysical exploration of the evangelical superiority complex, effectively embarking on a critical \u2014 but most importantly, fair \u2014 examination of the extreme religious mindset. Moss and McBaine simultaneously and intimately explore the nuances of the young man who let his conviction take him too far through interviews with old friends, a former missionary, an anthropologist, historian and a gut-wrenching letter from John\u2019s father, Patrick.\n\nArguably the most powerful, Patrick Chau\u2019s letter, read by an actor, addresses the pain of losing his son to unbridled faith and a quest he desperately tried to discourage. His sobering narrative is illustrated by hand-sketched animation, bringing John\u2019s world to life.\n\nFor McBaine, this father-son relationship is the spine, heart and soul of the entire movie. To humanize actions that are unthinkable to many is an uncomfortable and daunting task, but Moss and McBaine do so thoughtfully.\n\nThe story is structured so that it will resonate with audiences regardless of their backgrounds and beliefs. \u201cWe live in such a polarized and divided country and we\u2019re not naive about that. But I think it\u2019s important to find ways of connection if we can,\u201d Moss told the screening audience.\n\nThe team also spoke passionately about their hope to engage faith communities in conversations that re-evaluate the problematic nature of missionary work.\n\nThe following week, when film critic and USC professor Leonard Maltin asked that same audience for their thoughts on the film, students spoke more candidly about their distaste. One voiced their anger about the filmmakers bestowing a platform on John Chau. They felt that both sides did not deserve to be told in this story. Another student echoed that, saying they \u201cdespised\u201d the film for empathizing with Chau, which elicited an explosion of applause from the theater.\n\nThis type of discourse, however, does not leave room to consider the implications of that kind of lack of journalistic integrity. If documentarians are to portray radical, polarizing ideas from only the side that aligns with their point of view, the film will inevitably fail at its primary goal: allowing a variety of audiences to reevaluate their perspectives.\n\nThe film\u2019s final product needed to preserve a picture of the full truth, which was a priority for McBaine and Moss. At their core, people are not black and white; for the film to claim so would be a disservice to our understanding of any individual or group. If the filmmakers were to refuse to portray the nuanced ideologies of the people on all sides of this story, we would merely be watching an echo chamber.\n\nJohn Chau should not be glorified, but he must be understood, and understanding a person means reflecting on both the good and the bad. It is for this reason among so many others that where so many documentaries fail, Moss and McBaine shine.\n\n\u201cThe Mission\u201d is currently in select theaters throughout Los Angeles.\n```"}

It\u2019s Halloween which means there\u2019s just one month left in the Pac-12 regular season. But before the conference goes fully defunct, let\u2019s rank each football program by level of spookiness. Spookiness is a subjective metric but the way I look at it is the spookiest teams are the ones that you\u2019re afraid to play on your schedule. They\u2019re also the teams that have no business being difficult \u2014 sorry USC, Oregon and Washington, teams expect elite competition from you.\n\nWith all of that being said, let\u2019s get into the rankings.\n\n12. Colorado Buffaloes\nTeams spooked by Colorado: Cal\nOh, Colorado. Until Deion Sanders came to Boulder, teams had very little to fear from the program. Colorado is the only Pac-12 team to not have a winning record against any other conference team in the Pac-12 era. To add insult to injury, the Buffaloes are also the only team to be winless against another Pac-12 team in that span (0-12 against USC). The only team scared of Colorado is Cal after the Golden Bears gave Colorado its only win of the season last year, but that was only an embarrassing loss for Cal because of how bad Colorado was.\n\n11. Cal Golden Bears\nTeams spooked by Cal: Oregon State, Washington, Washington State\nMuch like Colorado, Cal hasn\u2019t given many teams a reason to be afraid. However, the Golden Bears\u2019 recent history with Washington might make some Husky fans a bit fearful. In 2018, a year where Washington won the Pac-12 title and went to the Rose Bowl, the Huskies lost to three ranked opponents \u2014 and Cal. Washington also lost to Cal the following year in just the second game of the season. The Golden Bears were only 3-9 against Washington during the time of the Pac-12, but the few wins they did have deflated the Huskies.\n\n10. USC Trojans\nTeams spooked by USC: UCLA, Washington\nUSC is a hard team to place. The Trojans are feared by many teams since even USC on an off day can dominate anyone due to the Trojans\u2019 level of talent. But does that make the team spooky? If other teams know to circle the USC on their calendar, it\u2019s hard for the Trojans to spook other programs. Still, USC has given fits to two historically successful programs: UCLA and Washington. The Trojans have won six of their last eight against UCLA and USC has a 3-2 record against Washington in the Pac-12 era. The Trojans\u2019 last win over the Huskies was Washington\u2019s only regular season loss en route to a College Football Playoff berth in 2016.\n\n9. Washington Huskies\nTeams spooked by Washington: Oregon State, Utah, Washington State\nWashington is another hard team to rank because teams expect a tough game out of the Huskies. However, the Huskies\u2019 dominance over some of its nearby rivals \u2014 two programs plenty of teams struggle to consistently beat \u2014 is impressive. Washington has won eight of its last nine meetings against Washington State and 10 of its last 11 against Oregon State. UW also seems to be Utah\u2019s kryptonite. The Huskies went 7-2 against the Utes in the Pac-12 era, including a perfect record in Salt Lake City for Washington. That\u2019s not an easy feat at all.\n\n8. Oregon Ducks\nTeams spooked by Oregon: Oregon State, UCLA, USC, Utah, Washington\nOf the top programs in the conference, Oregon is the most feared by the other top teams. The Ducks had won 12 in a row against Washington from 2004 through 2016. Oregon has won four of the last five against USC. The Ducks are one of the few teams that spooks Utah with Oregon winning 7 of the teams\u2019 11 meetings in the Pac-12 era. It\u2019s hard to classify Oregon as spooky for the same reasons as Washington and USC, but Oregon is definitely the spookiest of that group.\n\n7. Washington State Cougars\nTeams spooked by Washington State: Arizona, Oregon, Oregon State\nThe Cougars may not necessarily have the best record against the other teams in the conference, but a trip to the Palouse coming up on a team\u2019s schedule will cause any head coach to tense up in fright. Believe it or not, the team that might be the most afraid of WSU is Oregon. The Cougars beat the Ducks four straight times from 2015 through 2018 and it took a last-second Camden Lewis field goal in 2019 for Oregon to finally break the curse of the Cougars. Diehard Pac-12 fans will also remember that WSU was a missed pass interference call away from potentially knocking Oregon off on the Ducks\u2019 run to the College Football Playoff in 2014.\n\n6. UCLA Bruins\nTeams spooked by UCLA: Washington, Washington State\nUCLA is another team to be wary of even if the Bruins are having a down year. But in particular, for some reason, the Bruins scare the life out of the Washington schools. UCLA is 4-2 against each school since 2011 and the Bruins\u2019 last win over Washington effectively ended the Huskies\u2019 Pac-12 title hopes last season. Also, who can forget when UCLA overcame a 32-point second-half deficit against the Cougars in 2019? If you go trick-or-treating in a Dorian Thompson-Robinson jersey in Pullman, people might be too afraid to open their doors.\n\n5. Arizona Wildcats\nTeams spooked by Arizona: Cal, Oregon, USC\nArizona has brought the fright to some of the conference\u2019s top schools over the years. Ten of the Wildcats\u2019 last 13 games against USC have been decided by one score and the last four have been decided by an average of less than six points. Arizona is also one of two schools to beat Marcus Mariota twice while he was at Oregon and handed Mariota his largest loss while he was a Duck \u2014 a 42-16 beating in 2013. If you go trick-or-treating in a Scooby Wright jersey in Eugene... You know the rest.\n\n4. Oregon State Beavers\nTeams spooked by Oregon State: UCLA, USC, Utah\nThey say that great seasons go to die in Corvallis. The Beavers are 15-1 at home since 2021 with the only loss coming against last season\u2019s eventual Heisman Trophy winner \u2014 by three on the ghastly Pac-12 Network. USC has had other issues with Oregon State over the years as well. In 2006, USC finished the season ranked No. 4 in the nation. In 2008, USC finished the season ranked No. 3 in the nation. In both seasons, the Trojans were knocked off by the Beavers in Corvallis. There are few teams scarier than Oregon State at home.\n\n3. Utah Utes\nTeams spooked by Utah: Arizona, Oregon State, Oregon, Stanford, USC\nDoes Utah need any explanation? Utah has become a program capable of beating just about anyone. USC has lost four games in a row to the Utes. Utah holds an 8-4 record against UCLA and a 5-1 record against Stanford during the Pac-12 era. Utah and Oregon are probably the only two teams in the conference spooked by each other. Oregon won the last meeting on Saturday and sunk Utah\u2019s College Football Playoff hopes in the Pac-12 Championship in 2019. The Utes returned the favor in 2021 by knocking off Oregon twice within a two-week period \u2014 the first by 31 points and the second by 28 points in the Pac-12 Championship.\n\n2. Arizona State Sun Devils\nTeams spooked by Arizona State: Arizona, Oregon, USC, Utah, Washington, Washington State\nIf you\u2019re a top team and have a trip to Tempe on your schedule, you can pencil in a loss right away. As their mascot might suggest, the Sun Devils frighten just about every team in the Pac-12. They took down No. 21 Washington last season. They put Justin Herbert\u2019s College Football Playoff dreams to bed on primetime television in 2019. It\u2019s also worth noting that Arizona State has a 6-3 record against Washington in the Pac-12 era and currently holds a 6-5 record against Utah in the same span. Saturday\u2019s game will determine whether the Sun Devils end the Pac-12 era with a winning record over the Utes.\n\n1. Stanford Cardinal\nTeams spooked by Stanford: Arizona State, Cal, Oregon, Oregon State, UCLA, USC, Washington, Washington State\nStanford has mastered the most terrifying spook of them all \u2014 the jump scare. The Cardinal can play terribly against horrible opponents and then, out of nowhere, beat Oregon a week after the Ducks took down Ohio State in Columbus. Or they can come back from a 29-point half-time deficit at Colorado. Or they can nearly knock off No. 5 Washington \u2014 a program Stanford has beat in seven of their last 10 meetings at Stanford Stadium. Or... you get the point. Stanford is never a team you expect to challenge you, but it\u2019s almost inevitable that the Cardinal will catch a few teams off guard every year. Good luck to anyone who\u2019s set to face Stanford in the ACC \u2014 they\u2019ll need it.\n\n\u201cShout\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nBy Will Camardella October 31, 2023 at 2:51 pm PDT\n\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. For most teams in the Pac-12, the regular season is two-thirds complete. The larger the sample size gets in college football, the less preseason perceptions and individual game performances matter. For this week, I especially valued the teams that have shown the most consistent strength, while punishing teams that have strung together multiple underwhelming performances or have shown a consistent weak spot. This week, I also am valuing head-to-head matchups less than I have all year. Although seeing two teams play each other on the field is a valuable resource to compare what two teams are, many things change throughout the football season that can sway my opinion on whether or not a given result would happen again. That is why I ranked half the teams in this conference ahead of at least one team they have lost to this year.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my final rankings for the month of October.\n\n1. Oregon Ducks (7-1, 4-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nIt may be shocking to see me rank Oregon above Washington, despite Washington\u2019s head-to-head win a few weeks ago. However, I believe the decision is warranted, given the Huskies\u2019 recent struggles and the nature of what the Ducks just accomplished. Utah has been the class of the Pac-12 for a few years, and the home-field advantage in Salt Lake City is one of the best in the country. The Utes had not lost a game at home with fans in the stadium since September 2018. What I love about this Oregon team is that, whether the game is on national television against a college football powerhouse or on Pac-12 Network against a conference bottomfeeder, we see the same performance. Even including their loss to Washington, the Ducks are outscoring their opponents by an average of nearly 30 points per game and have only had two games this season decided by one score. Oregon plays hard-nosed defense, and Bo Nix\u2019s offense can score against even the most stout defenses in the country, as the Utah game proved. The Ducks are the most complete team in the conference, and, although Washington won round one, I would pick them to take down the Huskies on a neutral field in December.\n\n2. Washington Huskies (8-0, 5-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nWashington is the only team in the Pac-12 with an unblemished record, but their last two performances have concerned me. It is one thing to have one off-night against a bottom-tier opponent, but UW doing so two weeks in a row troubled me enough to drop the team below a surging Oregon. My primary concern with the Huskies is that they only really win games through their deep passing game. As both the Arizona and the Arizona State game showed, if that deep passing game can be limited, then the Huskies are in trouble. They cannot win games on the ground, after averaging just 3.4 yards per carry against lowly Stanford. Even more troubling than their ground attack was the fact that the defense allowed 33 points and nearly 500 yards to the worst offense in the conference. Washington\u2019s offensive explosiveness may be enough to carry the team to a conference title game, and perhaps even the College Football Playoff. However, a true national title contender needs to be able to do multiple things at an elite level, and Oregon is much closer to being that team than the Huskies are.\n\n3. Oregon State Beavers (6-2, 3-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nOregon State\u2019s loss in Tucson was maddening, especially as the team finally looked like a true contender to go to the Pac-12 Championship game. Normally, it would be grounds for me to drop them, but I could not find a team that I could justify passing them after this week. Both of my contenders to take the third spot \u2013 UCLA and Utah \u2013 have lost to the Beavers by multiple scores in head-to-head matchups and have serious flaws of their own. The Pac-12 is still a quarterback-driven conference in 2023, and DJ Uiagalelei still has some work to do to keep up with the top-tier signal callers. Since the start of conference play, Uiagalelei has only completed over 60% of his passes once, against Cal. His 17-to-4 touchdown-to-interception ratio is great for a team that usually plays great defense and is capable of running the ball, but in a game like we saw on Saturday, Oregon State needs its quarterback to elevate the rest of the roster and find a way to win. The Beavers\u2019 defense will also need to find a way to make its game travel away from Corvallis. In four home games, the unit has allowed less than 12 points per game, but in four road games, they have given up more than 30 per game. OSU\u2019s trip to Boulder next week will be the last chance to turn the corner on the road before it visits Autzen Stadium to close out the regular season.\n\n4. UCLA Bruins (6-2, 3-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nUCLA\u2019s defense remains an elite unit after dominating Colorado at the line of scrimmage throughout the game on Saturday. What Chip Kelly needed to compete for a conference title was a stable offense that could run the ball and protect the football. It seems that Ethan Garbers has stabilized the quarterback position for the Bruins; he has completed 72% of his passes since taking over the starting job two weeks ago. He has tossed just one interception in that span in 55 pass attempts, a stark contrast to what Dante Moore was doing under center. Two fumbles by Carson Steele were costly but should be much easier to clean up than Moore\u2019s interception problem. UCLA\u2019s offense is far from an elite unit, but its defense ranks first in the conference in both points and yards allowed per game. Their formula for winning games may not be successful against the likes of Oregon and Washington, but neither of those teams are on the Bruins\u2019 schedule. I believe they profile well against all of their remaining opponents, so don\u2019t be shocked if they finish a strong third in the conference standings.\n\n5. Utah Utes (6-2, 3-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nUtah has had some memorable moments despite facing a ton of adversity this season, but their blowout loss this weekend was a serious black mark. It appeared that the Utes\u2019 offense had finally turned the corner after a 34-point performance against USC, but they failed to reach the end zone once against Oregon\u2019s defense. Bryson Barnes is not even close to a good enough quarterback to allow Utah to compete with the top tier of this conference. He has thrown for over 160 yards just once this season, and he still has more interceptions than touchdown passes on the year. Utah\u2019s run game was no better on Saturday, failing to average even three yards per carry. Just because the Ducks, one of the most potent offenses in the country, scored 35 on the Utes\u2019 defense does not mean that the unit was overrated and won\u2019t bounce back in the future. However, it is clear that the Cam Rising injury sunk any chances they may have of winning a third straight Pac-12 title.\n\n6. Arizona Wildcats (5-3, 3-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nPrior to its huge win over Oregon State on Saturday, Arizona had not won back-to-back games against ranked opponents since 2014. Every coach can say that their team will earn momentum from close losses like the ones the Wildcats suffered to USC and Washington, but Jedd Fisch\u2019s team has actually done so. The Washington State win was a blowout, but pulling out this close game has proven that Arizona\u2019s previous heartbreak taught them how to win a tight football game. This is the second straight year Fisch has had his team playing its best football late in the season; their signature win in 2022 came in November against a ranked UCLA. Freshman quarterback Noah Fifita has progressed from a capable backup to a player who can lead his team to victory, as shown by his two fourth-quarter touchdown passes this weekend. He overcame a weak running performance, looked a very strong defense in the eye and completed nearly 80% of his passes. This win is more validation that Fisch is building a much stronger program than Arizona fans have been used to. Although their early-season struggles will prevent them from doing anything truly special in 2023, the Wildcats will be a dangerous team down the stretch with the way they are currently playing.\n\n7. USC Trojans (7-2, 5-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nUSC may have a head coach with a 73-15 career record and the reigning Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback, but I do not see a one-point win over lowly Cal as an underperformance. That game, in which the Trojans needed a two-point conversion stop in the final minute to avoid their third straight loss, is par for the course from what we have seen from this team all season long. With the lone exception of the first half against Colorado, USC has not looked like an elite football team since their win over Stanford on Sept. 9. The Trojans\u2019 record may still look impressive at the surface level, but their point differential is -20 over their last five games. Yes, they are 5-1 in Pac-12 play, but the teams they have beaten have a combined record of 7-19 in conference games. Offensively, USC often looks out of sync with receivers who struggle to get open and an offensive line that has been unable to protect Caleb Williams for much of the season. Defensively, the Trojans are a disaster defending the run, allowing a conference-high 172 ground yards per game. Lincoln Riley claimed on Saturday he believed his team was still capable of winning the Pac-12 title. With USC\u2019s final three games being against Washington, Oregon and UCLA, I believe Riley\u2019s group has already won its final game in the regular season.\n\n8. Washington State Cougars (4-4, 1-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nWashington State\u2019s losing streak now extends to four games after the team took its most humiliating defeat yet at the hands of Arizona State. The Cougars are now allowing 36 points per conference game, with three of those five games being against teams in the bottom half of the Pac-12 in scoring. The Sun Devils have been dysfunctional at many points on offense this year, but they had no trouble moving the ball up and down the field on WSU. On the offensive side, only Utah and Stanford are scoring fewer points in conference play than Washington State. Cam Ward had decent counting numbers on Saturday, but the Cougars failed to run the ball effectively and failed on nine of 12 third-down attempts. The one-dimensional nature of the offense has been its biggest problem, as they are one of two teams in the entire conference failing to rush for over 100 yards per game. Washington State looked like a formidable challenge in the Pac-12 after a strong non-conference showing. However, this team\u2019s conference record has demonstrated that the Cougars are not yet close to ready.\n\n9. Colorado Buffaloes (4-4, 1-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nColorado\u2019s problems remained against UCLA on Saturday. The Buffaloes averaged just one yard per rushing attempt, and Shedeur Sanders was sacked seven times. When the team was successful in 2023, it was because Sanders\u2019 play at quarterback elevated the rest of the roster. Sanders\u2019 performance was far from elite in this matchup; he averaged just five yards per attempt and only one of his receivers eclipsed 50 yards. Yes, the Bruins have a strong defense, but Deion Sanders should have been able to pull out a win on a night when his team won the turnover battle 4-0. Colorado continues to be a weak team at the line of scrimmage, a recipe for disaster against most teams in the Pac-12 this season. If Shedeur cannot find a way to overcome his roster\u2019s flaws in the final four games of the season as he did in the first three, the Buffaloes will have no chance at bowl eligibility.\n\n10. Cal Golden Bears (3-5, 1-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nI am sure that the Golden Bears came out of their game against USC, in which they hung with a preseason top-10 team until the final minute, feeling relatively positive. I, however, was not so impressed. I have already expressed that I believe the Trojans are overrated, and Cal should have been able to close that game out, given the 14-point lead it had early in the fourth quarter. The Golden Bears were extremely careless with the football on Saturday, turning the ball over four times and gifting USC 20 points off of those turnovers. This has been a pattern all year long for them; their 16 giveaways are tied for the 12th most in the NCAA. Cal can do some good things on the offensive side of the ball, especially in the running game with Jaydn Ott, but its mistakes are too costly and occur too often for those successes to translate into wins.\n\n11. Arizona State Sun Devils (2-6, 1-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\nArizona State was the last team in the Pac-12 to earn a conference win, but it finally did so by taking down Washington State on Saturday. For much of the season, the Sun Devils\u2019 offense has been pretty one-note, running everything through running back Cam Skattebo. This weekend, the unit finally found another threat in backup running back DeCarlos Brooks, who found the end zone three separate times. Together, the running back tandem of Skattebo and Brooks averaged 8.5 yards per carry, and quarterback Trenton Bourguet played a turnover-free game. ASU\u2019s momentum from their strong effort in Seattle has carried over, which is a really good sign for head coach Kenny Dillingham. The Sun Devils still are not a very good football team, but they have shaken off a disastrous start to the season and are playing respectable football again.\n\n12. Stanford Cardinal (2-6, 1-5 Pac-12)\nIt was nice to see Stanford finally put up a fight against a far superior opponent, but it has still folded to better competition far more often than it hasn\u2019t. In a sport where the home team wins about 70% of the time, the Cardinal are still looking for their first win in Stanford Stadium in 2023. Although its offense has made some progress over the last two weeks, Stanford\u2019s defense has made none whatsoever. The unit has allowed at least 42 points in four consecutive games; only UMass, Southern Miss, Temple and UAB have allowed more points per game on the FBS level than the Cardinal. Now that Arizona State has joined Stanford in the two-win club, I feel even more comfortable keeping Troy Taylor\u2019s group in the basement of this conference. The reality is that ASU has played inspired football far more often than the Cardinal, regardless of what happened on Saturday night.\n```"}

After 120 minutes of action, games are decided by just one person with one kick against the goalkeeper with everyone watching. A penalty kick in itself does not seem that difficult. The player has no defenders pressuring the shot, and it is a wide open kick. However, there is so much more to a penalty kick, and the success often comes down to mental strength.\n\nThe hopes and dreams of fans and players alike lie on the shoulders of the player who takes the penalty, and with these added stresses, anxiety can build up on the player shooting the ball. Players sometimes seem to rush their shots, as if to leave the moment, due to the pressure. The fear of making a mistake, being known forever as the player who missed, not knowing if they\u2019ll ever get an opportunity in the World Cup again, all could rush through a players head as they walk up to the penalty spot.\n\nFear of backlash from their country and fans alike add to the fear of the penalty kick. After the 2016 Copa America final penalty shootout, Messi had missed a penalty. Backlash on social media from fans helped make him temporarily retire from the national team. Meagan Rapinoe\u2019s miss in this summer\u2019s edition of the Women\u2019s World Cup led to her being heavily criticized and attacked by fans and media. Other players hear stories such as these and know the consequences of missing, again adding to pressure.\n\nStatistically, in the 2022/23 season, the chance of scoring a penalty shot in one of Europe\u2019s top 5 leagues is 75%, with numbers ranging from 71% in the premiership to 86% in Ligue Un. In Liga MX, the percent is 79.4%, while in MLS it is 87.2% this season. The World Cup on the other hand has a conversion rate of 71.5%, and the Champions League has a conversion rate of 71%, while the Qatar World Cup had a conversion rate of just 58%. Players in the best leagues fail to transfer their skill to the World Cup where pressure is much higher.\n\nThe World Cup and Champions League both have penalty shootouts where pressure taking a penalty is highest. Even though these competitions have roughly the same players due to Europe having the best players in the world, the shift in penalty percentages highlights the anxiety that players develop when they take a penalty. Rapinoe for example had scored over 20 straight penalties for her club team, but missed on the biggest stage for her country due to pressure. Kylian Mbappe, notable for his World Cup hat trick in Qatar, has a penalty conversion rate for club (less pressure) games is 82.6% whereas in the World Cup it\u2019s 75%. Other notable players follow this pattern. In club games with less importance versus the World Cup, Cristiano Ronaldo has a 70% versus 85.4%, and Messi scored 75% for country in the World Cup but 78.5% for club.\n\nThese numbers show that even the best players in the world aren\u2019t immune to the pressure. This form of pressure faced by high-level athletes when taking penalties is simply called external pressure. The anxiety that develops from these situations causes athletes to display physical attributes of fear. The racing heart and sweating that we\u2019re all accustomed to, along with their thinking becoming unclear, leads to athletes physically not being able to perform like they usually could.\n\nThinking about the effects of missing takes up space in our working memory. Working memory, more often known as short term memory, has limited capacity to operate with. When we\u2019re anxious before a test, we can\u2019t think as well due to our working memory not being able to multitask with the pressure and the task at hand. The same goes for players as they have to juggle the fans jeering, their run up, and most importantly, where to place the penalty kick.\n\nArousal theory can help explain why pressure makes it hard for players to score. According to arousal theory, there is an optimal amount of arousal needed for performance. As an example, the desire to do well on a test leads us to study so that we\u2019ll be well prepared. However, there is a threshold for arousal, and once you pass it, this is when individuals find that they are overwhelmed. With the nations and players\u2019 hopes on the line along with everything else mentioned before, these athletes have well passed their threshold for peak performance, and are negatively affected by these pressures.\n\nOne of the ways to handle performance anxiety is to practice such events multiple times beforehand, but it\u2019s impossible to replicate the same situation of a stadium on the biggest stage with a training field where nothing is on the line. Along with the fatigue of games, penalties are vastly harder to score in the World Cup than they are in regular competitions or in training. On the surface, a penalty kick might seem simple, but with so many factors at play, they can become very formidable for even the world\u2019s best players.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Victor Kevorkian\nOctober 31, 2023 at 12:16 pm PDT\n\nKansas shocks Oklahoma, 38-33\nA Jayhawk interception returned for a 37-yard touchdown on Oklahoma\u2019s first offensive drive would set the tempo for the biggest upset of the week. This Big 12 matchup was much too close for comfort at halftime, as the Sooners led by just four points heading into the break. The Jayhawks defense turned over the Sooners three times on the day, and were able to capitalize offensively. Oklahoma\u2019s 38 points allowed made for its highest tally of the season.\n\nKansas quarterback Jason Bean did not light up the box score by any means, but led impressive drives when the Jayhawks needed points. Bean threw for 218 yards with two interceptions, adding 62 rushing yards and a go-ahead rushing touchdown that put Kansas in front with 55 seconds to go. Oklahoma\u2019s offense was able to sustain productive drives despite their turnovers. Quarterback Dillon Gabriel threw for just 171 yards and one interception, but was effective on the ground with 64 yards and three touchdowns. Running back Tawee Walker was the Sooners\u2019 best offensive weapon, rushing 23 times for 146 yards and a touchdown.\n\nEach team had its fair share of mistakes, but the Jayhawks\u2019 third-down defense and turnovers were key components in their major upset victory. Oklahoma (7-1) falls four spots in the AP Top 25 Poll to No. 10 after their first loss of the season. Kansas (6-2) rejoins the poll at No. 22 after its impressive home win.\n\nGeorgia dominates Florida, 43-20\nAn early 7-0 deficit made for little concern for the Bulldogs, who would go on to score 36 unanswered points. Georgia quarterback Carson Beck put on a show without his top target Brock Bowers. Beck completed 19 of his 28 pass attempts for 315 yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Ladd McConkey accounted for 135 of those yards and a score, while running back Daijun Edwards tallied 95 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\n\nFlorida\u2019s offense received the opening kickoff and drove down the field in just seven plays, ending in a 25-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Graham Mertz to receiver Eugene Wilson. The Gators would fail to score another point until early in the fourth quarter, when the game was essentially decided. Mertz had a solid outing statistically despite the offensive stagnancy, throwing for 230 yards, two touchdowns and adding a late rushing score.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s (8-0) continued dominance has them sitting on top of the college football world at No. 1 in the poll. Florida (5-3) remains unranked after failing to ride some initial momentum to an exceptional home victory.\n\nUSC holds off California to avoid third straight loss, 50-49\nA game that consisted of 1,024 combined yards, five combined turnovers and 99 combined points made for an instant classic at California Memorial Stadium. After a string of lackluster performances, quarterback Caleb Williams got back on track in this contest, completing 23 of his 40 pass attempts for 369 yards and four total touchdowns.\n\nRunning back Marshawn Lloyd continued his impressive 2023 campaign, logging 20 touches for 187 total yards and two touchdowns. Receiver Tahj Washington led the team with 102 receiving yards. The Trojans jumped out to a quick 14-0 lead midway through the first quarter, but the Golden Bears did not give in to the adversity.\n\nCalifornia would string together four touchdown drives in the first half to take a commanding 28-14 lead into halftime. Quarterback Fernando Mendoza threw for 292 yards, four total touchdowns and one interception. Running back Jaydn Ott was the star of the Golden Bears offense, rushing for 153 yards and three touchdowns, including scores from 43 and 61 yards out.\n\nThis back-and-forth contest saw the Golden Bears down by 7 with 3:33 left to play. Mendoza would command a 9-play, 79-yard touchdown drive, finding receiver Jaivian Thomas for the potential game-tying score from 13 yards out. Cal decided to go for a two-point conversion instead of tying the game with an extra point, which they failed, allowing Southern Cal to escape with a win.\n\nUSC (7-2) remains ranked No. 24 in the AP poll. California (3-5) remains unranked.\n\nLouisville shuts out Duke, 23-0\nAfter jumping out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, the Cardinals never looked back. Louisville relied on their run game in this contest, dominating the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. Running back Jawhar Jordan led the way with 21 carries for 163 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nIt was not always pretty for the Cardinals offensively, as they went 2-10 on third down. Their defensive efforts and control of the clock were the key reasons they came out victorious. The Blue Devils could not get anything going offensively, getting outgained 351-202. Quarterbacks Riley Leonard and Grayson Loftis went a combined 12 of 28 passing for 151 yards and one interception.\n\nThe running game was not working, either, as the team combined for just 51 yards rushing on 21 attempts. Louisville\u2019s (7-1) impressive shutout granted them the No. 15 spot in the AP Poll. Duke (5-3) exits the poll after an underwhelming performance.\n\nOregon dominates Utah on the road, 35-6\nOregon quarterback Bo Nix continued his bid for the Heisman trophy with an impressive showing against a formidable Pac-12 opponent. Nix completed 24 of his 31 pass attempts for 248 yards and three total touchdowns.\n\nReceiver Troy Franklin led the team in receiving with 99 yards and a score. Oregon did whatever they wanted offensively, building methodical drives and protecting the ball in the process. The Ducks were just as impressive defensively, holding the Utes to just two field goals and pitching a second-half shutout.\n\nUtah struggled to get anything going offensively, turning the ball over twice. It was a tough outing for the Utes at home in what was easily their biggest game of the season. Oregon (7-1) jumped two spots in the poll to No. 6 after the win. Utah (6-2) dropped five spots to No. 18 after their second conference loss.\n\nWashington tops Stanford to stay unbeaten, 42-33\nHuskies quarterback Michael Penix continued to impress in a game that was closer than initially anticipated. The Heisman favorite threw for 369 yards, four touchdowns and an interception.\n\nWide receiver Ja\u2019Lynn Polk impressed with 148 yards and two touchdowns on only five receptions, including a 92-yard touchdown catch late in the second. Stanford was able to stay in this contest despite major contributions from Washington\u2019s playmakers.\n\nCardinal quarterback Ashton Daniels completed 31 of his 50 pass attempts for 367 yards and a touchdown. Daniels\u2019 favorite target was receiver Elic Ayomanor, who hauled in nine catches for 146 yards and a touchdown.\n\nStanford played efficiently on offense, outgaining Washington 499 to 460 and outpossessing the Pac-12 frontrunners 35:10 to 24:50. Stanford\u2019s gritty play through three quarters saw them down by just two heading into the final frame with the score at 28-26.\n\nPenix showed why he is the Heisman frontrunner, commanding two touchdown drives to keep the Huskies in front and put away any thoughts of an upset. Although Stanford kept this game close, Washington was able to stay in front throughout all four quarters.\n\nWashington (8-0) stays put at No. 5 in the poll, with playoff hopes still intact. Stanford (2-6) remains unranked.\n\nUCLA continues to impress defensively, beats Colorado, 28-16\nSeven was the magic number in this game \u2014 that\u2019s how many times the Bruins sacked Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders. UCLA\u2019s defense kept the Buffs\u2019 electric offense in check all night, allowing just one touchdown late in the fourth quarter.\n\nSanders wasn\u2019t bad by any means, throwing for 217 yards and one touchdown with no turnovers. But UCLA had him flustered all night, preventing any of the flashy highlight plays he displayed early in the year.\n\nBruins quarterback Ethan Garbers had himself a second straight efficient outing, throwing for 269 yards, two touchdowns and an interception while completing 74 percent of his passes. Garbers found receiver Logan Loya for 111 of those yards.\n\nUCLA (6-2) jumps three spots to No. 20 in the AP poll, while Colorado (4-4) remains unranked.\n\nGeorgia Tech bests North Carolina in shootout, 46-42\nA 28-24 lead for the Tar Heels heading into half was shaping up to be a tight finish in Atlanta. North Carolina saw contributions from all over on offense. Quarterback Drake Maye completed 17 of his 25 pass attempts for 310 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nRunning back Omarion Hampton carried the ball 29 times for 153 yards and two touchdowns, while receiver Bryson Nesbit led the team with 89 receiving yards and a score. The Tar Heels offense found most of their success in the first half, scoring just 14 points in the second after a strong start.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets offense was just as explosive, if not more. Quarterback Haynes King completed 23 of his 30 pass attempts for 287 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. Running back Dontae Smith ran for 178 yards and one touchdown on 22 carries, and receiver Eric Singleton caught eight passes for 117 yards.\n\nThe fourth quarter was the difference in this contest. North Carolina was in good shape heading into the quarter, up by multiple scores. It took a 22-7 run in favor of the Yellow Jackets for them to prevail, much to the delight of the home fans.\n\nNorth Carolina (6-2) exits the poll, falling from No. 17. Georgia Tech (4-4) remains unranked.\n\nArizona continues to impress, beats Oregon State, 27-24\nThe Wildcats have played a tough stretch of Pac-12 opponents in the past four weeks and have either beaten or come close to upsetting some of the premier programs in the conference.\n\nQuarterback Noah Fifita executed an impressive offensive game plan for the Wildcats, throwing for 275 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Fifita spread the ball nicely, finding eight different receivers throughout the game. Receiver Tetairoa McMillan led the way with eight catches for 80 yards and a score.\n\nThe Beavers were also efficient offensively, playing mistake-free football. Quarterback DJ Uiagalelei threw for 218 yards and two touchdown passes. Running back Damien Martinez led the team in rushing yards with 87, while receiver Jack Velling caught five balls for 71 yards and a touchdown.\n\nA low-scoring affair through three quarters made for an exciting fourth quarter, in which each team scored two touchdowns. In the end, it was Fifita\u2019s 40-yard touchdown pass to receiver Michael Wiley that put the Wildcats on top. They would extend their lead later in the quarter, with a late touchdown by the Beavers bringing the final score within a possession.\n\nArizona (5-3) remains unranked, but an upset next week against UCLA would surely give this team a much-deserved spot in the poll. Oregon State (6-2) drops five spots to No. 16 in the AP poll.\n```"}

(Photo by Jeremiah Estrada)\n\nBy Jeremiah Estrada\nOctober 31, 2023 at 12:08 pm PDT\n\nMore and more Filipino American authors and stories are being published and represented, something the Liwanag Literary Festival looks to recognize. This festival saw the unison of Filipino American History Month and National Book Month, both of which are celebrated in October. The second annual book fest took place on Saturday, October 21 at the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library in Long Beach.\n\nThe day was chalked full of events including a lineup of Filipino American authors. They write for a variety of genres that range from children\u2019s books to young adult to nonfiction to romance, and more. The events of the festival included author readings, Q&As, book signing and a performance by Millikan High School\u2019s Tinikling Troupe. There was also a pop-up bookstore, food and retail vendors and kids crafts available throughout the day.\n\nThe author lineup featured diverse perspectives on the challenges and experiences faced by the Filipino community. The readings and Q&As included groups of authors of different genres such as adult literature and young adult/teen who offered insight into their backgrounds and dived into the different stories from their books.\n\nThe emcees prepared the following questions that each author on the different panels answered to share that insight.\n\nWhat is it like to write from a Filipino perspective or with a Filipino history?\n\n\u201cI love the essay form because you can do really cool acrobatics with prose,\u201d said Jen Soriano, author of \u201cNervous: Essays on Heritage and Healing.\u201d Soriano\u2019s book is about transgenerational trauma explained through history, science and family stories. \u201cSo when I was missing pieces of my grandmother\u2019s or my parents\u2019 stories, then I would just put my story in there. So it was like weaving in and bringing different basically generations and layers of Filipino family stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a Filipino sensitivity reader read this because I wanted to make sure that the details I had in here were more universal than just my own personal experiences,\u201d said Dominic Lim, author of \u201cAll the Right Notes.\u201d Lim\u2019s book is a humorous gay romcom about a pianist who falls in love with a Hollywood heartthrob. \u201cParticularly, my language because Tagalog is not my first language. I wanted to make sure those details were on point. So I had my reader and my Tagalog teacher look through the various details just to make sure they were okay. Sometimes it was just as simple as like, \u2018No, you would not eat those two things together.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I ate them together.\u2019\u201d\n\nHow do you think the writers now are shaping what it\u2019s like to be Filipino or the Filipino experience?\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is kind of carrying on what a lot of activists, poets and writers did where they couldn\u2019t distribute their work\u2014it was actually very difficult,\u201d said Genevieve Clutario, author of \u201cBeauty Regimes.\u201d Clutario\u2019s book is about how beauty and fashion in the Philippines are intertwined with its nation\u2019s evolution and imperial expansion. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is carrying on that legacy but also showcasing what they did and showcasing more that there isn\u2019t a singular Filipino American experience or a singular Filipino experience that we\u2019re not a monolith. And you know why it\u2019s dangerous to have a monolith? It\u2019s because you\u2019re reduced to a stereotype.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving Filipino writers and an increased diversity of books is important,\u201d said Jasmin Iolani Hakes, author of \u201cHula.\u201d Hakes\u2019 book is a saga of tradition, culture, family, history and connection in the lives of three generations of women set in Hilo, Hawaii. \u201cWhen you see a book, even if you\u2019re not a reader, it validates in a certain way and it sends a message that this is worth of preservation and worthy of observation and acknowledgment.\u201d\n\nWhat advice do you have for writers who want to start writing in the YA genre?\n\n\u201cThis advice comes from a lot of other folks just to read a lot of YA,\u201d said Tracy Badua, author of \u201cThis Is Not a Personal Statement.\u201d Badua\u2019s book is about the conflicts of acceptance and lying a teen undergoes after getting rejected from her dream school. \u201cThe reason folks tell you to do that is because it is a different kind of style than writing for much younger kids or writing for adults. There\u2019s a very set kind of pacing like the way the characters think, the way things are structured that you will learn as you read.\u201d\n\nHow much of yourself did you write in your book?\n\n\u201cI think my Filipino Americanness comes through just by having characters who are Filipino American just existing,\u201d said Alex Brown, author of \u201cDamned If You Do.\u201d Brown\u2019s book is about a girl\u2019s healing after her abusive father left with the help of her guidance counselor who turns out to be a demon. \u201cCordelia is biracial, she\u2019s Filipino and white like I am. She, like me, grows up feeling disconnected from her heritage, but Veronica who\u2019s her best friend and love interest is Filipino, she is kind of more connected to her heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did want to see myself in a fantasy like a character that looks like me,\u201d said Vanessa Lanang, author of \u201cFireheart.\u201d Lanang\u2019s book is about a girl determined to slay the dragon that took her mother\u2019s life. \u201cThere\u2019s not necessarily issues faced in the story about any specific struggles for Filipinos in there. I would say that I grew up in a small town in Indiana where there weren\u2019t very many Filipinos. It\u2019s like the few that we knew and a culture that most people don\u2019t even know what Filipino is, trying to find that place in between and that\u2019s something my main character does kind of experience.\u201d\n\nBook signing that took place after all the author readings and Q&As. (Photo by Jeremiah Estrada)\n\nThe children\u2019s literature authors who attended include Jocelyn Francisco, Alexandra Adlawan, Bobbie Peyton, Michelle Sterling and Sophia N. Lee. Other adult literature authors who attended include Mia Alvar, Ricco Villanueva Siasoco, Maria Bola\u00f1os and Rachelle Cruz.\n\nWith more emerging Filipino authors, Filipinos of all ages will get a chance to see their stories told in books and there will be more opportunities for everyone to learn about the culture. The Liwanag Literary Festival will continue this new tradition of bringing together the Filipino community through the love of literature.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/30/usc-unsung-heroes-kali-wilding-the-kayaker/", "response": "```\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d is a column by Anthony Bottino that talks about elite USC athletes who aren\u2019t on one of the school\u2019s Division 1 teams. USC is one of the most storied athletic institutions in the country. Year after year, it produces national champions and is home to countless Olympians. This holds true even for athletes outside of the normal Division 1 teams. While most of USC\u2019s world-caliber athletes are involved in sports like track and field or water polo, Kali Wilding has achieved the same level of accomplishment in sprint kayaking.\n\nWilding, a 21-year-old junior, is double majoring in real estate development and business administration. The Hawaiian superstar comes from a lineage of great kayakers. Originally born in Australia, Wilding moved to Hawaii during middle school. That\u2019s where she first started kayaking. Growing up by the ocean, participating in water sports was a natural choice for her. Plus, her parents both competed nationally in kayaking. Her parents were both born in Australia and competed for the country. Her mother went to the Olympics twice for Australia, and the main reason they moved to America was that her father became the coach of the national team. Her mother would soon follow suit and is now the U.S. women\u2019s national team coach.\n\n\u201cMy home life even before I started kayaking was very revolved around sports,\u201d Wilding said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a family thing. Even though I wasn\u2019t into it when I was younger, I eventually fell into it. My parents\u2019 passion carried down to me.\u201d\n\nIt may seem like Wilding was destined to become a kayaker; however, growing up, her parents made it very clear that they did not want to pressure her into pursuing the sport. They wanted her to take part in the sport because she wanted to, not because they forced her, and that still remains true. So, what was the change? What finally made Wilding decide to follow in her parents\u2019 footsteps? Up until kayaking, she was mainly a gymnast and also tried out other sports. She began training with her mom and other kayakers for something fun to do and to stay in shape. Soon, the love she had for gymnastics faded away, and her interest in kayaking grew. Her training in kayaking continued, and she made the U15 national team. This took her abroad to compete internationally. This is when a switch flipped in her, and she decided to start pursuing kayaking.\n\n\u201cAfter I got the opportunity to compete internationally, I saw how much it can teach you and all the places it can take you,\u201d Wilding said. \u201cThen I realized how much I really wanted to do it.\u201d\n\nWilding had been competing with the U.S. junior national team since she was about 14 years old, and it wasn\u2019t until two years ago that she had her first chance to compete on the senior team. She didn\u2019t let the chance slip from her, as at the most recent national team trials, she had a stellar performance and won. This means she is the fastest sprint kayaker in the U.S. Following this, she became the K1 racer for the national team at international races.\n\nMoving forward, Wilding has her sights set on international races like the Pan American Games and qualifying for the Olympics. However, representing America as a kayaker in the Olympics is an uphill battle. Currently, the U.S. has no spots for the Olympics, but Wilding has a chance to qualify at the Pan American Championships in April if she wins the K1 or K2 500-meter race. Before doing that, though, she has to re-qualify for the national team a month before. Wilding\u2019s dream is to compete at the Olympics, and with Paris coming up this summer, she is determined to make it. In the long term though, she is looking ahead to the 2028 games in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt would be my dream come true,\u201d Wilding said. \u201cThe Olympics is the ultimate dream, and nothing would be more significant to me than to race in the Olympics, especially at home. Being someone who trains in L.A., it would be so special to race here. Getting to represent the U.S. in the U.S. would be so special, because we want to have representation and grow the sport in our home.\u201d\n\nWith Wilding training multiple times a day and managing two majors, she has a lot to handle and needs a coach that knows her better than anyone else, and there\u2019s no one better to do that than her mother. Wilding\u2019s mother is the national team sprint coach and runs Ikaika, the program she trains with at home. This has brought them extremely close and gave them a very special bond different from most mother-daughter relationships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super special to have her at every competition,\u201d Wilding said. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to share the traveling and racing with her. It\u2019s great to know she has my best interest at heart both as a mom and coach. She is so invested in my success, I can feel her passion for wanting me to succeed.\u201d\n\nKayaking is clearly one of the most important things in Kali\u2019s life, so how did it impact her decision when choosing USC? The first major reasoning is due to its proximity to the coast and the weather. There were lots of opportunities for her to continue training. Onto education, it checked all the boxes she was looking for, such as the real estate major and allowing for interdisciplinary studies. The final major factor was the vast USC network.\n\nTraining can be difficult at times, though. Since her sport requires the coast, she does have to make the drive on her own to places like Marina Del Rey and Newport Beach to train. She faces additional challenges since kayaking is not an NCAA sport, such as not getting support and benefits from the school. Even with the challenges, there is no college Wilding would rather be at.\n\n\u201cThere are other schools that would be easier for me to train at, but I love the school, the values and the opportunities,\u201d Wilding said. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool to be part of such a diverse, talented and successful student body. It\u2019s worth the extra driving and struggles.\u201d\n\nWilding\u2019s next competition is this week at the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile. With her mom in her corner, Wilding looks to take home more hardware and move one step closer to following her mom\u2019s footsteps and becoming an Olympian. With the way things have been working out for her recently, though, it looks like we will be seeing Wilding representing the U.S.A. and USC this summer in Paris.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Policy Exchange)\n\nBy Jasmine Kwok, Emilia Garza and Ari Rose-Marquez\nOctober 30, 2023 at 7:44 pm PDT\n\nMatthew Perry, who was propelled into sitcom stardom as the lovable and hilarious Chandler Bing in \u201cFriends,\u201d died in his Los Angeles residence Saturday at the age of 54. Captain Scot Williams of the LAPD robbery-homicide division said that while the cause was not likely to be determined in the near future, there was no indication of foul play, according to the New York Times. According to the L.A. Times, Perry was reportedly found unresponsive in an outdoor hot tub. No drugs were found at the scene, but toxicology will be a part of the LAPD\u2019s investigation because prescription medication was recovered in his home, according to L.A. Times sources.\n\nPerry battled with alcohol and opioid addiction throughout his life, which resulted in multiple stints in rehab. His substance abuse led to serious health issues in later years, including a five-month hospitalization in 2018 following a near-fatal colon rupture, which he wrote about in his 2022 memoir, \u201cFriends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the best thing about me is that if an alcoholic or drug addict comes up to me and says, \u2018Will you help me?\u2019 I will always say, \u2018Yes, I know how to do that. I will do that for you, even if I can\u2019t do it for myself,\u2019\u201d said Perry on the \u201cQ with Tom Power\u201d podcast in 2022.\n\nHis passing hits close to home for USC students, especially after he spoke about his memoir at USC\u2019s Bovard Auditorium during the Los Angeles Times Festival of books in April 2023.\n\n\u201cIt came pouring out of me\u2014the painful stuff, hospitals, rehabs, all this stuff\u2014it poured out of me. It went really quickly,\u201d Perry said at the festival about writing his memoir. \u201cWhat a horrible life this guy has had,\u201d he said, referring to himself.\n\nSome students shared their memories of the actor and the characters he played.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone who we will always remember. He was an inspiration, he was a funny guy and he\u2019s talented. It\u2019s sad to see him gone,\u201d said Ellie Bridges-Greenfield, a junior studying environmental science.\n\nLexie Hastings, a junior theater major said, \u201cMy family group chat \u201cexploded\u201d, is the best word, when we found out that he passed. The way my family bonded a lot was through his character and through that show, so it was really sad to hear.\u201d\n\nKenny Tapia, a freshman stage management major, expressed his sadness about losing someone he grew up watching.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something to be very sympathetic about, to kind of realize how an industry can lose such an emblematic figure,\u201d he said.\n\nKirstin Eggers, assistant professor of theatre practice in comedy performance, spoke about why Perry\u2019s acting resonated so strongly with students, even for those who may not have watched \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nIn order to create a compelling, memorable character, \u201cyou either want something completely original or delightfully familiar,\u201d Eggers said. \u201cMatthew Perry had both of those. Audiences could see their own flaws in him, and he made bold choices in his delivery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability, and the specific vulnerability, that he brought was pretty fresh, and it was pretty groundbreaking to be able to be so human and accessible, and a good looking guy,\u201d she said.\n\nEggers recounted stories from her friends who worked with Perry at one point throughout their professional acting careers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many people with personal stories,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people have said that he was just the nicest, kindest, giving person to work with on a professional set.\u201d\n\nSalma Hayek, who co-starred with Perry for the 1997 drama \u201cFools Rush In,\u201d agrees. In an Instagram tribute to her co-star, Hayek wrote, \u201cThroughout the years, he and I found ourselves reminiscing about that meaningful time in our lives with a deep sense of nostalgia and gratitude. My friend, you are gone much too soon, but I will continue to cherish your silliness, your perseverance, and your lovely heart.\u201d\n\nReactions from his \u201cFriends\u201d co-stars have yet to be publicly shared.\n\nAssistant Professor Eggers said that the joy Perry has brought to the lives of so many audiences exceeds any particular acting role.\n\n\u201cHow he was able to embody comedy really changed the tone of comedy,\u201d she said. \u201cHis vulnerability and even just his line delivery was so unique. I mean, you watch any trailer for any modern comedy movie, and they have the same delivery in the same tone that he brought to those lines.\u201d\n\nBesides working on his career as an actor, Perry created a sober-living facility for men, the Perry House, located in Malibu, California, and wrote a play titled \u201cThe End of Longing\u201d which he describes as his personal message to the world.\n\n\u201cWhen I die, as far as my so-called accomplishments go, it would be nice if \u2018Friends\u2019 were listed far behind the things I did to try to help other people. I know it won\u2019t happen, but it would be nice,\u201d Perry said on the \u201cQ with Tom Power\u201d podcast.\n```"}

Nitzan Mintz and Dede Bandaid, two Israeli artists from Tel Aviv, created the project and its accompanying website, which features testimonials from families affected by the kidnappings and a list of 203 of Hamas\u2019 hostages.\n\n\u201cWe want people to pass by and look and understand that this is real... we\u2019re talking about real people being held captive,\u201d Bandaid said in an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people: Babies and toddlers, men, women, grandparents... being held by militant people with guns.\u201d\n\nRabbi Dov Wagner, who runs the Rohr Chabad Jewish Center at USC, called the teardown of the posters \u201can attempt to erase the value of human beings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a political statement; these people are being held hostage,\u201d he said.\n\nJunior Andrew Turquie said he was disappointed by the removals.\n\n\u201cI was quite upset. I felt like our community wasn\u2019t being supported again. I felt like you were using university policies or guidelines per se to put down the Jewish community,\u201d Turquie said.\n\nOn Instagram, USC Hillel put out a message regarding the posters getting taken down.\n\n\u201cThe intent of the students who posted these flyers was to draw attention to the tragedy of these 200 Israeli hostages,\u201d the message read. \u201cWe will not allow them to be erased. These are our friends and our family, and we are praying for their safe return\u201d\n\nInnocent lives are being lost on both sides of the war, which further calls for empathy and kindness from the student body, according to Wagner. However, \u201crather than hearing and empathizing with each other, it just seems that things are being erased to the loudest voice,\u201d he said.\n\nWagner said that the USC community should focus on exhibiting resilience and strength. Students can come together to connect and bring positivity to each other during these times, and while community members may not reach a consensus at the moment, they can, \u201cat the very least, not call for the erasure of the other,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people all over to pause a little bit before saying something,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIs it achieving something? Is it bringing light to the world, or are you just trying to bring someone else down?\u201d\n```"}

Cal game on Saturday. (Photo by Sydni Zfira)\n\nBy Jinny Kim and Makayla Idelburg\nOctober 30, 2023 at 7:30 pm PDT\n\nFans watched in confusion as 15 students staged a sit-in on the field at Saturday\u2019s football game between USC and California, protesting for the reinstatement of a suspended UC Berkeley professor. The game was delayed for about 10 minutes before the protestors were arrested and escorted off the field of UC Berkeley\u2019s Memorial Stadium, according to a statement from the University of California Police Department. The department said 14 adults were transported to Alameda County Jail, and one juvenile was transported to UCPD.\n\nMany USC students present at the game were unaware of the circumstances of the protest. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really understand what was happening because they also weren\u2019t presenting it on any of the JumboTrons,\u201d said Kyra Aligaen, a junior studying occupational therapy. \u201cWe were pretty high up, as well, so all we could see was a group of 10 to 15 people sitting down on the field with posters, but we couldn\u2019t exactly read what the posters were.\u201d\n\nThe protestors were with Justice4Ivonne, a student campaign to reinstate Ivonne del Valle, a professor of Spanish and Portuguese at UC Berkeley. Del Valle was suspended following three university investigations that found evidence of her harassing and stalking Joshua Clover, an English and comparative literature professor at UC Davis, according to KQED.\n\nAlejandra Decker, a PhD student at UC Berkeley and an organizer with Justice4Ivonne, said that Justice4Ivonne\u2019s protests are in response to a lack of action from UC Berkeley\u2019s administration to reinstate del Valle as a professor. \u201cThis case has been going on for more than five years now. The protests are really just the latest in a long fight for Professor Ivonne Del Valle\u2019s reinstatement,\u201d Decker said. \u201cThe Justice4Ivonne campaign that\u2019s been going on since August is really a product of the administration\u2019s silence on this issue and the fact that they haven\u2019t acknowledged even how damaging it\u2019s been to our department.\u201d\n\nClover was accused by del Valle of hacking her phone and computer and harassing her. The professors reportedly met in 2018 when they met in person about a panel discussion del Valle was leading. The UC Berkeley Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination found \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to support del Valle\u2019s claims that Clover hacked, harassed or stalked her, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nKQED reported that after the first investigation in 2019 that found del Valle\u2019s violation of the university\u2019s provisions against stalking and sexual harassment, she violated the no-contact agreement in 2021 by leaving messages outside Clover\u2019s mother\u2019s home. The third investigation in 2022 determined that del Valle violated the no-contact order again when she posted about the situation on social media.\n\nClover said in Berkeley\u2019s 2019 investigation report that there was a \u201cmental toll by being stalked,\u201d and that he felt \u201cremarkably unsupported\u201d by the university, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nDel Valle admitted to some of the accusations in the investigations, such as keying Clover\u2019s car, contacting his friends and mother, writing \u201chere lives a pervert\u201d outside his door and posting a picture of his partner online. \u201cI\u2019m not proud,\u201d del Valle said in an interview with KQED. \u201cIf I had the opportunity to do things differently, I would do them differently.\u201d\n\nDecker said that del Valle was acting in \u201cself defense\u201d against Clover. \u201cWe believe that she is the victim of cyber stalking, that her personal devices have been compromised in a way that completely violates her privacy and is incredibly humiliating and that she was alone and wasn\u2019t given any support,\u201d Decker said.\n\nDel Valle has garnered some public support from the UC Berkeley community. Faculty members asked Berkeley\u2019s chancellor and then-vice provost to reconsider the case against del Valle in December, and students have continued to call for del Valle\u2019s return to campus, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nSome UC Berkeley students, including Decker, have noted del Valle as a \u201ckey mentor\u201d on campus, particularly for students of color. \u201c[Del Valle] is always that safe haven for a lot of students of color, for a lot of Latinx students, first generation students or students from low income backgrounds as well,\u201d Decker said. \u201cHer influence is spread far beyond herself. And you can see that in all of the students that she\u2019s mentored and their incredible careers now.\u201d\n\nDecker said that students involved in Justice4Ivonne are trying to highlight that del Valle has \u201cbeen punished enough.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on our main demand just being her reinstatement, because we know that once she gets back to her job, to her community, to the people that ground her \u2014 then that\u2019s the first step in healing a lot of this trauma that\u2019s been unresolved,\u201d Decker said.\n```"}

Mike Pence: \u201cI have decided to suspend my campaign for president effective today. I am leaving this campaign, but let me promise you: I will never leave the fight for conservative values, and I will never stop fighting to elect principled Republican leaders to every office in the land.\u201d\n\nThe former Vice President under the Trump administration, Governor of Indiana, and Congressperson for six consecutive terms, Pence, has been involved in Indiana and national politics since the year 2000. Pence chose to announce his step back from electioneering in Las Vegas at the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s annual gathering where the other republican hopefuls and former President Trump took their opportunities to voice GOP support for Israel and debate each other\u2019s policies.\n\nFormer running-mate, Donald Trump, was less than compassionate to Pence\u2019s decision. He even alluded to the fact that Pence might not have been the best person to have beside him. Donald Trump: \u201cI chose him, I made him Vice President but people in politics can be very disloyal, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has maintained his lead in polling, is loosely followed by Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley polling better than Pence was when the Fox News national survey was released October 11. Republican presidential candidate and former Governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, shared her public appreciation for Pence and all that he has done for the United States and Israel. Nikki Haley: \u201cHe\u2019s been a good man of faith, he\u2019s been a good man of service, he has fought for America and he has fought for Israel.

Chris Christie: \u201cMike ran a tough race, a good race. It was very difficult for him and I think he made the right decision for he and his family to get out of the race.\u201d\n\nThere is currently no way to tell if Pence\u2019s withdrawal from the race will benefit any candidates. However, the future of Pence and politics is still alive. Pence is expected to remain involved in politics by progressing the conservative think tank he created after his vice presidency called Advancing American Freedom. In addition to that, he has a book being released next month.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sixx Orange.\n```"}

With the freeway now used as a commuter route, the freeway is highly criticized for its poor travel design and the safety hazards that come with it.\n\nGottlieb believes Caltrans would love to expand the freeway and make the Pasadena freeway a much more safer method of transportation Gottlieb: \u201cCaltrans would love to expand the freeway, but they can\u2019t for a whole bunch of reasons in terms of how their plot and how it was originally designed. And it wasn\u2019t designed as a for you, it wasn\u2019t designed as a parkway to go, not just because it would be a slower speed, but because the experience in a parkway is to be connected to the places you\u2019re going through, rather than simply thinking of the destination where you end up.\u201d\n\nGottlieb would like to see Southern California take steps to modifying its transportation methods for a safer and more efficient future. Gottlieb: \u201cWe can go from place to place in a very different way, whether it\u2019s walking that mile or biking or rail or bus, there are alternatives.

We dig into her success in the pop music industry and her role in mainstream media today.\n\nSeventeen years after she released her debut album, Taylor Swift is continuing to dominate pop culture conversations. Swift has remained in the media spotlight by re-recording her albums and going on a worldwide tour. USC Sophomore Sophie Sullivan stated that Swift was the main topic of online discourse on various social media platforms that she engaged with.\n\nSophie Sullivan: \u201cI think every day over the summer I would open Instagram and every single one of the headlines I saw was Taylor\u2019s was editor this and Taylor\u2019s was after that. And now there\u2019s a movie and of, you know, the hype from the albums and stuff, but feel like she\u2019s doing her thing, like it\u2019s liberating and creates like a really beautiful fandom. Honestly, it is a little bit overwhelming at times, but, you know, it\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nHer success in the music industry has bled into the film scene with her 2023 concert film \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d. The film has grossed over 200 million dollars internationally against a roughly 20 million dollar budget. Her rumored relationship with Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce also led to a substantial increase in NFL viewership amongst Gen Z and millennial women. NBC Sports reported that the Chiefs vs Jets football game this month attracted 27 million viewers - the most for a Sunday night game since Super Bowl 57.\n\nJane Davidson, an adjunct instructor at the Thornton music school and practicing attorney of music law, spoke about how Swift\u2019s brand evolution has contributed to her ongoing success and likened it to a politician\u2019s career.\n\nJane Davidson: \u201cIf you look at any political figure in the Democratic Party who was involved in politics in the early 2000 or nineties use and still is today, you will see that they change. Most of them changed their views on gay marriage, for example, including Obama, who previously was against gay marriage, and then changed his his views on that. And I think that having a brand that can evolve as the public\u2019s views change and hopefully be a step or two ahead of the rest of the mainstream.\u201d\n\nNot all of the discussion surrounding Swift has been positive. U-S-C student Cler Barnhart noted Swift\u2019s selective activism when it comes to championing feminist ideals.\n\nCler Barnhart: \u201cI did watch this interesting video essay about, like white feminism and how she kind of, like, really fits into that, like from a more corporate standpoint of like, you know, like supporting feminist ideas when it\u2019s useful for her, but then like, when it\u2019s not important for her career, like, she\u2019s just silent.\u201d\n\nThis idea of \u201ccorporate activism\u201d is one that has led to heated debates amongst activist and pop culture communities. Davidson stated that Swift\u2019s activist statements can be best understood when examining them from strictly a brand perspective.\n\nDavidson: \u201cI would not expect to see her to step into the arena on issues beyond kind of those that fit with her brand. LGBTQ issues being the ones that fit with her brand currently, potentially ones related to women, might be issues that she might jump in on, but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see, for example, her commentary, commenting on issues of affecting people of color or anything like that, because I would not expect to hear that from her. From a branding perspective, not saying that that is a good thing for her to do or a bad thing. It\u2019s just simply probably not a branding choice that we\u2019re going to see from her.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the intent behind her activism, the Taylor Swift brand has extended far beyond the scope of music and become a staple of modern mainstream culture on an unprecedented scale.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Aditya Thiyag.\n```"}

The nonprofit organization also plans to widen its reach to South L.A. as well as Watts and Ladera Heights.\n\nThe non-profit, on a webpage dedicated to its \u201cFree Trees\u201d project, says it has planted \u201cmore than 10,000 free street trees for residents in the city of Los Angeles,\u201d since the year 2000. Free street trees are trees planted along Los Angeles streets at no charge to residents.\n\n\u201cKYCC aims to promote sustainability in our community, provide cooling of dense urban areas such as Koreatown, and help support LA\u2019s Green New Deal goal of planting 90,000 trees and increasing the tree canopy by at least 50% by the year 2028 in densely populated, underserved communities with the least shade,\u201d the organization announced in a press release.\n\nKYCC has raised over $600,000 in funding towards hopes to ramp up planting in Los Angeles. As noted in a press release, Sooman Lee, the founder of SM Entertainment and \u201cone of the pioneers of K-POP,\u201d is a partner of the project after donating heavily to the cause.\n\n\u201cStreet trees reduce pollution, provide cooling, save energy, and make neighborhoods more livable,\u201d the organization wrote in September\u2019s press release.\n\nWhile KYCC has not revealed specific details about the plan to expand the Free Trees project into South L.A., a scientific plan released in August by the USC Urban Trees Initiative lays out a blueprint for how the area would benefit from increased planting.\n\nThe initiative notes that South L.A. and University Park in particular experience higher temperatures than surrounding areas, as well as \u201celevated levels of particulate matter\u201d that hurt air quality. The plan outlines that trees reduce temperatures while providing more shade for residents and visitors. Trees also naturally remove particulate matter from the air and environment.\n\nIn the concluding analysis of the scientific plan, the Urban Trees Initiative reveals its findings and recommendations for where trees are most needed in South L.A. The initiative highlighted 41 street segments that add up to a length of three miles that would be the best locations for new trees. Common traits used to decide where trees should be planted were the amount of foot traffic, density of trees in the area, and the ability to plant in the area.\n\nKYCC\u2019s tree-planting project officially started ramping up late September at an event where Lee and KYCC representatives physically planted a single Ginko tree in front of Koreatown\u2019s Korean Pavilion.\n\nSouth L.A. residents can apply for free trees to be planted on their streets on the KYCC website.\n```"}

Depending on how old you are, you may be breaking the law. According to city laws in towns across the U.S., some candy-grubbers might have to sit out on the festivities because of their age. Multiple cities have placed an age limit on trick-or-treating.\n\nAccording to Section 46-8 of the Chesapeake, Virginia municipal code, any person over the age of 14 is prohibited from the activity. Breaking this code is a Class 4 misdemeanor, and could result in a $250 fine. Other cities like Jacksonville, Illinois; Rayne, Louisiana; and Belleville, Virginia have similar laws, according to NPR.\n\n\u201cI do understand, having older kids running around with a bunch of little kids might not be the safest,\u201d said Emma Rohelder, a freshman business major at USC. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t think there needs to be laws banning kids from trick-or-treating,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the age limits in cities across the country, some USC students are planning on partaking in the Halloween tradition themselves. Hayley Feinstein, a senior majoring in theater at USC, says she plans on going trick-or-treating tomorrow with at least five of her friends.\n\n\u201cYou just have a lot of good nostalgia and great early childhood memories from trick or treating,\u201d said Feinstein. From a college student perspective, Feinstein said, \u201cI think trick-or-treating was something that was more reasonable for my friends because they didn\u2019t want to really pay $100 to go to Halloween Horror Nights.\u201d\n\nBeyond age restrictions, some cities have imposed curfews on Halloween night that inhibit teens from trick-or-treating. For instance, in parts of South Jersey, the curfew is at 7 p.m., according to ABC 7 Los Angeles.\n\nThese regulations were not instated randomly. According to the article from CNN, the ordinance regarding trick-or-treating in Chesapeake appeared after an incident of teenagers throwing firecrackers into younger children\u2019s trick-or-treat bags in Hampton Roads in 1968. CNN reported that Chesapeake spokesperson Heath Covey said the regulation was intended to \u201ckeep people safe.\u201d\n\nMark Eckert, a former mayor of Belleville, Illinois (2004-2021), signed the ordinance forbidding teenagers from participating in trick-or-treating in 2008, according to Slate Magazine.

The Trojans just narrowly missed another opportunity to take the game\u2019s first lead just before the 11th minute when junior midfielder Aaliyah Farmer tried to head in a long pass and just missed it.\n\nIn the 14th minute of the game, Flores was finally able to get one to go for the Trojans as she scored the game\u2019s first goal. For Flores, it was her sixth goal of the season and it came off an assist from junior forward Kayla Colbert.\n\nThe score remained 1-0 in favor of USC for the remainder of the first half. Cal\u2019s scoreless outing was due in part to sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson saving the ball in a crowd as Cal was attempting to score off of a corner kick.\n\nUtilizing advantages in midfield was a critical part of limiting what the Golden Bears could do offensively.\n\n\u201cI think our team does well when we\u2019re specific about certain tendencies of certain players,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWe tried to shut down Cal\u2019s key players throughout the game.\u201d\n\nWith no goals being scored in nearly 40 minutes, the Trojans got their second and final goal of the match after senior defender Zoe Burns\u2019 pass was kicked across the field and then headed into the net by junior forward Izzy Kimberly.\n\nUSC nearly scored a third goal when Farmer set up junior forward Simone Jackson in stride, but Jackson was a little wide of the goal on the shot attempt.\n\nThe Trojans outshot the Golden Bears 16-5 and put six balls on target compared to just one for Cal. USC had a corner kick advantage of 7-4 and had possession for 57% of the game.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate the effort on defense and the attention to detail on offense,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on recognizing the signs of when to attack and we\u2019re just getting smarter.\u201d\n\nAfter going through a rough four game stretch, the Trojans believe the adversity was a necessary step to clean up certain areas before USC\u2019s regular season comes to a close.\n\n\u201cEvery team goes through a little learning curve,\u201d Burns said. \u201cI think our learning curve came at a perfect time and when you take plays off or have bad habits, the teams in the Pac-12 will punish you.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans conclude regular season play on the road with a matchup with the crosstown rival UCLA Bruins.\n\n\u201cI think intensity and creativity is what we\u2019re going to bring into UCLA,\u201d Burns said. \u201cIt\u2019s a game we look forward to all year so I know that the effort and intensity is going to be there.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s regular season finale at No. 2 UCLA begins at 7 p.m. on Friday at Wallis Annenberg Stadium.\n```"}

Los Angeles currently sits at 2-3 on the season. Last week, the Rams fell 24-17 at home to the Pittsburgh Steelers. L.A. led 17-10 entering the fourth quarter, but Pittsburgh outscored the Rams 14-0 in the final frame to come away with the victory.\n\nDespite the loss, it was yet another strong performance from rookie wide receiver Puka Nacua. The fifth-round draft pick out of BYU had his fourth 100-yard receiving game in seven weeks, catching eight passes for 154 yards. For his performance, Nacua was once again named the NFL\u2019s Pepsi Rookie of the Week. Nacua currently ranks third in the league with 752 receiving yards, with only established stars Tyreek Hill of the Miami Dolphins and A.J. Brown of the Philadelphia Eagles ahead of him. He is currently on pace for 1826 receiving yards this year \u2014 just 121 yards shy of teammate Cooper Kupp\u2019s total from his historic 2021 season.\n\nThe Cowboys, meanwhile, also sit at 2-3 and are coming off of their bye week. Two weeks ago, Dallas defeated the Chargers 20-17 in Los Angeles. Quarterback Dak Prescott completed 21 of 30 passes for 272 yards and a touchdown in the win, while wide receiver CeeDee Lamb caught seven passes for 117 yards.\n\nHowever, the biggest challenge for the Rams Sunday may be the vaunted Cowboys defense, led by star linebacker Micah Parsons. Through six games, Parsons has 20 tackles, seven tackles for a loss, five sacks, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.\n\nThe Rams did get some reinforcements this week, albeit in an unexpected form. On Wednesday, head coach Sean McVay and his wife Veronika welcomed a son, Jordan John McVay. McVay\u2019s arrival into the world even made the team\u2019s official transaction log.

But there was one former Trojan who had a rather memorable performance last week. Vikings rookie receiver Jordan Addison completely took over the Monday night game against a premier San Francisco 49ers team. Addison finished his Monday Night Football debut with 123 yards and two touchdowns, showcasing the quick speed and pristine route running that he flashed all last year at the Coliseum. The most memorable play of the night for Addison was a wrestling match for the football with 49ers cornerback Charvias Ward, that ended in number three finding the back of the endzone. Addison now has six touchdowns on the season, trailing only Dolphins star receiver Tyreek Hill (7). I am missing Addison wearing the Trojan Red and Cardinal Yellow a lot right now, but am happy for his early success in the NFL.\n\nThis week delivered some entertaining games. The Browns and Colts game ended in a thrilling controversial finish, the Ravens blew the lid off of the Lions and the Patriots pulled off an upset against their rival Buffalo Bills. Entering the season\u2019s halfway point, the Chiefs, to no one\u2019s surprise, look like the favorites out of the AFC. Mahomes and Kelce have looked untouchable, connecting on their 50th touchdown over the weekend, which is fourth-most for a quarterback-tight end duo in NFL history. On the NFC side, there is still no clear favorite. The Eagles and 49ers still lead the charge, with the Cowboys and Lions right behind. After a second straight loss for the 49ers, the rest of the path does not get any easier for them having the fifth-hardest remaining schedule, according to Tankthon. The Cowboys and Eagles still have yet to faceoff, making both of those games marquee matchups for not just the division title, but the potential to have a bye week on wild card weekend.\n\nIn a new addition to the Cookbook, I present this week\u2019s first-ever Michelin Star Player of the Week, Lamar Jackson. In a highly anticipated matchup between the 5-1 Lions, I saw the Detroit defense posing a problem for Lamar and the Ravens offense. However, Lamar had no time for B.S. and right out the gate delivered a 46-yard pass to rookie Zay Flowers that led to a Lamar one-yard rushing touchdown. And that was just the very beginning of a 28-point first half from the Ravens. Lamar was flawless throwing for 357 yards, three passing touchdowns, and even rushing for another one. It was another historic performance on Sunday, with Lamar getting his 50th career win making him the fifth fastest quarterback to reach that milestone.\n\nThe waiter has arrived, what\u2019s first on the menu?\n\nFirst Course | Minnesota Vikings (3-4) vs. Green Bay Packers (2-4)\n\nThe Vikings might have something with rookie receiver Jordan Addison, but better yet, they\u2019re 3-1 in the last four games after an impressive win last week over the 49ers. The rest of the schedule for the Vikings is on the easier side, ranking 24th leaguewide in strength of schedule, according to Tankthon. The NFC North is not totally out of grasp, and getting Justin Jefferson back in a few weeks can help lead a late-season push. The Vikings have really not been playing bad football. All four of their losses this season have been decided by one score or less. Executing a great game plan this weekend will include getting the ball to playmakers like Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson. Kirk Cousins may not be the flashiest player on the field, but this season he has been getting it done with a league-best 16 touchdown passes.\n\nThe Packers have yet to find consistency from any part of the team. Jordan Love has been nothing special, however, it doesn\u2019t help that the young gunslinger doesn\u2019t have any run game to support him. The team ranks 30th in rushing yards this season. If the Packers want to turn it around, then getting some sort of run game from Aaron Jones or A.J. Dillion can help to take the pressure off of Love. For Love, he needs to lose the cuteness in his play, and what I mean by that is trying to make everything a highlight. He ranks fifth-worst in quarterback rating, and a lot of it is due to him making the easy throws hard on himself. Setting the feet and making the easy pass should be the goal for Love this week. Right now, he is very much overcomplicating things.\n\nFries \u2014 Jordan Addison, Vikings Receiver \u2014  The former Trojan is making a strong case for Offensive Rookie of the Year after his first career 100-yard game last week. What makes Addison so impactful is his ability to get open almost every play with clean and quick route running. Kirk Cousins\u2019 passer rating when targeting Addison this season is 115.5. The future is bright for No. 3.\n\nDessert \u2014 The Vikings are going to win this game convincingly on the road.  The Packers have shown too many red flags so far and a dominant Vikings pass rush, is going to cause fits for Jordan Love and the offense.\n\nSecond Course | Cleveland Browns (4-2) vs. Seattle Seahawks (4-2), 1:05 p.m PDT, FOX\n\nIt\u2019s the second straight week the Browns have made the Cookbook, and in part it is because of how well Myles Garrett played versus the Colts. Garrett became the first player in NFL history to record two sacks, two forced fumbles, and a blocked field goal in a single game. However, Deshaun Watson\u2019s return on Sunday left many fans wondering if they will ever get to see what they thought they were getting with Watson from his Houston days. After only five passes he exited the game with an injury, and the Browns rode with backup P.J. Walker for the rest of the game. The Browns still sit at 4-2, but the uncertainty at the quarterback position has been troublesome. With Watson\u2019s $230 million deal, it\u2019s hard to just bench him, but his play has not resulted in really any winning football this season. The defense has been the backbone of this team, but will have a handful of weapons from the Seahawks to worry about, with a solid receiving core of D.K. Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and rookie Jaxson Smith-Njigba.\n\nBut for Seattle, the recipe for success on Sunday will be protecting Geno Smith. He has been sacked 13 times already and against arguably the best defense in football right now, the offensive line for Seattle is going to need to play near-perfect football. Giving Smith time in the pocket will open up the passing game tremendously, and will hopefully limit the turnovers created from the pressure, as Smith has three interceptions in the last two games.\n\nMac and Cheese \u2014 Kenneth Walker, Seahawks Running Back \u2014  If the Seahawks want a chance in this one, establishing a run game early on will be crucial. Walker is currently eighth in rush yards (450) this season and is not an easy player to get on the ground with nine broken tackles on the season. The Seahawks win if Walker goes for 100-plus.\n\nDessert \u2014 Riding with the 12th Man in this one.  The Seahawks have had their hiccups over the last few weeks with struggling to be very productive on offense, however, I believe Walker running the ball well, paired with protecting Smith leads to a close lower-scoring affair. The inconsistency at quarterback will prove to be determinant for the Browns this week.\n\nThird Course | Cincinnati Bengals (3-3) vs. San Francisco 49ers (5-2), 1:25 p.m PDT, CBS\n\nBoth teams enter this game at rather fascinating points in their respective seasons. For the 49ers, the first five weeks of the season they looked absolutely unstoppable, giving a pounding to every team that came their way. But over the last two weeks, gravity has pulled them back to earth, putting a dent in Brock Purdy\u2019s perfect record with two losses. The Bengals looked completely lost through the first few weeks of the season, but after back-to-back wins before last week\u2019s bye, the Bengals are sitting at .500. However the offense has still struggled to do much, even in the wins. They rank bottom in the league in total offense (256.3), only scoring 16 points a game. And with so many playmakers on this team, these woes are unacceptable. Ja\u2019Marr Chase needs to see way more action, while Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins need  some sort of rhythm. Higgins only has 149 receiving yards in five games.\n\nIf Trent Williams can be out on the field on Sunday, it will be a huge bonus for the 49ers. The last two weeks, the 49ers have struggled to have the constant run game they typically dominate teams with, rushing for a season-low 65 yards on MNF. Plus, Purdy has been under a lot more pressure in recent weeks. The 49ers have just not been healthy, plain and simple. Getting Deebo and Willaims back will provide the much-needed help they haven\u2019t had in recent weeks.\n\nGarlic Bread \u2014 Brandon Aiyuk, 49ers Receiver \u2014  I loved Aiyuk coming out of college, and am very happy that he has grown into more of a number one receiver role. His silky route running mixed with the burners he has for legs have caused trouble for opposing defenses all year.\n\nDessert \u2014 WHOO DEYYY.  In a tough atmosphere, I like the Bengals to pull this one out. This defense has had timely turnovers, with six of their eight interceptions coming in the second half. Putting the pressure on Purdy will be crucial to getting a win. I believe that the Bengals offense will finally wake up to the amount of star power they have.\n\nLast Weeks\u2019 Record: 1-2. Overall Record: 6-9.\n\nRecipe of the week\n\nA staple of any gameday, is a delicious serving of wings. They can be so versatile, because it is really up to every person what sauce to pair them with.

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Will Camardella October 28, 2023 at 7:55 pm PDT\n\nFor the first time in almost a month, Lincoln Riley could exhale. With 58 seconds remaining in the game, No. 24 USC had just allowed its 49th point of the afternoon on a 13-yard halfback slip screen to freshman Jaivian Thomas. A simple point after would have tied the game. However, Cal head coach Justin Wilcox decided to bet on redshirt freshman quarterback Fernando Mendoza and attempt a game-winning 2-point conversion. Mendoza had plenty of time to throw as the Golden Bears\u2019 route concept developed, but the secondary hung tough. As soon as he released the ball, junior cornerback Jaylin Smith lept over redshirt senior wide receiver Brian Hightower and slapped the final pass of the game onto the yellow turf in the end zone, securing a 50-49 win for the Trojans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really damn proud of the group,\u201d Riley said, following the win. \u201cThey could have folded after the last two weeks when things didn\u2019t go our way. To step up here on the road and find a way to get this sucker done is huge.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Cal would even need a two-point conversion to win the game at the end seemed unfathomable in the opening minute of the fourth quarter, when a QB sneak from Mendoza put the Golden Bears ahead by 14 points. Cal\u2019s offense was firing on all cylinders, and the Trojans\u2019 offense had scored just two touchdowns in its previous nine possessions. Time was running low, and if USC was going to avoid a three-game losing streak, it would need a major spark.\n\nThat spark came from redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd. Lloyd, along with the rest of the Trojan rushing attack, had a frustrating start to his game, only averaging three yards per carry in the first half. Yet, his game relies on explosiveness, and two explosive plays in the second half set up a pair of crucial scoring drives. In the drive immediately after USC went down by two scores, Lloyd hauled in a cross-body pass from junior quarterback Caleb Williams, shook off two defenders and sprinted down the middle of the field for a 53-yard pickup. The play got the Trojans to the Golden Bears\u2019 six-yard line less than a minute after the Mendoza touchdown, setting up a QB sneak score.\n\n\u201cI knew that once [Lloyd] got into the transfer portal, that there would be games like this,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s a team guy. He doesn\u2019t get up and down about his touches, but when it\u2019s his time to go, his number shines.\u201d\n\nThree fumbles and one touchdown later, USC found itself in possession of the ball with four and a half minutes remaining in a tie game. On the first play of the drive, Lloyd took the handoff, made one cut to the outside at the line of scrimmage and let his speed take over. He busted down the Cal sideline for a 56-yard gain, again putting the Trojans in first and goal. One play later, redshirt senior running back Austin Jones ran through a wide-open hole and into the end zone. This was the biggest drive of the day for the Trojan offense, but they only needed two plays to earn their first lead since the second quarter.\n\nUSC had to overcome multiple double-digit deficits on Saturday afternoon due to the success of the Golden Bears\u2019 offense, especially in the first half. Through the first 30 minutes, Cal averaged 9.6 yards per play. Mendoza had success throwing over the middle to redshirt sophomore wide receiver Trond Grizzel and redshirt freshman tight end Jack Endries, who combined for 155 yards on 13 catches, but the offense saw the most success in its run game. The Trojans had no answer for sophomore running back Jaydn Ott, who broke big run after big run. Behind Ott, the Golden Bears averaged nearly 10 yards per carry and had two touchdown runs of over 40 yards in the first half. The run success led to four touchdowns on Cal\u2019s first five offensive drives.\n\nThe second half was a much better showing from USC\u2019s run defense, as Cal only averaged 2.4 yards on 24 carries. A major reason was the return of sophomore defensive tackle Bear Alexander, who could not play in the first half due to a targeting penalty he took in the closing minutes of USC\u2019s previous game. Once Alexander returned to the game, the Trojans allowed 21 points on 10 drives, a low enough number to allow the offense to make the comeback.\n\n\u201cBear is a tremendous player, we definitely missed him in the first half,\u201d redshirt senior edge rusher Jamil Muhammad said. \u201cWhen he came in the second half, he did some awesome things. He penetrated the gaps like he usually does. I\u2019m proud to see how he handled missing the first half, and it was good having him to help us finish that game.\u201d\n\nThe Golden Bears may have been a more efficient offense than their opponent at their best, but they made a few too many mistakes to close out the game. They had four turnovers as a team \u2013 three fumbles and one interception \u2013 directly leading to 20 points for USC. Williams had an up-and-down performance. He completed just over half of his passes, yet he still accumulated 369 yards and two touchdowns without throwing an interception. Williams passed for 300 of those yards on 10 plays, as he consistently attacked Cal\u2019s defense down the field.\n\n\u201cI had a few mistakes in the Notre Dame with dumb passes I threw,\u201d Williams said regarding his season thus far. \u201cI\u2019ve had one off day in three years, I\u2019d say. Something Kobe [Bryant] said is that when you fail you succeed. When you\u2019re striving for success, doubt can creep in. I keep focusing on success and trying to get better, because doubt is a weird thing.\u201d\n\nRedshirt senior wide receiver Tahj Washington hauled in two deep balls down the middle, leading his team with 102 receiving yards on five catches. Redshirt sophomore tight end Lake McRee also had a big day with 72 yards on four receptions.\n\nThis win was an important one for the Trojans, who had lost two straight games coming into the weekend. Although this matchup against a team under .500 came down to the last seconds, Riley\u2019s confidence in his group has not wavered.\n\n\u201cI believe this team can win [the Pac-12],\u201d Riley said. \u201cHell yeah, I do. I know we can. ... This team\u2019s good is definitely good enough to beat anybody. We\u2019re not getting our good consistently enough to separate in some of these games. Some of our stretches offensively and defensively are dominant, but we\u2019re still making too many self-inflicted errors.\u201d\n\nThe win improves USC to 7-2 on the season and 5-1 in the Pac-12. The Trojans will face their toughest test so far next Saturday when they welcome undefeated Washington to the Coliseum.\n```"}

This time around, the No. 24 USC Trojans (6-2, 4-1 Pac-12) prepare to take on the Cal Golden Bears (3-4, 1-3) for the 109th and potentially last time as both teams prepare to join new conferences next season. While Cal\u2019s four losses might suggest the Golden Bears should be an easy win for the Trojans, USC is on a two-game losing streak and has looked vulnerable to other inferior opponents at points this season. This small skid is only the second multi-game losing streak in the regular season in Lincoln Riley\u2019s seven-year coaching career.\n\nBoth of USC\u2019s losses this season have come against ranked teams, but Cal boasts a potent running attack that ranks 19th in the FBS in rushing yards per game. Comparatively, the Trojan defense has yet to play a team that ranks in the top 30 in that stat, all while the unit ranks 99th in rushing yards allowed per game. Cal will likely feed the ball to sophomore running back Jaydn Ott, who has 615 rushing yards on the year. USC definitely remembers Ott, as the sophomore ran for 40 yards on the first drive in last year\u2019s matchup between the two teams when he was only a freshman.\n\nIn that game, the Trojans jumped out to a 27-7 lead in the third quarter, but allowed the Golden Bears to crawl back into the game with USC only winning 41-35. The defense will have to deal with Ott without the help of sophomore defensive lineman Bear Alexander in the first half. Alexander will have to sit the opening two quarters after committing a targeting penalty in the closing minutes of USC\u2019s loss to Utah.\n\nWhat the Trojans do have in their favor is that the Golden Bears have more losses than wins for a reason. This is partly because Cal\u2019s defense has been worse than USC\u2019s so far this season, allowing an average of 31.1 points per game. And the Golden Bears will have to deal with junior quarterback Caleb Williams, who has thrown for 2,277 yards and 23 touchdowns.\n\nWhile the USC offense has gotten out to slow starts in each of the last two games \u2014 scoring only a combined 20 points through the first halves \u2014 the Williams-led unit is still a strength for the Trojans, and it should be the same way this Saturday. There is no better time for a \u2018get-right\u2019 game than right now for USC, whose final three games after Cal are against teams currently ranked in the AP Top 25.\n\nThe offense has scored over 30 points in all but one game this season, but to achieve that feat again, the unit has to play more than just the one-dimensional strategy of hero ball through Williams. Despite averaging 12.3 yards per carry, redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd only ran the ball 12 times against Utah. Lloyd did fumble during the third quarter of a one-score game, affecting his touches the rest of the contest, but the running back is too electric to only average 10.3 carries per game.\n\nThe Trojans are likely out of the College Football Playoff conversation after already suffering their second loss, but they are still in perfect position to play spoiler the rest of the season against the likes of No. 5 Washington and No. 8 Oregon. However, to do so, USC needs to get back on track, and a dominant win over Cal would do just that. Kickoff between the Trojans and Golden Bears is scheduled for 1 p.m. at Memorial Stadium in what could be the last game in a series that started over 100 years ago. The game will be broadcast on Pac-12 Network.\n```"}

Let\u2019s discuss what went down at the first major competition of the season.\n\nKevin Aymoz, of France, competes in the men's free skate program during the Skate America figure skating event in Allen, Texas, Saturday, Oct. 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Roger Steinman)\n\nBy Valerie Fang October 27, 2023 at 8:07 pm PDT\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. Welcome to another edition of In the Loop! It has been a while since my last competition review, so let\u2019s dive right into it. The news of the week is that we have officially entered the Grand Prix series. Skate America is the first stop and is usually our first opportunity to watch some skaters\u2019 new programs. Typically, some skaters struggle with their performances at this event because they are still trying to get comfortable with the new programs. It will usually improve as the season goes on. This review will be focusing on men\u2019s skating.\n\nLet\u2019s review what went down at the first major competition of the season. We\u2019ll start with my personal favorites. Please promise me that you will check out Kevin Aymoz\u2019s new free skate \u2014 Ravel\u2019s \u201cBolero.\u201d The last \u201cBolero\u201d I saw being skated to was Kamila Valieva\u2019s long program in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons. If Valieva\u2019s version is described as sophisticated and elegant, Aymoz\u2019s rendition of the classic impressed me with its pure passion and magnetic force. His \u201cBolero\u201d had an emphasis on showcasing the music\u2019s emotional progression. Aymoz started the show with an almost ballet-esque stability. The texture of the program then grew more and more intense. As the music reached its climax near the end, Aymoz finished off his skate with a radiant knee slide and on-beat choreo sequence. His passion was contagious, as always. He was not even phased by the landing of his triple salchow and managed to give us an exciting performance. Kudos to Aymoz for achieving an almost clean long program at the very first Grand Prix stop. I think his next goal would be improving his technicality to get his Grades of Execution even higher.\n\nAnother surprise for me was Deniss Vasiljevs\u2019 free skate \u2014 \u201cBlues Deluxe.\u201d New season, new style for Vasiljevs. And wow, now he might just be the coolest guy in the house. Despite making several major mistakes like popping the opening salchow and failing to connect a double axel to his triple axel due to a shaky landing, the program overall was still highly pleasant and entertaining. In this era ruled by jumping machines, we often find some skaters can\u2019t \u201cskate,\u201d despite achieving some of the highest technical scores out there. At least for me, a good way to help determine whether a program is \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and \u201cwell rounded\u201d or not is to see if it still feels engaging without the jumps. So, I recommend also checking out this preview of \u201cBlues Deluxe,\u201d where Vasiljevs skips all the jumps and instead focuses on giving the overall presentation of this program. I see freedom in his every movement. It is as if he is dancing on ice. You will find that, as I have argued many times in this column, a good skate does not depend on jumping. As illustrated by this preview, what matters more is what comes in between the jumps, what connects everything and what makes the whole performance flow. \u201cBlues Deluxe\u201d earned Vasiljevs a score of 139.50 at Skate America, but I\u2019m not too stressed. He still has time to get used to and then improve the new program. I can\u2019t wait to witness how it will mature over the course of this season!\n\nOn to America\u2019s favorite figure skater right now, Ilia Malinin. The good thing is that I think his team made a good decision to abandon his quad axel in the effort to improve his once-pathetic component score. The bad thing is about his choice of music because I\u2019m not sure if he can handle it. My jaw dropped when I recognized Malinin\u2019s program music \u2014 selection from the soundtrack of \u201cSuccession.\u201d If you decide to use the music from a highly prestigious television show, you better incorporate its dynamics and tension into the program, or you are just wasting time and the music itself. As a character-driven and emotionally complex masterpiece, \u201cSuccession\u201d stands at the pinnacle of television. It symbolizes the cosmic narrative power of our imagination. It represents a close observation of humanity and our society. But on the contrary and disappointingly, Malinin\u2019s performance was shallow. It lacked basic expressiveness and emotional depth. It was another program of which the only notable aspect was the technicality and nothing more. In essence, it was a violation of the performative nature of this sport. Does his choreo have a theme? There were a couple of weird arm movements that did not speak to the music whatsoever. I couldn\u2019t see any intention. And let\u2019s not forget that this show is, afterall, a tragedy. Whenever I stream its soundtrack, the music puts a weight on my heart. If you don\u2019t have the ability to command it, Nicholas Britell\u2019s music will swallow you whole. The viewing experience got even more jarring with all the overexcited comments. \u201cArtistry\u201d? I don\u2019t think so, Tara. It\u2019s probably too soon to use this word. Instead, I\u2019ll quote the great Jeremy Strong, who played Kendall Roy in \u201cSuccession,\u201d with a twist \u2014 I thought it did NOT make sense dramaturgically.\n\nThat\u2019s a wrap on this year\u2019s Skate America! Don\u2019t forget to tune into Skate Canada this weekend if you get a chance. The lineup includes Cha Jun-hwan (2023 Worlds silver, 2022 Four Continents gold), Sakamoto Kaori (2022 Olympic Bronze, two-time World Champion), my personal delight Watanabe Rinka (2022 Skate Canada champion) and many more talents. Until then. \u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza October 27, 2023 at 7:45 pm PDT\n\nThe rest-of-season outlook for the \u201823 Trojans has changed considerably after their most recent losses to then-No. 21 Notre Dame and then-No. 14 Utah. Many storylines have mounted in the days following, a good amount surrounding Coach Lincoln Riley. Riley missed 2 days of practice this week for the first time in 20 years after a brief bout of pneumonia. Critics were quick to conclude that Riley may be entertaining leaving for the NFL, seeking employment elsewhere, or just doesn\u2019t have his head in the USC program fully. What else could have been the reason for such a sudden disappearance?\n\nWhen Riley came to USC, he was touted as the savior for a football program that has grossly underperformed over the past decade. His first season came with a lot of success and a lot of hope for potential growth in his second year. While the season isn\u2019t over yet, the expectations in many critics\u2019 eyes have not been met. Riley\u2019s absence from practice this week was yet another reason for those same critics to pile on the insults.\n\nBut Riley\u2019s absence proves something that should have been apparent from the beginning \u2013 he is only human. Yes, he is one of the premier coaches in the country and one of the few people who have the ability to turn this storied program around. But with the roster he inherited, with the USC brand still tainted from years of mediocrity, he should not have been expected to live up to the expectations set for him in year two.\n\nIn his weekly media availability on Thursday, he addressed his illness and where he believes the team and program as a whole currently stand. \u201cCompetitively, I\u2019m stubborn,\u201d Riley said. \u201cLast week felt like I was in one of those positions where do you take away from the prep or do you do what you probably should do for your body? I chose A, and I paid for it early this week. \u201cI\u2019m very invested in this team, this program,\u201d Riley continued. \u201cI want to win badly and want to do anything I can do to help these players and coaches.\u201d\n\nRiley\u2019s commitment to the program did not seem to be in question. This tough stretch in the grand scheme of returning USC to national relevance will hopefully be an afterthought in the coming years. As far as junior quarterback Caleb Williams goes, as well as the rest of the team for the rest of this season, Riley feels like there is still very much something to play for and that they aren\u2019t far off from finding that spark. \u201cWe do kind of feel like we\u2019re a group that\u2019s maybe one little spark away from really taking off,\u201d Riley said. \u201c[Caleb] is still very engaged; he wants to win very badly and wants to improve and do as much as he can for the team. ... He wants to lead these guys. He wants to play better. He wants to win, obviously, like we all do.\u201d\n\nA strong showing over these last four regular season games can help immensely on the recruiting trail, a place where USC has been lacking in its mediocre stretch this past decade. \u201cThere\u2019s a process that we\u2019re right in the middle of, and I think we\u2019ve made great progress on, but we still clearly have a lot of work to do,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe brand, though, and the USC degree ... is still incredibly high.\u201d \u201cThe exciting thing here is I still think we\u2019re in just the beginning stages of this, from a recruiting standpoint,\u201d Riley continued. \u201cI don\u2019t even think we\u2019re at our best yet. I think when we get our best we\u2019re going to be pretty tough to beat.\u201d\n\nThe long-term future is still bright for the Trojans. They have a coaching staff that\u2019s wholeheartedly committed to bringing success back to the program, and a host of players who feel the same way. Their matchup against Cal Saturday is a chance to get back in the win column, and get some momentum before they face a dangerous Washington team on Nov. 4.\n```"}

Photo taken by Amy Wang on October 18th, 2023.\n\nBy Amy Wang October 27, 2023 at 5:25 pm PDT\n\nEvery Wednesday, Kunja Mandana wakes up at 6 a.m. to prepare enough food to feed 50 people. She starts by boiling the vegetables separately and then blends them with warm, Indian spices, such as cumin and turmeric. While Kunja cooks, Vraja Kumuda is busy with the logistics of getting the pots and pans to USC campus by noon. Together, their work has turned into the Conscious Eats initiative, an extension of the USC Music Meditation Club.\n\n\u201cWhen I was going to school there was always a dearth of plant-based alternatives and it was very hard to find vegetarian or vegan food on campus at a reasonable price,\u201d Vraja said. Anyone passing by is welcome to enjoy a plate of curry-seasoned chickpeas, broccoli and carrots, over rice, a salad drizzled with homemade sunflower seed dressing, and a dessert made from farina, a form of milled wheat. The couple crafted the plant-based menu with seasonal ingredients which students can actually replicate when on a tight budget.\n\n\u201cFood can actually nourish the soul when it\u2019s offered with devotion and it becomes something much more than just to make the machine run; It can be an act of love-sharing and giving and receiving love,\u201d said Kunja. By 11 a.m., they would have set up camp in front of the USC Religious Center featuring a table adorned with posters and plates, making themselves approachable. When they see a student rush past or a construction worker on break, they wave and kindly inquire, \u201cHey, have you eaten?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to provide that alternative to students so they can become free from stress and anxiety just by eating healthy, uplifting food which is not only healthy for the body but also for their mind,\u201d said Vraja. Vraja and Kunja have been a couple since 2019, when they met at a meditation retreat in New Zealand. Both find nourishment in practicing spirituality. Vraja has played a key role in coordinating the Music Meditation Club since 2017. After graduating from USC with a Master\u2019s in Computer Science in 2018, his longing for community drew him back to help the club flourish. Kunja has been involved with the Music Meditation Club since 2022. Before moving to Los Angeles in February 2023, she lived in Wellington, New Zealand where she helped run a joint yoga studio/restaurant as a vegan chef.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unique concept and was a lot of fun,\u201d said Kunja. She learned that the \u201cconsciousness of the cook, the mood that you\u2019re cooking in, the meditation before you even begin cooking, the offering of the cooking \u2014 all of this adds to the food.\u201d In college, many students miss home-cooked food. Although easy-to-make meals from stores like Trader Joe\u2019s and Target offer convenience, they lack a sense of connection to the chef and land. For public relations major Andrea Fernandez-Cruz, Conscious Eats is \u201ca lot more nutritious and filling than anything I can get on campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cVraja and Kunja are such a warm presence, and it shows through in the food. It\u2019s affordable, healthy and delicious, and my personal favorite part of the meal is the halva dessert,\u201d said Janessa Ulug, a second-year Political Science and Business Admin double major. In addition to expanding the existing Conscious Eats program on campus, the couple also envisions creating a sacred space for students to meditate, relax, read and savor vegan cuisine. As Kunja concluded our conversation, she reflected upon the Bhakti yoga concept of \u2018Prasadam,\u2019 which translates to \u2018gift\u2019 or \u2018grace,\u2019 and left a thought-provoking message.\n\n\u201cYou know, I can\u2019t make a tomato, I can\u2019t make a potato, so Mother Earth has actually provided all of these ingredients for us human beings to utilize and nourish the body,\u201d said Kunja. Kunja\u2019s words serve as a reminder that it is imperative to care for our bodies and minds in devastating times. By eating plant-based food where the ingredients are grown without killing, we ground ourselves in gratitude and respect for the sanctity of all life. We may only begin to see more clearly one another\u2019s humanity when we recognize that violence, on any living-being, can never be justified.

Across the park, the lively spirits of these furry friends cheered on volunteers and students alike. Many people walking on campus paused to interact with the animals, bringing Nahouray\u2019s vision to life.\n\n\u201cMy favorite part has been, other than meeting all the dogs, meeting all the people. It\u2019s really fun to be in a group of people that really love animals,\u201d Quarles said.\n\nNahouray said the relationship between animals and humans, \u201chas been proven to decrease stress and increase one\u2019s mental health capacity, mindfulness, and one\u2019s state of mind set into a more positive outlook towards life.\u201d\n\nAs the Humane Society of USC continues to evolve, the keen/zealous founder said they hope to host an on-campus event each semester. So far, the society has been a holistic experience for all its members \u2014 two-legged and four-legged alike.\n```"}

It\u2019s a plane! It\u2019s... dumping fruit flies on Los Angeles? Over the next six months or longer, 250,000 sterile male fruit flies will be dumped from airplanes into a nine square mile radius over Los Angeles County, according to a press release. The effort will be implemented by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), in collaboration with the USDA and Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner, after two wild Mediterranean fruit flies were found in a Leimert Park home.\n\nA start date for the dumpings has not been officially announced. Ken Pellman, a press representative for the Los Angeles County Agriculture Department, told SFGATE that he believes the flies made it to L.A. via uninspected produce.\n\nOn October 23, CDFA announced in the release that they had quarantined a 69 square mile area after discovering the two flies. Neighborhoods in the current quarantine area include Inglewood, Mid-Wilshire, Hyde Park, Culver City and South L.A. \u2014 including USC\u2019s campus.\n\nIn the Preventative Release Program, the sterile flies will be dumped with the idea that they will mate with female flies but produce no offspring. This will gradually reduce the Mediterranean Fruit Fly population in the area until there are no more left, at which point the dumpings will stop.\n\nAccording to the CDFA, adult \u201cMedflies\u201d can live up to two months, and the total life cycle of the flies from egg to adult ranges between five weeks to five months. If the species is allowed to grow, the female flies will lay their eggs in fruits and vegetables, causing them to rot.\n\nThose living inside the boundary are advised to keep \u201chomegrown\u201d fruits and vegetables inside their properties and to double-bag them when throwing them away until further notice. The release said that residents should dispose of their fruit in the regular trash, not the compost.\n\nThe Medflies dumped into the target area are harvested at a military base in Los Alamitos using a method known as the sterile insect technique, and are marked with purple dye. Despite any surprise this may cause, this is not the first time sterile members of an invasive species have been dropped on fertile counterparts. The PRP has been in use since 1996 to combat more than a few invasions, including Medflies (another name for the Mediterranean Fruit Fly).\n\nTo view the CDFA quarantine map, visit this website.\n```"}

His performance displayed improvements compared to his previous duel with Leon Edward where he showed signs of cowardice and hesitation.\n\nThe first three fights of the card ended in the blink of an eye. Johnny Walker versus Magomed Ankalaev was ruled a first-round no contest because of an illegal knee Ankalaev threw while Walker was on the ground. UFC medical staff ended the fight despite both fighters asking to continue. Ikram Aliskerov vs. Warlley Alves ended in a first-round technical knockout when Aliskerov landed a flying knee and a flurry of punches when Alves was on the ground. Nurmagomedov was victorious against Muin Gafurov in a first-round submission via guillotine choke. Gafurov rushed in swinging against Nurmagomedov, leaving an opening for his neck to be taken.\n```"}

Here are our favorite haunts\n\nYour USC student guide to Halloweekend, from haunted farms to campus movie nights.\n\nUSC prepares for Halloween with festive decorations. (Photo by Reo)\n\nBy Reo\nOctober 27, 2023 at 2:35 pm PDT\n\nGhastly ghouls and Franken-students, the witching season is upon us. You have carved your pumpkins and secured your favorite Star Wars costume, and now the time is near for the height of the season\u2019s terrifying tomfoolery: Halloweekend. To make the most of this mischievous moment, we have compiled a hoard of haunts \u2014 both chilling and cheerful.\n\nKnott\u2019s Scary Farm\nThose looking for a traditional haunted experience can venture down to Buena Park to visit Knott\u2019s Scary Farm, the longest-running Halloween theme park in Southern California. The farm is a festive variation of Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, a year-round theme park. The farm boasts mazes, scare zones and shows to frighten attendees, and was described as a \u201cpseudo-haunted house\u201d by Jeremy Unger, a sophomore majoring in applied and computational mathematics. Their 10 mazes mimic traditional, close-quarters haunted houses, whereas their five scare zones are more free-to-roam unsettling environments. Both are filled with live actors dead set on petrifying patrons. The farm\u2019s four shows, on the other hand, are daily live performances with a more light-hearted spin. This Halloween, the farm will host its 50th anniversary. It\u2019s located just over 27 miles from campus, and tickets range from $60 to $200.\n\nThe Basement Los Angeles\nIf you are in need of a more intimate Halloweekend experience, or if you are looking to frighten your friends, The Basement L.A. might be the haunt for you. Often acclaimed as one of the best escape room experiences in the United States, The Basement L.A.\u2019s escape rooms are sure to terrify. Complete with live actors, challenging puzzles and panic buttons in case the terrors become a little too real, each of the four rooms presents a unique encounter for its residents. The Basement L.A. can also be found around 27 miles from campus, in Sylmar. Ticket prices are typically $42, but may vary.\n\nRegal LA Live\nLooking for something a bit more laid back? Stop by the downtown Regal location this Halloweekend and watch the frightening flicks they have on film. The sequels \u201cSaw X\u201d and \u201cThe Nun II\u201d are scheduled over the weekend, and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d the long-awaited film adaptation of the titular indie horror game, also makes its way into theaters tonight. Tim Burton\u2019s Halloween classic \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas\u201d (1993) is celebrating its 30th anniversary this month and will be subsequently screened through October. Located three miles from campus, the Metro E Line stations make it a quick trip for those who would not want to make the drive.\n\nUSC Sponsored Events\nIf you don\u2019t want to spend Halloweekend off-campus, the university has a number of events that will bring the Halloween spirits straight to USC. This Friday, Late Night \u2018SC is hosting a movie night in the Grand Ballroom of Tutor Campus Center from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. The event will include back-to-back screenings of \u201cScream\u201d (1996) and its requel \u2014 or sequel that functions as a reboot \u2014 of the same name, \u201cScream\u201d (2022). On Saturday, the McCarthy Quad will be transformed for Fall Fest. The event will take place from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. and include pumpkins, carnival games, food and more attractions in the quad. This Sunday, the USC Village will host the Boo Bash from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Some stores will have candy ready for trick-or-treaters at this time. Five costume contests \u2014 split up by age group \u2014 will also be conducted during the event. Throughout the weekend, at 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., \u201cGhosts of USC: A Historical Immersive Haunt\u201d will be presented by Visions and Voices in Kerckhoff Hall. The theatrical event will explore the history of L.A. by transporting attendees back to the year 1880. Admission is free, but tickets must be reserved in advance.\n\nOff-Campus Parties\nNo Halloweekend would be complete without nightly parties all around the city. Some parties are being put on by fraternities and clubs, while others are hosted by other organizations. \u201cYou can\u2019t be on Instagram for longer than five seconds without there being a bunch of different flyers and ads,\u201d said Eva Diop, a freshman majoring in economics. Parties stretch from Beverly Hills and beyond to USC\u2019s backyard. To find them, you need only listen to the screams (and the DJ).\n\nAcross campus, students are gearing up for Halloweekend in different ways. Some, like sophomore economics major Maya Hermanus, \u201cmay have to be studying,\u201d while others, like sophomore astronautical engineering major Kayden Cutchins, will be spending their weekend \u201camong friends.\u201d Regardless of whether you find yourself studying at your desk or scorching the dance floor, we can only hope you have a safe \u2014 and spooky \u2014 Halloweekend.\n```"}

This photo depicts signs put up by student protestors at the Sigma Nu house in 2021.\n\nBy Kate McQuarrie October 27, 2023 at 12:58 pm PDT\n\nUnder the 2013 Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, colleges must provide sexual violence education and awareness programs to their students. At USC, these programs are called Prevention and Education Modules. They include both online, self-paced learning modules and live Zoom sessions for undergraduate students.\n\nDespite a comprehensive curriculum that aims to address students in each year of their education at USC, students continually express concern about its effectiveness and content. Administrators in both the Title IX office, who facilitate the self-paced learning modules, and Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services, who facilitate the live Zoom sessions, emphasized their willingness to listen to and desire for feedback like this from students.\n\n\u201cWe update the modules based on the feedback we\u2019re getting from the pre and post surveys for that module,\u201d said Deborah Schleicher, the Director of Violence Prevention at RSVP. Catherine Spear, the Vice President of Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX, went even further, stressing that herself and the members of her office were available to hear complaints.\n\n\u201cWe know that we\u2019re not perfect. So ... we really, really want to hear from our students about what they like, what they don\u2019t like, what they would like us to do that maybe we\u2019re not doing,\u201d Spear said. \u201cWe absolutely can promise that we will really actively listen and take it to heart.\u201d\n\nYi-Ann Li, a senior majoring in English and psychology as well as the co-founder of the Survivor Support Community at USC, expressed her failing faith in the modules and USC\u2019s violence prevention.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I actually learned anything from the module and everyone that I\u2019ve talked to seems to feel that way,\u201d Li said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing anything to be teaching people that assaulting someone is wrong, because people know that, you know?\u201d\n\nOne scenario in the Sexual Assault Prevention Ongoing module, entitled \u201cShe Gets Wild After a Few Drinks,\u201d posits the following situation and asks students how to respond: \u201cMark mentions that Robyn, a girl he\u2019s been flirting with on social media, will be there. He tells Joe that Robyn is known to \u2018get wild\u2019 after having a few drinks. He says that all he needs to do is make sure Robyn keeps drinking \u2018the hard stuff\u2019 all night and he\u2019ll \u2018get lucky.\u2019 He\u2019s even thinking about getting Robyn to do shots with him so he can be sure they have a good time.\u201d\n\nIn another example, students are shown the following situation as an example of a positive way to communicate consent when \u201cproblematic things are happening around you.\u201d \u201cMauricio and Adam have recently started dating. Mauricio assumes that because Adam invited him over, Adam wants to have sex. While watching a movie together, they start to kiss. Mauricio eagerly tries to remove Adam\u2019s pants, but Adam stops him. He explains that he does want to have sex with Mauricio, but he also wants to build a relationship in which they feel comfortable communicating their wants and needs. Adam tells Mauricio that he thinks talking about their physical relationship is very sexy.\u201d\n\nJasmine Damian, a recent graduate of the Annenberg Specialized Journalism Masters program and a survivor of domestic violence, said simply that the module could have just been an email.\n\n\u201cIt kind of felt like a ham-fisted attempt to represent everybody that they possibly could, and that in itself felt like the whole thing was just a bid to cover their own asses,\u201d Damian said.\n\nHowever, Spear stated that the module serves to bring everyone to the same starting point in terms of education and knowledge of resources at USC.\n\n\u201cWe use the online training module because we have such a high volume of students at USC that we need to have a baseline platform of understanding,\u201d Spear said.\n\nBut this baseline platform may not be reaching the many students who just click through the self-paced modules to meet their registration requirements. All of the students interviewed said that they had seen others merely clicking through the modules or letting them play while multitasking.\n\n\u201cThis should not be a thing that they try to make easier for people ... just being able to do it while watching TV or something allows the person doing it to remove themselves from the context of everything that\u2019s happening,\u201d Damian said.\n\nThere is a clear disconnect between administrators and students when it comes to these sexual assault prevention and education modules. Celia Bartel, a graduate student in public policy and the LGBTQ+ Program Specialist at RSVP, was able to address the issue from both the perspective of a student and a facilitator.\n\n\u201cI understand why students are upset with the state that it\u2019s in because I think it feels like a lot of pressure ... is being put on students to prevent violence in the community when the administration is not doing their job to do that,\u201d Bartel said.\n\nMeanwhile, some students do find the bystander intervention education to be essential to the modules. Joshua Sacher, a sophomore majoring in Journalism, found that to be one of the most valuable aspects of the sessions.\n\n\u201cEspecially after everything that happened with [Sigma Nu] a couple of years ago, I think it\u2019s really, really important that we stress the need not only to look out for yourself ... but also as a bystander, what you can do if you see something, even if its your friend, to stand up and say something,\u201d Sacher said.\n\nAll students agreed that they wished the sessions to be in person rather than online or via Zoom.\n\n\u201cThey should try to strive for [it to be] in person because for a serious topic like that it\u2019s very easy for kids, even on Zoom, to just doze off [or] be on their phones,\u201d Sacher said.\n\nLi expressed that the Zoom sessions make it far too easy for students to tune out because of the disconnect among the participants.\n\n\u201cThe issue lies in people not realizing that they might be part of the problem without even realizing it,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier for people to understand how big of a problem this is when they see how people around them are affected.\u201d\n\nHowever, administrators said that the logistical barriers preventing them from hosting sessions in person were too difficult to overcome. With a team of only about 20 people, RSVP Zoom sessions cater to about 16,000 students each year, equating to a ratio of 800 students per facilitator. Because RSVP elects to keep their Zoom sessions under 40 participants each and hosts about 40 each week, there is the physical barrier of space on campus.\n\n\u201cOn USC\u2019s campus it really comes down to space, and then financial feasibility because ... you have to pay for space on this campus,\u201d Schleicher said.\n\nDamian called for that financial barrier to come down, saying that \u201cThis should not be where [USC is] cutting costs.\u201d\n\nSome student complaints, however, are actively being addressed. Li expressed the desire for more specific education on how some identity groups can address the problem of sexual violence in their own communities on campus.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, especially in queer communities and [among] people of color, [are] obviously affected by the issue of assault in different ways,\u201d Li said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s cultural stigmas or fear and prejudice that stops them from getting the help that they need ... [it] impacts someone\u2019s ability to be able to learn about the problem.\u201d\n\nBartel is currently using their position to \u201cto supplement what I can\u2019t change\u201d by forming a peer education group to help address this issue in queer communities called Queer2Peer.\n\n\u201cI do think that RSVP does a good job at trying to make the scenarios gender neutral, but I do think that they don\u2019t spend a lot of time specifically talking about queer experiences, because I do think that that is different, especially for relationships,\u201d Bartel said.\n\nOne issue that administrators have been able to directly address is that of student exemptions from the modules due to the potential for trauma activation. While there has long been the option for exemption, many students were unaware that it existed.\n\n\u201cThis year we created a new, more streamlined process where there\u2019s a link and students fill [a form] out. They only have to fill it out once ... it\u2019s not very burdensome and that was a goal,\u201d Schleicher said.\n\nTitle IX confirmed that based on their feedback, more students have been accessing the exemption process than in prior years because of that accessibility.\n\nDespite these efforts, students still do not feel that the university is adequately addressing the systemic issue of sexual assault on campus through these educational modules.\n\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t feel true to my experience at USC [in] the way that situations were addressed,\u201d Damian said.\n\nWhile these educational modules are consistently being updated and improved, it may not be enough. In Li\u2019s words as a survivor, \u201cThe emotional labor of addressing the issue [needs] to match the emotional labor of the problem itself.\u201d```"}

Mike Johnson was installed above the entrance to the House speaker office at the Capitol. Following the ousting of California Republican Sen. Kevin McCarthy, Johnson was voted into the leadership position on Oct. 25. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)\n\nBy Abigail Nguyen\nOctober 27, 2023 at 12:14 pm PDT\n\nKevin McCarthy was removed from his role as speaker on Oct. 3 \u2014 the first ousting in House history. The scramble for a new House speaker began, and after just one day of winning the speaker nomination Steve Scalise withdrew his candidacy. The GOP came back to square one and after multiple rounds of voting on Oct. 25, Republican Rep. Mike Johnson for Louisiana was elected as the new House Speaker.\n\nSince the ousting of McCarthy, California has zero House leaders which has the ability to cause a shift in the balance of power within the Republican party and the state\u2019s representation in national policy, according to Sejal Govindarao of Politico. California\u2019s seniority and prominence in the House of Representatives might diminish as it becomes less influential on the national stage.\n\nCalifornia was once home to two top house leaders and the state has since made a significant impact in its role in American politics. California representatives have long held key leadership positions in the House. After Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi stepped down from the position she held since 2019 as speaker of the House, Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy was elected as her successor in 2023. McCarthy held his speakership position for only 269 days, and he has been ousted by his own party.\n\nNow, the former speaker is unable to fully advocate for California Republican policymaking since being left without his continuing recruitment, which helped the GOP to keep a majority of seats. Al Weaver from The Hill wrote \u201csome political operatives and analysts still believe he will try to help California-based candidates, though he may not have the clout he once did.\u201d\n\nPelosi secured federal funding for infrastructure and health care facility projects in California and helped the state fight economic disparities by providing financial relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cA skilled and effective speaker like Nancy Pelosi helps everyone, including citizens in their home state. An ineffective speaker who cannot pass legislation benefits nobody in their home state, or anywhere else,\u201d said USC professor Johnathan Aronson.\n\nA leading representative in the House can place a larger focus on issues specific to their respective state and districts. In a statement to Annenberg Media, USC professor Nicholas Cull said \u201c...the gains or losses from having a speaker from your delegation are marginal compared to the loss that comes from the spectacle of dysfunction on Capitol Hill.\u201d\n\nThe speaker has significant influence in determining which bills and issues are brought to the floor for consideration and when they are scheduled for debate and votes. With its decline in leading representation, California and its citizens may not receive as much attention in the Senate as its former speaker and advocate has been removed or stepped down, according to Al Weaver of The Hill. This prevents a concentration of power for the state\u2019s influence in the direction of legislation and oversight.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s ability to shape national policies and advocate for its own interests are negatively affected through McCarthy\u2019s removal as speaker of the house. Weaver said \u201c[California] has long relied on top members,\u201d leaving California with zero seniority within the House and questions to the state\u2019s future influence on national politics.\n```"}

A game that many presumably thought would be over by halftime had fans at The Palace on the Prairie on the edge of their seats. Central Florida\u2019s offense had its way with Oklahoma\u2019s defense, scoring on nearly every drive and protecting the football in the process. Quarterback John Rhys Plumlee had a solid outing, throwing for 248 yards and two touchdowns with a rushing touchdown to boot. Knights receiver Javon Baker showed out with five catches for 134 yards and two touchdowns, while running back RJ Harvey added 101 yards on the ground. Oklahoma\u2019s offense was able to respond to all of UCF\u2019s punches, which started with a complete game from their signal caller. Quarterback Dillon Gabriel, a former UCF Knight, threw for 253 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. His favorite target was Nic Anderson, who accounted for 105 of those yards and two touchdowns. UCF found themselves down by eight with 3:13 remaining. Plumlee was able to command the offense down the field, and found Baker for a 12-yard touchdown on 4th-and-10 with 1:24 remaining. Oklahoma was able to snuff out UCF\u2019s quick pass on the ensuing 2-point attempt, holding on at home and avoiding the monumental upset. Oklahoma (7-0) remains ranked No. 6 in the Ap Top 25 Poll. UCF (3-4) remains unranked and will look to carry this encouraging performance into next week.\n\nOhio State tops Penn State in defensive slugfest, 20-12\nIn their first true test of the year, Penn State\u2019s usually high-scoring offense failed to find the endzone until the final 30 seconds of the game. While the offense did not turn the ball over, they were forced to punt nine times. The Nittany Lions went an abysmal 1-16 on 3rd down, failing to get anything going on offense. Quarterback Drew Allar completed just 42 percent of his 42 pass attempts for 191 yards and a garbage-time touchdown. Ohio State failed to find much success offensively either, scoring their second-lowest point total of the season at 20. Quarterback Kyle McCord completed 22 of his 35 pass attempts for 286 yards and a touchdown. The star of the Buckeyes offense was wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., who hauled in 11 catches for 162 yards and a touchdown. His 18-yard score late in the fourth quarter essentially put the game away for the home team. Ohio State (7-0) remains ranked No. 3 in the Ap Poll, while Penn State\u2019s (6-1) first loss of the season saw them falling three spots to No. 10.\n\nVirginia stuns UNC on the road, 31-27\nThe Tar Heels offense saw major contributions across the board, but couldn\u2019t get it done on the final drive of the game. Quarterback Drake Maye completed 24 of his 48 pass attempts for 347 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Wide receivers Devontez Walker and Bryson Nesbit accounted for 146 and 93 of those yards respectively, scoring a touchdown each, and Omarion Hampton added 112 yards on the ground. Maye\u2019s interception came on the final drive of the game, as UNC looked to put together a game-winning drive. In the end, this seemingly explosive offensive performance would lead to a home loss vs an unranked Cavaliers team. Virginia\u2019s box score was not as pretty, as quarterback Tony Muskett threw for 208 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Receiver Malik Washington was electric, hauling in 12 receptions for 115 yards, including the go-ahead score from 14 yards out with 8:51 left to play. The key difference in this game was key down conversion rate and time of possession. Virginia went 10-21 on 3rd and 4th down conversions, while UNC went 4-15. The Cavaliers did a good job keeping the ball out of Maye\u2019s hands, outrushing the Tar Heels 228-143 and dominating time of possession by almost 15 minutes. Overall, Virginia\u2019s ability to win time of possession and in the trenches was the key to their upset victory. UNC (6-1) dropped seven spots to No. 17 in the poll after their shocking loss, while Virginia (2-5) remains unranked.\n\nFlorida State dominates second half, beats Duke 38-20\nBlue Devils cornerback Chandler Rivers intercepted Seminoles quarterback Jordan Travis and returned it for a 13-yard touchdown to put Duke up 17-7 early in the second quarter. As their bench was still celebrating the defensive score, Seminoles wide receiver Deuce Spann returned the ensuing kickoff for a 99-yard touchdown, quickly shifting the momentum of the game. An electric back and forth game through three quarters saw Duke leading 20-17 heading into the fourth quarter. Duke leaned on their running game to move the ball, rushing for 197 yards on the day. Jaquez Moore led the team in rushing, totaling 110 yards and 1 touchdown, including a 42-yard scamper to open up the scoring in this contest. Quarterback Riley Leonard was abysmal statistically, completing 7 of his 16 pass attempts for 69 yards and an interception. Florida State\u2019s offense was solid all game, but exploded in the fourth quarter to put this game away, scoring 21 unanswered points to put the game away. Seminole quarterback Jordan Travis threw for 268 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, adding 62 yards rushing and a score on the ground. Florida State (7-0) stays put at No. 4 on the poll. Duke (5-2) drops four spots to No. 20 on the poll after the hard-fought loss.\n\nUSC loses heartbreaker vs Utah, 34-32\nThe Utes seem to have the Trojans\u2019 number, beating them for the third time in the past year. This Pac-12 matchup has heated up as some sort of a rivalry in the past couple of years, and Utah seems to answer the call every time. This highly anticipated matchup was knotted up at 14 a piece at halftime, and came down to a game-winning field goal. Utah found contributions from every position on offense, starting with their signal caller. Quarterback Bryson Barnes completed 14 of his 23 pass attempts for 253 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. Utah safety Sione Vaki, who saw a lot of offensive action, showed he may be listed in the wrong position group. He caught 5 balls for 149 yards and two touchdowns, while adding 68 yards on the ground. Ja\u2019Quinden Jackson led the team in rushing with 117 yards. The Trojans weren\u2019t efficient offensively, but did replicate the offensive fireworks they displayed earlier in the year. Quarterback Caleb Williams was solid, throwing for 256 yards whilst adding 27 yards on the ground and a rushing touchdown. Wide receiver Tahj Washington led the team in receiving yards with 112, and running back MarShawn Lloyd ran for 86 yards and a score. Following Williams\u2019 rushing touchdown, the Trojans found themselves up by one with 1:46 remaining. Barnes would command a 12-play, 59-yard drive to get the Utes in field goal range. Kicker Cole Becker nailed the attempt as time expired, breaking the hearts of the thousands of Trojans fans in attendance. USC (6-2) has now dropped two straight games, resulting in a significant fall to No. 24 in the AP Poll. Utah\u2019s (6-1) hard fought win saw them rising one spot to No. 13 in the poll.\n\nWashington wins ugly vs. Arizona State, 15-7\nDown 7-6 midway through the fourth quarter with the Sun Devils in the red zone, the Huskies were in desperate need of a big play. Cornerback Mishael Powell jumped a slant route, intercepting quarterback Trenton Bourguet and returning it for an 89-yard touchdown to give the Huskies their first lead. Washington would add a field goal later on, and ride the home crowd\u2019s energy to a sloppy win. The Huskies found themselves down early and often because of four turnovers. Heisman frontrunner Michael Penix accounted for three of them, tallying two interceptions and a fumble. He threw for 275 yards on the day, with receiver Ja\u2019Lynn Polk accounting for 102 of those yards. Arizona State\u2019s offense could not capitalize on their defense\u2019s takeaways, going scoreless after their initial touchdown late in the first quarter. Bourguet was subpar, completing 26 of his 47 pass attempts for 196 yards and an interception. The box score of this game suggests Arizona State should have won by multiple possessions. They dominated time of possession 37:29-22:31, total yardage 341-288 and won the turnover battle 4-1. In the end, Washington\u2019s big time defensive touchdown paved the way for them to come out on top after an uninspiring 3 1\u20442 quarters. Washington (7-0) sees no movement in the poll, and remains ranked No. 5. Arizona State (1-6) remains unranked.\n```"}

Moaiery was also a recipient of the Wallis Annenberg Justice for Women Journalists Award for her coverage of conflict in Iran last fall that led to her arrest. She\u2019s a photojournalist who was released on bail.\n\nFor more than 30 years, the IWMF has honored women and nonbinary journalists who report \u201con taboo topics, work in environments hostile to women, and share difficult truths\u201d according to their website.\n\n\u201cI believe it means that we\u2019re being recognized for all the different things that we\u2019d have to go through to do that type of work in order to, you know, put out a product, the work,\u201d said Monta\u00f1o Delgado, founder and editor of The Observer. \u201cIt also visualizes me as an independent news reporter or journalist. It\u2019s something very difficult to accomplish for local journalists.\u201d\n\nAlong with answering questions from Bay, the panel spoke of the challenges from their own past coverage and also their role as women journalists. Shefte, a senior video journalist at the Washington Post, spoke on women journalists\u2019 ability to connect with their sources. She said reporters must earn a source\u2019s trust in order to tell their story.\n\n\u201cOften there are survivors of rape during war, other kinds of torture. And I think it\u2019s really important that we have women there to make other women feel comfortable to tell those stories, too,\u201d said Shefte. \u201cWe\u2019re also there to tell really personal human stories about how everybody is impacted by the horrors on the ground.\u201d\n\nSimilar to Shefte, Koh spoke on her own experience in regards to covering conflict. \u201cOftentimes the people that are coming back after surviving the war are women and daughters,\u201d said Koh, also on The Post\u2019s video team. \u201cAnd in one instance or in many instances, I should say, it was, women that were coming back to mass gravesites to look for their husbands and their brothers and their children in mass grave pits that had been hastily dug during the war, or I should say, during the occupation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to cover who is being affected by the war. And women are a huge part of that story,\u201d Koh said.\n\nEach woman spoke on their own career in the past that led them to their recognition for the IWMF Award. The participants all covered events in the world, that although may be dangerous, are critical to share with the public. The women urged students to be steadfast in their pursuit of the truth.\n\n\u201cI mean, they have to be patient. They have to be very powerful,\u201d Moaiery said in giving advice to Annenberg students studying journalism. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be tired of it because, you know, a lot of problems happened, especially for the women that may stop them. But don\u2019t stop, please.\u201d\n```"}

Though they may seem like words fit to describe upcoming Halloween festivities, they are instead among those used by students describing their emotions for a different, but perhaps equally scary, looming event: Election Day.\n\nUSC\u2019s Center for Political Future invited students to share these concerns at a \u201cHow to Reduce Election Anxiety\u201d workshop, hosted at the organization\u2019s office on Thursday. The event was conducted by Cat Moore, USC\u2019s first-ever director of belonging, and Kiel Shaub, the academic curator for USC\u2019s Experiential Learning Lab.\n\n\u201cFollowing the news and elections feels like a tornado,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThese systems are organized to go as fast as possible, not to produce calm. That\u2019s why you have to find calm and groundedness within them.\u201d\n\nMoore shared mindfulness practices on Thursday with the five attendees, including deep belly breathing techniques and a humming exercise. The small group allowed for more personal discussions, as Shaub encouraged each of the students to turn inward and dissect their emotions.\n\n\u201cStudents are facing increased mental health issues across campus. So our intention in hosting this event was to approach it from a mental health and stress management angle, and apply it to how we are feeling around politics and elections,\u201d said Schaub.\n\n\u201cDoes anxiety have a political party? Is it Democratic or Republican? Is it Capitalist or Communist?\u201d\n\nEmotions are running high as campaigns start to kick into full gear, about one year from the next presidential election. According to a poll by the American Psychological Association, more than 68% of U.S. adults said the 2020 U.S. presidential election was a significant source of stress in their lives.\n\nIn the room Thursday, the discussion focused more on technique for coping with anxiety \u2014 and organizers even included coloring exercises.\n\nOn campus, students are indeed awaiting the next election. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will come down to the polarized battle it was in 2020,\u201d Kate Peterson, a sophomore political science major, told Annenberg Media. \u201cI\u2019m more anxious about the new candidates, and how they will fix everything Trump and Biden both left behind.\u201d\n\nBut with Biden running for a second term and Trump leading as the favorite in Republican primary polls, the possibility of 2020 repeating itself has become a concern to voters who feel trapped by what could be yet another Trump-Biden showdown.\n\nThe Center for Political Future event addressed that divide. \u201cYou can\u2019t change people\u2019s opinions and you can\u2019t change the system,\u201d said Moore. \u201cBut you can go \u2018I\u2019m going to hum and no one can stop me.\u2019\u201d\n```"}

Guests waited in tedious lines for over an hour, dressed head-to-toe in designer clothing to watch the runway of new, senior and retiring fashion designers legends. They were greeted by various art exhibits and photo opportunities with quality lighting equipment for all. Vivid colors were brightly spaced around the venue and followed by projection of animals such as sharks on the ceiling.\n\nLogan Garcia traveled miles away by car from Arcadia, California with their family to attend. They enjoyed the venue change from Beverly Hills to downtown Los Angeles, as a regular Art Hearts Fashion attendee since 2015, excluding during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s way more diverse than before and the artists are much higher quality,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBeforehand, it wasn\u2019t as beautiful. Today, there were different races and ages...but it was mostly the same [as of thin women], it could be better in representing non-binary folk.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2010, Art Hearts Fashion has long emphasized its creative shows as diverse and inclusive, but attendees spoke out about the show\u2019s lack of representation on the stage and need for progression on particular runways. Regardless, the weekend of designers focused on featuring Latin and LGBTQ+ designers, including Mondo Guerra who won the first season of \u201cProject Runway: All Stars.\u201d Their designs this season stepped outside the box of media trends with vibrant colors and patterns, accompanied by electronic tunes.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re having a huge opportunity for people of color... [I put] work out there that may not be necessarily understood, but inspires that small group of people that have to fight a little harder,\u201d said Guerra after the show. \u201cWhat I showed today was really from the heart. Creativity is more important than trends, that\u2019s what I recommend for younger designers. Go against the grain.\u201d\n\nZarina Yeva walks the runway in Michael Castello\u2019s latest design. (Photo by Jazmyne Aquino)\n\nAdditional designs included work by Michael Castello, who announced his retirement with a final runway that featured black, gold and red metallics with dramatic sparkling sheer material, as well as a beautiful pleated gold lam\u00e9 metallic dress. Models walked fiercely as a projection of a roaring lion and fire intensively followed their tracks. To close his show, Castello\u2019s whole family joined him on the runway. Castello posted on Instagram that interested customers should order directly from him, allowing fair payment and living for his family and employees.\n\nThe diversity in designers and their work also cast a wide net for audience members. One notable attendee was executive producer of and inspiration for CBS-TV\u2019s hit drama \u201cScorpion,\u201d Walter O\u2019Brien. O\u2019Brien found the event to be a great opportunity to meet people of different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cIn terms of shows, Castello\u2019s was amazing,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe put a ton of work into it. Especially because it\u2019s his final show. He blew it away.\u201d\n\nMichael Castello\u2019s final fashion show walks the runway together.

Nayyab Waleed: I have no clue at all what we do, to be honest. That\u2019s Nayyab Waleed, who\u2019s in her first year at USC. For junior Tyler Vondriska, knowing what to do in case of an active shooter is necessary because it keeps happening. Tyler Vondriska: I haven\u2019t really learned the safety procedures from USC itself, but unfortunately living in the United States I feel like I\u2019ve been trained in schools throughout my entire life so I have a general sense of what to do. Other schools teach their students what to do... says junior Grace Gerstner. Grace Gerstner: When I was in like high school, we had like what we should do but I\u2019ve never learned anything about what the USC protocols are. which sadly.. like any other school... is not immune from threats... Nick Zhao: I think it\u2019s always a risk... Sophomore Nick Zhao Zhao: There definitely should be kind of a learning model...I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever went over that with us...I know what I should do, but officially no one\u2019s ever told me anything.\n\nUSC doesn\u2019t conduct any kind of drill to practice what to do in active shooter situations. Neither do other universities like UCLA, Chapman, or Occidental College. But why don\u2019t we? Patrick Prince, the Associate Vice Provost for Threat Assessment and Management with Campus Wellbeing and Crisis Intervention, explained the trade-off of why \u2014 or why not \u2014 to hold a campus wide drill. Patrick Prince: When you do a simulation...how do you do it in a way that doesn\u2019t create more emotional distress and triggering than it does comforting and teaching? Prince: Does it have the real outcome we\u2019re looking for? Prince says strategic rather than systemic training, is the best option. He says training their administration.. faculty.. and staff... is more efficient than trying to train all students. Prince: The more effective training is with senior leadership, with our DPS, with our first responders. And to do it system-wide doesn\u2019t really seem to have a positive return on investment.\u201d \u201cWe could probably do them all day, every day, and still miss a lot of folks.\n\nPrince says USC\u2019s measures are multi-faceted and complex... Prince: We do our threat assessment as a layer. We do our emotional intervention as a layer. We do our follow up. We\u2019ve got people of concern that we pay attention to, some times years after they leave USC. The Department of Public Safety\u2019s active shooter protocol is published on their website..... which contains a lot of important and helpful information about what to do in case of an active shooter... with links to videos . And if there is an emergency... students and others should be alerted through DPS\u2019s emergency text notification system called TROJANS ALERT. And at a minimum.. remember this from Patrick Prince... Run. Hide. Fight... Prince: The first thing you need to do is get away, run. If you can\u2019t run, then you hide until you can run. And if you can\u2019t run or hide, then you fight until you can run. Run. Hide. Fight... Run. Hide. Fight... Run. Hide. Fight...

Their protest also acknowledged the role of the United States, USC and defense companies in the conflict.\n\nArjun Bhargava led chants and spoke with Annenberg Media after the protest. They conveyed discomfort with how few resources were being offered to Muslim students.

(Photo by Yufei Hong)\n\nBy Catherine Stuart-Chaffoo and Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as\nOctober 26, 2023 at 4:31 pm PDT\n\nUSC graduate students and alumni gathered in front of Bovard Auditorium Thursday for what they labeled a \u201cDIE-IN Community Action for Palestine,\u201d to honor the lives lost in Palestine following Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Those who attended the protest sat together on the Bovard lawn. Many held up signs that read, \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d \u201cStop the genocide,\u201d and a black, white and red banner reading, \u201cEnd the genocide in Gaza.\u201d Two attendees stood in front of the lawn, and read off the names of Palestinians who have been killed, nearly 7,000 people at the time of the gathering.\n\nSurrounding the protest were five DPS officers and representatives from a USC freedom of expression organization, to ensure safety and security. More than 160 graduate students and graduate alumni wrote an impassioned plea to USC\u2019s administration, writing that they \u201cdemand President Folt condemn Israel.\u201d The 750-word joint statement, unsigned \u201cfor student safety,\u201d outlined their views on what they called \u201cthe ongoing and continued violence against the Palestinian people.\u201d It referenced two statements from USC President Carol Folt and suggested free speech is being stifled on campus.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of all this, USC President Folt released a statement condemning \u2018terrorist attacks by Hamas\u2019 with no mention of Palestinian resistance being a direct response to the ongoing colonial terrorism Israel imposes,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe are additionally disheartened to learn that members of USC administration have explicitly prohibited departments from issuing statements on the ongoing violence unfolding before our eyes, in direct violation of our right to free speech and undermining the right for all oppressed peoples to resist under occupation. This infringement on academic freedom is deeply concerning to us as graduate students invested in the future of our fields and communities. The university\u2019s decision to police speech reinforces what we already know: solidarity with Palestinian decolonization is the limit for academic freedom.\u201d\n\nAs a protester entered the building to deliver the letter to Folt\u2019s office, the crowd outside evoked the name of Israel\u2019s prime minister. They chanted: \u201cNetanyahu Netanyahu, what do you say? How many kids did you kill today?\u201d \u201cStop the killing, stop the hate, Israel is a colonizer state.\u201d \u201cWhen Palestine is under attack, what do we do? We fight back.\u201d \u201cShame on USC.\u201d\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, the protestor returned to the group after successfully delivering the letter, and was met with an emotional response. People applauded, embraced and cried. The president\u2019s office has received the letter but President Folt is out of town on business, the university said in a statement.\n\nAnnenberg Media attempted to interview six people attending the protest, but they all declined. A few initially agreed, but quickly retracted when friends urged them not to speak to the press. A senior majoring in Global Studies spoke to another Annenberg Media reporter, giving only her first name, Nada, out of fear of retaliation for attending and speaking at the protest. As an Arabic speaker, she read a list of some of the dead, out of \u201chonor and respect\u201d for them.\n\nNada noted that some Palestinian students were uncomfortable coming to the protest, because they feared harassment or retaliation, like doxxing from the \u201cCanary Mission,\u201d a website that compiles information about activists, journalists and others they deem to be anti-Israel or antisemitic. Nada also noted the real possibility of government surveillance, on campus retaliation and \u201cdeath threats\u2019' for students joining the protest or speaking publicly about Palestine.\n\nLauren Torian, a graduate student of USC\u2019s Gould School of Law, was interviewed by Annenberg Radio, and spoke on the goals of the Die-in for Palestine. \u201cWe\u2019re protesting to end the genocide that\u2019s happening in the Gaza Strip right now. There are innocent men, women and children who are being bombed,\u201d Torian said. In terms of how USC is handling the conflict, Torian said, \u201ceven though I don\u2019t believe our administration has come out in support, their silence is a bystander on the back side of that.\u201d\n\nJen Byers and Morgan Fierro contributed reporting.\n```"}

Yet after the loss to Utah, where the offense was stagnant at times, players took accountability for the sluggish performance at times on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhen the defense gets those couple stops, we have to attack the moment and get in the endzone ... and I am going to put that one on us,\u201d Rice said. Williams echoed Rice\u2019s sentiment: \u201cWhen we get our shots, we have to take advantage of them.\u201d\n\nEven with a 6-2 record, anything can still happen with a handful of games still left to play. USC has an opportunity to get back on track with upcoming games against ranked opponents No. 5 Washington, No. 9 Oregon and No. 23 UCLA.\n\n\u201cWe are halfway through the season, you don\u2019t necessarily know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe have seen a lot of ranked teams lose in a lot of close games.\u201d\n\nUSC football will be back this Saturday at 1 p.m. as it travels up north to take on the Cal Golden Bears.

Meghna Kiran, a senior and the lead operations engineer for RPL, says their goal is set in the pursuit of reliably finding their way to space.\n\n\u201cRPL, just as an entity, was founded with the goal of being the first student team to go to space,\u201d said Kiran, who is studying mechanical engineering and pursuing a progressive degree in astronautical engineering. \u201cAnd we achieved that goal in 2019. Since then it\u2019s been all about knowledge transfer and really trying to turn just a space shot into a space program. So we want to be the first team \u2014 [the first] student team \u2014 that can reliably send rockets to space and potentially even carry scientific payloads in the future.\u201d\n\nProducing new rockets capable of getting to space hasn\u2019t been an easy journey for the RPL team. The current undergraduate team was not present for the last RPL launch for space in 2019. After multiple failed attempts with an eight inch diameter motor, the decision was made to scale down the rocket to a six inch in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get our second space shot working, but between 2019 and now ... we blew up three static fires \u2014 eight inch static fires, space shot scale static fires,\u201d Kiran said. \u201cAnd then last year we took a step back. We scaled down to a six inch scale. We went a lot slower ... [because] the static fire and the flight vehicle of last year were a success, we were able to validate most of our designs that are now flying on this space shot.\u201d\n\nBefore the team tested the motor in the static fire \u2014 a test to see if the ignition, pressure, fuel and structure will work for a launch \u2014 emotions were scattered. Mezie Nwizugbo, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering, was the trip coordinator. He had a fearful anticipation of what might happen during the test, but was hopeful because of all the work that had been put in.\n\n\u201cOur next year and months will be decided by a one second ignition \u2014 or will be decided after half a second \u2014 [or] less than that, so I don\u2019t know what to feel right now,\u201d Nwizugbo said. \u201cI\u2019m very scattered, I\u2019m worried, I\u2019m also not sure what I am going to see ... Seeing like a month, months of work, years of work on a pad and not knowing what\u2019s going to happen after the second once you ignite it is kind of like kind of paralyzing. I\u2019ve been biting my nails all night, and day. Yeah, so I have silly optimism because I don\u2019t know what else to expect.\u201d\n\nSome RPL members said that they prefer to hide their emotions until after a launch.\n\n\u201cThe best emotion to have is none,\u201d Kiran said. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve accepted that I\u2019m going to cry, whatever happens.\u201d\n\nFor Kiran being out in the desert at the test site after all the work was put in makes this experience so much more real.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s like those couple of moments where you\u2019re like, holy shit, we\u2019re like, actually out here and we\u2019ve been working on this since June,\u201d Kiran said. \u201cReally it\u2019s been a lead up of years, but like this particular motor we\u2019ve been working on like the design, the manufacturing since June. We\u2019ve remade so many parts to try to get it to, you know, our high standards and tolerance and, you know, as perfect as we can get it because like, especially on this scale of motor, there\u2019s no room for error, pretty much.\u201d\n\nDue to there not being any room for error, finding and making fixes before the test is a normal part of the days leading up to the static fire. Not finding any issues would be a bigger cause for concern. Kiran noted a last minute issue that occurred the day before the test.\n\nWhile in the desert, \u201cwe had, during motor integration, a tolerance stack-up issue with how our bulkhead seals on the inside of our case and we just needed an extra plate for that,\u201d Kiran said. \u201cSo Andrew Lana [an RPL member], who had dropped from the trip because he was sick, had manufactured basically four separate options for us out of different materials and different thicknesses.\u201d\n\nIntegrating the motor and casing happened through the night and into the early morning after Andrew Lana's manufactured part arrived and allowed the static fire to move forward.\n\nAs Lana was able to manufacture the needed part and get it sent out to them in the desert that night, they were able to complete integration, a process of putting the motor with the fuel inside the motor case, well ahead of the test. The group was grateful because this allowed the test to progress with minimal changes to the plans.\n\nUsually when something goes wrong, people are a bit scared, but finding and fixing things in the moment is what they prepare for.\n\n\u201cOverall we work through it and we find solutions when it happens, right, which is normal,\u201d Nwizugbo said. \u201cSo was I and am I a bit scared. Yeah, but also this is pretty normal.\u201d\n\nAll the members of RPL wrote a letter of thanks to Lana for his ability to help on such short notice.\n\nThe only thing left to do was wait for the moment that it would either work or wouldn\u2019t. The red team is a minimized team during the final minutes leading up to firing the motor, working on the finishing touches and making the motor ready for the test.\n\n\u201cShockwave\u201d performs a successful static fire kicking up dirt and debris around the launchpad.\n\n\u201cWith a max thrust of 3,796 lbf and a total impulse of 45,698 lbf-s, Shockwave is officially the most powerful solid motor ever fired by students!\u201d RPL said.\n\nDuring the static fire smoke started emanating from the case. According to RPL, \u201cSmoke from [the] case was not a result of combustion chamber leakage and did not affect the structural integrity of the CFRP case.\u201d\n\nAs the rocket fired successfully, the weight of the accomplishment hit everyone in the bunker. Students erupted into cheers, giving each other hugs, crying and clamoring \u201cWe did that!\u201d This means there could be a \u201cspace shot!\u201d \u2014 a launch that reaches space.\n\nRomit Banerjee, a member of the data acquisition team and junior majoring in mechanical engineering, cried and hugged the people around him as he was flooded with joy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe it.\u201d Banerjee said. \u201cI think we just there\u2019s like a certain point where it goes from like, that was cool to like, oh, that was art. I think we passed that boundary. That was just, there\u2019s just something else about what we just did. That was art.\u201d\n\nFor these students, this success validates the work and effort of their multi-year goal.\n\n\u201cIt means everything,\u201d Banerjee said. \u201cThis team means so much to me. Everyone here is like family to me. And like, the fact that, we all did this, \u2014 like we did it! There\u2019s no other way to describe it. I don\u2019t have the words to describe what I\u2019m feeling right now. Except I am so deeply proud.\u201d\n\nFor Jacqueline Nguyen, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering who worked on composites for the project, it was her first time at a static fire event.\n\n\u201cI was blown away. I was a little nervous, but it was amazing. It was insane,\u201d Nguyen said.\n\nJessica Ridgeway, the lead propulsion engineer, was reminded of all the years of struggle this success meant for her and the program.\n\n\u201c[It was] just instant tears when I saw that firing, We\u2019ve come such a long way,\u201d Ridgeway said. \u201cThis is \u2013 I was counting \u2013 my seventh time integrating a motor. And we\u2019ve made eight motors since my freshman year, and I\u2019ve been a part of all of those. I\u2019ve seen so many \u2018almost\u2019s. [And] to see the growth of the team producing this motor, and to see that work was just one of the best things I\u2019ve felt.\u201d\n\nFor Ainsley Starr, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, and member of the red team or the essential minimized team of leads during the final minutes leading up to launch, this meant a lot to her as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen two failed eight inch static fires my freshman year and sophomore year,\u201d Starr said. \u201cSo to see a successful one and the amount of work I put into it, the amount of work our team has put into it and the amount of growth our propellant team has seen is amazing. I\u2019m so proud of everyone and I\u2019m so excited to take over and continue what Jess has done [next year].\u201d\n\nRPL said on Instagram that this rocket motor \u201cShockwave is the most powerful solid-rocket motor ever fired by students, as well as the most powerful composite-case solid-rocket motor ever fired by amateurs.\u201d\n\nBecause it was a continuous burn and didn\u2019t blow up, it is considered a working and successful static fire.\n\n\u201cIt means all the components that we made on the static fire are going to hold the pressure we need, [and] are going to withstand the temperature and the thrust,\u201d Kiran said.\n\nJuan Contreras, the data acquisition lead for RPL and a senior majoring in aerospace engineering, talked about how the implications of breaking the most powerful motor record meant that this motor\u2019s fuel to force efficiency should help them get back to space.\n\n\u201cWith having successfully static fire this weekend and having now data that supports our simulations, we can safely say that our motor design and our entire kind of design for our rocket is capable [of] not only reaching space, but kind of surpassing our record if everything goes well,\u201d Contreras said.\n\nTraveler III and Traveler IV were rocket launches in 2018 and 2019 that aimed for space with Traveler IV being the rocket that got them there. This static fire test was a \u201cqualification of the largest motor we\u2019ve ever made that\u2019s supposed to get us well above our previously held record [for] altitude well past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line [the proposed boundary between Earth\u2019s atmosphere and outer space],\u201d Ridgeway said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the largest motor we have ever fired and it\u2019s kind of insane for us, [because] we\u2019ve been trying to go back to space bigger and stronger since [the Traveler III and Traveler IV] era. And we\u2019ve had so many people put [their] hands in to help get us here, [and] get us back, so it\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nIf the simulations are successful, RPL might not have to worry about other groups taking their records away. They are going where no amateur team has gone before or might be able to go again without extreme difficulty and precision.\n\n\u201cThis motor has a predictive apogee [or highest point] of a little bit over 400,000 feet, which will break the record we currently hold and is almost at the legal limit [of 485,000 feet],\u201d Kiran said. \u201cSo the theory is that, if we are able to actually make the static fire work, and have the flight vehicle work, we will have that record and theoretically no one can beat it.\u201d\n\nThe progress is one not-so-small step for USC\u2019s RPL team, and a giant leap for the future of student and amateur rocketry.\n```"}

Angel City lost its first playoff game in club history on Friday, falling to the OL Reign 1-0 in Seattle. It was a stodgy, tense affair in which both teams were more afraid of making a critical error than they were concerned with creating chances. The Reign and ACFC combined for just 13 total shots in the match, with Angel City failing to post even one shot on target. Angel City edged the Reign on possession (55% to 45%) and completed over 100 more passes, but its possession style fell flat on the road.\n\nAngel City managed to hold onto a 0-0 scoreline until the 87th minute, when Reign right winger Veronica Latsko headed in the winner point-blank, just beating defenders Paige Nielsen and Mary Alice Vignola to the ball. Rookie goalkeeper Angelina Andersen acquitted herself well enough in this match, though Angel City surely missed its first-choice keeper and team leader Dijana \u201cDiDi\u201d Hara\u010di\u0107, who had started 18 of Angel City\u2019s NWSL matches.\n\nWhen you watch the highlights back on YouTube, there\u2019s not one clip that I would characterize as positive for Angel City. Despite the heartbreaking loss, Angel City has undoubtedly had a positive season. Most importantly, 2023 NWSL Draft No. 1 pick Alyssa Thompson looks like a future star. Four goals and two assists in 21 NWSL matches may not sound like a ton, but that crude stat line doesn\u2019t do justice to how Thompson tortured defenders with her close-control dribbling and energy. Besides, just adapting to life as a pro while still finishing high school must\u2019ve been a challenge. In an Instagram post after the Reign match, Thompson called 2023 \u201cthe most hectic year of [her] life,\u201d but she clearly loves ACFC. \u201cI could not think of a better club to start my professional career at.\u201d\n\nSecond, the club seems to have found its coach for the future. As I\u2019ve noted many times in this column, Angel City was defeated just twice under Becki Tweed\u2019s leadership, including this weekend\u2019s playoff loss. She earned her place as one of three nominees for NWSL coach of the year and should continue to work with this club, unless some major breakdown in contract talks occurs.\n\nAmid Thompson\u2019s hype and Tweed\u2019s success, though, Sarah Gorden\u2019s season might have gone under the radar. Not only did Gorden play every single minute of every NWSL match this season \u2014 one of just seven players to do so \u2014 she played damn good soccer! Her ability to progress the ball shined in the second half of the season as Angel City adopted a more cohesive possession strategy. Per FBref\u2019s stats-keeping, Gordon played 3.76 progressive passes per 90 minutes, a solid 67th percentile among her positional peers, and had an even more impressive 0.87 progressive carries per 90, good for 87th percentile among centerbacks. Beyond anything stats can measure, Gordon just looks unreasonably calm at the back, which presumably makes her teammates more comfortable and carefree going forward. She will be a key member of this team for the next few seasons and may soon earn the first U.S. women\u2019s national team cap of her career.\n\nThe mood will always feel gloomy after a playoff loss, but rest assured, Angel City will be back.\n\nLAFC\u2019s playoff opponent unveiled/Assessing my Decision Day predictions\n\nMaking predictions is hard, guys. Last week I gave myself the ambitious task of predicting every relevant Decision Day match between Western Conference teams in order to chart a potential playoff bracket for LAFC. And I failed miserably. Besides St. Louis City, who mathematically had locked up first place on Decision Day, my entire running order for the Western Conference was wrong. Most embarrassingly, the team I picked to finish in seventh, the Portland Timbers, fell all the way to 10th as a result of their 3-1 loss to the Houston Dynamo. FC Dallas, who I predicted to miss the playoffs, instead smacked the Galaxy 4-1 to seal the seventh place berth.\n\nSince I had estimated that LAFC would finish in second, the club played Portland in my hypothetical scenario, but instead dropped to third place with a 1-1 draw in Vancouver. As such, LAFC earned itself a rematch with the sixth place Vancouver Whitecaps in the first round of the playoffs. By failing to secure second, the black and gold have set themselves up for a sneaky-tricky best-of-three series.\n\nAt the very beginning of the season, way back in April, LAFC crushed the Whitecaps in the CONCACAF Champions League, winning 6-0 on aggregate in the two-leg knockout round. But in MLS play in June, Vancouver figured LAFC out, winning 3-2 at BMO Stadium before this past weekend\u2019s draw. Even accounting for cagey playoff soccer, we should expect goals in this series. Whitecaps matches averaged 3.03 total goals per game this season, tied for fifth-highest in the league and the most among Western Conference playoff teams, per Footystats. I still favor LAFC to advance, but don\u2019t be surprised if it requires all three matches to secure the series.\n\nP.S.: I recommend you leave predicting to the professionals.\n\nIloski powers OCSC to USL Championship QF\n\nSince we knocked the Galaxy and LAFC out in one section, let\u2019s get to the real stuff: USL Championship playoff soccer! In the Western Conference quarterfinals, our guy Milan Iloski continued to prove why he\u2019s ready to make the leap from Orange County to Europe. Orange County SC (No. 2 seed) knocked off El Paso Locomotive FC (No. 7 seed) 1-0 in front of a sellout crowd of 5,500, with Iloski scoring the all-important goal off a smartly-taken free kick: From about 20 yards, the SoCal native wrapped the ball low and around El Paso\u2019s wall with enough pace that Locomotive goalkeeper Benny Diaz didn\u2019t have time to react.\n\nOrange County could\u2019ve easily had more than just the one goal, too. The team had 14 shots, six on target, including one \u201cbig chance missed,\u201d according to FotMob\u2019s data. Iloski himself nearly scored a second when he won the ball back high up the field and broke forward with Diaz way off his line. However, three El Paso defenders swarmed Iloski quickly enough that by the time he squared toward the goal to shoot, the angle had disappeared.\n\nA quick perusal of the highlights reveals that Iloski was the most dangerous attacker on the pitch and that Orange County played far better than the measly 1-0 scoreline shows. The Morten Karlsen-coached side has as good a shot as any at winning the USL Championship title.\n\nNext games:\nLAFC: Saturday, Oct. 28 vs. Vancouver Whitecaps (home)\nOrange County SC: Saturday, Oct. 28 vs. Phoenix Rising FC (home)\nAngel City: N/A, season\u2019s over\nLA Galaxy: N/A, season\u2019s over\n```"}

Chargers. After leading college football with 13.5 sacks in 2022, the USC defensive lineman was selected by the Chargers in the second round of this year\u2019s NFL Draft.\n\nDespite early-season struggles for L.A.\u2019s defense as a whole, Tuipulotu has been a bright spot, bursting onto the scene with sacks in each of his first two games. \u201cHe\u2019s tough, rugged, low-maintenance,\u201d said defensive coordinator Derrick Ansley before L.A.\u2019s game against the Vikings about Tuipulotu. \u201cHe\u2019s a throwback-type guy, loves contact, plays with a high motor.\u201d\n\nAdded to a pass rushing group that already includes superstars Khalil Mack and Joey Bosa, the L.A. native has played more than half of the Chargers\u2019 defensive snaps in each game since Week 1. So far this season, Tuipulotu has lined up on both the exterior and interior of the Chargers\u2019 defensive line and has been used in both passing and rushing situations, proving capable wherever he plays.\n\n\u201c[Lining up all over the defensive line] takes me back to my USC days because we did the same thing my last year over there, where I would just roam around and jump through stuff,\u201d said Tuipulotu after his strong first two games of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s fun being able to be on the same field as K-Mack and Joey at the same time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his two sacks\u2014good for third in the league among rookies\u2014the former Trojan has also registered five tackles for a loss, tying him for the most among rookies and second on the Chargers through six games. \u201cTuli is a baller, man,\u201d said Mack after L.A.\u2019s 0-2 start to the season. \u201cHe\u2019s going out there and playing grown man football.\u201d\n\nDespite having only just turned 21, Tuipulotu is already being trusted by head coach Brandon Staley in important defensive situations. \u201cHe just does a lot of things that winning edge players do. He can rush the passer. He is rugged in the run game. We can move him around. He has a big-time motor. You see that motor get him to a lot of the plays. He has been around the quarterback a lot this year,\u201d Staley said.\n\nWith a record of 2-4 and with its bye week already in the rearview, L.A.\u2019s season isn\u2019t over, but it certainly is sputtering. The Chargers now look ahead back-to-back games against teams who will be without their starting quarterback: the Bears, who will be without Justin Fields, then the Zach Wilson-led Jets, a stretch that should hopefully provide some relief to the team\u2019s struggling defensive unit.\n\nWin or lose, this is only the beginning of a promising NFL career for Tuli Tuipulotu.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/26/talking-trades-possible-moves-prior-to-the-nfl-trade-deadline/", "response": "```\nThe halfway mark of the NFL season is approaching, and front offices around the league can now better gauge where their teams stand in the race for the Lombardi. Ascending organizations may be looking for reinforcements to push them into playoff or even Super Bowl contention, while those with a growing loss column could opt to \u201cblow it up\u201d and allocate resources to a substantial retooling in the offseason. With the trade deadline less than a week away, let\u2019s take a look at potential moves that could come to fruition in the coming days.\n\nMost likely trades\n\nPanthers give Bryce Young a WR1\nCandidates: Denver Broncos receiver Jerry Jeudy, Arizona Cardinals receiver Marquise Brown\n\nWith the Carolina Panthers\u2019 playoff hopes dwindling by the week after an 0-6 start, the team\u2019s primary focus should now be on rookie passer Bryce Young and what the organization can do to develop him as it advances in its rebuild. Young has struggled so far \u2014 through seven weeks, he ranks 26th in touchdowns (six), 27th in yards per game (193.4), and 29th in passer rating (78.7). But while his play raises some cause for concern, particularly the below-average athleticism which has failed to translate from the college game, his struggles can mostly be attributed to the dire environment around him. Young\u2019s primary receiving options, a 33-year-old Adam Thielen and rookie Jonathan Mingo, have failed to consistently separate past the underneath level. This can make it rather difficult for Young to operate downfield; he currently ranks 31st in air yards per attempt (5.0) and 30th in completions of 20 or more yards.\n\nSupporting Young with a quick separator would do him wonders, speeding up his processing and enabling him to access the intermediate and deep levels, thus accelerating his development into the potential Pro-Bowl quarterback the Panthers invested in this past spring. Denver Broncos receiver Jerry Jeudy makes a lot of sense here: a very good separator who has failed to live up to his potential in Denver and could be available with the Broncos seemingly in a fire sale. Arizona Cardinals wideout Marquise Brown could also be an option, a dynamic field stretcher capable of adding a whole new layer to the Panthers offense. Both receivers \u2013 young, able separators \u2013 fit the Panthers\u2019 timeline, and could potentially be available in exchange for second or third round picks.\n\nRaiders trade for D-Line help\nCandidates: Minnesota Vikings linebacker Danielle Hunter, New England Patriots linebacker Josh Uche.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders may have invested in their defensive line this past offseason, yet the unit has failed to take a leap. Seventh-overall selection Tyree Wilson has been a non-factor, recording a lone sack and only three pressures through seven weeks, and third-round pick Byron Young has failed to establish himself as a frequent player on the rotation, being a healthy scratch in three of the Raiders\u2019 six games. Only former All-Pro Maxx Crosby has elevated his game, resulting in the unit ranking 31st in QB knockdowns (8) and 30th in pressure rate (15.8 percent).\n\nThe Raiders are now 3-4 and coming off an underwhelming 30-12 loss to the Chicago Bears and thus, a front office currently on a short leash after an underwhelming 2022 may view it imperative to make a move and strengthen the roster prior to the deadline, with the defensive line being a prime candidate for an addition. The most obvious name to look toward would be Minnesota Vikings linebacker Danielle Hunter, a three-time Pro-Bowler currently on track to become a free agent in the offseason. The Vikings are in the midst of a retooling period with notable names Za\u2019Darius Smith and Adam Thielen also offloaded this offseason, and thus could be tempted to part ways with a day two pick.\n\nThe Raiders could also look at acquiring Patriots linebacker Josh Uche, a fearsome speed rusher coming off a career year with 11 1\u20442 sacks in 2022. Uche has been an important part of the Patriots defense, yet Belichick has shown he is not afraid to let go of key pieces for the right price, and with the team now up against the tide in a stacked AFC after a 2-5 start, Uche could be the latest in a long line of former Patriots stars to leave Foxborough for greener pastures.\n\nTrades that make the most sense\n\nBills acquire secondary reinforcement\nCandidates: New York Giants cornerback Adoree Jackson, Chicago Bears cornerback Jaylon Johnson\n\nThe star-studded Buffalo Bills defense has faced much adversity over the last three weeks, losing two defensive linchpins for the season in linebacker Matt Milano and cornerback Tre\u2019Davious White. In a star-studded AFC (and an apparent season-long race with the Miami Dolphins for the AFC East title) the Bills can\u2019t afford to stay put, and thus general manager Brandon Beane could be proactive in strengthening his defense prior to the trade deadline. An addition at linebacker is possible, with Devin White and Devin Bush potential names to look out for, yet a move for a cornerback makes more sense, a premium position which the Bills are now particularly thin at with 2022 first round pick Kaiir Elam failing to develop.\n\nThe obvious pick would be former Trojan Adoree Jackson, a seven year vet known who\u2019s been a sturdy presence in the secondary his entire career. Now at 2-5, the Giants could be sellers at the trade deadline, and with the clear connection between franchises \u2014 current Giants general manager Joe Schoen served as the assistant GM in Buffalo for five years and head coach Brian Daboll as offensive coordinator for four \u2014 a Jackson move to Buffalo is certainly plausible. The 28-year-old has struggled this year, although he hasn\u2019t been helped by defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, who runs man coverage at one of the highest rates in the league and repeatedly leaves Jackson on islands to win rep after rep. A move to a more zone heavy and talented defense could resurrect his near Pro Bowl form earlier in his career.\n\nAnother name to look out for is Chicago Bears cornerback Jaylon Johnson, now in the final year of his contract and a player who could be on the market with mixed reports on him and the Bears making progress toward an extension. Through seven weeks, Johnson has allowed a stellar 22.2 passer rating when targeted, and would be an outstanding addition for the Bills defense. Both Jackson and Johnson could be available for mid to late-round picks.\n\nCowboys trade for a workhorse back\nCandidates: Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry, Arizona Cardinals running back James Conner\n\nWhat would be more Dallas Cowboys-esque than Jerry Jones stealing headlines at the trade deadline by acquiring a star running back? With the Cowboys running game failing to find its footing to start the season, it\u2019s certainly a possibility \u2014 through seven weeks, Dallas ranks 22nd in rushing yards per attempt (3.9) and 18th in expected points added through the ground (-6.33), down from 2022 where they ranked 18th and 11th in both respectively.\n\nIn 2022 and years prior, the Dallas offense hummed with the balance of a short yardage bruiser in Ezekiel Elliot and Pro-Bowl caliber change of pace weapon Tony Pollard splitting carries. Yet with the team refusing to re-sign Elliot this offseason, Pollard is now the lone primary back, seeing the highest carry share of his career (16 per game) in his least efficient pro campaign at 3.9 yards per carry. To improve the rushing offense and free Pollard up to his 2022 form, the Cowboys may look to a trade deadline addition, with not much of a better fit than perennial Pro-Bowler and prospective Hall of Fame running back Derrick Henry.\n\nNow 29, Henry is approaching the twilight of his career, yet has maintained himself in good shape, currently on pace for another 1000 yard season despite running behind a sub-par Titans offensive line. A move from the Titans side is also likely, with the team now clearly in a selling position after the Kevin Byard trade. With Henry on big wages and the team in a retooling period, a move is certainly on the cards, and would make sense for a second or third round pick.\n\nIf a trade for Henry fizzles, look for the Cowboys to turn to Arizonal Cardinals running back James Conner, a seventh-year player who has rushed for over 700 yards every year since his breakout 2020 season with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Conner is a tough, physical runner who also adds value in the pass game, and could be a more than suitable alternative to Derrick Henry.\n\nLongshots\n\nChiefs add a WR1\nCandidates: Arizona Cardinals receiver Marquise Brown, Tennessee Titans receiver DeAndre Hopkins\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are 6-1 and sitting at the top of the AFC West, yet could probably still hit another gear considering their wide receiver play has been subpar this season. With Marquez Valdes Scantling and Kadarious Toney failing to cement themselves as an integral parts of the passing game, MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes has had to rely on rookie second round receiver Rashee Rice as his primary receiver, leading him to post the third worst passer rating (101.0) and passing success rate (51.6) of his career.\n\nMahomes does have the best tight end of all time in Travis Kelce to rely on as his primary pass catcher, yet Brett Veach, the team\u2019s general manager, should see a prime opportunity to add a true game breaker to push the team into clear AFC dominance, similar to what the Los Angeles Rams did when they acquired Von Miller near the trade deadline in 2021. A tier one bonafide star is probably off the table, yet the move for a well respected WR1 like Marquise \u201cHollywood\u201d Brown or DeAndre Hopkins could certainly be on the cards.\n\nBrown has proven to be productive with Pro-Bowl caliber players like Lamar Jackson and Kyler Murray at quarterback, and could be available as the Cardinals continue to amalgamate assets in their ongoing rebuild. As for Hopkins, the move to Tennessee prior to the season has clearly been a lose-lose for both sides, with Hopkins averaging the fourth-worst yards per game of his career (62.7) and the Titans offense ranking 30th in pass yards per game (173.2).\n\nWith an alien at quarterback, a first-ballot Hall-of-Famer at tight end, and one of the best offensive minds in the game\u2019s history calling plays, the Chiefs may view it pointless to spend resources on a luxury addition. With that said, the move would most certainly enable them to shrug off the Dolphins and other contenders at the top of the AFC and march on towards another Super Bowl berth.\n\nLions acquire a star defender\nCandidate: Denver Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain II\n\nThe Detroit Lions have been a phenomenal story this year, yet last Sunday\u2019s 38-6 loss to the Baltimore Ravens proved they still have some way to go before reaching the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 level in the NFC. General manager Brad Holmes was hired from the Los Angeles Rams in 2021, where he helped general manager Les Snead revolutionize NFL roster construction with the \u201cscrew them picks\u201d strategy through the acquisition of stars like Brandin Cooks and Jaylen Ramsey with first round picks.\n\nNow leading a weak division and the two seed in the NFC, Holmes could see this trade deadline as an opportunity to make a Ramsey-like transaction and solidify the Lions as Super Bowl contenders. With the offense humming under offensive coordinator Ben Johnson\u2019s masterful play calling and eighth-year quarterback Jared Goff\u2019s impressive play, a move on the defensive side of the ball makes the most sense, as the Lions defense has impressed but not played to elite standard.\n\nHolmes could opt to strengthen the defensive line and add another star rusher opposite to Aiden Hutchinson, yet a move in the secondary seems most likely with the Lions backline currently banged up and so far ranking 29th in air yards conceded (951) and 26th in first downs given up through the air (88).\n\nDenver Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain II is the name to look for, an All-Pro caliber defender who would immediately elevate the Lions defense. Reports out of Denver have listed Surtain as \u201cuntouchable,\u201d yet that could clearly be a negotiating tactic by a team looking to acquire as many assets as possible for Sean Payton\u2019s incoming scorching and complete reshaping of the team. The trade would almost certainly require multiple first round picks, but the Lions should move heaven and earth to do it. Surtain is that good. With Surtain leading the secondary, the Lions would cement their transition from a feel good team into one of the major powers in the NFL.\n```"}

The actors are seeking wage increases, protections against A.I., boosts in compensation and improvements in health and retirement benefits. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, known as the AMPTP, represents the studios and pitched new reforms in hopes to change the future for actors.\n\nThe effects of the strike are looming over USC students in the cinema school, as they prepare to enter an already unstable industry. Mott: I feel really nervous about it, um, it\u2019s already a very intimidating industry to go into, especially as a college student, um, it\u2019s kind of up in the air. Students like Jasper Mott, a senior acting major feels the weight of the stress having to choose between not having a job, or facing backlash and potentially being canceled in the industry. Mott: I have no agent I\u2019m not SAG, um, and so there is even more uncertainty about um, whether or not I will get employed, or get roles, or do what I love post graduation.\n\nBut, students like Riley Buchanan, a senior film major, says overcoming obstacles is just apart of what it takes to get in the industry. Buchanan: It\u2019s just a stress contributor and it kinda goes hand in hand with the benefits of being in this industry. You just kinda have to roll with the punches if you really wanna stick it out in the long run here.\n\nStudents like junior Micah Slater, a cinema media studies major says the stall in negotiations still comes down to the use of A.I. in Hollywood. Slater: Actors and background actors could have their likeness scanned and reused in perpetuity. They wouldn\u2019t own their own faces. Digital reconstruction of their bodies could be owned by studios, um, and that\u2019s just abhorrent to me.\n\nBut hope could be on the horizon... as more actors like George Clooney, Emma Stone, and Ben Affleck push union leaders to come up with a strategy to end the strike.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Piper Vaughn.\n```"}

(Photo by Jonathan Martin of Annenberg Media)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel\nOctober 25, 2023 at 9:40 pm PDT\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d is a column by Kyle Frankel about fantasy football. Finally, I\u2019ve been waiting to say this. Welcome to KIRKTOBER! It\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite time of the year. That time when Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins reminds the world that he deserves its respect. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you this fugazi \u201cprimetime Kirk\u201d narrative. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s fake news because Cousins was balling on Monday Night Football in the Vikings 22-17 win over the 49ers. All of a sudden, after starting 0-3, the Vikings may be back. More importantly, \u201cBig Kirko\u201d is back. I apologize. Monday Night Football was too fresh in my mind for me to not celebrate Kirktober just a little bit. Let\u2019s get down to business.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about Darrell\n\nRemember last year when we were all trying to decipher the Rams\u2019 backfield? Well, we may not have fully cracked the code last season, but one constant in the conversation was Darrell Henderson Jr. Los Angeles\u2019 running game has been far easier to gauge from a fantasy perspective this season. Not only is Kyren Williams firmly No. 1 on the depth chart at running back, but the team\u2019s rushing offense has actually been producing. Williams finally broke out and is having a stellar sophomore season. Not only is he rostered in nearly every fantasy league, but he\u2019s an every week starter in most of them too. He\u2019s currently the fourth highest scoring running back (in PPR leagues) in all of fantasy football, a crazy thing to be saying about someone carrying the rock for the Rams. However, Williams was sent to the IR last week with an ankle injury, meaning the earliest he can return is for their Week 12 date with the Cardinals. In the meantime, L.A. needs someone to pick up the slack. That\u2019s where Henderson reenters the conversation. While his stats from the previous season definitely were not the most illustrious, he had himself a great 2023 fantasy debut on Sunday in the Rams\u2019 24-17 defeat. He saw 18 carries and took them for 61 yards and a touchdown. This was against a stout Steelers defense as well, so expect him to keep producing with this hefty workload. With Williams out for at least another four weeks, Henderson is a guy capable enough to immediately slot into your starting lineup. He\u2019s only rostered in 12.2% of ESPN leagues at the time of writing (before waivers have cleared) so chances are he\u2019s still out there in yours.\n\nUps and Downs\n\nThe fact that I\u2019m even able to list this next player as a target on the waiver wire is preposterous. Here\u2019s this wide receiver\u2019s last three-game PPR totals: 15.7, 13.1 and 23.5. Now I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s definitely a better three-week stretch than some of my starters. The fact that he\u2019s only on a roster in 34.6% of ESPN leagues is criminal. Forget proving yourself in the NFL, this dude has proven himself in the fantasy realm. So who is this mystery pass-catcher I\u2019m raving about? Well, if you guys guessed Josh Downs you\u2019d be correct. The Colts wideout is on a three-game tear, scoring his highest PPR total of the season in last week\u2019s loss to the Brown. With his backup quarterback under center, Downs reeled in five of six targets for 125 yards and a score. Downs has been a favorite target of Colts quarterback Gardner Minshew when he\u2019s played this year. With starting quarterback Anthony Richardson out for the year, Downs should continue to see a healthy diet of passes thrown his way. He hasn\u2019t had less than six targets in his last three outings \u2014 that will be his new normal. Not to mention, Jonathan Taylor looked like he was getting back to himself on Sunday. When he ramps up to full strength, Indianapolis will be better on offense and Downs\u2019s scoring opportunities will increase accordingly. Long story short... if he\u2019s on your waivers, he won\u2019t be there very long.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad in Buffalo\n\nIt was a bad week to be a Bills fan, as they watched a miracle comeback fall just short in a game in which they should\u2019ve never needed a comeback. Nonetheless, at least from a fantasy point of view, there was definitely a positive to take away from Buffalo\u2019s 29-25 loss to the Patriots. This positive is none other than rookie tight end Dalton Kincaid. After having opportunities throughout this season, four, five and six targets in respective outings, the former Ute finally broke out. Kincaid saw eight targets on Sunday and caught all of them, going for a total of 75 yards. This all added up to 15.5 PPR points, by far the best game of his young career. Despite being substantially out-snapped by Dawson Knox this season, as Knox was initially the clear starting tight end, Kincaid only has one less target. This evidences quarterback Josh Allen\u2019s trust in him as a pass-catcher and bodes well for his future workload. I think the Bills will start playing some really good football soon, and I expect Kincaid to parlay that into a nice fantasy stretch. He\u2019s still only rostered in 31.4% of ESPN leagues.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

(Photo by Mia Thompson)\n\nBy Shadi Angotti October 25, 2023 at 6:25 pm PDT\n\nAs temperatures begin to drop in Southern California, USC students are looking forward to some sweater-weather on campus. Angelenos have experienced some highs in the mid-to-upper 80s over the past two weeks, but temperatures have dropped in the past three days with highs in the low-to-mid 70s. With only one day in the next two weeks predicted to reach a high in the 80s, it seems like the last of the warmer temperatures have nearly passed.\n\nIn the middle of this fall transition, students shared some of their thoughts. Ben Yu, a junior majoring in business administration, felt that the colder weather reminded him of home. \u201cPersonally I really enjoy it because I\u2019m from Minnesota, so I\u2019m pretty used to colder weather. So I like it getting chillier,\u201d said Yu. \u201cBut one small thing is just being able to open my windows without my room getting super hot and letting the natural cool air come in. That\u2019s super enjoyable as well.\u201d\n\nFor most students, with colder temperatures comes the possibility of wearing warmer clothes. Julian Guerrero, a 21-year-old studying philosophy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the best. There\u2019s so little opportunity to wear things as a man and then you get stamped. So layering is the only way to express yourself.\u201d\n\nFor other students, colder temperatures mean being able to get outside more. \u201cI\u2019ll probably do bonfires by the beach with my friends. I also like to ski, so cool weather means more snow in Tahoe,\u201d said Francesca Restrepo, a 19-year-old business major. \u201cI will definitely go for a hike. I had been waiting for the weather to be a bit colder \u2013 I feel this is the perfect time,\u201d said 23-year-old artificial intelligence major Vidin Savas.\n\nFor Cameron Power, a finance major, the colder weather is a stark contrast to the weather back home: \u201cI\u2019m from Arizona, so this weather is amazing. I\u2019m really enjoying it, being able to wear pants and jackets and stuff. Back in Arizona I don\u2019t get to wear that until the beginning of December so being able to do it in October is perfect.\u201d\n\nIt may be getting colder as Thanksgiving nears but for Saira Binepal, a biopharmaceutical major, the holidays bring warmth: \u201cI kind of see the correlation to like the concept of being warm and like being surrounded by love and family, especially this time of year with like Thanksgiving and Christmas around the corner.\u201d\n```"}

As the SAG-AFTRA strike has elapsed the 100 day mark, strike captains have been looking for ways to boost morale among picketers.\n\nStrike captains have organized special pickets to try to keep morale high. Strike Captain Elyssa Phillips shared why the special pickets started: \u201cWe try and do different fun ideas just to help keep morale going and keep everyone feeling good.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s special picket was a tribute to all strike pups and was hosted at the Walt Disney lot. \u201cWe\u2019re a great lot for people to bring their dogs. So we thought, why not celebrate our picket pups for a day,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nOrganizers coined the 104th day of picketing as The Dog Days of the Strike. Michelle C. Bonilla, another strike captain at the Disney lot, said, \u201cit\u2019s a morale booster in and of itself. It engages our members in different ways, with the dogs and other animals we get to meet.\u201d\n\nSAG-AFTRA members and supporters were encouraged to come out and walk with their pups and they didn\u2019t disappoint. Picketers came out in full force with their four-legged friends.\n\nGraham Husted and his doodle, Chewie, have been joining the picket lines since July. Today, Chewie came with a fresh new look as a giraffe-a-doodle, bringing smiles to strikers\u2019 faces.\n\nHusted, a writer and actor, said, \u201cthe experience, it can be draining. It can be demoralizing at times.\u201d Husted said that these special pickets help to ease these woes: \u201cHaving the little distraction of a fun, happy-go-lucky pup is nice. Who doesn\u2019t love a puppy?\u201d\n\nLauren Aparicio joined the picket for the first time today after the extra encouragement from the special picket, she said. The actor, who was accompanied by her maltese-yorkie, Bohdi, said, \u201cobviously, our animals give us dopamine and serotonin and all the good happiness,\u201d adding, \u201cso why wouldn\u2019t I want to bring out my dog and see a bunch of other dogs?\u201d\n\nBut puppy love isn\u2019t the only reason why Aparicio finally made it out to a lot. \u201cWe are at a really crucial time with negotiations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to come out and support and give them the energy.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether you\u2019re a SAG-AFTRA or WGA member, support is still encouraged and welcomed. Kristen Karaliunas, a non-union worker in the industry, has been joining picket lines with her dog, Betty, since July, often picketing at the Fox Lot in Los Angeles.\n\nKaraliunas and Betty made their way out to the Disney Lot for the Dog Days Picket. She said that she loves letting Betty socialize: \u201cit\u2019s nice to bring her and help boost morale.\u201d\n\nBeing a part of industry support staff, Karaliunas said, \u201cbeing on strike is hard, being support staff that supports those on strike is hard, but standing with other folks is so important.\u201d She said that she and Betty will continue to show up for them.\n\nThese special strikes haven\u2019t been met with positive responses from everyone though. Strike Captain Jule Bruff recalled some of the backlash. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely heard some push back about it,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people are saying, you guys are having too much fun. This is serious,\u201d but according to Bruff, having fun is exactly the point. \u201cJoy is a form of resistance. We\u2019re not going to let you ruin our days,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping to make strikers and supporters feel welcomed to join the line is a crucial element of Jules\u2019 job: \u201cWe try to have host energy and make people feel like, thank you for welcoming me to be here,\u201d she said.\n\nThese special picket days are a major component of keeping energy and morale high as \u201cpicketing is a form of negotiation,\u201d said Bruff.\n\nAs the strike continues and negotiations ensue, the strike captains at the Walt Disney Lot have no plans of halting their pickets.\n```"}

Wednesday's march marks the largest demonstration of its kind to date since the strike started in July.\n\nMaritza Morales works as an office coordinator at a hotel that costs upward of $1,300 per night for a standard room, yet she can barely afford her monthly rent in South Los Angeles. The inequality she\u2019s experiencing is why she marched through the streets of downtown L.A. Wednesday morning with more than 2,000 fellow hotel workers from dozens of hotels experiencing similar conditions. Hotels represented Wednesday included the Fairmont Miramar, 1 Hotel, Pasadena Hilton, Hyatt Pasadena, the Beverly Wilshire, where Morales works, and several more.\n\nThe march marked the latest activity in a series of one-day workers strikes against hotel management that has included more than 50 L.A.-area hotels since July. Wednesday\u2019s march for higher wages and better benefits was described by the union as its most widespread action to date.\n\n\u201cWe have to make them understand that we are united, and we\u2019re going to keep pressuring them until they sign,\u201d said Morales. On Wednesday, Morales stood beside her fellow red-T-shirt clad employees who are part of a hotel workers union called Unite Here Local 11, which represents around 15,000 workers employed at major hotels in L.A. and Orange County. Members include workers from cooks and dishwashers to room attendants and front desk agents.\n\nStrikers held signs that said \u201cworkers need a raise,\u201d \u201chomes not hotels\u201d and \u201crent is too damn high\u201d with Spanish translations on the other side. Strikers chanted in English and Spanish. Morales said workers at the Wilshire are asking for a 40% increase in hourly wages to keep up with the rising cost of living in L.A. With her current wage of $25 per hour, a 40% increase would move Morales\u2019 pay up to $35 per hour. Most workers at union hotels make $20 to $25 an hour.\n\n\u201cWe cannot live with the wage we have at all,\u201d said Morales. \u201cYou have to have somebody else to help you out to live here and pay rent.\u201d Morales said she lives with her five children and multiple grandchildren, some of whom have jobs of their own to help pay rent and put food on the table.\n\nAn organizer with Unite Here Local 11, Maria Hernandez, said she will stand by hotel workers for as long as it takes. \u201cThey mean business,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cThe hotels need to see that, but they also need to hear that because they\u2019re clearly not listening at the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nThe Coordinated Bargaining Group, which represents more than 44 local hotels on the executives\u2019 side, said union officials remain \u201cunwilling to engage in actual good-faith negotiations,\u201d calling the union inflexible in its demands. \u201cInstead, the Union appears to want to continue to hurt Los Angeles and negatively impact our employees by continuing its Los Angeles boycott and its intermittent work stoppages,\u201d said Kieth Grossman, a spokesperson for CBG, in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nGrossman also said the current round of work stoppages is \u201cmisguided and hurts employees who are expressing their displeasure with Unite Here Local 11\u2032s tactics.\u201d \u201cIts inflexibility and insistence on all its demands will not end this labor dispute or get employees what they are asking for,\u201d said Grossman.\n\nIn turn, Morales criticized hotels\u2019 willingness to hire expensive lawyers like Grossman to defend them at the bargaining table instead of coming to terms with employees\u2019 demands. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to pay them in order to not give us what we want,\u201d said Morales. \u201cWithout our labor, there won\u2019t be hotels at all.\u201d\n\nLocal and state government officials joined Wednesday\u2019s strike as well, including Maria Elena Durazo, the California State Senator representing L.A. \u201cToday is a very important day to show the hotel industry and everyone in the community that these workers will not give up,\u201d said Durazo in an exclusive interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to end up on the street as homeless families. We can\u2019t stop homelessness if people can\u2019t pay the rent.\u201d\n\nDespite the ongoing strikes, some major hotels have been able to come to agreements, however, just a handful of hotels have reached agreements with the CBG. In September, the Millennium Biltmore reached a tentative agreement and the Westin Bonaventure reached a labor deal with employees. More recently, Loews Hotel reached a tentative agreement with its striking workers.\n\n\u201cIf they can come to an agreement and give the workers what they\u2019re asking for, what\u2019s stopping these hotels from doing the same thing?\u201d Hernandez questioned. Despite their tentative deal, some employees from the Biltmore still stood in solidarity with the union on Wednesday, according to Biltmore General Manager Jimmy Wu, who walked out of the nearby Biltmore to see what was happening with the strike but was not participating.\n\n\u201cI cannot join them, but my heart goes with them,\u201d said Wu. For Morales, she\u2019s willing to strike as long as it takes. \u201cI know they have the money. They can do it.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Tamorlan / CC BY 3.0)\n\nBy Selina Kausar October 25, 2023 at 5:50 pm PDT\n\nBad news for chocolate lovers \u2013 cocoa prices have soared to their highest price in 50 years amid a global cacao bean shortage. It\u2019s driven the price of chocolate up by almost 10%, right in time for Halloween. So, what has made chocolate so expensive all of a sudden? Weather conditions and climate have a big part to play, said Greys Sosic, senior vice dean at USC Marshall School of Business.\n\n\u201cCocoa is one of the main ingredients in chocolate production, and its growth requires hot temperatures, high humidity, and a lot of rain, which only exists in a small number of countries,\u201d she said. \u201cCote d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana account for about half of the world\u2019s production.\u201d\n\nBut right now, West African countries are seeing the opposite, and experiencing an unusually warm and dry growing season due to the naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. As a result, cacao bean crop growth is suffering.\n\nAccording to Dr. Raj Rajagopalan, a supply chain management specialist, the changing weather conditions have adversely impacted supply, while demand has remained quite stable. \u201cSo, naturally, prices have to increase,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile general inflation definitely has some impact, in this case the reason is more specific \u2013 an increase in cocoa prices.\u201d\n\nCocoa futures have now surged to $3786 per metric ton, their highest price since 1979 (Figure 1). Research from the National Retail Federation predicts that Americans are expected to spend around $3.6 billion on Halloween candy this year, up from $3.1 billion last year. This increase in spending is not due to a greater volume of chocolate being sold, but rather higher prices because of both inflation and the cocoa shortage.\n\nCocoa futures prices. Source: Bloomberg\n\nThis price hike is likely to be reflected across the market, said Chris Tang, a UCLA distinguished professor in supply chain management. \u201cMany brands of chocolate have been consolidated and are controlled by only 3 firms in the US: Mars, Hershey, and Nestl\u00e9,\u201d he said. Because of how little competition there is in the chocolate manufacturing market, many Halloween favorites are likely to be affected by the price increase.\n\nLars Perner, a USC Marshall professor and expert in consumer behavior, pricing and holiday shopping, believes retailers have no choice but to push these higher prices down to consumers. \u201cSupermarkets already have very low margins...we\u2019re talking a net of around two to three percent. So, they can\u2019t absorb the higher production costs themselves, or then we\u2019d run into an even bigger problem of shortages,\u201d he said.\n\nThe laws of economics state that limited supply must be rationed in some way when demand remains unchanged. In other words, either chocolate prices have to rise, or the quantity must fall. \u201cHistorically, candy makers have tended to \u2018downsize\u2019 candy items.\u201d Perner said. That\u2019s what happened when chocolate prices increased in the late 1970s. Firms found it difficult to raise candy bar prices so instead simply kept prices the same and made the bars smaller in size.\n\n\u201cBut now candy sizes have shrunk so much that it\u2019s difficult to downsize any further,\u201d Perner said. With consumers having no choice but to pay more for their chocolate fix, Perner suggests that they might get more creative with their Halloween treats this year: \u201cYou might find people giving out a piece of a candy bar rather than the entire bar itself. Some people are even starting to give children small amounts of money or healthier options like fruit.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Halloween \u2013 chocolate prices are expected to continue to rise in line with El Ni\u00f1o through the first half of 2024. Sosic said that this will make growing conditions difficult next year as well. Similar effects were noticed in the sriracha shortage this year, which was caused by drought conditions in Mexico in early 2022.\n\nBut the problems don\u2019t end with El Ni\u00f1o. A 2013 study by Peter L\u00e4derach, a climate change researcher, found that almost 90% of cacao production locations will be unsuitable for harvest by 2050, which means that chocolate could soon become more of a luxury good than a regular purchase unless producers think of solutions \u2013 and fast.\n\n\u201cOne adaptation strategy could be providing cacao growers with selectively bred seeds that have superior drought resistance.\u201d Perner suggests. If the shortage continues, Perner believes we\u2019ll see chocolate go on sale or be discounted less often, which is likely to affect consumer spending patterns too.\n\nWith Halloween only days away, it seems like many people will be getting more of a \u2018trick\u2019 than a \u2018treat\u2019 this year.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Tamorlan / CC BY 3.0\n```"}

Part of the LA Times Book Club series, Kevin Merida, executive editor for the LA Times, interviewed Baron Wednesday night in the Annenberg Hall foyer. Baron spoke about his new book, \u201cCollision of Power: Trump, Bezos, and The Washington Post,\u201d which covers his time leading the Post between 2012 until his retirement in 2021. However, the interview ended up beyond the pages, with Baron touching on his personal view of where the industry was going.\n\nHe had seen a rift between his own views and the views of his colleagues, prompting his self-imposed send off from the industry. \u201cFor all the internal conflicts, I just have enormous admiration for the people on the staff,\u201d Baron said. \u201cThey\u2019re incredibly courageous, work at all hours, go into dangerous situations, endure threats, and have a strong sense of mission. But I did feel like it was time for me to go.\u201d\n\nBaron\u2019s career has been a long and notable one. Portrayed by Liev Schreiber in an Oscar winning film, Baron was executive editor of the Boston Globe during its investigative reporting of sexual abuse in the Boston Catholic Church. He then served as executive editor of the Washington Post, overseeing the publication through an ownership transition to Amazon, the Trump campaign and presidency, and the 2020 presidential election. He got his start in 1976, a year which he said was \u201ca bad year for journalism,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s been a bad year every year since.\u201d\n\nBut now, almost five decades of experience later, there\u2019s an acknowledgement that the industry has changed dramatically. In his book, he recounts how the election of 2016 began to shake the institution of journalism. \u201cThe next day [after the election], people felt like our work didn\u2019t matter, the people of the American public didn\u2019t take us seriously, that it didn\u2019t register,\u201d Baron said. \u201cWhat are we doing if it doesn\u2019t sink in? Just telling people about who he was and his history and his lying and all of that. And I said \u2018we did our job. This is how democracy works. It\u2019s the same democracy that gives us the freedom to write what we feel we should.\u2019\u201d\n\nBarron recounted Trump\u2019s first full day in office, when Trump visited the Central Intelligence Agency and sought to repair a relationship between the department that he often attacked and the president himself. In his speech to CIA agents, he brought up his \u201crunning war with the media.\u201d A couple weeks later, Baron was asked his thoughts on this idea of warfare between journalists and Trump, to which he gave the famous quote \u201cwe are not at war with the administration, we are at work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see myself, or us at the Post, or any news organization, being at war with him,\u201d Baron said. \u201cI see that we have a job to do that goes back to the crafting of the First Amendment. That\u2019s what I believe. And it\u2019s sad that a President of the United States who swears an oath to the Constitution doesn\u2019t seem to understand that.\u201d\n\nTo this day, he still considers journalists as exactly that: workers doing a job. Joking that the phrase will probably end up on his tombstone, he acknowledges it was also critiqued by some colleagues who argued that it was important to acknowledge the active conflict. But, he maintained his stance that journalism was a much simpler endeavor.\n\nTrump made repeated remarks during both his campaign and term in office targeting the media at large and specific publications \u2014 the Washington Post among them\u2014 which only prompted his supporters to take their own actions. Baron recounted how the Post had to step up their office security in response. Online harassment was commonplace. Some people on staff received threatening indications that people knew where they lived. One reporter had pellets shot through a window at their house.\n\n\u201cThe threats against reporters were horrible,\u201d Baron said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what a president ought to be doing. He shouldn\u2019t be inciting violence against anyone, and here he was inciting violence against his perceived enemies, and of course his biggest perceived enemy was the media.\u201d\n\nOn two occasions, Trump personally reached out and called Baron in order to complain about stories that the Post had published. In writing the book, Baron used notes he took during the conversations, as he had figured he should take notes with the \u201cPresident on the line.\u201d During one call, Trump accused the paper of being influenced by Jeff Bezos after he disliked an article published about him. Amazon had purchased the paper in 2013, around seven months after Baron took over as editor. Baron said that he tried explaining that Bezos only was concerned about the business side of the paper, never the reporting, but said Trump was only angered by the answer.\n\nAnother call was made by Trump about a piece that he felt had painted him as a child. \u201cAnd then he said words that I never thought that I would ever hear from a President of the United States. He said \u2018I am not a child,\u2019\u201d Baron said, giving a bit of a chuckle. \u201cWhich I thought was actually kind of childish.\n\nTrump was the source of threats and annoyances throughout his presidency, and beyond, for Baron and the Washington Post. But the industry was also undergoing changes far greater than the influence of the 45th President. Baron has watched the rise in the role social media played in both journalistic organizations and the lives of individual reporters.\n\nIn his book, Baron said he loved the profession but felt it was going astray. He attributed it to the growing role social media had in the work of the independent reporters on staff. A staunch believer in objectivism in journalism, Baron had one of his speeches adapted in an opinion piece in the Washington Post earlier this year, arguing journalism demands the same goal of objectivity as the medical or legal fields.\n\n\u201cBaron claims no objective journalist would appoint themselves a moral authority or fail to acknowledge their own limitations,\u201d said journalist Max Moran in an opinion piece in the New Republic. \u201cBy Baron\u2019s standards, almost none of the journalists who proclaim themselves practitioners of objectivity actually are \u2018objective\u2019 in any measurable way.\u201d\n\nStill though, Baron believes that social media has driven journalists further away from the principles of pure objectivism than ever before. The Post had a policy regarding staff\u2019s usage of personal social media, but it would often draw complaints from reporters, a conflict he found \u201cdismaying.\u201d\n\nIn a couple instances, these conflicts would turn into public controversy for the seasoned journalist. \u201cI felt this incredible gap in terms of how a substantial segment of the staff saw their role as journalists and how I thought journalists should carry themselves,\u201d Baron said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to be in a position of constantly fighting with them over social media. I didn\u2019t want the institution that I was associated with, that I was responsible for learning, to be defined by an individual tweet by one person who didn\u2019t consult with anybody.\u201d\n\nWhile not mentioned by name, Baron was referring to incidents involving former political reporter Felicia Somnez. In 2020, she was placed on leave shortly after the death of Kobe Bryant when she retweeted a story about the sexual assault charges brought against the late basketball star. It was later concluded by the Post that she had not violated the paper\u2019s social media policy. Herself a survivor of sexual assault, Somnez sued the Post in 2021, alleging she was being discriminated from covering the topic in her reporting. Then, in June of 2022, Somnez was fired for criticizing a colleague on Twitter, after her colleague had retweeted an allegedly misogynistic joke on his personal account. Somnez has maintained that all of her actions were justified, and other journalists have come to her defense in the name of self expression.\n\nIt\u2019s a controversy that stayed with Baron, written about in his book where he defends his beliefs. Following the talk, Baron stayed around and mingled with the crowd, signing books and shaking hands. He was also willing to answer a couple questions directly, and to speak more about his beliefs on individualistic journalism.\n\n\u201cPeople should be individuals,\u201d Baron said. \u201cOne of the great things about working in the profession is I get to meet so many great individuals of all personalities and with their own ideas. Look at all these people.\u201d At this point, he gestured to the crowd of people who had hung around after the talk. There weren\u2019t many USC students in the crowd due to it being Fall break. Rather, it was mainly composed of Baron\u2019s old co-workers and familiar faces in the industry, including from the LA Times who had worked with Baron back when he was based in Los Angeles. He considered many of them long-time colleagues.\n\nIn between signing books and answering questions, they would come up to him to congratulate him on the \u201cwonderful speech,\u201d and saying \u201cthank you for being so frank.\u201d \u201cAll of these people, did they give up their individuality? No, they brought their individuality to help serve the organization,\u201d Baron said. \u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is go off on their own and say whatever they wanted about any subject whether they were asked to or not. They need to contribute, but I want them to contribute internally. Let\u2019s follow the standards that we as a journalistic institution have long used.\u201d\n\nIn sitting down to talk about his new book, journalist Martin Baron made it clear the volume was not just his own experience as leader of one of the most read publications in the country, but a recount of some of the most tumultuous years for his profession. Now, resigned from the Post and retired from the profession, for the first time in his life, he said on stage, he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do next.\u201d Journalism has been a part of his life since junior high school, but with the changing times and a changing profession, he felt somewhat out of place. At the very least, though, he feels OK figuring out what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to deal with this stuff,\u201d Baron said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to fight this battle everyday, that\u2019s not what I want to do at work. I\u2019m 66. I can move on.\u201d```"}

Niamh Rolston, Peyton Stewart, Asha Weir and Deslyn Williams died on October 17 after they were struck by a vehicle in the 21600 block of the PCH. Rolston was 20 years old. The other three women were 21.\n\nThe driver, Fraser Michael Bohm, was initially arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence. The L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department released him after failing to provide sufficient evidence. This week, Bohm was rearrested and charged with four counts of murder and four counts of vehicular manslaughter.\n\nL.A. County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n announced the charges Wednesday. He said the driver\u2019s speed and \u201creckless disregard for the safety of others\u201d prompted the murder charges. Gasc\u00f3n said Bohm was allegedly speeding at 104 miles per hour in a 45-mile-per-hour zone when he lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a parked car before colliding with the four students.\n\n\u201cThe investigation revealed that the defendant knew his actions were dangerous to human life and deliberately acted with conscious disregard for human life, committing four counts of implied malice murder,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWe have to realize that when we\u2019re driving a car, we have the potential of killing others. When we\u2019re driving 100 plus miles per hour in a 45-mile-per-hour zone, the only reasonable conclusion that could arrive out of the behavior is harming others \u2014 and the worst case scenario, which happened here, is killing others.\u201d\n\nBohm pled not guilty to all charges in an arraignment Wednesday. His bail was previously set at $8 million but was reduced to $4 million. Bohm\u2019s attorney Michael Kraut claims his client was being chased following a road rage incident. Officials from the district attorney\u2019s office and sheriff\u2019s department said at the news conference there is no current evidence showing that there was another vehicle involved in the incident.\n\n\u201cThe arrest warrant had already been issued by the time Mr. Kraut emailed it to the DA, who reviewed the case for charging,\u201d Head Deputy District Attorney John Harlan said during the conference. \u201cIt was not with any names of any witnesses. It was just a claim.\u201d\n\nIf convicted as charged, Bohm could face multiple life sentences. Investigators could not answer many specific questions during the news conference about evidence and current findings due to the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe crash happened on a stretch of road described by locals as \u201cDead Man\u2019s Curve.\u201d On Monday, Malibu residents gathered at a city council meeting to call for increased safety measures on PCH \u2014 which has already seen a number of vehicular collisions and deaths. The 20 miles of the highway stretch from Santa Monica to the Ventura County line has claimed about 40 lives since 2020 in other car crashes.\n\nMichel Shane, a film producer, is set to publicly release a documentary titled \u201c21 Miles in Malibu\u201d later this year. The documentary explores the trend of deaths and the lack of safety regulations on PCH. Shane\u2019s daughter Emily was also killed while walking along the highway in 2010, which prompted the documentary\u2019s creation.\n\n\u201cWhen Emily died in 2010, she was the youngest person to die on PCH in probably 20 years,\u201d Shane told Annenberg Media on Tuesday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re now in 2023, and there\u2019s been no real change to the highway.\u201d\n\nAlmost 5,000 people have signed a petition Shane started that\u2019s calling for safety improvements and educational initiatives on the PCH. The Pepperdine memorial service held on Thursday October 19. (Photo courtesy of Alex Nagode)\n\nPepperdine held a memorial service for the four students last Thursday and created a memorial fund in their names. \u201cTo the students who loved, lived with, and were in community with the departed members of our Pepperdine family, my heart is broken with yours,\u201d University President Jim Gash said in a statement released last week. \u201cI join you in your grief as we process this profound loss.\u201d\n\nAny witnesses are encouraged to contact the L.A.

{"key": "/2023/10/25/clippers-to-open-season-vs-trail-blazers/", "response": "```\nClippers to open season vs. Trail Blazers\n\nExpect the Clippers to fly out of the gate in a straightforward home-opener.\n\nBy Jack Hallinan\nOctober 25, 2023 at 2:12 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if Tyronn Lue and Michael Malone conspired to play a pair of preseason games that told us nothing. The Clippers played the Denver Nuggets twice to end preseason, winning the first game 116-103 before dropping the second one 103-90, both at Crypto.com Arena. Except, in the first game Nuggets head coach Malone rested his title-winning starters while Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Russell Westbrook played before all sitting out in the rematch. As such, we can\u2019t really use these games as a barometer for how the Clippers compare to the defending champs.\n\nHowever, it does seem like Lue is closer to finding his preferred regular season rotation. For one, rookie forward Kobe Brown will play considerable minutes. Brown has found his role game-by-game through preseason, starting off by playing 23 minutes against the Jazz before falling below 20 minutes in the next two outings. On Thursday against Denver, though, Brown played 21 minutes, scoring nine points, grabbing two rebounds and contributing three steals. Expect Brown\u2019s role to look similar going forward \u2014 17 to 25 minutes per night, offering defense, energy and fouls off the bench.\n\nLue and the front office also used the preseason to make final roster decisions. Despite averaging 20 minutes and nine points per game in preseason, the Clippers cut guard Xavier Moon from the final roster, along with Joey Hauser, brother of Celtics forward Sam Hauser. Moon\u2019s removal from the roster might create more room for Amir Coffey to contribute in his fifth season with the team. Coffey saw less action in 2022-23 than he did in the prior season, going from 30 games started in 2021-22 to just nine in the next campaign.\n\nCoffey didn\u2019t see much action against Denver, though, playing just 29 minutes across the two games and taking just one three-pointer, which he missed. The three-point shot presents Coffey with his best chance to become a difference-making rotation guard. Coffey shot 37.8 percent from deep during the 2021-22 season on about 3.7 attempts per game \u2014 a perfectly respectable number. He shied away from the three last season, however, making just 11 all year. If Coffey wants to re-establish himself in this lineup in a serious way, that number has to increase immediately.\n\nCutting Moon might also create a pathway for Jordan Miller, who saw his minutes decline during preseason but might bounce back if he impresses with the G League\u2019s Ontario Clippers. Plus, George looked back to his best against Denver on Tuesday, scoring 10 points just in the first quarter in addition to forcing this turnover from Reggie Jackson. Leonard and Westbrook pitched in with 14 points in 17 minutes each as well.\n\nBut now it\u2019s time for the real basketball. The Clippers will open their season against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, tipping off at 7:30 p.m. at Crypto.com Arena. Despite their intriguing offseason moves, the Trail Blazers should be a softball season-opener for the Clips. The Trail Blazers roster is replete with young guards who the Clippers can attack on defense, particularly Shaedon Sharpe and Anfernee Simons.\n\nThe third overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, Scoot Henderson, will presumably start alongside Sharpe and Simons to create a small backcourt, albeit one with serious attacking firepower. Theoretically, at least, since we\u2019ve yet to see Henderson play a real NBA game. Watch out for Sharpe\u2019s defensive battles in particular. As the tallest of the Blazers\u2019 young trio, Sharpe will have more responsibility to guard Leonard and George on the wing, both of whom could eat the young Canadian alive.\n\nWith Sharpe on the court last season, the Trail Blazers had a defensive rating of 121 points per 100 possessions \u2014 not ideal! On both ends of the court, though, Deandre Ayton can become the Trail Blazers\u2019 most important player. In Portland, Ayton doesn\u2019t have All-Star caliber teammates (yet, although Hendersoon could quickly get there) that the former Arizona center has to fit around. Ayton may not be the absolute No. 1 scoring option for the Blazers, but he won\u2019t have to defer to the Kevin Durants and Devin Bookers of the world.\n\nAnd even though top-tier talent surrounded Ayton last season, he still managed to post his second-best career scoring average, with 18 points per game. The Bahamian big man should exceed that figure healthily this season, breaking the 20-point barrier to go along with his 10-plus rebounds. Surrounded by perimeter talent and a floor-spacing four in Jerami Grant, Ayton will eat in and around the paint. Last season, he took 88.8 percent of his shots within 16 feet of the basket, a number that should stay about the same, although it will be interesting to see how Henderson\u2019s ability to drive to the rim dovetails with Ayton\u2019s paint presence.\n\nIvica Zubac will have his hands full. The 7-foot Croatian center has started 76 games in each of the past two seasons and will continue to be a foil to the Clippers\u2019 stars, in addition to slowing down opposing big men. The Clippers won the season series against the Blazers 3-0 last season and the betting market clearly doesn\u2019t think Portland has improved much since, favoring the Clippers by nine points. But if Ayton has settled in quickly, they could give the Clippers some unanticipated trouble.\n```"}

Aptly, as a movie taking place during World War II, it is incredibly disturbing, but not in the ways one might expect. It is a picturesque day in a picturesque countryside villa. The children are swimming in the stream, a mother is rustling through the flower garden and a father is marveling at his idyllic family life. This rural brood\u2019s paradisal lifestyle is imbued with a sinister truth: it resides directly next to an Auschwitz concentration camp and the patriarch is commanding officer Rudolf H\u00f6ss.\n\nThe sounds of war and barbarous acts happening next door are heard in the background, which are ignored by the characters throughout the film. The film performed well at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, but I was able to see it when it made its way to the New York Film Festival. The Alice Tully Hull screening was followed by a Q&A with the director, British filmmaker, Jonathan Glazer, and the two leads, Sandra H\u00fcller and Christian Friedel.\n\nGlazer, whose most notable previous work is \u201cUnder the Skin,\u201d does not sensationalize the atrocities or deliver a biopic. Instead, he relied on the impeccable work of sound designer Johnnie Burn, who developed the horrifying bed of background noise that accompanies most of the film. There is also a score composed by Micachu which is used sparingly, but brilliantly, for effect.\n\nIt is difficult to think of a film that is more unsettling than this one. H\u00f6ss is played by Friedel alongside H\u00fcller as Hedwig, his wife \u2014 who also starred in festival favorite \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d this year. The cold indifference that is portrayed is jarring. H\u00f6ss casually chats to some of his colleagues over a cup of coffee, as they work through the details of how they will construct the gas chambers to murder the most number of people at once. Hedwig and some of the other mothers sit around and boast about the new dresses and jewelry that they got from the Jewish victims whose belongings and lives were stripped from them.\n\nThe film purposely illustrates how casual and commonplace these conversations were, easily forgotten, an insignificant part of everyday life. H\u00fcller\u2019s performance as Hedwig is marked by a physicality that demonstrates her restlessness. With all of the characters, but most memorably hers, there is a lack of humanity that is always present. She never seems to experience pleasure or gentleness and rarely stops moving, in search of a constant distraction. It is almost as though if she were to pause, she would have to confront her own depravity, which would simply be too inconvenient.\n\nGlazer bravely tackles frightening truths about the human condition and challenges his viewers to examine whether they would recognize evil if they saw it. Evil appears distressingly familiar. While the film refuses to empathize with the characters, it ruminates on the ways that people can become desensitized, how wealth incentivizes chosen ignorance and how people cushion their lives to avoid having to acknowledge the suffering of others. It is not merely a World War II movie. It is a singular work of art that illustrates the way the world is right now, and the way it has always been.\n\n\u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d will be distributed by A24 and is expected to see a limited theatrical release starting December 15th.\n```"}

Photo Courtesy of Kim Moran.\n\nBy Balin Schneider October 25, 2023 at 12:07 pm PDT\n\nIlluminati Hotties and Silversun Pickups joined forces on Sept. 27 at The Bellwether, the new independently promoted venue in downtown Los Angeles. Both bands, hailed from Los Angeles played with energy, but the show lacked uniqueness. Illuminati Hotties, the opening band for the night, played a lively set but to seemingly few fans in the audience. The show resonated best with its power pop hooks and riot grrrl screaming by frontwoman Sarah Tudzin. However, the overall performance fell short of capturing a deep energy in the crowd. It's a lost connection. Listeners seemed indifferent, even uninterested in the performance.\n\nThe set personified how the Los Angeles communal music scene has changed since Silversun Pickups took the scene by storm in the early 2000s. Silversun Pickups, who electrified stages like Silverlake Lounge in the early 2000s, dominated a feeding frenzy of early social media bands in L.A. At a changing time in the music industry, Silversun Pickups did one thing perfectly \u2014 play live. When the band played on stage at the venue, the energy and musicianship proved they still have it twenty years into their career.\n\nIlluminati Hotties, although played fiercely, seemed to lack one core thing \u2014 identity. The band, a standard four-piece, with Tudzin in the foreground implied a dorky and disjointed persona. Tudzin, who by no means tried to appear cool alongside their headlining counterparts for the night, leaned into a quirky aesthetic. At one point the singer even exclaimed an \u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday my dudes!\u201d joke halfway through their set. A sentiment the millennial fans of both bands would like, but landed poorly. However, the band doesn\u2019t resemble an understanding or look for an identity other than this. The music was similar; it lacked a definitive style, tone or meaning. The tracks played mainly felt like an early project, with talented people still in search of their roots.\n\nUltimately, Illuminati Hotties\u2019 personality took away from their performance and made it hard to let alone listen to the music. Illuminati Hotties weren\u2019t the only thing to lack identity at the show. The Bellwether, a building that is no stranger to being a music venue, previously housed Prince\u2019s historic after-hours shows. It currently houses an awkwardly placed restaurant and lounge. This created a strange vibe with an unusual layout to the room. What was even weirder was the lack of history. The Bellwether cultivated a pay-to-play feel, instead of what should have been an important hometown show.\n\nEven though the band dragged at times, Silversun Pickups\u2019 energy couldn\u2019t be matched on \u201cLazy Eye\u201d and \u201cEmpty Nest.\u201d \u201cTruck,\u201d a newer track from Illuminati Hotties, was much to be enjoyed by concertgoers. All put together, a show presented by both bands should be proportionately attended by fans. The coupling of the two is an odd choice. But, it is worth pondering if Silversun Pickups tried to usher in a new band because nobody else would do so. Are the criticisms of Illuminati Hotties, not based on their musicianship, but more or less fused on a place where a community of music is hard to cultivate? Instead of blaming the band, should the L.A. rock music culture scene be held responsible? The identity search in both live and recorded music is crucial.\n\nThe Bellwether and L.A., doesn\u2019t have the place to serve Illuminati Hotties as it did when Silversun Pickups dominated the scene. It\u2019s hopeful for the community and talent-forward bands, like Illuminati Hotties, that the city will develop more venues like the Bellwether \u2014 but do so with more style. Although the approach is forward, it is short of charming identity at this venue and band. However, it is worth noting one thing \u2014 hearing Sarah Tudzin scream is one thing every L.A. venue needs. Illuminati Hotties is currently on tour with The Linda Lindas throughout November. Silversun Pickups will continue another leg of touring beginning in February.\n\n***Editor\u2019s note: A former version of this article had a spelling error of Sarah Tudzin\u2019s last name.

The most unrealistic part of \u201cHit Man\u201d is not the premise, a philosophy teacher taking on a side gig as a pretend killer; it\u2019s the notion that Powell is unattractive until he removes his thin-rimmed glasses. We as an audience, are collectively expected to suspend our disbelief while he waddles around in unflattering jorts, yes \u2014 jean shorts and goofy spectacles. Underneath such embellishments, he is actually some sort of ugly duckling. Nothing can cover up the unbridled charm of the man, making it difficult to perpetuate  the narrative that social media has made the true Hollywood movie star extinct.  Glen Powell is, I dare say, the Tom Cruise of Gen Z.\n\nOn the rise since his breakout role in Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cEverybody Wants Some!!\u201d Powell went tit for tat with Zoey Deutch in the rom-com to save rom-coms, \u201cSet It Up\u201d and flexed his acting muscles in \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d Now, he takes on the leading role in Linklater\u2019s newest joint, \u201cHit Man\u201d which played as one of the Spotlight screenings at the New York Film Festival this year.  Linklater \u2014 whose filmography includes \u201cSchool of Rock,\u201d the \u201cBefore\u201d trilogy, \u201cBoyhood\u201d and \u201cDazed and Confused.\u201d He continues to remind us of his tremendous scope as a filmmaker. He layers each of his films with introspection, heart and astute humor, but they are different each time.\n\nThe film is based on the unique life of Gary Johnson. After offering his technical proficiency to assist the police with an undercover operation, Johnson gets roped into a role he could have never predicted for himself \u2014 fake killer for hire. In essence, due to the prevalence of such a trope in popular media, most people believe that the profession of a hitman is a real job. It is not. Utilizing this misconception, an investigative police force decided to put undercover cops in the field posing as hit men, to arrest those who respond to the ad. His job is to get them to pay for the macabre job, an act that signals admission of guilt, so the cops can seize them on sight. Reluctant at first, he eventually finds himself enamored by the job. He does copious amounts of research on each client, dons elaborate costumes and learns complicated accents.\n\nThis is where Powell demonstrates his range as a performer, committing to each bit with the nuance of a well-crafted comedy sketch. The film cheekily bills itself as \u201csomewhat\u201d of a true story:  the real Gary Johnson  successfully made around seventy arrests in the nineties by transforming into various assassins with names such as Mike Caine, Jody Eagle and Chris Buck. Glen Powell, therefore, does not only take on the role of being Gary \u2014 he takes on the role of being Gary and Gary\u2019s version of Mike, Jody or Chris.\n\nThe most appealing part of Powell\u2019s performance is his genuineness and the fun he has with the role. He playfully chameleons from one beat to the next, tailoring each act to the sensibilities of each new customer and situation. One of these personas is Ron, who is a suave, confident and stylish killer with just enough edge to entice and sincerity to comfort his latest would-be criminal. Adria Arjona plays Maddy Masters, a nervous wife who seeks out a hit man to off her controlling husband. She has warmed to Ron as soon as she starts devouring his slice of pie, confiding that her husband puts her on a strict diet, leaving her always eager to indulge when she is away.\n\nThe classic Hollywood chemistry seeping out of every glance between the two leads is the backbone of the film. Arjona is as magnetic as Maddy, transforming from a feeble housewife to a liberated singleton. The courtship between Maddy and Ron/Gary is off-limits considering the circumstances, but Maddy is effortlessly sexy which she wields throughout their budding relationship, making it increasingly difficult for Gary to resist. This might be the first time some viewers have seen Arjona on the big screen, as she has risen through the ranks of smaller projects over the years. She has a naturalism about her that is engaging. Holding her own against the charisma of Powell, her performance is memorable.\n\nThe pairing together calls to mind the classic noir duo like Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in the unbeatable \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and the playful seduction of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith.\u201d One scene of the two of them playing off of each other in what felt like a verbal masterclass was so thrilling to watch, that it sparked an applause midway through the film screening. As evidenced by the boisterous festival audience, this film was meant to be seen on the big screen. It is disheartening that Netflix bought the rights to the film putting it at risk for burial. It is set for wide release by Spring 2024, but with the streaming platform snagging it first, it is unlikely to experience a quality theatrical release, and it is yet to be seen how much Netflix will prioritize its promotion. But make no mistake: \u201cHit Man\u201d is a hit. If Glen Powell can remind us that there are still movie stars ready to grace your screen, this film should remind us that there is still a reason to go to the theater. Be on the lookout for \u201cHit Man,\u201d will be waiting for you. \u201cHit Man\u201d has yet to be widely released, but is expected to be available to watch early next year.\n```"}

Despite the top-20 matchup, rows of seats are empty. (Photo by Sam Yang)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade October 24, 2023 at 6:36 pm PDT\n\n\u201cShout\u201d is a column by Matthew Andrade about college football.\n\nMinutes before No. 18 USC took on No. 14 Utah, I took a long look around the Coliseum. All around, it was a sea of red \u2014 not because of Trojan fans or even Ute fans, but from the clusters of empty seats throughout the stadium. It was looking like the Coliseum was going to struggle to get to 60% capacity, although as the first quarter went on, fans trickled in and the attendance looked much more respectable. Still, for a matchup between top-25 teams, it\u2019s puzzling why USC can\u2019t pack the stands.\n\nUSC has had this issue for a while now. It\u2019s so difficult to get fans to show up to the Coliseum that Pete Carroll said filling the Coliseum week in and week out was one of the things he was most proud of during his time as the Trojans head coach. More recently, from 2015 through the 2019 season, USC ranked seventh in the Pac-12 in percentage of stadium capacity filled per week. Granted, the Trojans weren\u2019t meeting their championship expectations during that period of time, but under Lincoln Riley, the attendance still isn\u2019t hitting the marks it made when Carroll was in charge.\n\nAlthough USC fans may not want to admit it, part of the reason for disappointing attendance is the Coliseum itself. It has a rich history, but it feels old and antiquated despite the renovations it\u2019s undertaken in recent years. Some have called it the \u201cMausoleum\u201d for how sound evaporates out of the stadium instead of bouncing back onto the field. With the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in town and the Clippers investing 1.2 billion dollars into their new arena, reportedly set to feature the largest ever double-sided halo video board, it\u2019s not hard to understand why fans aren\u2019t as enthused to see games at the Coliseum. It fits the Trojan theme to a T, but it doesn\u2019t have the glitz and glamor Angelenos come to expect.\n\nOf course, the Coliseum can\u2019t be the only thing to blame. The product on the field over the past decade is probably the most likely culprit. However, how do stadiums in small college towns continue to sell out even when their team is much worse than the Trojans? The theory a lot of people run with is that there\u2019s nothing else to do in those college towns while the teams in major metropolitan areas have to compete with a host of different entertainment options.\n\nAn issue with this theory is that it fails to recognize that the major metropolitan areas have more people and therefore, even with more options, stadiums should still have respectable attendance. Let\u2019s take a look at Nebraska football, for example. Its stadium has a capacity of approximately 85,000. That\u2019s 29% of Lincoln, Nebraska\u2019s population, per the 2020 census. The Coliseum only needs 2% of Los Angeles\u2019 population to fill the Coliseum. Nebraska\u2019s task should be a lot taller.\n\nThe theory also doesn\u2019t acknowledge that people make their way to these college towns from all over. It\u2019s not just the people who live in these college towns, where there\u2019s supposedly \u201cnothing to do,\u201d who show up to these games. I know this from driving over two hours multiple times a year growing up to see Oregon at Autzen Stadium.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to put a finger on exactly why the Coliseum and Rose Bowl can\u2019t get fans to show up even when the teams are putting on a spectacle. But I\u2019ll throw out an idea: there are fewer passionate fans. I\u2019m not talking about the die-hard USC fans on Twitter or the season-ticket holders who wouldn\u2019t sell their seats if their life depended on it. Those Trojan fans do exist and they\u2019ve got plenty of passion, to their credit. However, it feels like there just isn\u2019t enough passion to go around. Whether that\u2019s due to a decade-plus of apathy and disappointment with the program or other reasons, it\u2019s still unlike how it feels in many college towns.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why Riley\u2019s decision not to have players speak to the media following the loss to Utah is detrimental to the program. It prevents fans from being able to connect with the humans in the pads. How can you create a passionate fan base if the fans know next to nothing about the athletes they\u2019re cheering for?\n\nThe attendance issue is a hard one to solve. USC has tried several things to increase engagement including hiring a DJ and putting on drone shows during halftime. The student section has shown up, but the so-called \u201csidewalk fans\u201d haven\u2019t caught on yet. Maybe a few more consecutive years of national title contention can make the Coliseum the \u201cMecca of college football,\u201d as Riley pronounced it during his introductory press conference. Or maybe this is an issue that will become even more exaggerated when the Trojans join the Big Ten and teams with no connection to the West Coast come to town. Time will tell.\n\n\u201cShout\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

Skims announced a new clothing line on Monday that will offer boxers, briefs, undershirts and socks for men. The line is set to launch on Thursday, Oct. 26. Skims announced their new venture by posting an ad campaign featuring three prominent male athletes: San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa, Brazilian soccer star Neymar Jr. and the Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. These pro athletes will be the promotional faces and bodies for Kardashian\u2019s new men\u2019s line.\n\nHowever, USC students and athletes alike are a bit skeptical that the men\u2019s line will be a hit. According to the New York Times, Skims is currently valued at around $4 billion, offering clothes and shapewear for women as well as unisex styles. Skims\u2019 website boasts that the new men\u2019s line is \u201cthe most comfortable underwear you\u2019ll ever wear, designed for your best performance.\u201d The new collection features three fabrics: Sport, designed to aid performance, Stretch, for a lightweight feel and Cotton, for everyday wear. The prices on the garments range from $16 to $54 and will offer sizes from XS to 5X.\n\nSkims originally launched to fulfill a need that wasn\u2019t represented in the marketplace: a wide variety of shapewear with inclusive sizing and skin tones for women. However, as the company is known for selling bras, underwear and other women\u2019s clothing, men may be more skeptical about the brand. USC Annenberg sophomore student Jordan Willis said that Skims is automatically associated with women. \u201cI think Skims is inherently associated with women because it was a woman-owned and marketed brand, so I think the boys will automatically assume Skims is for girls, whether it\u2019s marketed for men or not,\u201d Willis said.\n\nIn an article by CNBC, Kardashian said that she focuses more on creativity and marketing tasks than the logistical side of things in the business in order to attract people\u2019s attention. USC junior and Trojan football defensive lineman Korey Foreman believes that having male athletes promote the new line is a great marketing strategy. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good look for the celebrity aspect involving athletes because there\u2019s a lot of young athletes, and by mixing stuff like this, men might want to buy the clothes,\u201d Foreman said.\n\nIn an interview Kardashian had with GQ, she stated that there was a big request to launch a men\u2019s line and that they had male customers who bought or wore the Boyfriend Collection previously. Kardashian wanted popular athletes to promote the new line and \u201choped the athletes will help Skims show that its pieces can fit a range of body types.\u201d However, Willis felt as if the athletes Kardashian got weren\u2019t big enough names. \u201cMaybe if she got LeBron to wear it, [men] will start wearing it. She needs to use bigger names in order to catch men\u2019s attention,\u201d Willis said.\n```"}

Following the tragic deaths of four Pepperdine students on the Pacific Coast Highway this week, the university and local activists came together to call for safer driving speeds. The four students were Niamh Rolston, Peyton Stewart, Asha Weir, and Deslyn Williams, all seniors at Pepperdine University.\n\nAccording to Sherrif Officials, a driver on PCH lost control of his car and swerved into three vehicles, and the four seniors died on impact. The University held a prayer service this past Thursday to mourn these losses. The Sherrif\u2019s department made a plea to slow down while driving on PCH because this is not the first time there has been a deadly crash.\n\nMichel Shane, a filmmaker, lost his youngest daughter, Emily in a car accident on PCH and has advocated about making the area a safer place, acknowledging that there are others who have lost their lives in a similar manner.\n\nMichel Shane: There were a lot of accidents, a lot of deaths on PCH. And a really couldn\u2019t take more. And not being a political person and not being a journalist or a writer or anything like that. But being a filmmaker, I decided I had to make a document...When Emily died in 2010, she was the youngest person to die on PCH in probably 20 years, and we are now in 2023 and there\u2019s been no real change to the Highway District seven that controls Caltrans District seven that controls Pacific Coast Highway in this area has been negligent.\n\nHe believes that reducing speeds may be the answer.\n\nShane: I think what Malibu needs to do is take control of a small portion of Pacific Coast Highway that runs through a heavily populated area where there are stores, where there are restaurants, where there are pedestrians, and turn that into a city street where in that section you don\u2019t go over 25 miles an hour.\n\nHe voices that building walkways may be another effective method to prevent tragedies.\n\nShane: In the in the dream scenario, I said, you know, build some walkways, have them sponsored, make them architecturally beautiful, and big corporations sponsor them. Because if you\u2019ve got 800,000, a million people visiting or you have 250,000 people using PCH as a thruway to their communities, these people will see this every single day. And if there\u2019s a beautiful structure, a beautiful bridge, it makes it a lot more pleasant.\n\nEmma Carter, a senior at Pepperdine University echoes the need for a safer environment.\n\nEmma Carter: So suddenly, when you hear that these were girls who were doing absolutely nothing wrong, they were getting something out of someone\u2019s trunk like parked in a driveway, were just killed in an instant...And that is to change like law enforcement and reduce speeding on Pacific Coast Highway. Just asking for something to be done. I think, unfortunately, accidents happen here all the time.\n\nThe area where the accidents occurred has been nicknamed the \u2018Dead Mans Curve\u2019.

This allows for a more convenient and easy-going process for students.\n\nWe spoke with Ashley Fuentes, one of the co-owners of J & F Photo Lab Inc., who explained what this means for USC students interested in film and photography.\n\nAshley Fuentes: The response on campus has been fantastic. When we first announced the USC village Dropbox on her Instagram, the support and excitement from the USC community was overwhelming. They were incredibly thankful, and it was heartwarming to see how our service was appreciated. Currently, we\u2019re picking up about 5 to 6 packets every morning and we\u2019re just getting started.

Our goal is to make film more accessible and convenient for the USC community, since many of our customers are USC students we wanted to make it easier for them to drop off their film. We now offer morning pickups and same day delivery, eliminating the need for them to drive out. Although they\u2019re welcome to visit our shop where we also do sell film.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty rare for your film to get developed the same day, with film developing services through CVS or Walgreens potentially taking up to a month. Vadlamani: It was pretty easy. I just dropped my film off. I\u2019ve been looking to take it elsewhere, but it\u2019s been very convenient just having it right here.\n\nFuentes believes that being a small business allows them to have an edge over bigger competitors. They can work intimately with their customers and build community through their service developing films.\n\nFuentes: What sets us apart from the film development at CVS or Walgreens is the quality and service we provide. We\u2019re a small family business with 31 years of experience. Unlike CVS and Walgreens, who send them out to other labs, we handle everything in-house, ensuring higher quality and a quicker turnaround. Same day, in fact, we also return the negatives, which many chain stores don\u2019t do. We\u2019re not just a service, we\u2019re a resource for our customers.

What\u2019s the impact of Olympic sport inclusion for the trajectory of sports?\n\nThe Olympics announced five new sports for the 2028 L.A. Games. (Photo by Daniel Toomey)\n\nBy Keely Roy October 24, 2023 at 6:28 pm PDT\n\nThe International Olympics Committee (IOC) excited the sporting world when it announced on Oct. 16 the approval of five new sports for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. These include baseball, softball, lacrosse, squash and flag football. Baseball, softball and lacrosse are returning to the Games after previous stints while squash and flag football will be making their Olympic debut.\n\nWhile the Olympic\u2019s origins date back to ancient Greece, the first modern Olympic Games that took place in April 1896 included some of the same sports that are being played today including racing, jumps and wrestling. Over the course of time, the Games have evolved with the changing world. But the one constant is that they\u2019ve continued to capture the attention of a global audience, holding a special status as the most elite sporting competition in the world.\n\nAs society has changed, so has sporting culture, and the Olympics has adapted to fit this by continuing to add new sports as they rise to prominence through a careful selection process.\n\n\u201cThe choice of these five new sports is in line with the American sports culture and will showcase iconic American sports to the world, while bringing international sports to the United States,\u201d IOC President Thomas Bach said in a statement. \u201cThese sports will make the Olympic Games LA28 unique.\u201d\n\nEven in 2023, new sports are still competing for Olympic contention and the opportunity to be represented on the world stage.\n\nThe process of obtaining Olympic legitimacy\n\nA major component of the IOC\u2019s role is the approval of the sports that make up the Olympic Games. For a sport to even be considered, it has to be governed by an International Federation (IF) that is officially recognized by the IOC. The next step is making sure the sport complies with the Olympic Charter, the 112-page document originally written in 1908 that outlines the fundamental principles of the Olympics as well as the rules and regulations that have been adopted by the IOC.\n\nThe sport must also comply with the World Anti-Doping Code and the Olympic Movement Code on the Prevention of the Manipulation of Competition to be eligible for Olympic contention.\n\nFrom there, a sport is further analyzed to see how it aligns with the IOC\u2019s preset evaluation criteria. As part of a thorough process, it is evaluated on a variety of factors, including existing facilities, present sporting communities and gender equality.\n\nThe Olympic Agenda 2020 (which was actually adopted in 2014) placed a new emphasis on enhancing the popularity of the Games which directly led to the push for the inclusion of new popular sports.\n\nThe responsibility of proposing new popular sports for consideration has fallen largely on the Organizing Committee of the specific edition of the Games. The 2020 Tokyo Summer Games Committee was the first committee with the power to propose new sports, and they were able to get five new sports for their edition of the Games. These included surfing, karate, sports climbing, skateboarding, baseball and softball.\n\nThe main limiting factors for the inclusion of new sports is that the additions do not dramatically increase the number of athletes participating, the hosting cities must have the infrastructure to support these sports, and their additions do not add a large amount to the overall cost of the Games.\n\nThe Olympics and the promise of possibility\n\nOlympic recognition is a widely esteemed honor that many up-and-coming sports dream of reaching. With the IOC\u2019s recent commitment to increasing the opportunities for new and popular sports, many sports in recent years have reached this goal.\n\nThe 2028 LA Games are on track to continue this trajectory debuting two new sports: squash and flag football.\n\nSquash dates all the way back to the 1830s in England. While the sport took some time to gain prominence at the institutional level, it has grown in popularity all over the world with courts and local competitions in hundreds of countries.\n\nFlag football has origins dating back to World War II as a pastime for U.S. soldiers to compete without the threat of injuring themselves. The sport continued to evolve over time, sustaining several rule changes and growing in popularity. In recent years, the sport has had massive growth, particularly in the U.S. as well as in Canada and South America. Women\u2019s flag football also joined in this movement, providing an opportunity for women to participate in football in some form, something previously unavailable.\n\nThe sport\u2019s inclusion in the 2028 LA Games marks a huge opportunity for the sport to potentially grow to mainstream sports status and develop teams at all levels worldwide.\n\nLacrosse was part of the Olympic Programme twice, appearing in the 1904 and 1908 Games \u2014 over a century ago. The plan for the inclusion of the sport in the 2028 Games is a huge deal to many within the sporting community.\n\nBaseball debuted in the Olympics in 1904 and continued to be played as a demonstration sport before it was recognized as an official Olympic sport in 1992, where it remained until 2008. It was since revived for a single appearance for the 2020 Games but is not returning again till the 2028 LA Games.\n\nUSC baseball player Fisher Johnson said adding the sport to the Olympics is important to lots of viewers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Olympics, you know?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEveryone watches the Olympics [and] tunes in. There\u2019s a lot of country pride, nation pride behind that. So I think that\u2019ll absolutely boost it up a little bit.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, softball had a stint in the Olympics, debuting in 1996 and appearing until it was removed in 2012 along with baseball. It was also featured in the 2020 Tokyo Games and will return in the L.A. 2028 Games.\n\nProfessional softball player Makena Smith spoke on the impact of the inclusion of softball in the Games.\n\n\u201cIt will no doubt grow the game in every way, and allow everyone to see just how competitive and fun our sport is to watch,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe opportunities to play professional softball now are available, but not completely accessible due to the small amount of opportunities. But with our sport on full display at the Olympics, I truly believe investors and stakeholders around the globe will follow suit in supporting the game we love.\u201d\n```"}

U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is running for U.S. Senate, is working on legislation to ensure unemployment benefits nationwide to striking workers. Under his proposed Empowering Striking Workers Act of 2023, workers would be able to collect their pay after two weeks on strike, according to a draft of the bill viewed by the Los Angeles Times.\n```"}

The question: Should fans take the money up front or sit down with the mogul over dinner to learn the secrets of his billion-dollar empire.\n\nJay-Z (file audio): Take the $500,000. Go buy some albums and listen to the album. It\u2019s all there. If you piece it together and really listen to the music for the words of what it is. It\u2019s all there.

They are fighting for a significant wage increase, improved residual payments for streaming, and protections against the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nContinued after a failed negotiation on Wednesday, October 11th due to a disliked offer that was proposed before the strike began, the continued strikes hope to end after today\u2019s meeting with AMPTP.\n\nJames Hudson, a model and actor, shares his thoughts on who should be standing with him during the strike.\n\nJames Hudson: All the famous people don\u2019t really need to be coming out here. A lot of A-listers do. But like, Brad Pitt can\u2019t come out... I mean, that\u2019s just too much. And they probably have prior obligations.

And they\u2019re like, you know, someone\u2019s like, I\u2019m not getting booked that much. Well, they\u2019re like, well, you went to Strike Zero times in 105 days, right? So, we\u2019re considering, you know, I don\u2019t know, not kicking you out of the union, but, you know, we\u2019re booking more people that went down to strike because they fought for it, you know.\n\nHowever, Sarah Carey, SAG eligible member thinks otherwise.\n\nSarah Casey: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to say. I think everyone is on their own level. Everyone has their own personal issues, like social anxiety is real. And even for me as an introverted human being, coming out here was really difficult.

And not everyone has that person.\n\nWhen asked about what they\u2019d say if given the opportunity to speak during the meeting set today, striker Alexander Gutierrez said.\n\nAlexander Gutierrez: I think I think solidarity is important.

(AP Photo/ Jorge Jeronimo)\n\nBy Mark Armendariz-Gonzales October 24, 2023 at 6:01 pm PDT\n\nSaturday was a heartbreaking day for the Costa family and the people of Portugal as the country\u2019s furriest celebrity took his final bark. Bobi, the purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, passed away at the age of 31 years and 165 days within the comfort of his home in the town of Conqueiros.\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, the average life expectancy of a Rafeiro do Alentejo is 12 to 14 years. At the time of his death, Bobi held two world records: the world\u2019s oldest dog and the oldest dog to ever live. He took the latter title from an Australian Cattle Dog named Bluey, who lived up to 1939 to the age of 29 years and five months. Bobi celebrated his recording-breaking birthday with a party in May that had more than 100 guests.\n\nBobi was presented with these titles back in February by the Guinness World Records, who confirmed his age through a veterinary and government-owned pet database in Portugal.\n\nThe Costa family\u2019s mourning of the death of their beloved Bobi is something that any pet owner who lost a furry friend can sympathize with. One pet owner who knows this pain is Dehlia Drennon, who lost her dog Tucker while growing up.\n\n\u201cIt hits you harder than you would think, because they are part of your family,\u201d Drennon said. \u201cThere is definitely a grieving process for anyone that is connected to them.\u201d\n\nLosing a pet may be tough for any owner at first, but in some cases, it may be for the better. Mykalah King experienced this with her dog \u201cJack,\u201d who battled cancer for many years before giving into his illness. Though it was a very sad moment for King, she is happy that Jack is in a better place.\n\n\u201cIt was really sad because of the cancer,\u201d King said. \u201cIt was a long time coming, so I guess it was bittersweet.\u201d\n\nAlthough losing a pet may seem like the end of the world to most pet owners, it is important to focus on the good memories with furry friends.\n\n\u201cDogs really are so in the moment that they do not even resist death,\u201d Drennon said. \u201cOur dog kind of knew that he was going and he had made his own little goodbyes. So just trusting that your dog is with you every day, they are even somehow supporting you in death, and that is a helpful way to look at it and process it.\u201d\n\nPet owners said sometimes, getting a new pet is also helpful for healing.\n\n\u201cWith time, getting a new pet helps soothe the sadness,\u201d said pet owner Piergiuseppe Di Michele.\n\nSince losing Tucker, Drennon added a new member to her family, a 3-year-old dog named Navy, who has quickly become the light of her life. Even though death is a long way away for Navy, Drennon tries her best to enjoy every second with her new best friend.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard not to be in the moment with her, because she loves to play,\u201d Drennon said. \u201cWe go on daily walks, we play ball like four times a day, so she is such an integral part in our lives at this point that almost every moment involves her in some way.\u201d\n\nWhile dogs never live as long as owners would like them to, it is important to treasure all the time possible with pets.\n\n\u201cEnjoy them as much as you can while you have them,\u201d King said.\n```"}

Photo courtesy of Ian D'Andrea.\n\nBy Todd Takeuchi October 24, 2023 at 5:56 pm PDT\n\nAs the 2023-24 NBA season is set to officially start today, talk about the longevity of LeBron James\u2019 basketball career is storming through the media as he heads into his 20th season. With talks about retirement in the near future, James has reassured the media that he is trying to stay in the league as long as possible. James has stated that he hopes to play alongside both of his sons, Bryce and Bronny, in the NBA one day.\n\nJames has built a career set to go up against the best of the best. From his early days as a Cleveland Cavalier back in 2003, to now being a part of one of the NBA\u2019s historic franchises, the Los Angeles Lakers, James has been compared to players such as Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan as the greatest player to ever step on an NBA court.\n\nAt the 2023 Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Awards on July 12, James explained his outlook on his career following the Lakers playoff loss at the hands of the Denver Nuggets in the 2023 Western Conference Finals. With many wondering whether or not James would call it quits, James stepped to the front of the stage to speak on behalf of himself, rather than let the media speak for him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how many more points I score or what I can or cannot do on the floor,\u201d James said at the event. \u201cThe real question for me is: Can I play without cheating this game? The day I can\u2019t give everything on the floor is the day I\u2019ll be done. Lucky for you guys, that day is not today.\u201d\n\nWith all that James has accomplished, both of his sons battle with criticism and the thought of living up to their father\u2019s reputation. When talking about the idea of playing alongside one of the all-time greats, the idea seems like an opportunity that can\u2019t be passed up. But the question of whether or not the child would enjoy that experience comes into play.\n\nKorey Foreman, junior defensive lineman for the USC football team, said he admires the idea of playing with his father knowing the competitive nature they would bring to the table. \u201cIf my dad told me he wanted to play with me, it\u2019d be a blessing,\u201d Foreman said. \u201cI\u2019m already knowing that he\u2019s putting in 20 times the extra work to maintain the years he wasn\u2019t able to do so. It wouldn\u2019t be coming home at night and asking how practice was, I\u2019d either be running him over or he\u2019d be running me over.\u201d\n\nUSC senior and member of USC\u2019s song girl team Zariah Rouse believes she should receive the spotlight aside from what her parents have done in the past. \u201cI feel like now it\u2019s my era to shine,\u201d Rouse said. \u201cThey kind of had their time. I think it\u2019d be cool in some way. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for me because I wouldn\u2019t want to compete in the same competition.\u201d\n\nAndrew Silvia, member of the Facilities Planning and Management team at USC, said he knows if his father were to ever team up with him, the production value would decrease because of the way in which the two compete against each other. \u201cWould I want to play on the same team as my father? Absolutely not,\u201d Silvia said. \u201cWe would constantly want to one-up each other. It would not make Thanksgiving dinner any easier.\u201d\n\nAaron Wilson, USC junior studying international relations and global business, said it would be an enjoyable experience being out there competing with his dad because of the relationship they built among each other. \u201cI think it\u2019d be a fun opportunity to play with another generation but also someone who is related to me,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019d be fun to butt heads a little bit and compete knowing it\u2019s my parents.\u201d\n\nThere is still time before any decisions are made about the James\u2019 family future. It will be about a year before Bronny will be in the talks about potentially getting drafted, as he is currently enrolled at USC. Bryce just started his sophomore year in high school, playing for Notre Dame High School.\n\nEven with a difference in opinion about competing alongside your parents, the accolades James has racked up through 20 seasons is something special. As the oldest player listed for the season, James continued his legacy starting today in Denver, Colorado for a Western Conference Finals rematch against the Nuggets.\n```"}

Christian Ch\u00e1vez shared a similar message, especially through stepping more into his Queer identity and expressing himself freely. This is a big moment for Ch\u00e1vez, considering the controversy in 2007, when the media leaked his civil marriage ceremony, essentially outing him to the public and receiving extensive backlash.\n\nCh\u00e1vez was one of the first Latinx celebrities to come out as Gay and is a prominent figure for LGBTQ+ rights within the Latinx community.

The new minimum wage will go into effect starting in April.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is home to more than 500,000 fast-food workers who \u2013 for decades \u2013 have been fighting for higher wages and better working conditions,\u201d Newsom said at a press conference. \u201cToday, we take one step closer to fairer wages, safer and healthier working conditions, and better training by giving hardworking fast-food workers a stronger voice and seat at the table.\u201d\n\nThe legislation only applies to restaurants that are a part of a national chain and have over 60 establishments. It is the first industry-specific minimum wage law in the state\u2019s history.\n\nWhen asked what she thinks about the pay raises, University of Southern California student Solana Espino, a former Chipotle employee, said, \u201cI think there\u2019s been a big movement of unionizing lately ... I think this is kind of the work of people coming together within that industry and demanding more pay and demanding to be compensated accurately.\u201d\n\nGallup polls reported that 71% of Americans now approve of labor unions \u2013 the highest percentage recorded since 1965. According to The Guardian, fast-food workers in California have gone on strike over 450 times since 2020 and played a role in the passing of the act.\n\nAnother bill, signed the same day, also gives health care workers a higher minimum wage of $25 an hour. However, this won\u2019t go into effect until 2028. The general minimum wage will also increase from $15.50 to $16 an hour on January 1. California voters will have the option to raise it further, to $18 an hour, in November 2024.\n\nMany feel wage increases are essential in California given that it is the second most expensive state to live in, according to Business Insider. Los Angeles also has the sixth highest cost of living in the nation, according to CNBC.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, fast food costs have been rising at a historic level. Many students who rely on fast food for an affordable meal are concerned that franchises might respond to the wage increase by increasing menu prices even more.\n\n\u201cIf the price increase was drastic, I would probably go less,\u201d Stefan Reginelli, a freshman studying communications said. \u201cFast food is something that a lot of people crave ... so they would pay a somewhat premium for it in this case ... I would probably still buy it every once in a while.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Espino, feel that fast food is more about speed and convenience, and less about the price. \u201cI probably still would [buy fast food] because it\u2019s really just the convenience of it more than anything,\u201d Espino said. \u201cThe fast-food industry really drives ... to just be as quick as possible, as efficient as possible. I definitely would still be going, but I don\u2019t know if I would be going as frequently.\u201d```"}

If the authorization receives two-thirds approval votes, the union will be able to decide to strike if the committee feels it is necessary.\n\n\u201cStriking is very much, from the graduate student workers perspective, a last resort,\u201d said Jackie Johnson, a doctoral candidate on the union bargaining committee. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019d have to be pushed into, based on the university delaying proposals or not getting counter offers that meet graduate student needs.\u201d\n\nFrom the university\u2019s perspective, USC is \u201cdoing everything we can to avert a strike,\u201d said Andrew Stott, dean of USC Graduate School. \u201cA strike will be disruptive to everybody; it will be divisive to the community.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stott, there are more than 2,500 graduate student workers in the union bargaining unit, a third of which are teaching assistants (TAs) and two-thirds of which are research assistants (RAs). Stott said graduate student workers represent around 5% of the student body, collectively. Of the 11,000 sections of class offered at USC per semester, TAs support about 1,300 sections, Stott said.\n\nThe most recent proposal addressing key issues on the table \u2014 like wages, health care and childcare support \u2014 was handed over by USC administration on Monday evening. The document is the third \u201ceconomic package\u201d the university has pitched to the union, which formed in February of this year after members of the Graduate Student Workers Organizing Committee (GSWOC) reached out to the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), forming GSWOC-UAW.\n\nMonday\u2019s economic package proposal makes note of a 5% increase in wages provided in July for the 2023-24 academic year. The current stipend therefore stands at $35,700, Stott said. The proposal lays out wage increases of 2 to 2.5% over the next three years. Following this model, graduate student workers would earn just over $38,000 by the fall of 2026.\n\nThis is a substantially lower wage than the GSWOC-UAW\u2019s first ask in August, which requested that first-year student workers be paid $50,000, the first rung on a ladder culminating in fifth-year student workers receiving a stipend of $70,000. According to data compiled by GSWOC-UAW, USC\u2019s stipend, which the university identifies as being \u201camong the most competitive in the nation,\u201d is lower than that offered at UCLA, Princeton, Columbia and Stanford, which tops the list at over $51,000.\n\n\u201cWhile the university did give us a wage [increase] after we unionized for this school year, people are still finding it hard to live in an expensive city like Los Angeles,\u201d said Johnson, a fifth-year doctoral candidate in the Division of Cinema and Media Studies at the USC Cinematic Arts school. Johnson has been a student at USC since before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Since then, she said \u201cthere\u2019s been little evolution.\u201d\n\nMany members of the union feel that the wage increases \u2014 both those already granted and those proposed by the university moving forward \u2014 are not high enough to reflect the rising cost of inflation. In an email distributed to graduate student workers, Wes Wise, a third-year doctoral student studying mathematics and member of union\u2019s bargaining committee, called the university\u2019s second economic package proposal \u201cbelow inflation,\u201d amounting to a \u201c0% additional raise.\u201d\n\nThe university wants to ensure their \u201ceconomic package is taken as a whole,\u201d rather than focusing on stipends alone, Stott said. In addition to their stipends, students receive health care, dental care, vision care, remission of all mandatory fees, and \u201cfree tuition of up to $66,640 a year,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, these are students first and foremost,\u201d Stott said. \u201cThey apply to USC to pursue a program of study, not to come and take a job as a teaching assistant or research assistant.\u201d\n\nAlso on the table is childcare support for graduate student workers with children. In Monday\u2019s economic package, the university proposed that workers be able to apply for a subsidy of up to \u201c$1,800 per semester for each child under the age of six,\u201d with the money coming out of a fund with a maximum annual cap of $250,000.\n\n\u201cHaving access to childcare, and being able to afford it, is a key part of being able to do your work as a graduate student worker,\u201d Johnson said. Fearing that parents will \u201chave to fight each other until the pot of money runs out,\u201d the union is advocating for a reimbursement model rather than a capped fund, she said.\n\nMore successful negotiations surrounding grievance and arbitration have led to a tentative agreement reached in July. Graduate student workers \u201cdon\u2019t have faith in the internal process,\u201d Johnson said about the current abuse, harassment and discrimination procedures within USC, like the Title IX office. Under the tentative agreement, strict timelines would be introduced. Currently, students with grievances \u201cmight even graduate before they reach a resolution,\u201d Johnson said. Both the university and the union would appoint independent arbitrators, so the complaint wouldn\u2019t be heard solely in-house.\n\nLast year, graduate student workers at University of California schools held a strike that lasted for five weeks. The absence of graduate student workers was felt across all 10 campuses, with classes and grading heavily disrupted, the L.A. Times reported.\n\nIf the union authorizes \u2014 and declares \u2014 a strike, USC has a plan in place to ensure continuity of education, Stott said. As online systems like Blackboard belong to the university, faculty will retain access to grading software even if teaching assistants go on strike. Further, he said discussion sections may be able to happen on Zoom, so faculty can run them. Stott also said that the university is prepared to modify final exams or other assessments \u201cin any way that\u2019s necessary\u201d to make sure students can get their final results, have their financial aid renewed or even graduate.\n\nBut Johnson said the university functions largely because of the graduate student workers. \u201cI have had a positive experience so far at USC,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd it is actually because of that that I am invested in making this place a better place to work and study.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Planned Parenthood)\n\nBy Alia Noll and Nathan Silva\nOctober 24, 2023 at 4:29 pm PDT\n\nThe state of California has become home to abortion tourism, revealed a new #WeCount report released by the Society of Family Planning. In the 12-month period following the Dobbs v. Jackson\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Organization decision on June 24, 2022, California became a \u201csurge state\u201d for abortions. The report found that the total number of abortions provided by a clinician cumulatively increased by 8,810, the fourth highest amount across the U.S. after Illinois, Florida and North Carolina.\n\nThe Dobbs decision effectively overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, which protected the legal right to abortion in the United States. The Dobbs decision removed this federal protection, allowing individual states to create their own legislation.\n\n\u201cIn some states, new abortion restrictions have been litigated in court, resulting in week-by-week changes to the legal status of abortion, creating confusion and abortion care churn,\u201d the Society of Family Planning wrote in the report. \u201cAt the same time, some states have passed protective legislation that has potentially increased access \u2013 for residents and people coming from banned states \u2013 and protected providers.\u201d\n\nThe #WeCount report tracked medical, procedural and telehealth abortions overseen by a licensed clinician. They acknowledged the limits of measuring abortion access, mentioning that they were unable to estimate the amount of abortions completed via Aid Access or volunteer accompaniment networks in Mexico. The report does not include self-managed abortions, which the Society of Family Planning defines as \u201cany attempt to end a pregnancy outside the formal healthcare system, including using medications, herbs, or something else, or obtaining pills from friends or online without clinical assistance.\u201d\n\nFor the 33 states where abortion remains legal, the Society of Family Planning recorded about 117,000 more abortions, or a 14% increase from before the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nOut-of-state students have been disproportionately affected by the Dobbs decision. The states with the five largest cumulative drops in abortions during the one year-period after Dobbs include: Texas, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana and Alabama. All of these states have banned abortion completely since the Dobbs decision, with the exception of Georgia, where a six-week ban was enacted.\n\nMolly Holsinger, a junior majoring in political science and an e-board member of the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, USC\u2019s intersectional feminist club, spoke on the report\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cAs someone from Texas, the state with the largest drop in abortions post-Dobbs, this issue is especially important to me,\u201d Holsinger said. \u201cAccess to safe, affordable abortion is healthcare, and denial of these services only leads to unsafe, back-alley situations for many women.\u201d\n\nA large proportion of the increase in abortions in states where it remains legal came from patients who traveled across state lines to facilities to obtain healthcare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not a public health triumph that people have to mobilize the financial and social resources to travel, sometimes hundreds of miles away from their home, to obtain basic health care,\u201d said Dr. Alison Norris, co-chair of #WeCount and association professor at The Ohio State University\u2019s College of Public Health, in an interview with CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s really a public health crisis.\u201d\n\nYari Navarro, a USC sophomore studying business administration said, \u201cI think factors that contribute to the trend of California becoming a surge state might be the cost of having a child in the state of California, the access to abortions in California, and the progressive policies of the state of California.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on what conversations USC can have, Navarro said it\u2019s important to \u201cprovide education and awareness, have support spaces and work with outside organizations to improve efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think USC can help support students who may face barriers to accessing reproductive healthcare by offering proper health services, access to information and providing financial assistance to those who may be facing financial burdens and can\u2019t afford proper aid,\u201d Navarro said.\n```"}

(USC Annenberg Media/Sarah Arencibia)\n\nBy Sarah Arencibia October 24, 2023 at 2:34 pm PDT\n\nUSC is not as vanilla as once believed: over 20 students sat in on an intimate lecture about BDSM on Wednesday in hopes of diversifying the sex education resources being offered to students. Led by Counseling and Mental Health clinician at USC, Guru Shabd Khalsa, this lecture covered the basics of what BDSM \u2013 Bondage, Dominance, Sadism, Masochism \u2013 sex entails and how to go about participating in a more unorthodox sex life in a way that is both safe and fun.\n\nThe idea behind the event was \u201cto offer some accessibility and baseline information so that... [anybody] who felt unwelcome or unable to do some exploration... about any interest they might have\u201d could do so safely and without judgment, said Khalsa.\n\nSince the release of the 50 Shades of Grey movie franchise, BDSM has become much more mainstream, according to Time Magazine. Yet there still remains a stigma surrounding unconventional sex practices, which are often looked down upon and assumed unhealthy or even evil, Khalsa said. Society often holds the general belief that there is something psychologically wrong with people who partake in BDSM sex.\n\nHowever, BDSM \u201cis simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority, and for most participants not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with \u2018normal\u2019 sex,\u201d according to the National Institute of Health.\n\nThis ignorance in society is due to the limited availability of resources surrounding sexual health, and \u201cthere are even fewer resources about [these] \u2018alternative\u2019 lifestyles,\u201d Khalsa said.\n\nDuring her lecture, Khalsa touched on several topics including: the spectrum of sex and gender, the importance of consent and communication, expectations and boundaries, green versus red flags in partners, and the idea of pleasure versus performance.\n\nKhalsa also provided several tips for anyone looking to consensually experiment with or delve more deeply into the world of BDSM. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not sexy to have cold conversations about consent, there are sexy ways to ask for consent: Does that feel good? More of this? Is it okay if I do this?\u201d Khalsa said.\n\nThe main takeaway from Khalsa\u2019s lecture was that everyone should be engaging with their sexuality in a safe way and to do this, communication must happen constantly so that boundaries can be respected and consent is present.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sexy, fun and efficient to express what you want and don\u2019t want to a partner... and, in my opinion, [communication] is important in vanilla relationships, kink relationships, and everything in between,\u201d said Khalsa.\n\nMany students who attended were appreciative of the intimate and inviting atmosphere Khalsa created throughout the event and found her lecture to be very informative and educational.\n\nUSC students listening in on BDSM lecture in Los Angeles, Calif., Oct. 18, 2023. (USC Annenberg Media/Sarah Arencibia)\n\n\u201cIt was just a really safe and educational space for everyone at all levels of interest. She gave a lot of good resources both for people who have either minor interests in [BDSM sex] or people who are already in the community and participating in it,\u201d said Chandra Delano, a public relations major at USC.\n\nDelano said she was happy to see such an emphasis on communication and consent in the lecture, since these subjects are not talked about enough. It\u2019s especially important to discuss them on college campuses, she said, where many students are exploring their sexuality for the first time and are experiencing new thoughts and feelings that can be difficult to navigate.\n\n\u201cI think that there is a stigma that consent is not sexy, or content can kill the mood when, in reality, it can really do the opposite,\u201d said Delano. \u201cCommunication can be one of the most attractive things that people can do, and it just overall boosts the experience that everyone is having.\u201d\n\nOther students enjoyed the community they were able to find at an event like this.\n\n\u201cThere are others like me, people who I can share these things with, there are people I can talk to,\u201d said 27-year-old computer engineering graduate student at USC, who would like to remain anonymous for fear of not being accepted by groups he is a part of at the university.\n\nHe believes that more events like this are necessary, to raise awareness for others to realize they are not alone and that there are inclusive spaces and communities they can comfortably explore their sexuality and interests in.\n\nThrough the lecture, the grad student said he learned why sex positivity is so important, which is so that people aren\u2019t afraid to be who they are.\n\n\u201cConsensual safe sex without shame or fear is a right everyone deserves, whatever that looks like is up to you, as long as you are not hurting other people in your pursuit of that,\u201d Khalsa said.\n\nFor more resources or information about BDSM, Khalsa suggested connecting with the employees at your local sex shops, who are typically \u201cvery excited to have those conversations with you\u201d, or local sex positive organizations. To connect with other like-minded individuals, you can get on the app Feeld, which is an open-minded dating app with more gender and relationship options than the average dating app. You can also try FetLife.com, which has a lot of \u201cnudity and aggressive porn ads,\u201d but can be useful. OMGYES.com is a good site to visit to learn all about pleasure as a woman, but it requires a subscription.\n```"}

The team\u2019s core is getting younger, but forward LeBron James is getting older. In fact, he\u2019s now officially the oldest player in the NBA. He\u2019s still playing like one of the best players in the league \u2014 but how long will that last? Lakers head coach Darvin Ham will have to manage James\u2019 play time, as well as monitor forward Anthony Davis through potential injury issues during the season. On opening night on the road, they\u2019ll play arguably their greatest threat in the Western Conference, the Denver Nuggets. It\u2019s a rematch of last year\u2019s NBA Western Conference Finals, which was a painful exit for the purple and gold as they were swept by the Nuggets. Nuggets head coach Mike Malone talked a lot of smack about the Lakers last year, and it sounds like the  team will be using his words  as extra motivation this year. They can prove it immediately with a statement win on Tuesday. This Lakers squad should be an upgraded one from this year. They added offensive weapons that should help them spread out the floor in guard Gabe Vincent and forward Christian Wood while solidifying their defense with forward Taurean Prince and center Jaxon Hayes. It seems like guard Austin Reaves will step up and be the third scorer this season, which will be a big jump for the man with a brand new signature shoe. Reaves may benefit from Michael Porter Jr. potentially not being able to play. One key matchup to watch on Tuesday: how will Anthony Davis fare against Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic, who played great defense against him all series long? The Lakers had no answer to Jokic\u2019s offense last year, either, but the new editions of Prince and Hayes should help the interior defense, along with Davis and Rui Hachimura. Speaking of the Lakers\u2019 defense, this should be one of the better groups in the league. The Lakers\u2019 defense is one of the main reasons why they went as far as they did last year, but the Nuggets had the second-best offensive rating in the Western Conference last year behind the Sacramento Kings. It\u2019s going to be tough to stop Jokic, but the Lakers had trouble containing Jamal Murray as well. Reaves should be able to give Murray a tough match, but they\u2019ll need to be almost perfect to beat the reigning champions. If everything goes according to plan health-wise, then the Lakers should be using a constant set of starters, which wasn\u2019t the case last year. Taurean Prince was named the fifth starter after a solid pre-season showing while forward Jarred Vanderbilt is out due to injury. Besides Vanderbilt\u2019s injury, this new Lakers team will be hungry to seek revenge against a team that fueled their fire for this year in the Nuggets. Will the Denver altitude be too much for the Lakers just like last year\u2019s playoffs? Or will this new group find a way to silence their doubters early on against the champions? We\u2019ll see on Tuesday night.\n```"}

The Trojans\u2019 loss to the Sun Devils in Tempe on Thursday was their first since Sept. 7. USC is now 13-7 all-time against ASU after a 1-0 loss.\n\nDespite the loss, the Trojans have won four of their last six on the road against the Sun Devils. After a scoreless first half, Arizona State\u2019s redshirt senior midfielder Hannah Lapeire scored the only goal of the match in the 72nd minute. The Trojans had many chances for victory but couldn\u2019t convert their opportunities into points.\n\nUSC had 14 corner kicks to Arizona State\u2019s zero, and the Trojans outshot the Sun Devils 13-5. USC also dominated the possession battle 61% to 39%. USC and ASU both had only two shots on goal. Junior forward Simone Jackson and freshman forward Maribel Flores led the Trojans in shots with three each, with Jackson also having a shot on goal.\n\n\u201cArizona State is always a team that is going to be challenging,\u201d head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cAlso, traveling to Arizona is always kind of a blistering hot one, so even though it was a night game, it was still near 100 degrees, so we knew that it was just going to be challenging in different ways.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the Trojans went to Tucson and drew with the Arizona Wildcats 1-1. Facing a deficit heading into halftime, the Trojans regrouped in the second half, scoring in the 57th minute. Despite conceding a goal in the first half, USC\u2019s offense came out strong, getting four shots in the first 16 minutes. However, graduate goalkeeper Hope Hisey kept her composure for Arizona and helped hold the Wildcats\u2019 lead in the first half.\n\nIn the 31st minute, sophomore defender Ella Hatteberg opened up the scoring for the Wildcats, kicking in a missed shot that hit the post. In the second half, USC was determined to even the score. On a play that began with a throw-in, Flores lasered one into the right side of the net in the 57th minute, thanks to an assist by senior defender Zoe Burns.\n\nThe final 30 minutes of the match featured strong defense from both teams. Hisey finished the game with six saves, while sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson saved three shots for USC.\n\n\u201cI think the team appreciates what Hannah brings, because it\u2019s composure, it\u2019s confidence, and it\u2019s just the calm that we need, especially in the way that we want to play, which is building out of the back,\u201d Alukonis said.\n\nWhile only scoring one goal, USC\u2019s offense was solid, totaling 14 shots with six corners. With a matchup against No. 5 Stanford on the horizon, USC must capitalize on opportunities earlier to win. While the Trojans\u2019 defense has been solid, USC has gone winless in three straight. In order to win more games, the defensive unit must support Dickinson\u2019s production in goal in order to come out ahead.\n\n\u201cWe went with a press set ... you sacrifice a little bit of risk for hopefully the reward, and we picked up a lot of balls really early from it,\u201d Alukonis said in regards to the defense. \u201cBut, we had a little trouble converting so definitely in both games we\u2019ve learned a lot from [the defense] and we saw adjustments that needed to be made.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will take on undefeated Stanford on Thursday at McAlister Field, with kickoff scheduled for 2 p.m.\n```"}

Photo courtesy of Brett Arndt.\n\nBy Maya Broomfield\nOctober 24, 2023 at 11:51 am PDT\n\nContent warning: The following article contains mentions of depression and drug use.\n\nRod Wave is shedding light on feelings that many young Black men around the country, and quite possibly around the world, experience but were told to not talk about. Starting in childhood, boys are taught to dust themselves off and act like a big boy. Teaching them at a young age that emotions are a sign of weakness. These childhood experiences continue into adulthood and create men who are unable to process and communicate their emotions and feelings. Leaving men feeling like they have to deal with mental and emotional health problems by themselves.\n\nBut a young artist from St. Petersburg, Florida is helping to change that. Wave made his debut in 2016 with his mixtape \u201cHunger Games Vo.1.\u201d From the beginning, his fans were drawn to his ability to capture and express the pent-up emotions that many young men experience every day living in low-income communities. While using a combination of singing and rapping, Wave covered topics like love, heartbreak, drug use, depression, anxiety and the process of grief.\n\nWhile Wave\u2019s financial situation has changed his ability to use his music to express his emotions hasn\u2019t. Wave\u2019s music has been heavily criticized for being too emotional. Wave himself stated before the release of his album \u201cBeautiful Mind\u201d that this would be the last \u201csad a\u2014 album \u201c. But many of those who support and are fans of Wave are drawn to the relatability and vulnerability.\n\n\u201cAfrican Americans\u2019 depressive occurrences are more disabling, persistent and resistant to treatment than those experienced by whites,\u201d according to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Depression affects more than 17 million Americans each year and makes matters worse for Black men. Mental health is something that affects many people, but the discussion around mental health especially in the Black community is limited.\n\nWhether it\u2019s intentional or not Wave is starting up conversations around mental health in the Black community. For years hip hop, which plays an important part in the Black community, has allowed artists to talk about everything from women to drugs and violence. But there has always been limited space in the mainstream media dedicated to talking about more sensitive topics like love, heartbreak, anxiety, grieving and depression.\n\nWhat for some seems like senseless complaining or crying over beats, is a reflection of reality for many young Black men. Faced with dealing with their mental health in a society that has not allowed them a safe place to express their feelings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to open up dawg, and be that way, especially in this society. We was taught to hide them feelings... hide how we feel inside to the point where your mind will trick you into thinking you don\u2019t got no feelings or you heartless,\u201d he said in an interview with Montreality.\n\nOne of the first steps towards creating change in any space is dialogue. Change can not be made if people aren\u2019t aware of what is going on. When artists like Wave use their platform and music to address these issues it breaks the mold and creates an incite of dialogue and discussion.\n\nAn example of this is a YouTube video created by Josh Jones. In a simple 14-minute and 30-second video a father and his son listen to and review Wave\u2019s live performance of his song \u201cBoyz Don\u2019t Cry.\u201d While it\u2019s entertaining to watch the father and son duo interact, their discussions about manhood and life lessons keep the audience\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019 telling you to run around crying but men know how to cry,\u201d the father in the video said. These little comments and dialogue begin to help shape the way Black men view masculinity. Others are hearing and listening to these conversations. The comment section is full of viewers who pour out their praise of the father and son duo.\n\nThis is just one example of several conversations that are happening online. Several Youtubers and streamers have used Wave\u2019s music as a way to start conversations and community with their audiences who also struggle with understanding how to deal with their mental and emotional health.\n\nWave is breaking generations of toxic traditions around Black masculinity. He\u2019s using his music and fame to talk about the subjects that were traditionally off-limits. By being his most vulnerable and honest self he is allowing others to do the same.\n\nCritics can fairly argue that there is still a lot of improvement that can be done in Wave\u2019s music lyric-wise. Wave does highlight drug use and violence as a way to cope with his emotions. At times Wave has created emotionally heavy songs.

After USC lost its first home game in the Lincoln Riley era to earn a second loss that all but ended its College Football Playoff hopes, the Pac-12 will almost certainly come down to four teams: Washington, Oregon, Oregon State and Utah.\n\nThe Huskies have the best win in the conference thus far after their heavyweight bout with the Ducks, but neither program has a clear path to the championship game yet. It is remarkable that the Trojans \u2013 the conferences\u2019 best hope at a College Football Playoff team last season \u2013 will only be trying to play spoiler for the remainder of the season, but that\u2019s just how this conference has been this year.\n\nNone of the coaches in my top three teams have extensive experience coaching a Playoff contender late into the season; Dan Lanning and Kalen DeBoer are both in their second seasons in their respective jobs, while Jonathan Smith has only won at least 10 games once in his career.\n\nI think new faces competing on college football\u2019s biggest stage is extremely fun for the sport, and with upcoming games such as Oregon vs. Utah, Washington vs. Oregon State and Oregon State vs. Oregon, there is still a lot for these programs to prove.\n\nAs far as which teams I expect to rise to the occasion down the stretch, I\u2019ll let these rankings do the talking.\n\n1. Washington Huskies (7-0, 4-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\n\nAfter a season-defining win at home over Oregon a week ago, Washington\u2019s Pac-12 After Dark matchup against 1-5 Arizona State was a natural let-down spot. It\u2019s not as if the Huskies could not move the ball against the Sun Devil defense; they were just terrible situationally.\n\nThey turned the ball over four times, went 3-for-11 on 3rd down attempts and failed to score an offensive touchdown. Yes, only mustering 15 points against one of the worst teams in the Power Five is a troubling optic, but everything the Huskies have accomplished this season indicates that this game was a fluke.\n\nTurnovers killed Washington throughout the evening, but the team had only coughed the ball up six times in its previous six contests prior to this disaster. I will not discredit an offense that has looked like the most prolific in college football because of one bad performance.\n\nThe Huskies\u2019 defense still held up its end of the bargain to secure the win, holding strong in key red zone situations and getting a backbreaking pick-six from cornerback Mishael Powell.\n\nDespite the fact that this game was way closer than it should have been, a night like this could go a long way towards helping Washington become an even more complete football team.\n\n2. Oregon Ducks (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\n\nThe Ducks lost their first game of the season in devastating fashion a week ago but are still very much alive in the College Football Playoff race. Their objective against Washington State was to shake off that loss and win convincingly in front of their home fans.\n\nIt may have taken a quarter for Oregon to get going, but it did put together a solid 14-point victory to get its season back on track. In the victory, the Ducks reminded the country why they can be such a dangerous team, starting with the effectiveness of the running game.\n\nBucky Irving was sensational once again on Saturday, averaging over eight yards per carry on 15 attempts and finding the end zone twice. Defensively, Oregon\u2019s pass rush returned in a big way, compiling six sacks of Cam Ward over the course of the afternoon.\n\nThe Ducks can beat teams in more ways than any other contender in this conference, and the WSU game reminded the nation of that. If Bo Nix can stay poised against a raucous Utah defense in a hostile road environment next week, I don\u2019t see what keeps Oregon from a Washington rematch in December.\n\n3. Oregon State Beavers (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\n\nOregon State was idle this weekend but will have a lot to prove in the home stretch of its schedule. The Beavers\u2019 two signature wins this season over Utah and UCLA have been at home, with their lone loss coming on the road against Washington State.\n\nIf they want any chance of competing for a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game, they will need to step up their game on the road, as just two of their five remaining games will be in Corvallis.\n\nTheir schedule culminates with back-to-back games against Washington and Oregon, which is as tough a close to the season as there is in the country. The biggest contrast for Jonathan Smith\u2019s team in home and away games has been his defense; Oregon State allows 11 points per game in Corvallis and over 30 per road game.\n\nNext week, it will battle an Arizona team in Tucson that has scored 80 points in its last two contests. If the Beavers shut down the Wildcats on the road on Saturday, it will go a long way towards telling me they are ready for their toughest tests in November.\n\n4. Utah Utes (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\n\nFor Utah fans, Saturday night was bittersweet. On one hand, the Utes continued their absolute domination of USC in a thrilling road victory. On the other hand, head coach Kyle Whittingham announced that Cam Rising, the one player who could elevate the Utes to a College Football Playoff contender, is being shut down for the remainder of the season.\n\nUtah\u2019s defense has been a force all season long, but facing Caleb Williams was its biggest test of the season thus far, and the unit passed with flying colors. The Utes\u2019 secondary was draped all over the Trojan receiving core throughout the night, and, excluding a pick-six and a drive where USC started at the Utah 15-yard line, the defense allowed a total of 20 points to a Lincoln Riley offense.\n\nNow that Bryson Barnes is the likely starter for the remainder of the season, the Utes\u2019 defense will need to continue to shut down elite quarterbacks, starting with Bo Nix on Saturday. Barnes has looked a lot better in the last two weeks, but he cannot throw interceptions like the one he had in the fourth quarter this past weekend.\n\nNix and Michael Penix Jr. do not make those kinds of decisions, and Utah would be unlikely to survive a seven-point mistake like that again.\n\n5. UCLA Bruins (5-2, 2-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\n\nFor the long-term development of the former five-star recruit Dante Moore, making a quarterback change may have been ill-advised by UCLA. For the short-term objective of winning football games in 2023, the switch to Ethan Garbers looks like the right decision thus far.\n\nUCLA really struggled on the road against Utah and Oregon State with Moore under center, and Chip Kelly hoped to turn the tide by starting Garbers in Palo Alto. The junior looked comfortable, albeit against one of the worst teams in the country, completing 20 of 28 passes for 240 yards without turning the ball over.\n\nHe helped his receivers and running backs succeed in the offense, while the Bruin defense returned to its stout form by completely shutting down the Stanford offense. By the time the Cardinal found the end zone, UCLA was already up 35-0 late in the third quarter.\n\nThe Bruins\u2019 schedule the rest of the way is actually pretty manageable compared to others in this conference, with just one of their five remaining games against a ranked opponent. That ranked opponent is USC, a team that is clearly trending in the wrong direction.\n\nIf Garbers continues to manage this offense effectively and avoid big mistakes, expect UCLA to surge heading into Bowl season.\n\n6. USC Trojans (6-2, 4-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\n\nI could not be more surprised at how out of sorts a Lincoln Riley-coached football team looks more than halfway into his second season. Yes, allowing 34 points to one of the worst offenses in the Pac-12 is deeply troubling for Alex Grinch, but Caleb Williams and company are supposed to be a potent enough offense to overcome performances like that.\n\nInstead, the offense is coming off its worst two-game stretch in the Riley era. On a night where Williams struggled to find open receivers and MarShawn Lloyd was averaging over 12 yards per carry, one might expect USC to be a little more run-heavy. Yet, Lloyd only had seven rushing attempts the entire game in the latest edition of perplexing offensive gameplans by Riley.\n\nAt the same time, the Trojan defense never figured out how to slow down Sione Vaki in the passing game, allowing 149 yards and two touchdowns on five catches to the two-way player. On both sides of the ball, USC looks like a poorly coached mess, and this has been the case since Week 2 against Stanford.\n\nThe Trojans won games against inferior opponents to start the year but have folded in their only two major tests thus far. With matchups against Washington and Oregon still to come, I believe their ceiling is 8-4 at best.\n\n7. Arizona Wildcats (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\n\nIt gives me no pleasure to drop Arizona two spots in these rankings after a bye week, but, with more data across college football available to me, the Wildcats\u2019 resume does not look as good as it has in previous weeks.\n\nTaking USC to triple overtime three weeks ago looked impressive when the Trojans were widely considered a National Championship contender. Now, that looks like a game Arizona should have been able to win outright. Similarly, its blowout win over Washington State holds less water now that the Cougars have dropped to 1-3 in conference play.\n\nI cannot place the Wildcats above USC given the head-to-head result, and I believe UCLA is a better all-around football team right now. If they give Oregon State a game next weekend, I am happy to boost them back up again, but the circumstances of this conference forced me to drop this team for the time being.\n\n8. Washington State Cougars (4-3, 1-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\n\nThe Cougars have now lost three straight football games and have been outscored 107-47 in that span. The offensive stats looked better for Washington State against Oregon than they have in previous weeks, but you cannot settle for field goals against an opponent like the Ducks.\n\nWashington State only got in the end zone once, while Oregon flirted with yet another 40-point day. Despite the losing streak, expect WSU to make a surge as their schedule eases up significantly.\n\nBefore their big rivalry matchup against Washington to close out the season, the Cougars will match up with Arizona State, Cal, Colorado and Stanford in the next month. Even if they go 4-0 in that stretch, which I expect they will, the team has proven itself not ready to compete with other strong programs in the Pac-12.\n\nThe Oregon State win was important, but it appears to be a fluke, as WSU has done nothing but disappoint since.\n\n9. Colorado Buffaloes (4-3, 1-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\n\nI don\u2019t think a bye week could have come at a better time for Deion Sanders\u2019 group, which has lost three of its last four games. For two weeks, Colorado can drown out the outside hype and focus on improving as a football team after blowing a 29-point lead to lowly Stanford.\n\nThe Buffaloes\u2019 best chance of securing bowl eligibility will come in a pair of matchups with Arizona and Washington State, the only two games left on their schedule not against ranked teams.\n\nIn order to get to a sixth win, Colorado will need Travis Hunter to turn around a secondary that has been torched in his absence. Colorado has the worst passing defense in the Pac-12, and the unit allowed 340 yards per game through the air in Hunter\u2019s absence.\n\nUntil the Buffaloes\u2019 secondary starts to follow the example of their Hall of Fame head coach, the team will not be a national contender in today\u2019s college football.\n\n10. Cal Golden Bears (3-4, 1-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\n\nCal has done a fine job this season winning some games it was expected to while not having embarrassing losses at the same scale as either Arizona State or Stanford.\n\nAt the same time, the high points of the Sun Devil and Cardinal seasons have been more impressive than anything the Golden Bears have been able to achieve. Cal has an opportunity this weekend to finally hang with a far superior opponent when it welcomes a reeling USC team to Berkeley on Saturday.\n\nIf there is one thing that the Golden Bears have been able to do this season, it is run the ball effectively. They rank third in the Pac-12 with nearly 200 ground yards per game.\n\nThe Trojans have the worst run defense in the conference, and their best defensive tackle, Bear Alexander, will not be able to play in the first half after taking a late targeting penalty against Utah.\n\nThere is an opportunity for Cal to dominate in the ground game, run clock, keep Caleb Williams off the field and keep this game close until halftime.\n\nThroughout this season, we have seen some of the worst teams in college football have moments of brilliance, most recently when Virginia pulled off a top-10 upset over undefeated North Carolina.\n\nThe Golden Bears are yet to have a moment like that, and, given the current state of USC, this week will likely be their last, best chance.\n\n11. Arizona State Sun Devils (1-6, 0-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 12\n\nLast week, I had Stanford leapfrog Arizona State because its comeback win over Colorado was more impressive than anything the Sun Devils had done this season.\n\nThat changed on Saturday night; while Stanford was getting boat raced by UCLA in its own building, ASU was giving a National Championship contender all it could handle.\n\nAfter Michael Penix Jr. and his host of elite pass catchers went up and down the field against an elite Oregon defense, Arizona State somehow outgained Washington in its own building.\n\nThe Sun Devil secondary held Penix to a 41 QBR, forced 13 incomplete passes and turned the Huskies over four times.\n\nOn the other hand, Kenny Dillingham\u2019s offense was a disappointment, not only failing to put more than one touchdown on the board, but also giving the lead away on an 89-yard pick six.\n\nArizona State is still far away from being a contender, but Dillingham has now twice proven he can be a great motivator for high-profile games.\n\nGiven that I do not think Stanford is capable of what ASU has done against Washington and USC, I moved them back out of the basement.\n\n12. Stanford Cardinal (2-5, 1-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\n\nIf you thought that a season-defining 29-point comeback in Boulder would have sparked some positive momentum for Stanford, think again.\n\nOnce again, the Cardinal got blown out in their own building by UCLA in a game that was essentially over at kickoff.\n\nThe first eight possessions for Stanford resulted in punts, with five of the eight being three-and-outs.\n\nIn a sport that values home-field advantage more than any other, the Cardinal are now 0-4 in home games, losing by a combined score of 135-56.\n\nTroy Taylor\u2019s offense ranks in the bottom three in the conference in most offensive categories, and his defense is allowing over 40 points per Pac-12 contest.\n\nStanford has returned to being an uncompetitive entity in the nation\u2019s most competitive conference, and, with the possible exception of the Cal game, I do not see that changing.\n```"}

County\u2019s unhoused population.\n\nTents used by the homeless line a downtown Los Angeles street with the skyline behind Tuesday, Sept. 22, 2015.

The study, conducted by two researchers at UC San Francisco, found that in a group of 868 sudden deaths presumed to have occurred due to cardiac complications across an eight-year period, the mortality rate was 16 times higher for unhoused individuals in San Francisco when compared to the mortality rate for housed individuals.\n\nWhile some media outlets interpreted the study as saying that unhoused individuals in San Francisco County are 16 times more likely to die suddenly than housed individuals, the focus on cardiac deaths provides a more complex conclusion. Cardiac arrest deaths are not the only kind of sudden deaths. Other causes of sudden death facing the unhoused community can include homicides, suicides and transportation accidents. There are also many other causes of potential unhoused deaths, like diseases or sicknesses caused by poor living conditions.\n\nWhile the calculated mortality rate in this study\u2019s eight-year-long, cardiac-focused scenario was 16 times higher in the unhoused community compared to the housed community, it is not factually correct to say that unhoused individuals are 16 times more likely to die suddenly in San Francisco.\n\nDr. Jared Schachner, a research scientist at USC\u2019s Price School of Public Policy, said that when compared to San Francisco, Los Angeles faces a \u201csimilar problem, just on a larger scale in terms of the health risks faced by the population.\u201d\n\nThe City of San Francisco\u2019s most recent report on the population of people experiencing homelessness registered the population size at over 7,700 individuals. According to the 2023 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, the city\u2019s unhoused population is at an all-time high with over 46,000 Angelenos currently living on the street.\n\nBecause Schachner believes that the issues facing unhoused individuals are similar in both cities, regardless of the difference in population size, Los Angeles statistics can provide a closer example of the actual current mortality rate gap in San Francisco.\n\nAccording to the most recent Los Angeles County data released in a L.A. County Mortality Report in May, the mortality rate among unhoused people was 3.8 times higher than the mortality rate among housed people in the county between 2020 and 2021.\n\nWhile a mortality rate ratio closer to four is far less concerning than the perceived 16, it is still a troublesome number. The recent recorded gap is the largest in Los Angeles County history. The previous high was recorded between 2017 and 2019, when the mortality rate among unhoused people was 2.9 times higher than the mortality rate among housed people.\n\nL.A. County reported that 2021 was the first year in history in which the number of unhoused deaths crossed 2,000. The Mortality Report registered 2,201 deaths in the record-high year, an increase of about 400 deaths from 2020. About 760 unhoused people died just five years before in 2015.\n\nAccording to experts, there are multiple possible explanations for the rise. \u201cLike many other homelessness researchers, I believe homelessness is fundamentally a housing problem,\u201d Schachner said. \u201cHousing is certainly a key ingredient to ensure that [health] risks can be properly managed and that stress can be reduced.\u201d\n\nBen Henwood, a professor at USC\u2019s Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, points to the dangers of drugs as the main cause for the mortality rate rise in both Los Angeles and San Francisco. \u201cOver the past four or five years, we have seen that overdose, unintentional overdose, is the leading cause of death among people experiencing homelessness basically across all races and ethnicities, as well as gender, as well as age,\u201d Henwood said.\n\nThe 2023 Mortality Report\u2019s data falls in line with Henwood\u2019s claim. In the report\u2019s recent period of study spanning 2020 and 2021, L.A. County found that the mortality rate in deaths caused by overdose among unhoused people was 38.9 times higher than the mortality rate among housed people.\n\nAccording to the report, more people experiencing homelessness died due to overdose in 2020 and 2021 than in at least the previous six years combined, spanning back to when L.A. County started tracking overdose-caused deaths.\n\nHenwood attributes a portion of this staggering climb to the country\u2019s fentanyl crisis, which he said \u201cobviously disproportionately impacts our homeless population.\u201d\n\nThe researchers who composed the Mortality Report shared findings that back up Henwood\u2019s claim. \u201cOur analysis of drug types involved in overdose deaths suggests that fentanyl has rapidly replaced other opioids among users in this population and is the drug most responsible for the recent increase in overdose deaths,\u201d the researchers wrote in the report\u2019s conclusion section.\n\nThe prevalence of overdose deaths potentially explains why the cardiac death rate among unhoused individuals in the UC San Francisco study was so much higher than it was among housed individuals.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of GRID-Arendal)\n\nBy Jasmine Kwok, Shyloh Koo, and Roman Marchetti\nOctober 23, 2023 at 6:08 pm PDT\n\nRegardless of any future cutbacks on carbon emissions, sea levels will rise about 6 feet over the next few centuries, according to a new study based on simulations calculating the future state of the West Antarctic Ice Shelf. Dr. Kaitlin Naughten, a British Antarctic survey oceanographer, led the study in which researchers used computer simulations to calculate the future melting projections of the Antarctic ice sheets.\n\n\u201cOur simulations suggest that we are now committed to the rapid increase in the rate of ocean warming and ice shelf melting over the rest of the century,\u201d Naughten told the Associated Press. The simulations looked at four different levels of carbon dioxide emission. In each of the four emission levels, huge portions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were shown to melt due to high water temperatures, which is the result of oceans absorbing more greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe EPA\u2019s website said that changes to the ocean system occur over longer stretches of time. Even with immediate cutbacks, the oceans wouldn\u2019t start adjusting for many more centuries. The figures from Naughten\u2019s study reveal how the retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may contain enough ice to raise the global mean sea-level. They also project the upwards trend of ocean temperature for every future scenario, although mitigation scenarios like Paris 1.5\u00b0C \u2014 a goal of the Paris Climate Agreement to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels \u2014 can flatten out the warming trajectory in a few centuries.\n\nAccording to Sarah Feakins, a professor of earth sciences at USC, this has been an ongoing phenomenon, as past model projects and reconstructions have revealed how current levels of carbon dioxide will result in less ice. \u201cIt just takes a while for the ice to melt and come into equilibrium with greenhouse gases,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if we stopped all [greenhouse gas emissions] today and let the clock roll forward a few hundred years, or a few thousand years, we\u2019d expect to see a lot of that ice gone.\u201d\n\nHowever, Naughten said she was still wary of using words like \u201cdoomed\u201d to describe the current state of the climate crisis because the study only covers years up to 2100. \u201cAfter 2100, we probably have some control,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association (APA), climate change is such a large-scale issue that many people feel as if there\u2019s nothing they can do to solve it. As stated by the APA, climate grief surrounds the loss of a predictable future and a fear for the loss of ecosystems and landscapes. However, climate grief is differentiated from other cycles of grief because climate change is ongoing and \u201call-encompassing,\u201d according to the APA.\n\nDr. Emily Smith-Greenaway, an associate professor of sociology and spatial sciences at USC, spoke to Annenberg Media about climate grief and how media rhetoric can influence how readers perceive and respond to climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of this desire to sensationalize science,\u201d Smith-Greenaway said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a responsibility to ensure that we\u2019re presenting results in a more balanced and neutral manner that\u2019s not turning our science into this kind of clickbait phenomenon.\u201d\n\nAccording to Smith-Greenway, there is sociological evidence that negative news affects how people understand mass events, and it can measurably affect their mental health. Students also spoke to Annenberg Media about their awareness of the sea-level rise and how they perceive the scale of the climate issue.\n\n\u201cI think many people are not paying serious attention to this,\u201d said Pradeep Bhattarai, a graduate student studying finance. \u201cBut, looking at the statistics, this is a really serious thing.\u201d Bhattari worries that island and coastal nations are the most vulnerable and \u201cso many nations could disappear.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, news rhetoric surrounding climate change is often met with suspicion by readers. Interviews conducted by the center revealed that language describing climate change as an \u201curgent threat\u201d led to a disconnect between interviewees\u2019 own beliefs and what the media publishes.\n\nAccording to Professor Feakins, language indicating hopelessness can result in inaction. Despite the inevitable rising sea levels, \u201cit would be wrong to think that we can\u2019t do anything,\u201d Even though part of Antarctica\u2019s ice sheet will be lost, Feakins said that \u201cthe messaging always has to be that every drop of CO2 saved is a good thing.\u201d\n\nAccording to Naughten, there are vulnerable sections of the environment that can still be saved. \u201cJust always remember that it can be a lot worse,\u201d Feakins said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t want to give people a sense that there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d\n```"}

The UN expert Francesca Albanese has warned that Israel\u2019s current actions in Gaza constitute a form of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nIn a statement quoted by The New York Times, 92NY said that the attack by Hamas on Israel has \u201cabsolutely devastated the community.\u201d \u201cGiven the public comments by the invited author on Israel and this moment, we felt the responsible course of action was to postpone the event while we take some time to determine how best to use our platform and support the entire 92NY community,\u201d the statement read.\n\nFollowing the event\u2019s cancellation, Nguyen stood by his previous statements. \u201cI have no regrets about anything I have said or done in regards to Palestine, Israel, or the occupation and war,\u201d Nguyen wrote in an Instagram post the day after the 92NY event was canceled. \u201cI only regret that [event organizer Bernard Schwartz] and other staff at the Y have been so deeply and negatively affected by standing up for art and writers.\u201d\n\nUSC professor Howard A. Rodman, a colleague of Nguyen\u2019s who teaches in USC\u2019s John Wells Division of Writing for Screen and Television, said that he was \u201cvery upset\u201d when he first heard of the event cancellation. \u201cThey can invite [and disinvite] whoever they want,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cBut it seems to me that what they were doing was saying that anyone who calls for a cease-fire, anyone who makes a statement against genocide, is therefore not an acceptable guest in our house. And that bothered me.\u201d\n\nRodman said he fears the possible wider implications of 92NY canceling Nguyen\u2019s event. \u201cIf uttering an opinion about a very, very pressing world event can get you deaccessioned from your platforms, then I think we have to look hard at what free speech means,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cI fear for Palestinian students and Palestinian members of the professoriate who may feel that to speak out against what they see as the genocide of their people will have adverse repercussions on their lives, career and rights to speak.\u201d\n\nNguyen, whose debut novel \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, is known for his writing about Vietnam and the Vietnam War. He was born in Bu\u00f4n M\u00ea Thu\u1ed9t, Vietnam, but moved to the United States with his family in 1975 and settled in a camp for Vietnamese refugees in Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, according to his biography on his personal website. Nguyen said on Instagram that his new memoir, \u201cA Man of Two Faces,\u201d references this time in his life. \u201cI spoke about my book, yes, but also about how art is silenced in times of war and division because some people only want to see the world as us versus them,\u201d Nguyen said in the same Instagram post about the last-minute event he held in Seaport after 92NY\u2019s cancellation. \u201cBut art is one of the things that ... can help us see beyond the hatred of war, that can make us understand that we cannot be divided into the human versus the inhuman because we are, all of us, human and inhuman at the same time.\u201d\n\nThree days after the cancellation of Nguyen\u2019s event and the following controversy, 92NY announced Monday that its 2023-2024 literary series was \u201con pause given recent staff resignations,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n```"}

This was Biden\u2019s way of reestablishing his unwavering support of Israel. On Thursday, the White House released a video of the president commenting on the ongoing war in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Biden: As I emphasized earlier, we will continue to have Israel\u2019s back as you work to defend your people. We\u2019ll continue to work with you and partners across the region to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians.\n\nBiden has promised to support Israel following the Hamas attack on October 7th which killed about 1400 Israelis. More than 200 people remain hostage with four people having been released as of today\u2019s show. The president has been walking a fine line between supporting the United States\u2019 longtime ally in the Middle East while also listening to many of his democratic supporters calling for Israel to use restraint in their retaliation.\n\nFor the past two weeks the Israeli government continues airstrikes on Gaza, and the death toll continues to rise. According to PBS, shortly after receiving a small amount of aid into Gaza, Israeli warplanes attacked the besieged area which was home to Palestinians seeking refuge. Israel has also struck the occupied West Bank, Syria, and Lebanon, amidst fears of further turmoil in the Middle East most specifically Hezbollah.\n\nProfessor Emerita of Political Science and Middle East Studies, Laurie Brand explains that support from the Arab community is a critical aspect for Biden\u2019s re-election.\n\nLaurie Brand: So, it\u2019s possible to me, I mean Arab-Americans, Palestinian Americans are an important part of the electorate in Michigan and Michigan is an important battleground state.\n\nBesides the politics, Brand also praises Biden\u2019s empathy.\n\nLaurie Brand: I thought it was interesting that he mentioned the six-year-old Palestinian-American boy who was murdered, I believe, in the Chicago area. Seemed to be an attempt to try and humanize Palestinians, which is not generally done, I think, by U.S. presidents or U.S. representatives in general.\n\nMuch of the scrutiny Biden\u2019s facing is from his own party with many older, more centrist democrats support his actions and support for Israel. Benjamin Radd, a fellow at the Center for Middle East Development at UCLA recognizes where most democrats are leaning towards.\n\nBenjamin Radd: I think the majority of the party, I\u2019d say overwhelming majority, is in favor of Biden\u2019s support of Israel.\n\nBut some younger, more radical democratic lawmakers are divided over the conflict calling for an immediate cease-fire. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota spoke over the weekend, questioning Biden\u2019s Democratic leadership over his overwhelming support for Israel.\n\nIlhan Omar: Israel has dropped more bombs in the last 10 days then we dropped in a whole year in Afghanistan. Where is your humanity? Where is your outrage? Where is your care?\n\nAccording to the Health Ministry in Gaza more than 4,300 Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks. President Biden faces a backlash from other lawmakers in his own party and at least one State Department official has resigned over Biden\u2019s support for Israel. They want him to press Israel more to follow international and humanitarian laws of war.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sixx Orange.\n```"}

Although highly acclaimed director Martin Scorsese released his film \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d over the weekend, you may be surprised as to which of the two is dominating the box office.\n\nBy Gabriella Medina, Dominic Varela, and Jason Goode\nOctober 23, 2023 at 5:50 pm PDT\n\n\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d was Scorsese\u2019s third best opening. It brought in 23 million dollars. Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras film on the other hand broke box office records with an estimated $31 million in its second weekend of release. In doing so, it became the highest-grossing concert film in North America ever, with about $130 million in domestic box office sales.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t surprise Maya Oster who studies film and television production at USC. Oster: \u201cBecause Swifties are crazy and she just has such a massive fan base that it totally makes sense. Like the Eras tour was so in demand for live tickets, it makes so much sense that now that it\u2019s like available widely, it\u2019s having this big of a reaction.\u201d\n\nPaulina Zornikova studies film production. Zornikova: \u201cI think there are more Swifties in America right now than there are Scorsese fans, probably.\u201d But those Scorsese fans, she says, should not feel bad. Zornikova: \u201cI think they\u2019re just like made for two different audiences. And I don\u2019t think Taylor Swift\u2019s movie beating Martin Scorsese movie at the box office is the death of cinema.\u201d\n\nIt may not be the death of cinema, but it can\u2019t compare with all the life in the movie theater for Taylor Swift, says Oster. Oster: \u201cEras Tour movie theater is, like, filled with girls of all ages, dancing and singing and shouting and screaming. It\u2019s like, really fun environment. And then Killers of the Flower Moon is, like, very much your classic movie theater experience everyone sits down everyone applauds at the end during the credits. Like it feels like a film festival screening, almost.\u201d\n\nWhile some celebrate Swift\u2019s success, others say a simple film of a concert outgrowing an artistic, multi-year produced film like \u201cKillers Of the Flower Moon\u201d could have an effect on the film industry. Jordan Rice studies theater at USC. Rice: \u201cI\u2019m happy for the Taylor Swift fans, but it\u2019s really upsetting to see an icon of the film industry be beat out by someone in a different field. That being said, I think it\u2019s important that we\u2019re changing the landscape of how we view cinema and how we view movies. So if it\u2019s getting more people to support movie theaters, which is an industry that is dying, then I\u2019m for it.\u201d\n\nCinema may be suffering, but concert films will continue to be a thing says USC Thornton School of Music professor Nate Sloan. He says the film will be part of marketing the whole package. Sloan: \u201cThere will be the album, there will be the tour, there will be the film version of the tour, there will be the Associated merch. In an era when musical artists are making less money than ever because of the economics of the streaming music industry, they are turning to other sources of revenue.\u201d\n\nAnd part of the appeal must be that twenty bucks for the film is affordable to more people than hundreds or thousands of dollars to see Taylor Swift live!

Strikers say they feel overworked and burnt out due to understaffing and high worker turnover. Eric Sanitate, a respiratory therapist explains that other hospitals in the area offer better pay, better working conditions and better patient safety records.\n\nSanitate: \u201cWhy would anybody want to work here when they can work at a better place? So as a result, we can\u2019t hold on to staff, we can\u2019t retain them in the place just becomes less and less safe. There\u2019s fewer and fewer of us trying to do more and more work for more and more patients. And it\u2019s quite frankly, become a scary situation in there.\u201d\n\nSanitate says this strike does not surprise him.

You know, we just could not save COVID patients for the life of us.\u201d And yet, they stayed on the job and only became more and more exhausted.\n\nSanitate: \u201cI think this is the culmination of three years basically, of just feeling taken advantage of and disrespected. And I think that\u2019s what you see out here, and I think that\u2019s mainly been the motivation for the strike.\u201d\n\nProvidence St. Joseph is Burbank\u2019s only hospital and E.R... It serves a population of over 100,000. As burn out and staffing issues loom over the heads of health care workers, the quality of care has been dropping says Burbank Mayor Konstantine Anthony.\n\nAnthony: \u201cWe were one of the top hospitals in the country and the last few years since the pandemic, that is not the case anymore. I firmly believe that what\u2019s going on with the staffing, what\u2019s going on with the lack of pay incentives for the workers directly affects the care that\u2019s being provided to the patients.\u201d\n\nHospital officials told ABC7 that they have proposed a 24% increase in wages over a three-year contract but, Christian Ayon, a surgical technician, claims that that would not apply for all workers at the hospital.\n\nAyon: \u201cIf that was true across the board for everyone here, we wouldn\u2019t be out here in the streets. It may be true for certain categories of people, but it\u2019s just not true for everybody. It might rain for 24% that some people getting 18, 19 and all the way down to 14% depending on who you are and what you do.\u201d\n\nFor now, the hospital will return to the bargaining table as soon the strike ends in five days.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Zifei Zhang.\n```"}

The highly anticipated game seven begins at 5 P.M and baseball fans across the country have many differing opinions and hopes on come out victorious.\n\nMelvin Garcia, a USC junior majoring in economics is rooting for the Rangers to spoil the Astros chances of going back to back. Garcia: \u201cI\u2019m just rooting for someone else to make it out of the ALCS. So I\u2019m going for the Texas Rangers to make it out. So I was just like, I want to see a little bit more, some more variety and who we see in the championship series. So seeing I see a team like the Rangers that get all the way. I think that\u2019d be a pretty good for the MLB So I\u2019m just really pulling that they, you know, keep their underdog status and probably get in a nice little upset against the Astros.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers are looking to reach their first world series since 2011 after a decade of underwhelming play on the diamond. On the opposite end, the Astros are fighting to become back to back champs as they have been the definition of success of late in the MLB. They have reached the ALCS seven years straight and won the World Series in 2017 and 2022.\n\nThe bad blood between the teams has been evident and was on full display in game five when Rangers Adolis Garcia was hit by a Bryan Abreu pitch that veered inside. Benches cleared and players stormed the field to protect their teammates and it led to Adolis Garcia, Bryan Abreu and Astros Manager Dusty Baker all being ejected. The Astros would go onto win game five by a clutch Jose Altuve homerun to left field just over the glove of Evan Carter.\n\nIn game 6 the Rangers would rally back and win in blowout fashion 9-2 thanks to an Adolis Garcia grand slam. USC graduate Denton Cohen does not have anything against the once heavily hated Astros but would not mind seeing the Rangers be a great underdog story. Cohen: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a huge Astros fan, but I will say most of the cheaters are gone now. I\u2019ll always defend Jose Altuve. I don\u2019t think he cheated. So I don\u2019t mind the Astros winning another World Series, but I think I\u2019d rather see the Rangers do it than the Astros. You know what, I think the Rangers bullpen is going to come through. They\u2019ve been a they\u2019ve been a liability all year. They\u2019ve blown a couple of games in the playoffs. But I think they\u2019re going to come through today.\u201d\n\nFor years there has been a rumored curse around the attendance of Senator Ted Cruz at Houston sporting events. With Cruz in attendance Houston has lost many important games including game seven of the 2018 NBA Western Conference Finals. Cohen: \u201cI think the Texas Rangers are going to win because I think that Ted Cruz is going to go to the game and I think the Cruz curse is going to hit again and they\u2019re going to go to own five on the season when Ted Cruz attends a game.\u201d\n\nThe winner of the big game will walk home with the A.L pennant and will face either the Diamondbacks or Phillies in the World Series.

After appearances by the Rock and John Cena, the momentum for WWE has never been better. The company seems to know exactly what direction they\u2019re going in, and while they sometimes have legends appear, they are starting to look to younger talent to deliver more and more. Similarly, AEW recently debuted Adam Copeland, formerly known as \u201cEdge\u201d in WWE, and has been building up some momentum of its own. They gave fans multiple first-time-ever one-on-one matches that were instant classics. Both companies have incredibly talented wrestlers who put on amazing performances each week, and this past week was no different. Here are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week:\n\nBryan Danielson vs. Andrade El Idolo (AEW Collision, October 21)\nBilled as a dream match, Bryan Danielson took on Andrade El Idolo in a sickening one-on-one bout. The technician Danielson is in the ring is always impressive, and seeing El Idolo keep up with Danielson with his own speed and strength was true magic. The chops given by El Idolo visibly reddened the chest of Danielson, but that didn\u2019t stop the \u201cAmerican Dragon\u201d from delivering some of his own back. A highlight of the match was a springboard dropkick that sent Danielson outside of the ring and saw El Idolo follow up with two moonsaults. They continued to go back and forth, and ended the match trading roll-up covers, with Danielson rolling up El Idolo for the three count in the end.\n\nCharlotte Flair vs. Iyo Sky (WWE Friday Night Smackdown, October 20)\nThis may have been a repeat match, but every time these two step in the ring together, it\u2019s something special. This time around, Sky hit Flair with a suicide dive, missile dropkick and powerbomb from the top rope, and so much more innovative offense. On the flip side, Flair reversed several of Sky\u2019s moves, including incorporating a Boston Crab submission into her moveset. She also reversed a hurricanrana that Flair used the momentum from to catch Sky and drop face first on the ring apron, and a crossbody from Sky that led to Flair hitting a fallaway slam from the top rope. Flair seemed to have the match won after a spear, but Sky\u2019s Damage CTRL group moved Sky\u2019s leg to the rope to avoid a three count. When Flair tried a spear again, Sky illegally had her championship belt catch Flair\u2019s impact so she could steal the victory. Even though Flair lost, she avoided getting completely beat up by Sky and company thanks to Bianca Belair making her return to aid Flair.\n\nKyle Fletcher vs. Kenny Omega (AEW Dynamite, October 18)\nKyle Fletcher\u2019s nickname should be \u201cThe Flash\u201d because of the sheer speed he delivered some of his moves to Kenny Omega. With the two having similar arsenals of suplexes, running kicks and knees, there were so many moments that I thought would end the match, but both competitors showed resilience. I also have to mention how both Omega and Fletcher are incredible sellers, meaning they know exactly how to land from moves to make their opponent look stronger. After a sinister high knee that sent Fletcher to the mat, Omega raised him up again for his One Winged Angel finisher and the victory.\n\nRicochet vs. Shinsuke Nakamura (WWE Monday Night Raw, October 16)\nDue to its falls count anywhere stipulation, this match took Ricochet and Shinsuke Nakamura from the ring to backstage, and even to the crowd. There was no limit to these superstars\u2019 innovation. At one point, Ricochet climbed into the crowd and jumped off the stair ledge to hit Nakamura with a shooting star press, something that not many superstars could do. Unfortunately for Ricochet, that wasn\u2019t enough to pull off the victory, and once the two made it back to the ring, Nakamura kicked Ricochet off the top rope straight into a table. Nakamura followed the table spot with his finisher to get the win over Ricochet.\n```"}

Students who came from families in the top 20% of earners were seven times more likely to get a \u201cgood\u201d score (above a 1300 on the SAT or a 29 on the ACT) than students coming from the bottom 20% of earners, according to College Board and admissions data analyzed in the study. These students from low-income families not only earned lower scores on the standardized tests, but were significantly less likely to take them in the first place; only one in five students in the bottom 20% took the SAT or ACT.\n\nThe cost of taking both the SAT and ACT exams once is over $100, before the additional costs of essay sections, subject tests, tutoring or textbook prep. Data from over 9,000 public schools shows that students in affluent school districts are also more likely to get \u201c504 designations\u201d that allow for academic accommodations like extra time or a private space to take the tests, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThere are discrepancies with the SAT and test scores that matter for college admission, but there\u2019s also a ton of inequality that happens before that,\u201d said Dr. Ann Lauren Owens, a professor of sociology and social policy at USC. \u201cAs much as we pretend to believe it, we don\u2019t live in an open society where everybody has an equal chance to succeed...There are a lot of things affecting people\u2019s access other than good test scores.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of admissions and attendance records in the study further uncovered the overrepresentation of wealthy students at elite colleges. Legacy status, athletics programs, donations and growing up in an environment with the resources to better prepare them for pursuing higher education all play a role in that overrepresentation, the study found.\n\nTest score gaps are indicators of inequality and educational opportunity, according to Owens. But those gaps are the result of family backgrounds, where students grew up and their educational and extracurricular opportunities. \u201cBy the time we get to testing, it\u2019s really the culmination of 18 years of lots of different sources of inequality in our society,\u201d she continued.\n\nStudents having fewer resources is directly linked to lower scores on standardized testing; This also correlates to a disparity between test scores of white students and students of color, who, according to a study on income segregation between school districts, are more likely to live in poorly-funded school districts with less opportunities and resources for academic success.\n\n\u201cColleges are faced with an applicant pool that has faced unequal access to opportunity and unequal exposure to different challenges, and they\u2019re asked to come up with policies that somehow admit a class on \u2018fair grounds\u2019,\u201d Owens noted.\n\nThere is no ubiquitous policy that would solve social inequality and immobility in higher education. Until one is found, some students think the SAT and ACT should remain the benchmark of educational testing. \u201cI may be old fashioned, but I think that standardized testing is really important,\u201d said Juwon Seo, a fifth-year student at USC studying architecture. \u201cIt\u2019s true that wealth and affluence give you more time and opportunities to get better...but unless they find a better standardized testing form, I think regardless of what it is, it is needed.\u201d```"}

Photo courtesy of Farah Sosa.\n\nBy Jaelyn Gonzalez October 23, 2023 at 4:44 pm PDT\n\nA three-piece string quartet introduced the band gently as they started with their 2017 record \u201cJimmy Fallon Big!\u201d from the album \u201cSoft Sounds from Another Planet.\u201d Together, they opened with a whimsical soft sound and warmed up the crowd for a performance of sentimental ballads and energetic pop songs. A part of LA Phil\u2019s KCRW series, the band spent two nights at the Walt Disney Concert Hall on Sept. 27 and 28. However, this venue doesn\u2019t typically serve as a home for rock bands. A usual night at the concert hall includes a full orchestra alongside formal attire by concertgoers. Instead, Japanese Breakfast broke unspoken concert hall rules with an exhilarating electric guitar and their fans in Doc Martens and indie rock band tees. It was a commemorative moment for the band and the concert hall\u2019s history.\n\nJapanese Breakfast frontwoman, Michelle Zauner, filled each corner of the room with her impassioned voice and contagious playful energy on stage. During the show, Zauner announced the show is one of her last for a while, as the band will go on hiatus. Whispers scattered throughout the crowd after the unexpected news. She followed by saying she would be moving to South Korea to write a book. This will be Zauner\u2019s second book, following the release of her New York Times best-selling memoir, \u201cCrying in H Mart.\u201d\n\nBefore her start with Japanese Breakfast, Michelle Zauner also fronted the emo rock band, Big Little League from Philadelphia. It was one of Zauner\u2019s first musical projects in her post-college time, from 2011 to 2014. The band had its run until Zauner moved back to her hometown when she discovered her mother had pancreatic cancer. While she cared for her mother, Zauner wrote for Japanese Breakfast. She joined forces with her now husband and guitarist, Peter Bradley and previous bandmate, Deven Craige, on bass, Japanese Breakfast was given life with \u201cPsychopomp\u201d in 2016. The LP is known as Zauner\u2019s grief album, as many of the songs on it are about the loss of her mother.\n\n\u201cIs there something you can do with yourself? / As I sift through the debris / While I empty every shelf / And flounder in the muck that I\u2019ll be drowning in so soon\u201d she writes in \u201cIn Heaven.\u201d She battled grief throughout the album. She developed a stronger sound over the next few years, the band\u2019s release of \u201cJubilee\u201d was about Zauner\u2019s pursuit of happiness after years of mourning.\n\nAt one of the last shows of the \u201cJubilee\u201d era tour, Zauner made the show feel like a party even in a room designed for a seated experience. It was impossible to not move to the pop synths in \u201cBe Sweet.\u201d By the end of the night, fans were out of their seats regardless of the constrictive venue. The inescapable dancing was infectious, led by Zauner as she hopped along the stage with the giant bow attached to her dress which followed her every step. She had an animated stage presence, accompanied by her passionate voice. So much so that she got a bit shaky and mumbly at times. Her vocals were slightly lost as she pushed her cords too hard mid-way in the set while singing \u201cPaprika.\u201d Eventually, she got back into the swing of things for the band\u2019s indie pop song, \u201cEverybody Wants to Love You.\u201d\n\nAt times, the band would start a bit rocky by failing to keep time, leaving Zauner to look back at drummer Craig Hendrix. Zauner also performed a new record, \u201cOrlando\u201d on acoustic guitar shortly after performing \u201cGlider\u201d written for the video game \u201cSable.\u201d The song has yet to be released, but the live performance was tastefully backed by the string quartet. It is somber and heavily indie folk-inspired.\n\nJapanese Breakfast performing at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Photo Courtesy of Farah Sosa.\n\nThey came back for an encore and Japanese Breakfast ended the night as rock stars with an emotionally powerful performance. Zauner\u2019s sentimental writing about love and loss paired with intricate guitar solos created a touching journey. \u201cPosing for Cars,\u201d a song of two lovers keeping their relationship alive, issued a heartfelt moment with minutes of Zauner and Bradley exchanging strums on their guitars. Their connectivity on stage made for a sweet moment between the two, especially during \u201cTactics\u201d as they shared glances while on keyboards facing each other. The chemistry between the two is dear and tender.\n\nJust before the night ended, the choppy synths of \u201cDiving Woman\u201d echoed off of the chamber walls. As it arrived before the chorus, Bradley\u2019s lead guitar prompted a jaw drop. With the help of Criage\u2019s intense bass and Zauner\u2019s slide down her guitar, together they made a thrilling arrangement. The band did the venue service and created a hypnotizing moment, returning to Zauner\u2019s emo roots. The sonorous feeling of the bass within the floor, the pouncing from Hendix\u2019s drums and the waves from the amplified guitar were chilling live music experiences.\n\nAs this is one of the last performances for Japanese Breakfast for a while, fans can still get their fix by watching Zauner lick the guitar again and again as she dances.\n```"}

His mother, Hanaan Shahin, 32, was also stabbed more than a dozen times and is currently recovering.\n\n\u201cHis name was Wadea,\u201d Biden said in his speech. \u201cWadea \u2014 a proud American, a proud Palestinian American family.\u201d\n\nThe president went on to denounce Islamophobia and antisemitism, urging Americans to reject \u201call forms of hate.\u201d\n\nJoseph Czuba, the landlord and alleged attacker, was charged with first degree and attempted first degree murder, two hate crimes and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\n\nIn texts to the boy\u2019s father, Wadea\u2019s mother said the landlord attempted to choke her and attack her with a knife, yelling, \u201cyou Muslims must die,\u201d according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\n\u201cDetectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,\u201d the Will County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement.\n\nIn another statement, president of the Muslim Student Union at USC Hafeez Mir wrote that the incident last Saturday represents \u201cthe grave threat to the safety of Arabs, Muslims, women and children\u2014whether at home like Wadea, on campuses like USC, and anywhere in between where the innocent become targets.\u201d\n\nIn the past week, there have been multiple reports across the country detailing a rise in both antisemitism and Islamophobia in relation to the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nLast week, New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a statement strongly condemning antisemitism and Islamophobia in New York after recent reports of increased acts of hate and discrimination, saying the state had \u201czero tolerance\u201d for any form of hate.\n\nSarra Hussein, a Muslim junior at USC, said the incident was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d but not surprising, as she described noticing an uptick in Islamophobic sentiment on social media the week of Wadea\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI hope that this serves as a reminder or a warning of how dangerous this rhetoric is, and how seriously it needs to be taken,\u201d she said.\n\nWadea had celebrated his sixth birthday just eight days before he was killed. In a picture circulating on X, formerly known as Twitter, the kindergartener is seen standing wearing a sparkly blue birthday hat, his gift bag next to him and a remix rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d playing on the TV behind him.\n\n\u201cHe loved everything and everybody\u2014from his toys to basketball, to his friends and family,\u201d Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the CAIR-Chicago, said in a news conference on Sunday. \u201cHe was looking forward to a long and healthy prosperous life,\u201d he added. \u201cHe has no clue about these larger issues happening in the world, but he was made to pay for it.\u201d\n\nBoth loved ones and strangers gathered last Monday in Plainfield, Illinois for Wadea\u2019s funeral. His mother\u2019s injuries prevented her from being able to attend, according to Rehab.\n\nAs the community continues to mourn, Biden has announced $100 million in aid to Palestinians after he visited Israel Wednesday to stand in \u201csolidarity in the face of Hamas\u2019s brutal terrorist attack,\u201d according to a tweet.\n\nDuring the visit, Israel agreed for humanitarian aid to reach Gaza after it was blocked.\n\nIn his Oval Office appearance Thursday, Biden also addressed the nation on the United States\u2019 response to Hamas\u2019 attacks against Israel and Russia\u2019s ongoing war with Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, the president requested $106 billion in military aid for Israel, Ukraine and Gaza, which is yet to be approved by Congress.\n\nThousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the last two weeks after Hamas attacked Israel and killed more than 1,400 people.

(Photo by MATTHEW CALMA OF ANNENBERG MEDIA)\n\nBy Matthew Calma October 23, 2023 at 3:03 pm PDT\n\n\u201cHomelessness is the unfinished business of the Civil Rights Movement,\u201d said Martin Luther King III in the opening video addressing the audience of the National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH) Leadership Conference in Washington D.C. The conference was held over the course of two days inviting advocates, service providers, and leaders who have experienced homelessness to discuss strategies for tackling the growing population of homeless people that is taking place across the country. Panels hosted by leaders in non-profits from across the country discussed topics including racial equity, tenant organizing, foster care, prison-to-homelessness pipeline and film and media for advocacy to name a few.\n\nThe NCH has launched its new grassroots campaign \u201cBring America Home Now\u201d (BAHN), which focuses on the passage of federal legislation \u201caimed at addressing the interconnected solutions to the decades-long epidemic of homelessness in the United States.\u201d The campaign changes how the homelessness movement has operated by putting people with \u201clived experiences\u201d of homelessness at the front of campaign advocacy, policy development and storytelling. In NCH, 90% of employees have experienced homelessness at one point in their lives. For the organization, and for the movement, this is the campaign\u2019s strength and what they believe will make the campaign truly effective.\n\n\u201cHomeless people should be at the forefront of everything we do,\u201d said Donald Whitehead, NCH Executive Director. This strategy is made tangible with the Lived Experience Training Academy, a curriculum created by people who have experienced homelessness, to train others with lived experiences to be leaders within their communities by equipping them with tools and resources to make their \u201cvoices the centerpiece of strategy and advocacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the ones we\u2019ve been looking for,\u201d said Rosyln Brock, a member of the National Board of Directors of the NAACP, speaking to the packed conference room during day 1, made up mostly of formerly homeless people. The Lived Experience Training Academy is built upon the strategies of the Civil Rights Movement, strategies that Whitehead views as an effective means of winning public support and putting necessary pressure on national lawmakers. During the Civil Rights Movement, Black Americans were trained to become leaders in their own communities in classes similar to the BAHN campaign. Rather than putting people who are disconnected from the experience of being homeless at the forefront of leadership, the NCH is mobilizing and organizing those who have gone through living on the streets and in shelters.\n\nHomelessness continues to grow faster than before the pandemic, without any signs of letting up, as protections from evictions and federal aid begin to fall away. Ann Olivia, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, believes that \u201cAll of our systems are creating more homelessness\u201d. In response to pressures from the public to take action on a growing homeless population, cities are criminalizing homelessness across the country. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has made it easier to arrest homeless people and has ramped up street sweeps to get rid of homeless people sleeping out on the streets. A growing number of people believe homelessness is a top issue affecting cities today, and people are becoming angrier with politicians and the homeless. This is not a natural trend in public opinion, according to advocacy leaders such as Mark Horvath, founder of Invisible People, a non-profit dedicated to telling the stories of homeless people in a raw and authentic way. Instead, it\u2019s due to a well-funded homelessness agenda by right-wing organizations that are pushing the message that housing the homeless does not work.\n\nIn a Fox News video that Horvath showed during his panel, Jesse Watters says homeless people want to \u201cwander around and live in tents on the sidewalk. You can\u2019t coddle antisocial beings.\u201d Horvath believes that winning the battle for public opinion is how we win the battle to end homelessness. However, the reason the right-wing campaign is winning is simple: money. They are well-funded compared to homeless non-profits. During his panel, Horvath talked about people such as Michael Shellenberger, who believes that homelessness is not an issue of housing or an issue of the economy but rather an issue of individual mental health problems. Shellenberger published a book called \u201cSanfransicko\u201d, arguing for the need for public funds to go toward mental and drug abuse support rather than housing first. Shellenberger has been at the center of the anti-homelessness campaign, putting large sums of money, in comparison to homeless advocates such as Horvath, into marketing. One instance Horvath pointed out during his panel was Shellenberger\u2019s payment of $25,000 to social media personality, Soledad Ursua, to tweet rhetoric claiming that homelessness is not a cause of the housing crisis. Ursua has also published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times arguing that homelessness is a result of individual mental health and drug addiction.\n\n\u201cAre any of you getting funded to tweet good stuff? No, no. Right,\u201d asked Horvath to the panel audience. Recently, Horvath posted to his social media explaining that his organization Invisible People has had to pause production due to a lack of funding. The homelessness movement is not just battling the status quo of what already exists, but as people like Horvath have pointed out, advocates are battling those who wish to keep things the same.\n\n\u201cAs Martin Luther King Jr. so wisely reminded us that social change does not inevitably happen. It happens because of tireless dedication, and passion, and struggle. And that is all of us,\u201d said Donald Whitehead.\n```"}

And that\u2019s exactly what Martin Scorsese did with \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Scorsese grabbed two of his great collaborators \u2014 Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, combining under the director for the first time \u2014 and made a film worthy of the \u201cmasterpiece\u201d label. But somehow, Scorsese still finds a way to innovate.\n\n\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d follows the real-life relationship between DiCaprio\u2019s Ernest Burkhart and Lily Gladstone\u2019s Mollie Burkhart, a woman of the Osage Nation in Fairfax, Oklahoma. Ernest, a World War I veteran, moves to Fairfax to work for his uncle, William King Hale, the town\u2019s de facto mayor and a supposed friend to Osage whose generosity belies a vicious scheme. Under his uncle\u2019s guidance, Ernest marries Mollie and becomes his right hand man.\n\nAnyone who read anything about \u201cKillers\u201d before seeing the film probably knows that the story concerns a series of murders of the Osage people, perpetrated to claim the land and oil money that made the Osage exceedingly wealthy. But rather ingeniously, \u201cKillers\u201d is not a mystery film. By roughly 30 minutes into the film, the audience has a strong idea of who\u2019s behind the deaths in the Osage community and after an hour or so, DiCaprio\u2019s Burkhat reveals it outright. Instead of luxuriating in the mystery, Scorsese and his co-screenwriter Eric Roth prefer to meditate on the crimes\u2019 severity.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to critique this film without discussing the mammoth runtime, so we may as well get it out of the way. If you simply can\u2019t sit still in a movie theater for over three hours, then maybe \u201cKillers\u201d is not for you. But for those who have the patience, Scorsese and his longtime editing collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker don\u2019t let the film drag. That\u2019s not to say \u201cKillers\u201d moves at breakneck pace. Rather, when it needs a jolt of energy, Scorsese and Schoonmaker employ familiar Scorsese hard cuts to the next scene. It has a startling positive effect and at times it even plays for laughs, a pleasant surprise in an otherwise somber story.\n\nStitching together three hours and 26 minutes of footage so that it flows seamlessly is Oscar-worthy in and of itself, regardless of the film\u2019s other accomplishments. But quality editing would mean nothing without a series of exceptional performances that keep the audience not just engaged, but enthralled by their emotional depth.\n\nBy playing Ernest, DiCaprio has chosen a third consecutive part in which he deliberately plays a character either less attractive than he is (\u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d), less intelligent (\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d) or both (\u201cKillers\u201d). Make no mistake about it: Ernest Burkhart is a dolt, motivated only by lust and money. He appears to harbor genuine love for Mollie, but his initial attraction to her still comes off as almost predatory and certainly leans into her other-ness from him.\n\nIn a crucial scene, he attempts to flirt with Mollie by saying, \u201cYou got a nice color of skin, what color would you say that is?\u201d to which she simply replies, \u201cMy color.\u201d The exchange demonstrates a core aspect to both characters, which DiCaprio and Gladstone play to perfection. Ernest is an arrogant and over-talkative outsider who may mean well, but never sees the wrongness of his ways. Mollie, meanwhile, has a quieter demeanor and is typically the smartest person in any given room, but prefers to see the best in Ernest until it\u2019s too late.\n\nDe Niro as Hale completes the lead trifecta, imbuing the robber baron-type with a sense of pure evil. Hale is all show. When Ernest arrives in Fairfax, Hale jokes crudely with his nephew and they imbibe plentiful whiskey during the Prohibition era, but Hale clearly intends to use his nephew to advance his sinister agenda. As opposed to the classic De Niro tough guy roles of the past, like Jake LaMotta in \u201cRaging Bull\u201d or Neal McCauley in \u201cHeat,\u201d Scorsese and his cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto film De Niro in a way that makes him seem smaller and older. But what Hale lacks in physical intimidation he more than makes up for in cunning.\n\nOne other question will loom over \u201cKillers\u201d in the online discourse: does it do justice to the Osage people? Truthfully, that\u2019s a hard question to answer. Scorsese clearly has great respect for Osage culture and customs and they are portrayed in detail for the film\u2019s duration, from Ernest and Mollie\u2019s wedding down to a baby-naming ceremony. In fact, the film\u2019s first words are in the Osage language. But as Scorsese\u2019s Osage language consultant on the movie, Christopher Cote, told the Hollywood Reporter, \u201cas an Osage, [he] really wanted this to be from the perspective of Mollie and what her family experienced. But I think it would take an Osage to do that.\u201d\n\nAt the film\u2019s premiere, Osage language consultant Christopher Cote shares his complicated feelings about #KillersOfTheFlowerMoon\n\nStories about America\u2019s despicable history of discrimination and genocide against Native Americans will always be delicate, particularly when told by non-native creators, but Scorsese hits the mark. \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d may not have the instant pop appeal of \u201cGoodfellas\u201d or \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d but as our judgment deepens with time, Scorsese\u2019s latest effort will surely rise to the top of his storied filmography.\n```"}

If you\u2019re a Sweetgreen consumer, you might be reassured to know your salads will only contain extra-virgin olive oil from here on out. Last week, the salad chain Sweetgreen announced that it will stop using seed oils, making it the first national fast-casual restaurant to cook exclusively with olive oil. Following backlash from consumers about health concerns from cooking with seed oils, the chain decided to make the switch in stores nationwide. On October 18th, it announced on twitter, \u201cToday, we\u2019re excited to share an exciting milestone\u2014not just for Sweetgreen\u2014but for our entire industry. Starting 10/24, all of our protein, veggies, and grains will be cooked in extra virgin olive oil\u2014a commitment that\u2019s *never* been made by a restaurant at our scale.\u201d\n\nOlive oil is a healthy fat that is important to maintaining a balanced diet. It is high in the monounsaturated fat Oleic acid, which has been shown to decrease inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is one of the drivers in diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, arthritis and obesity. However, seed oils are higher in inflammatory fats, like polyunsaturated fats, than oils like olive or avocado. Polyunsaturated fats contain higher levels of omega-6s that can trigger inflammation. Seed oil is also highly processed and calorically dense, but doesn\u2019t provide the same nutrients as olive oil. An average tablespoon of vegetable oil is 120 calories and has 14 grams of fat with no protein or carbohydrates. Additionally, seed oils have made their way into the American diet because of how cheap they are compared to alternatives.\n\nSweetgreen has decided to partner with Bari Olive Oil Company, a sustainable company that produces and cultivates olive oil locally in California. Additionally, Sweetgreen is also considering adding avocado oil as an additional cooking oil as the company continues to innovate its menu. Following the success of the summer speciality red wine vinaigrette dressing, which has an avocado oil base, Sweetgreen has added the dressing permanently to the menu. \u201cReimagining fast food goes beyond the kitchen and starts with a strong, transparent supply chain. In addition to partnering with suppliers and growers we trust, we take into account how every ingredient is prepared, down to the oil it\u2019s cooked in,\u201d said Nicolas Jammet, Sweetgreen\u2019s co-founder in a statement. \u201cWhile we know there\u2019s more work to do, we hope this change raises the bar and continues to inspire our industry to make quality products more accessible.\u201d\n\nThis switch is in alignment with Sweetgreen\u2019s commitment to local sourcing and providing consumers with local, high quality ingredients that are minimally processed. However, seed oils are quite the opposite. Oils like canola, safflower, grapeseed and sunflower are highly processed oils that go through a  process of chemical extraction  and sometimes bleaching or deodorization. Dr. Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine, discussed a possible reasoning for obesity from the consumption of seed oils. \u201cIn the last two decades and in particular in the last 10 years the consumption of seed oils has gone up dramatically, that is true, and that the caloric content of seed oils may in some ways, perhaps in many ways be contributing to the so called \u2018obesity epidemic,\u2019\u201d Huberman said in his podcast the Huberman Lab.\n\nSweetgreen has taken a huge step in the dining industry and will influence how similar healthy fast-casual restaurants, like Cava and Chipotle, take action to provide cleaner ingredients for consumers. As more restaurants switch over from seed oils we may even see a decrease in obesity and other health conditions that come with it. The Sweetgreen switch will be in effect starting tomorrow.\n```"}

The Trojans (13-7, 7-3) defended Galen well again on Sunday (24-26, 25-23, 17-25, 25-17, 15-10), continuing their undefeated tenure at home this season despite falling behind early against Washington (13-8, 4-6). USC came into the match hot off of a Friday night win over No. 4 Washington State. Sunday seemed like a fairly even matchup through a tightly-contested first set, with the Huskies coming out on top after eight total lead changes. Freshman outside hitter London Wijay recorded five kills in the set.\n\nUSC struggled to break early ahead in the second set but found offensive life behind a strong showing from redshirt sophomore middle blocker Tyrah Ariail. Ariail also led the team with a career-high eight blocks. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot tougher than we think we are mentally and physically,\u201d Ariail said after the match. \u201cWe just need to keep pushing for higher goals.\u201d The Trojans spearheaded a major offensive barrage to win the second set in part due to key kills by Ariail, senior middle blocker Lindsey Miller and senior outside hitter Skylar Fields. Fields had her fifth double-double of the season with 23 kills and 11 digs, and moved up to  fourth in the nation  in total kills. \u201cWe have what it takes, we just need to find a quicker way to start,\u201d Fields commented.\n\nUSC struggled to generate offense again in the third set and allowed the Huskies to reach a 17-10 lead early. It ultimately dropped the set 25-17. \u201cAre we even close to where we need to be?\u201d head coach Brad Keller questioned. \u201cNo. Can we get there? Maybe. Time\u2019s running out, though.\u201d The Trojans rallied again in a strong fourth set behind several important kills by sophomore blocker Rylie McGinest. Junior setter Mia Tuaniga also had a strong outing, recording her eighth double-double this year with 17 digs and a season-high 50 assists. A McGinest kill sealed the set for the Trojans and sent them to the fifth, where they dominated over a worn-out Washington squad 15-10.\n\nThe win is the second five-set comeback for USC this weekend, who now hits the road for more Pac-12 play. Keller was particularly vocal about the team\u2019s recent play and his role in their somewhat rocky season. \u201cI didn\u2019t focus on the right things and I kind of let them be complacent,\u201d Keller said. \u201cAs a coach, you can never do that. And so I have vowed that that\u2019s not going to happen going forward. We\u2019ve had two wins, and they\u2019re gonna have the hardest practice they can possibly imagine on Tuesday.\u201d The Trojans travel to Boulder to take on Colorado this Friday at 6 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Yang)\n\nBy nikki thomas October 22, 2023 at 1:53 am PDT\n\nFor a few moments on Saturday night, it seemed like USC football would silence the critics and redeem themselves after their tough loss at Notre Dame last weekend. Instead, untimely mistakes cost the Trojans a game that was, at many points, well-within their grasp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as gut-wrenching a defeat as I can remember in my career,\u201d said head coach Lincoln Riley.\n\nThis year\u2019s rematch of the Pac-12 championship didn\u2019t disappoint for college football fans as USC (6-2, 4-1) hosted Utah (6-1, 3-1) at the Coliseum. Coming off of their first loss of the season, USC fought hard but ultimately fell to Utah in a late-game thriller.\n\nUSC was 0-2 against the Utes last season, who were missing a major piece in senior quarterback Cam Rising. Rising, last year\u2019s Pac-12 Championship MVP, has been out all year due to injury. But despite their reliance on backup junior quarterback Bryson Barnes, the Utes caught their stride early.\n\nThey struck first in the matchup, with Barnes hitting sophomore running back Sione Vaki for a 53-yard touchdown less than two minutes into the game. The Trojans weren\u2019t kept down long, and redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd hammered in a 45-yard touchdown run on the very next possession.\n\nAfter forcing a Utah punt, USC stormed back down the field. Junior quarterback Caleb Williams connected with redshirt senior wide receiver Tahj Washington for a 51-yard pass to take the Trojans to the one-yard line. A couple of plays later, freshman receiver Zachariah Branch ran in the two-yard score to put USC up 14-7.\n\nUtah wouldn\u2019t go away, though; Barnes ran the ball in for a 10-yard touchdown late in the first to tie the game back up. The teams exchanged empty possessions in a scoreless second quarter.\n\nAfter forcing a USC punt to begin the second half, Utah scored again on a six-yard pass from Barnes to sophomore tight end Landen King. On the next USC possession, Utah junior defensive end Van Fillenger forced a fumble on Lloyd, and junior safety Cole Bishop recovered the ball for the Utes.\n\nThe turnover led to another Barnes touchdown, as he reconnected with Vaki for a 15-yard score to go up 28-14. Things began looking up for the Trojans on their next drive when Williams hit Washington for a 40-yard pass to bring USC within striking distance. However, a Williams touchdown pass was called back on penalties shortly after.\n\nA 44-yard field goal by redshirt sophomore kicker Denis Lynch made the score 28-17 in favor of the Utes to end the third quarter. USC started to heat up again as junior safety Calen Bullock intercepted Barnes for a 30-yard touchdown towards the start of the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Utes and Trojans exchanged field goals to make it a 31-26 game. A 65-yard punt return by Branch gave USC new life late in the game, and the Coliseum exploded when Williams ran the ball in for an 11-yard touchdown with 1:46 left that put the Trojans up 32-31.\n\nWilliams finished the game 24 for 34 with 256 passing yards and one touchdown on the ground. USC ran out of gas after that, missing on the 2-point conversion and leaving time on the clock for one last Utah run.\n\nThe Utes marched downfield courtesy of a costly USC penalty and a 26-yard Barnes scramble. Utah junior kicker Cole Becker sealed the deal with a game-winning 38-yard field goal, and the Trojans fell 34-32.\n\nBarnes went 14 for 22 and threw for 235 yards with three TDs and one INT.\n\n\u201cIt kills you to lose a game like this, especially when you fight your tail off and have an epic comeback like we had,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut do you let it defeat you and take you away from the things that you\u2019ve built over time?\u201d\n\nThere were definitely some offensive highlights for USC, who ranked 9th in the nation in total offense before this week. Washington had several stellar receptions, leading the Trojans with 112 receiving yards on five catches. Lloyd was USC\u2019s leading rusher with 86 yards on seven attempts and one touchdown.\n\nBut after two straight losses, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll see the Trojans in the playoffs this year.\n\n\u201cYear two, this is a different step,\u201d Riley commented. \u201cRight? Everybody expects you to be good, everybody expects that you can have a championship caliber team. And when you\u2019re constantly trying to live up to those expectations, you can kind of fall away from what put you there in that position in the first place.\u201d\n\nNext Saturday, the Trojans head upstate to Berkeley to take on the California Golden Bears at 1 p.m.\n```"}

However, Japanese artist Yoshiki, the star of the show, was nowhere to be seen. Conductor Ward Stare began to lead the group in Yoshiki\u2019s \u201cAmethyst,\u201d with all its ethereal melodies. When they finished, the screen played newsreels of recent Yoshiki media coverage. This included his recent honors at the nearby TCL Chinese Theatre, where his handprints, footprints and drumsticks are immortalized alongside a multitude of other stars. He is the first artist from Japan to receive this honor, and is a part of a decades-spanning legacy that he now looks to spread beyond his home country.\n\nDespite being a Hollywood local, Yoshiki\u2019s performance on October 20 at the Dolby Theatre marks his first solo performance in the city. Although he is best known for his heavy rock style and frenetic drumming alongside bands like X Japan and The Last Rockstars, he showed off his classical side at the weekend performance. This is the third stop of his \u201cRequiem\u201d tour, celebrating the 10th anniversary of his album \u201cYoshiki Classical.\u201d\n\nThe screen flashed with the words \u201cYoshiki is here now,\u201d as the elusive musician walked on stage dressed in a sparkling red jacket that draped down to his knees. As Yoshiki took his place at the piano, he flipped his coattail back and brushed his hair aside. He began playing his song, \u201cTears,\u201d a song written for his late father, who died by suicide when Yoshiki was a child.\n\nYoshiki performs alongside singer Beverly in a rendition of X Japan's \"Angel.\" (Photo by Yufei Hong)\n\nThe concert was marked with guest performances with singers Beverly and Ai Ichihara accompanying Yoshiki on vocals for X Japan songs like \u201cAngel\u201d and operatic works like \u201cMiracle.\u201d The concert even featured a crew of ballet dancers from USC\u2019s Glorya Kaufman School of Dance to perform alongside X Japan\u2019s \u201cForever Love\u201d and Yoshiki\u2019s rendition of \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d For an orchestra concert, the performance was unique, to say the least. There were no restrictions on audience photography and videos, and Yoshiki encouraged fans to call out to him and cheer whenever they wanted. There were even moments where he called the audience to sing along and wave the flashlights on their phones for a new unreleased song for X Japan, titled \u201cKiss the Sky.\u201d\n\nYukari Weldi has been a fan of Yoshiki for about 20 years. She says that whenever Yoshiki is in town, she\u2019s there. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the Wiltern, where they played as X Japan a couple of times and the Last Rockstars,\u201d Weldi said. \u201cBecause I live in L.A., so whenever I\u2019ve got the chance, I want to see him.\u201d\n\nEven artists who are inspired by Yoshiki\u2019s work attended the performance, including musician Raven. \u201cI love [X Japan\u2019s] creativeness and I love Yoshiki\u2019s creativeness as well,\u201d said Raven. \u201cVery over-the-top and very creative, talented as well. So, it\u2019s like I respect him as a musician, like everything he does is something I want to do.\u201d\n\nThe word Weldi, Raven and other fans consistently used to describe Yoshiki was \u201ctalented,\u201d and this is reflected in his versatility.\n\nYoshiki picks up the microphone at the end of his song, \"Tears,\" saying \"I tried to live with love...\" (Photo by Yufei Hong)\n\nAs audiences returned from intermission, fans grew excited when the crew wheeled out a clear drum set lined with lights. Some rushed up to the stage to take a picture of the iconic instrument, because they knew that despite this being a classical concert, Yoshiki was going to give them a taste of visual kei. Yoshiki strutted on stage now in a sparkling white jacket, crossing the piano to sit at the drumset. As the orchestra began to play alongside operatic vocals, Yoshiki began to rattle the cymbals. He continued, hitting the drumheads, lost in his own world as the orchestra matched his tempo. He slowed his drumsticks and stood on his chair to catch his breath, signing an \u201cX\u201d with his arms before sitting back down and continuing his solo.\n\nTo Yoshiki, music, and drumming especially, is an expression of his grief and anger. His life is marked with tragedy. Alongside losing his father, he lost X Japan members hide and Taiji, whose deaths were both ruled suicides. More recently, Yoshiki\u2019s mother passed away just a year ago. \u201cSomeday, because we are human, someday, we die... Well, I\u2019m going to give it another 200 years,\u201d Yoshiki joked on stage. \u201cI thought kind of that my mother would be here forever, but I was wrong, but one thing... our love will last forever.\u201d\n\nYoshiki explained that he felt like giving up after losing her, but ended up doing what he does best in channeling these emotions into his music. \u201cThe melody I wrote, eventually started supporting me, helping me,\u201d said Yoshiki. \u201cI think if this melody can help me, this melody may be able to help you as well.\u201d This would become the song \u201cRequiem,\u201d a yet-to-be-released piece dedicated to his mother. When he played those soft melodies, tears streamed down his face, with tones of turmoil and questioning woven into the harmonies. He follows this with \u201cWithout You\u201d in dedication to everyone he lost. While he played, a montage of videos and photos of his childhood and bandmates flashed on screen. The final scene shown is a clip from his recent handprint ceremony, where he said that his mother \u201cwas the very first person to see my hands and feet, and now she can see them from the sky.\u201d\n\nYoshiki takes a deep breath before returning to his playing. (Photo by Yufei Hong)\n\nTo Raven, this ability to turn struggle into symphony is what speaks to him the most about Yoshiki\u2019s music. \u201cMany songs about his past band members, his family... that actually helped me cope with a lot of things through his music,\u201d said Raven. \u201cIt makes me express myself musically.\u201d Fellow musician Rocky echoes this, saying that Yoshiki\u2019s work is a source of motivation. \u201cConfidence, determination, not giving up or saying nothing\u2019s impossible... It\u2019s just like always having to have a strong willpower to continue,\u201d said Rocky.\n\nYoshiki would end the concert with X Japan\u2019s iconic \u201cEndless Rain\u201d in response to the suffering felt by many across the globe. In one moment, the orchestra is stripped away and Yoshiki is left playing on the piano alone. Audience members began singing the words \u201cEndless rain, fall on my heart, \u5fc3\u306e\u50b7\u306b, let me forget all of the hate, all of the sadness.\u201d When he played the final note, the audience roared, giving him a standing ovation. Throughout the entire night, Yoshiki never raised his voice until now, yelling \u201cWe are...\u201d as the audience responded \u201cX!\u201d\n\nYoshiki\u2019s \u201cRequiem\u201d tour will make its final stop in New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall on October 28. He will also perform with The Last Rockstars at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood on November 29.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Creation of the Gods I Official Weibo Account)\n\nBy Elena Wang October 21, 2023 at 12:53 pm PDT\n\nThe first installment of the trilogy, \u201cCreation of the Gods,\u201d directed by Wuershan (known for \u201cPainted Skin: The Resurrection\u201d and \u201cMojin: The Lost Legend\u201d), has come to the United States. This ambitious cinematic endeavor, which spanned nine years and boasted a staggering $400 million investment, first graced Chinese screens on July 20, accumulating domestic box office earnings of approximately $358 million. Now, it\u2019s going to Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland and the U.S.\n\nThe narrative is an adaptation of the classic Chinese novel, \u201cCreation of the Gods,\u201d a magical war epic that chronicles the struggle between humans, immortals and demons \u2014 also known as the Chinese version of \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d In this first installment, the focus lies on Yin Shou, the king of the Shang Dynasty, who joins forces with a fox demon, plunging his kingdom into tyranny and enraging the heavens. Jiang Ziya, an immortal, descends from celestial mountains on a quest to find a rightful owner of the \u201cGods\u2019 Investiture List\u201d and to rescue the beleaguered populace. The main character, Ji Fa, aided by Jiang Ziya, gradually unravels the true nature of the tyrannical king, sparking a rebellion against his rule.\n\nRemarkably, the series cast a host of newcomers in leading roles. According to the documentary \u201cRoad to Creation of the God I,\u201d after a year-long audition process that drew more than 150,000 aspiring actors from across the globe, a select 30 individuals embarked on a rigorous six-month closed training camp. Here, they honed their acting skills and immersed themselves in Chinese history, equestrianism, horseback riding, musical instruments and additional activities of relevant value. Wuershan remarked in the documentary, \u201cOnly those with unwavering determination and a profound love for acting could endure such an intensive training regimen.\u201d\n\nBeyond the actors\u2019 rigorous training, the production boasts world-class artistry. The directing team painstakingly researched and collaborated with hundreds of craftsmen, including heirs of China\u2019s intangible cultural heritage, to craft exquisite character designs, costumes, scenery, props and music. A shining example of this meticulous craftsmanship is Longde Hall, a central setting in the story. Drawing inspiration from Ming and Qing Dynasty architectural styles, it took 800 artisans approximately three months to handcraft every wooden and clay piece, followed by an additional six months to assemble them.\n\nAs James Schamus also noted in the documentary, \u201cIf you go into the Longde Hall, and you see the massiveness, the scale of the palace, but then you get close to the set and you realize that everything has been carved individually and to perfection, [you can see] little stories in every piece of the set, so that the actors are really existing in a fantasy world that is real. That\u2019s what\u2019s astonishing.\u201d\n\nDavid Stratton, former chairman of the Sydney International Film Festival and current film critic for Variety, commented on the movie in the newspaper \u201cThe Australian\u201d as follows: \u201cThe combination of expertly staged action scenes, including some superb equestrian stunts, and the impressive visual effects proves to be most satisfying. The acting is robust, the photography (by Wang Yu) is first class and the film should prove to be a rewarding entertainment for audiences who enjoy this kind of super-production -- if they can adjust to the fact the dialogue is in Mandarin. The subtitles are fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms\u201d made its U.S. debut on September 21, promising audiences an unforgettable journey into the realms of ancient Chinese mythology and fantasy.\n```"}

(Photo by Nya Manneh)\n\nBy Nya Manneh\nOctober 21, 2023 at 12:25 pm PDT\n\nManagement companies up and down the Sunset Strip have gone quiet as the SAG-AFTRA strike continues into its fourth month. For only the second time in U.S. history, both SAG-AFTRA and the WGA striked at the same time, leaving agencies, management companies, costume designers and caterers in Hollywood without work. Though the writers\u2019 strike has since concluded, the industry is still in flux.\n\nWhile media outlets were quick to jump on coverage of what actors and writers were doing while they were out of work, many were left wondering who else might have been affected by these recent strikes, and in what ways. What of the agencies, management companies, costume designers, caterers and more that also lost much of their livelihoods as a result of these negotiations?\n\nAssistants and managers at MGMT Entertainment described how the once bustling office sometimes looks like a ghost town on certain days of the week, as employees cope with working from home, reduced hours and pay and a complete hold on activity for their clients.\n\nValentina Velazquez, assistant to MGMT senior manager Courtney Kivowitz, found similarities between the strike and the effects of COVID-19. \u201cWith the cut days and cut hours, with everybody working from home, whatever culture was there has severely decreased,\u201d Velaquez said. \u201cWe still have our Thursday team lunches, and if a bunch of managers have meetings they\u2019ll still come in. Like the other day, all the partners were in for the first time, so it was a little higher in energy for better or for worse, but for the most part, it\u2019s a lot more quiet. It\u2019s a lot less busy just in terms of bodies in the office space and in workload.\u201d\n\nLack of work for their clients and a very strict code of what actors and writers are able to do without violating the strike left management companies with few opportunities to generate business for those they represented.\n\nLeo Driessen, a former assistant to lead talent manager at MGMT Adam Isaacs, discussed how not only were projects in development immediately halted, but no new auditions or gigs could be pitched to their clients. \u201cI can\u2019t do any of their scheduling because they can\u2019t do press, so no press, no acting. They can still meet with their managers and do independent gigs \u2013 like a lot of them are going into podcasting or other things \u2013 but most productions that are SAG-affiliated,\u201d Driessen said. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to do much for them, which is not great, because the worst thing you want to be as a manager is ineffective.\u201d\n\nAs a result of a halt in projects for their clients, management companies have experienced a massive loss in revenue that is suspected to impact the industry for years after the strike ends. Like many agencies and management companies, MGMT makes commissions from clients that help fund the company. However, many projects take years to complete, meaning that revenue from those projects may not be seen until years later. It also means that as a result, MGMT might be dealing with a loss of revenue years later, due to projects that were halted during the negotiations.\n\nMark Morikawa, a talent manager at MGMT Entertainment, discussed the efforts that MGMT has made to reduce layoffs in their company as much as possible, but it meant that many assistants experienced pay reductions and reduced hours. \u201cLittle things like our parking passes have gone away, we\u2019re parking on the street so we\u2019re not paying for parking passes as well,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cOur expense accounts have been shut down, so we\u2019re not going to lunches, drinks, dinners, we\u2019re not taking clients out to things like this. We\u2019re not necessarily going to film festivals and premiers with clients that we would usually expense to attend with them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to management companies, production companies have also been affected. Irelyn Wesley, a senior film and TV production major at USC, interns at Productivity Media, a financing and producing company. She has had to work in this role remotely as a result of negotiations and hasn\u2019t been able to step foot in her company office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m currently not working in the industry now besides freelance shoots that I conduct myself, so as of now it only affects my experience with my internship and not being able to attend anything in person,\u201d Wesley said.\n\nSimilarly, Kiana Ong, a junior majoring in public relations, experienced a shift in her internship experience, as well. Ong interns for MPRM Communications, an entertainment PR firm, where she noticed how a lack of in-person time at the office leaves her without a lot of informative experience that she hoped to gain from her internship.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how office life was before the strike happened, but I was informed before my interview that there might not be as many in-person event opportunities for me to go to because of the strike, so premiers, red carpets, or awards shows, or any press for TV or film,\u201d Ong said.\n\nThe ripple effect doesn\u2019t stop there. Loss in production has hurt many businesses that supply certain products for films and TV. Morikawa also noted just how far the effects of the strike fell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the below-the-line folks, as well. It\u2019s craft services, it\u2019s hair and makeup, it\u2019s stylists. You hear of publicity companies who are not allowed to promote their clients\u2019 films, they\u2019re on retainers. Clients pay them fees on a monthly basis, so if they\u2019re not on for 5 months, that\u2019s five months that they\u2019re not able to make money,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cI know during a lot of the SAG strike, a lot of the publicists were meeting with SAG about \u2018what can we promote? What can we not promote? What can we speak to? Can they have a magazine cover if they don\u2019t speak about films? Can they just speak about their career as a whole?\u2019 so in the publicity piece, they have been very much affected by it,\u201d he added\n\nThe end of the writers\u2019 strike two weeks ago may have signaled a revival in some industry work, but the struggles that these industries face is far from over. Though the writers may be starting work again, many of these businesses won\u2019t be able to see much revenue \u2013 at least not until SAG-AFTRA\u2019s terms get accepted.\n\nJustin Horowitz, assistant to manager Cora Olson, explained that one strike cannot end without the other, as no projects can begin again until both guilds are able to collaborate together \u201cIf we just resolved the writer\u2019s strike, there would be some money that comes in for writing stuff, but not in large amounts because there are no actors attached, so there\u2019s no real monetary value there yet,\u201d Horowitz said.\n\nEven then, managers and assistants alike understand that even with both strikes eventually being settled, strike negotiations of the terms of the agreement will likely span another few months.

{"key": "/2023/10/21/mls-cup-playoffs-and-decision-day-preview-is-this-the-year-for-another-first-time-winner/", "response": "```\nThe most exciting day (or for some fans, daunting) of the MLS regular season is officially here. Decision Day takes place Saturday and features 14 matches to determine the five remaining open playoff spots, with three open in the Western Conference and two open in the Eastern Conference. This year, the MLS Cup Playoffs are completely different. In each conference, the eighth and ninth-place finishers will play a wild card game to determine who makes the playoffs and faces the #1 seed. The first round is the other notable change in the MLS Cup Playoffs as it will now be a best-of-three series. The remaining series of games will be win-or-go-home, just like they were in the past.\n\nDecision Day Madness\nEnough of the formatting talk, let\u2019s get down to the details of Decision Day. The Eastern Conference is simple, with only the two wild card spots left for the taking between five teams. CF Montreal has the best chance to make the wild card game at 82 percent, according to Sports Club Stats. The first tiebreaker would be wins, and Montreal has 12 compared to the rest of the field\u2019s 10, meaning they should have a very solid chance even if they lose to the Columbus Crew on Saturday. Charlotte FC had the second-best chance of making it through in the east, but they drew 2-2 to Inter Miami on Wednesday, dropping their playoff chances from 58 percent to 50 percent. They\u2019ll rematch Miami at home Saturday, but would need to win \u2014 and the New York Red Bulls to lose, as well as the Chicago Fire to draw or lose \u2014 making matters even more complicated. New York City FC has the worst odds of making the playoffs due to being two points behind three remaining teams and three behind Montreal. They need to win against Chicago and for New York and Charlotte lose.\n\nIn the Western Conference, five teams are still alive and fighting for three available spots. The Portland Timbers are currently in the driver\u2019s seat with a 85 percent chance to advance. They currently hold the seventh seed, and the only automatic playoff berth in the Western Conference. FC Dallas and San Jose Earthquakes currently hold the eighth and ninth spots, respectively, and are tied with Portland on points, but they both have one less win than the Timbers. Sporting Kansas City and Minnesota United are still alive, but are both two points behind Portland, Dallas and San Jose. Kansas City and Minnesota will play each other on Saturday, which would make for the juiciest Decision Day game on the schedule if Dallas and San Jose were to falter.\n\nPlayoffs\nThis year, the MLS Cup Playoffs feature an abundance of great storylines at the top of the table. Two of the top teams, St. Louis CITY SC and FC Cincinnati, are the leaders at the top of their respective conferences, and are looking for their first MLS Cup as recently-founded clubs. St. Louis is currently having the most successful first season in MLS expansion franchise history. The city is known for having a rich soccer history, but no one would have imagined this dream start for the club. They\u2019re the best team in the Western Conference, and did that through clever signings. The club didn\u2019t go after any big-name players to fill their designated player spots, with their biggest DP signing an unconventional one in Switzerland and former Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman B\u00fcrki. They signed players who they knew would produce for the team, such as Brazilian forward Jo\u00e3o Klauss and American forward Nicholas Gioacchini.\n\nFC Cincinnati were historically awful in their first three seasons starting up in 2019. They were consistently bottom of the table but that changed last year after they made the playoffs. After making the playoffs for the first time last year, Cincinnati won their first-ever trophy in the Supporter\u2019s Shield for having the most points in the regular season. They\u2019re led by their dynamite attacking midfielder Lucho Acosta who\u2019s second in the MLS in goals (16) and assists (10). Those numbers, paired with being the best player on the best team in the league, should make him the runaway favorite for the Landon Donovan MVP award.\n\nOrlando City and Philadelphia Union finished right behind Cincinnati and are also looking for their first-ever MLS Cup titles. Philadelphia are looking for revenge after falling short in the MLS Cup Final in a 3-3 game that they lost in penalties to LAFC. Speaking of LAFC, they\u2019re looking to be the first back-to-back MLS Cup champions since their cross-town rivals LA Galaxy did it back in 2011 and 2012. They\u2019re spearheaded in attack by Dennis Bouanga, who currently leads the MLS Golden Boot race, and former MVP Carlos Vela. It\u2019s only a matter of time to see which storyline will prevail. Will St. Louis win it all in their inaugural season? Will Cincinnati win after having one of the worst starts to an expansion team ever? Or will LAFC go back-to-back? Time will only tell which team will finish their storybook ending as the MLS Playoffs begin on Wednesday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/21/usc-womens-volleyball-pulls-out-win-against-washington/", "response": "```\nUSC women\u2019s volleyball fought their way to a hard-earned victory over Washington State Friday night at the Galen Center. Following a somewhat disappointing series of matches on the road, the Trojans were able to pull themselves back from a 2-0 deficit to triumph over No. 4 Washington State (25-17, 25-14, 22-25, 23-25, 8-15). The Trojan attack was effective with senior outside hitter Skylar Fields earning 21 of USC\u2019s 64 kills throughout the game. However, the Trojans\u2019 defense, or lack thereof, is where the spotlight shone early in this match. While not an unseemly performance against a top ranked team, the Cougars were able to exploit holes in USC\u2019s defense and come away from the first two sets on top.\n\nAfter the match, USC head coach Brad Keller expressed his pride in his team\u2019s resilience and toughness. \u201cI want to make sure my team and everyone out there knows that the last couple weeks have not been good enough,\u201d Keller said. \u201cOur focus needs to be on getting [our players] to be all-around players and to help in various ways. So I want to make sure we understand that, and that we\u2019re not even close to where we need to be.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans struggled in the second set to create offensive chances, hitting just .037 and lacking an energetic response to the challenges Washington State posed. Coming into the third set, the Trojans came alive. For the first time since the match started, the team seemed to have found their fire. Sophomore middle blocker Rylie McGinest came in and immediately made an impact, notching six of her twelve kills and ending the match with an incredible .706 hitting percentage. Another important change made to the Trojan lineup occurred in the third set, when graduate libero Ellie Snook took over the libero role from sophomore Gala Trubint. Within three sets, Snook recorded a whopping 14 digs, second on the team only to Fields\u2019 15.\n\nThe final member of Friday night\u2019s star trio? Sophomore libero Ellie Geoghehan. With two aces and eight digs, she entered the Trojan defense with the confidence to turn the match around. She provided vital service to her teammates and helped them win their final three sets. \u201cHuge shoutout to Ellie G, Rylie McGinest and then Snook,\u201d junior setter Mia Tuaniga said. \u201cThey played a huge role for us those last few sets.\u201d\n\nThe fourth set felt like USC was bouncing back, albeit slowly. With 16 kills and a hit percentage of .389, the Trojans were able to fight their way back into the match, following it up with a decisive victory in the fifth set. With them all the way was the crowd, who pumped the team up and cheered them on in the tensest of moments. Keller also had a few words to say about his key players. \u201cSnook stepping into the libero spot was really calm, cool, and collected. I thought Ellie Geoghehan did an amazing job, she made play after play after play. Rylie McGinest was virtually unstoppable,\u201d Keller said.\n\nFriday night was Kids Club Night at the Galen Center, and the energy in the stands was palpable. Filled with children bursting at the seams to meet their favorite players, and not a play went by without excited screams or enthusiastic boos and jeers. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see Galen starting to fill up,\u201d Fields said. \u201cWe wanted to put on a show for everyone in the Galen Center, so I\u2019m glad we were about to do that with all of those kids there.\u201d\n\nDespite a challenging few weeks on the road, this team has continued to rely on each other. \u201cYou make a mistake, you go to the person right next to you, you look them in the eye, and you say \u2018alright, I\u2019m with you and you\u2019re with me,\u2019\u201d Tuaniga said. Keller made sure to emphasize his role in this season\u2019s turbulence. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done a good enough job to lead this group, and so this week was a massive focus on those types of things,\u201d Keller said. He and his players, through it all, emphasize supporting one another and staying focused on the road ahead as they continue to work and improve.\n\nThe Trojans will take on the University of Washington at the Galen Center on Sunday at 2 p.m. and hope to see good turnout for what is expected to be a challenging match. \u201cWe\u2019ll be prepared and not be taking this one lightly,\u201d Keller said.\n```"}

(Photo by Aditya Thiyag)\n\nBy Aditya Thiyag and Malcolm Caminero\nOctober 21, 2023 at 11:16 am PDT\n\nOn Thursday, September 28, the University of Southern California Center for the Political Future hosted an open panel Q&A with Forward Party founder Andrew Yang at Taper Hall. The event was open to all students and was hosted in conjunction with BridgeUSA, a national organization dedicated to bringing politicians to high schools and colleges to generate dialogue.\n\nUSC Political Union President Eli Scott stated that Yang\u2019s decision to speak to students gave the campus organization a lot of momentum. \u201cA lot of our members have looked up to Andrew Yang, both members of the right and the left,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAndrew Yang tends to situate somewhere in the middle, not as a centrist, but as someone who bridges a gap. The Forward Party has been something we\u2019ve looked up to for a while in terms of bridging a divide.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief Q&A with a moderator, the event was opened up to all students to ask questions. Yang began discussing how partisan politics prevent change from being made in American democracy by noting the disparity between government approval and reelection rates. \u201cWhat is the approval rating of Congress right now?\u201d Yang asked. \u201cIt\u2019s around 20%. What is the reelection rate for those in Congress? 95%.\u201d\n\nYang began discussing The Forward Party, a political party he founded to give voters another voting option while challenging the two-party system in place. He then proposed an alternative voting system to increase voter count in America. \u201cRight now, voters are getting bullied into voting for the \u2018acceptable\u2019 candidate instead of who we actually like,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIf you have a ranking system with alternative voting choices beyond the confines of the two-party system, I think it will actually increase public trust.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his dissatisfaction with the partisan politics at play, Yang also talked about how the current capitalist system in play was unsustainable. He then proposed a system that he called \u201chuman-centric capitalism\u201d, where the economy would revolve around the well-being of people. \u201cOne of the most dangerous things about right now is that the economy can do well while people are doing worse and worse, which is exactly what\u2019s happening in American life,\u201d Yang said. \u201cInstead, I want to measure how your economy is doing based on how people are doing. And then if I do something that makes you happier, healthier and it gets rewarded.\u201d\n\nTo sustain this system, Yang proposed the funding of alternative currencies that would reward people based on several factors. This philosophy\u2019s core tenant revolved around having currencies be equivalent to the work people in order to eliminate income inequality. \u201cWhenever I look around, I see live music bands that are not being paid jack shit, but they make people happy,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThese new currencies would recognize and reward people who do positive things for the community. So you could basically give people special credits based on their art that could be used for something like a meal out.\u201d\n\nYang closed out the event by talking about how economic and social progress would only be made by revamping the political system and how he wanted his Forward Party to be a vessel for that change, with the Party\u2019s founding values being centered around diverse thinking, collaborative solutions, and grassroots initiatives. He also continued to express support for Universal Basic Income as a tool for poverty alleviation and chastised the current state of American politics for being ineffective. \u201cLet\u2019s cure the political system and then we can fight out specifics,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThe current system is a waste of time for everybody. Only if we merge the two sides of our nation can we make decisions about how we let the political system work for us.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/20/saturday-eve-week-8/", "response": "```\nIt\u2019s that time of the week again, football fans. Whether you\u2019re in the thick of midterm season, behind on sleep from your fall break travels or just craving some top-tier college football action, I\u2019m happy to report that this Saturday just might boast the best slate so far this season. But first, let\u2019s take a look back at last week\u2019s games. Last week\u2019s game of the week was a thriller with then-No. 7 Washington defeating then-No. 8 Oregon in a matchup that came down to the final whistle. The lead changed hands six times, but the Huskies held the advantage for about half of the second quarter and all of the third, entering the final period up 29-26. With 12:58 left in the fourth, Oregon sophomore running back Jordan James scored on a 10-yard run to give the Ducks a 33-29 lead. But Washington quarterback and Heisman hopeful Michael Penix Jr. responded. Taking advantage of strong field position after a turnover on downs, Penix dropped a beautiful pass into the arms of Ja\u2019Lynn Polk in double coverage for 35 yards, which he followed up with an 18-yard end zone strike to Rome Odunze to take the lead 36-33. Oregon quarterback Bo Nix mounted a strong comeback on the ensuing drive, completing six consecutive passes to bring the Ducks all the way to the 25-yard-line as the clock neared zero, but kicker Camden Lewis shanked a potential game-winning 43-yard field goal to give Penix and the Huskies their first ranked win of the season. Washington climbed to No. 5 in the AP Poll with the victory, cementing themselves as a true playoff contender \u2014 and with no more top-10 teams remaining on their schedule, an undefeated season (and, thus, a strong playoff seed) doesn\u2019t seem like a stretch if the Huskies continue to play as effectively as they did last week. I\u2019m officially back to .500 for upset predictions on the year after picking Arizona to defeat then-No. 19 Washington State on the Cougars\u2019 home turf. After nearly knocking off Washington three weeks ago, and then coming to L.A. and taking the Trojans to overtime the week after, I just knew Arizona was too hungry to let their third consecutive shot at a ranked upset pass them by. In the end, we got a game that wasn\u2019t even close, with Wazzu scoring on their opening drive and proceeding to give up 44 unanswered points for a final score of 44-6. The Wildcats\u2019 freshman quarterback, Noah Fifita, continued to impress, completing 34 of 43 passes for 342 yards in the contest. But the true playmaker of this game was sophomore running back Jonah Coleman, who took 11 carries for 70 yards and three touchdowns, in addition to four receptions for 98 yards. Arizona used Coleman all over the field, with the highlight of his outing being the shallow drag route he took for 69 yards on the Wildcats\u2019 opening drive to set up for a 1-yard touchdown rush the next play. Wazzu found themselves bounced from the AP Poll after taking a second consecutive Pac-12 loss, while Arizona remained unranked, but climbed above .500 for the first time since September. As I said, this week\u2019s slate has plenty to offer. So buckle up and get ready for a great weekend of football. Happy Saturday eve. GAME OF THE WEEK \u2014 No. 3 Ohio State (6-0) vs. No. 7 Penn State (6-0) Columbus, Ohio 9:00 a.m. PDT on FOX Eight undefeated Power 5 teams remain as we enter Week 8 of the college football season. On Saturday, two of them will face off in what will be arguably the most exciting matchup we\u2019ve seen so far this year. With such a wide field of undefeated squads (some of whom won\u2019t face real competition again until their conference championships), whoever loses this weekend in Columbus is almost certain to be waving their playoff hopes goodbye \u2014 while whoever wins will have an extremely strong argument as the most proven playoff contender in football. This one will be a true defensive showdown, as both teams rank top-10 in FBS total defense. Penn State is currently the best statistical defense in football, the only team in FBS allowing less than 200 yards per game (193.7) and less than four yards per play (3.42). This unit is good at everything they do. The team ranks second in rushing defense, allowing a mere 72.5 yards per game on the ground. And they rank first in pass defense, giving up just 121.2 yards per game through the air \u2014 more than 20 yards per game better than the second-best team. This is probably due in part to the team\u2019s 27 total sacks, the second-most of any FBS team. Four different Penn State linemen have tallied at least two sacks and nine total tackles, led by senior edge rusher Adisa Isaac, who has five sacks and eight solo stops through six games. Don\u2019t count out the Buckeyes though \u2014 while their stats are slightly less impressive (seventh in total defense with 263.5 yards allowed per game, and second in yards per play at 4.00), they\u2019ve faced better competition, notably the win they notched in September over then-No. 9 Notre Dame. And I don\u2019t have to tell anyone who saw what the Fighting Irish did to USC last weekend that Notre Dame is no joke. This game will ultimately come down to what offense shows up more ready to compete. Questions have been raised about both units\u2019 legitimacy, as with only one ranked matchup on each team\u2019s resum\u00e9, it\u2019s hard to tell how much of their success has stemmed from mismatches. Ohio State has, for the most part, looked efficient and effective on offense. Quarterback Kyle McCord has thrown for 1,651 yards on a respectable 64.1 percent completion with 11 touchdowns and only one interception. Junior wide receiver and projected top NFL Draft pick Marvin Harrison Jr. leads the team and the Big Ten with 604 receiving yards and five touchdowns, and senior tight end Cade Stover\u2019s 359 receiving yards rank third amongst FBS tight ends. But the Buckeyes have only played one top-25 defense (Notre Dame), and their playmakers struggled \u2014 McCord only completed 56.8 percent of his passes and failed to find the end zone, while Harrison found himself restricted to only three catches for a mere 32 yards. The Buckeyes could be in for a long day against Penn State, especially if their injury woes continue. Ohio State\u2019s feature running back, junior Treveyon Henderson, hasn\u2019t played since September with an \u201cundisclosed injury,\u201d and No. 2 receiver Emeka Egbuka is questionable to play Saturday after sitting out last week\u2019s game with a lower-body injury sustained in Week 6 against Maryland. Penn State\u2019s offensive statistics tell a similar story: a skilled unit with little experience against top defenses. Sophomore quarterback Drew Allar has thrown for 1,254 yards on 65.2 percent completion with 12 touchdowns and no interceptions. Their rush attack boasts a strong 1-2 punch with sophomore running backs Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton, who have combined for 737 yards and nine touchdowns on the ground in six games. But the Nittany Lions are even less battle-tested than the Buckeyes \u2014 they have yet to face a top-25 defense, and their strongest defensive opponent, Iowa, has still allowed an average of 325.6 yards this season. Both of these teams will come out firing, but who ends up victorious will hinge on which offense takes a step forward and plays at the elite level necessary to defeat a top-10 defense. It\u2019s pretty hard to make a strong prediction for a matchup between such powerhouse teams, but my gut is with Penn State on this one. The nation\u2019s top defense could prove too much for a Buckeye squad that barely squeaked by Notre Dame (arguably only because the Fighting Irish had 10 defenders on the field for the game\u2019s final play). UPSET ALERT \u2014 No. 11 Alabama (6-1) vs. No. 17 Tennessee (5-1) Tuscaloosa, Ala. 12:30 p.m. PDT on CBS Is it time for the Crimson Tide to fall again? In two consecutive weeks, Alabama has nearly lost to unranked SEC teams in close games defined by sloppy play, taken advantage of by eager underdog teams. Most recently against Arkansas, \u2018Bama punted on four of their five second-half drives, allowing the Razorbacks to climb back from a 21-6 halftime deficit to trail 24-21 in the fourth quarter. The Gamecocks\u2019 final drive ended just a few first downs outside of field goal range, and just a few more big plays for the Razorbacks could have made the look of this column much, much different. Alabama has had four concerningly close games with (now) unranked teams in the last five weeks. A disaster of a game against South Florida saw the Crimson Tide fail to score a single touchdown in the first half. The Tide hosted then-No. 17 Ole Miss a week later, and did the same thing. Follow that up with a weak 26-20 victory over unranked Texas A&M a few weeks later, and then the Arkansas game, and \u2018Bama isn\u2019t looking so hot. When I see a pattern like this \u2014 a series of close wins against undermatched teams leading up to a marquee matchup \u2014 all of the upset alarms start going off in my head. Tennessee has won two of its last three games by 21 or more, and has less to lose than Alabama given their lower position in the poll due to losing to unranked Florida. Alabama and Tennessee\u2019s defenses are evenly matched, ranked 15 and 17 respectively. But Alabama\u2019s 86th-ranked offense could struggle to outpace a Vols offense that ranks sixth in the FBS in rushing yards per game. The running back trio of junior Jaylen Wright, senior Jabari Small and sophomore Dylan Sampson have a combined 1,203 yards and nine touchdowns, with all three boasting at least one 90+ yard game (Wright leads with four). And we can\u2019t forget to add on quarterback Joe Milton III\u2019s 173 yards and four touchdowns on the ground. Alabama certainly has the capacity to win this game, but doing so will require playing at a significantly higher level than they\u2019ve shown in their last few outings. If they don\u2019t, Tennessee will be ready to take advantage. ON THE RISE No. 6 Oklahoma (6-0) vs. Central Florida, 9:00 a.m. PDT on ABC In my personal opinion, OU ranked at No. 6 is a travesty. They were essentially punished for their bye in this week\u2019s AP Poll, bumped from their No. 5 spot by Washington. I would say the Sooners\u2019 win over then-No. 3 Texas \u2014 the team that knocked off Alabama \u2014 is more impressive than the Huskies beating Oregon, a team whose strongest win came against a fraudulent Colorado team that has since exited the poll and lost PAC-12 relevancy, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. It\u2019s important to remember that the AP Poll doesn\u2019t really matter once CFP rankings commence in about a week and a half. The Sooners should handle 3-3 Central Florida at home in senior quarterback Dillon Gabriel\u2019s first matchup with his former school. With no ranked opponents on the rest of their schedule, they could continue to climb into a playoff spot if they avoid sloppy play. If Oklahoma can defeat UCF this weekend and Kansas next Saturday, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they fare at 8-0 in the initial CFP rankings, especially considering either Ohio State or Penn State will no longer be undefeated. No. 23 Tulane vs. North Texas, 12:30 p.m. on ESPN2 After losing their second game of the season to No. 13 Ole Miss, Tulane has won their last four games, and don\u2019t show any signs of stopping. They had a close one against Memphis last week, but took control down 21-17 to start the fourth quarter with two unanswered touchdowns for a 31-21 victory. Against a North Texas defense ranked bottom-five in all of FBS, I have no doubt the Green Wave will continue to climb the rankings in next week\u2019s AP Poll. Besides next week\u2019s road matchup with a sneaky-good Rice team (more on that in next week\u2019s column), their schedule contains very little challenge to close out the year, so it\u2019s pretty realistic that Tulane could win out and find themselves slotted for a major bowl game come December. SOMETHING TO PROVE No. 18 USC (6-1) vs. No. 14 Utah, 5:00 p.m. PDT on FOX If you\u2019re still (somehow) a faithful Lincoln Riley, Alex Grinch, modern-era USC football fan, I advise you to skip this last part of my column and go on with your evening. It\u2019s about to get ugly. What in the world is going on with Southern Cal football? Watching the Trojans over the past two weeks has been downright embarrassing \u2014 as if nearly being upset by an unranked Arizona in their first evening game of the year wasn\u2019t enough, they then went to South Bend and got absolutely handled by Notre Dame for all 60 minutes of a game that can only be described as dysfunctional. Shockingly, the Trojans\u2019 notoriously awful defense had a decent night, allowing only 251 yards to a Fighting Irish offense that has averaged 414.5 yards per game this season. This time, the offense was the problem, consistently struggling to produce in all phases, all night long. For a school with a $110 Million dollar head coach, USC runs plays and blocking schemes back to back far too often \u2014 can someone tell Lincoln Riley this isn\u2019t Madden, and you can\u2019t just spam the same zone concept because you have a good running back? Notre Dame only scored four offensive touchdowns \u2014 three of which came after interceptions thrown by Caleb Williams. USC\u2019s supposedly generational quarterback finished the night 23 of 37 for 199 yards, a touchdown and three interceptions, turning the ball over four times before finding the end zone, and effectively destroying his Heisman campaign. According to USA Today, Williams went from holding the second-highest odds for the award last week to leaving the top five completely after last weekend\u2019s meltdown. And what was Williams\u2019 response? Did wonder boy own up to his horrible play, or make a Tebow-like promise to turn the season around? Not exactly. He felt it was important to tell reporters how \u201ceverybody wants to be in these two 12-and-a-half shoes.\u201d I don\u2019t speak for anyone else, but I can\u2019t say I would have enjoyed spending this week as Caleb Williams, roaming campus at USC after playing the biggest game of the year like a trigger-happy seventh-grader plays Retro Bowl. Catch me in the back of class with a hoodie and an N-95. Regardless, No.14 Utah is back in the Coliseum this weekend after handing the Trojans two disappointing losses last season. It\u2019s still unclear if their star quarterback Cam Rising will make his season debut after sitting out the Utes\u2019 first six games from a knee injury sustained in last year\u2019s Rose Bowl game. If he does, I fear the worst for the Trojans. But with Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham telling the media this week that Rising could return next year on a medical redshirt if he sat out the rest of the season, and no update from Utah on his status as of Friday afternoon, it doesn\u2019t seem likely. Without Rising, Utah is a bottom-25 ranked offense, averaging 322.2 yards per game and scoring only 14 offensive touchdowns all season. But even without Rising, Utah still boasts a top-10 defense, allowing opponents to average only 277.8 yards per game and giving up only nine touchdowns all year. And don\u2019t worry about a weak PAC-12 schedule with that statistic \u2014 Utah boasts a ranked win over No. 25 UCLA and out-of-conference victories on Florida and Baylor. This is a must-win game for the Trojans \u2014 for Williams to show he\u2019s not all hype, for Riley to demonstrate his hiring wasn\u2019t a mistake and for the defense to prove last week\u2019s improvements weren\u2019t a fluke.\n```"}

This event rounded out USC\u2019s \u201cSex Week,\u201d a week where student and university-affiliated organizations promote safe sex education and practices through a range of interactive events.\n\nThe idea behind an event, such as \u201cSex in the Dark,\u201d is in part that sex often happens in the dark and the organizers wanted to simulate that sexy, risqu\u00e9 ambience. Simultaneously this event was meant to create a comfortable and welcoming space for students to discuss sexual health and well being, which can be an intimidating topic of conversation for many, according to Guru Shabd Khalsa, one of the event panelists. \u201c[The] darkness can allow people to be less wary of how other people are perceiving them and [feel open to asking] questions,\u201d Khalsa said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the fluorescence and the glow in the dark [paraphernalia]... to hopefully make [these conversations] accessible and a little bit less scary.\u201d\n\nAs one of the event panelists, Khalsa was there to provide students educated answers to questions they had about sex and their sexualities, which were submitted anonymously to the panelists prior to the event. \u201cWe made sure people could respond anonymously if they don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking up in a group of people that they don\u2019t know or even... that they do know,\u201d said Khalsa. Khalsa also works as a clinician at CMH, the counseling and mental health center at USC, and is a licensed marriage and family therapist. Khalsa said she is dedicated to \u201c[supporting] students and [helping] them figure out the ways that they want to live in a healthy, positive... way\u201d.\n\nDuring the panel, Khalsa was joined by two other \u201csexperts\u201d: Erin Tillman, certified intimacy coordinator and sex educator; and Leroy Mitchell, a violence prevention educator at USC. In response to student questions, the panelists explored the importance of communication during sex or sexual interactions. \u201cOne of the challenges of relationships, dating, and sex is that everybody communicates differently,\u201d Khalsa said. \u201cHookup culture is very common on college campuses. Hookups don\u2019t allow for people to get to know one another, communication is limited.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith new partners, the goal is to be able to communicate,\u201d said Tillman. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get to know your partners because expression of enthusiasm [for sex] varies from person to person.\u201d This communication creates a safe and consenting atmosphere for sex, according to Tillman. A lot of people are scared to ask questions for fear of \u201ckilling the vibe,\u201d but \u201ccommunication helps people be present before and during sex, which is important,\u201d said Mitchell. Having these conversations allows your partner to know what you like and don\u2019t like and \u201csomeone respecting [your boundaries], that\u2019s hot.\u201d\n\nThese \u201csexperts\u201d also discussed the stigmas and expectations surrounding sex. \u201cSex can be whatever you want it to be, you can make it whatever you want,\u201d said Tillman. The aim of the panel conversation was to \u201c[expand] the umbrella of sex positivity,... where we\u2019re talking about things such as consent, boundaries, what sex looks like for different genders, what sex looks like for different people in and out of relationships,\u201d said Devin Alaya, student health coordinator for USC Student Health. Alaya\u2019s colleague, Sophia Dettweiler, student ambassador for USC Student Health, said the panelists talked about a lot of issues that are common concerns which students generally avoid talking about, so \u201cthis [event] was a great chance to just be totally open, nothing is off limits here.\u201d\n\nDettweiler said she\u2019s glad that USC Student Health was able to host an event that provided \u201can inclusive space, where we\u2019re not judging each other, we\u2019re just all learning together and learning from each other.\u201d Prior to the panel, the student organizers held a raffle, prizes for which consisted of vibrators, bondage sets, bottles of lube, a couple whips, and even some sex education novels written by Tillman. The raffle was yet another activity student organizers hoped would get students excited to learn about their sexuality and sex education.\n\n\u201cI ended up picking a hot pink vibrator, just to try it out,\u201d said Lexi Rosser, raffle winner and journalism student at USC. Free paraphernalia scattered throughout the audience during the \u201cSex in the Dark\u201d event at Tommy\u2019s Place on USC\u2019s campus, in Los Angeles, Calif., Oct. 19, 2023.\n\nTo cap the evening, USC student drag performers came out and did a show for the students. The performers received big cheers and applause from the audience, most notably the last performer of the night, Saneel Sharma, well-known by her drag name, Rae Oblivion. Sharma danced to a mix of the songs \u201cTreat Me Like A Slut\u201d and \u201cXXX\u201d by Kim Petras, bringing both a powerful energy and raw sexual magnetism onto the stage.\n\n\u201cI [wanted to do] a sexual number that allows a person of color, who is also trans, to represent and also embrace their body, sexually,\u201d Rae Oblivion said. Saneel Sharma, 20, USC student and drag performer who goes by the name Rae Oblivion is seen here on stage performing her dance number at Tommy\u2019s Place on USC\u2019s campus in Los Angeles, Calif., Oct. 19, 2023. Sharma said she started dressing up in drag during high school, just in her bedroom, and now she participates in major competitions and occasionally performs at USC.\n\nUSC\u2019s 14th annual drag show is coming up on Feb. 4th, 2024 and, as the executive producer of the event, Sharma said \u201cit\u2019s definitely going to be the biggest show ever, with bigger production, bigger looks.\u201d Generally speaking, drag queens are known to simultaneously uplift and entertain the queer community. At an event like \u201cSex in the Dark\u201d that focuses on serious topics such as sexual health, drag performances show people how they can have fun with their bodies and sexuality and that, while safety is important, that\u2019s only one aspect of a person\u2019s sexuality, according to Sharma.\n\n\u201cHaving a drag show at a very sex positive event, reminds people just to have fun and embrace sex,\u201d said Sharma. Many students who attended the event, like Rosser, were originally drawn in by the drag show. Yet, Rosser said she appreciated the entirety of the event, since it provided her and her friends a place to start conversations about sex in an exciting and entertaining way.\n\n\u201cI hope that [this event] invites people to continue the conversation and to not be shy out around campus,\u201d said Rosser.\n```"}

Then you\u2019ve seen an excellent trailer. British teenager Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield) knows nothing in practice, but everything in theory about sexual health and relationships \u2013 courtesy of his mother, sex therapist Jean Milburn (Gillian Anderson). After passing the parental teachings onto his classmates at Moordale Secondary High School for three seasons, Otis\u2019 last deep-dive into sex and identity takes place at a new venue: Cavendish College.\n\nThe ambience permeating the ultra-progressive school that Otis attends in the shows\u2019 final season, describes the atmosphere found at USC\u2019s Sexploration Tent in all the right ways. The Sexploration Tent is one among several initiatives that took place in celebration of USC\u2019s Sex Week, which began on October 14 and runs through the 21st. The atmosphere inside the tent promoted sex with a healthy dose of respect, humor, empathy and facts \u2014 demonstrating that Sex Education\u2019s approach to personal and sexual development can exist offscreen, too.\n\nHosted by the USC Student Health, Undergraduate Student Government (USG), Graduate Student Government (GSG), Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment (SAGE) and Women and Youth Supporting Each Other (WYSE), the initiative Sex Week at USC is in its second consecutive year and provides USC students with a series of spaces and events to explore sexual health and empowerment.\n\nJudging by the constant crowds hanging around the Sexploration Tent and the international success of Netflix\u2019s Sex Education, young people seem to long for safe spaces where they are encouraged to understand and celebrate all facets of sexuality. Offering USC students informal access to resources about dating, sex and disability, dealing with STDs, sex and religion, trans and asexuality, and consent shows them the importance of sexual identity, education, and health as cornerstones of socio-emotional health.\n\nHearing sexpert Erin Tillman and violence prevention specialist Derek Wu discuss \u201chow to tell someone that you don\u2019t like how they grab that butt\u201d while on a stroll through stalls with free lube and condoms normalizes conversations around sexual preferences, safety and performance. As an international grad student I was encouraged to see male engagement with and respect for female topics at a young age gives hope for the future, even when statistics on gender-based violence unfortunately suggest otherwise. And someone might give self-gratification another go if they see girls high-fiving each other after winning a satisfyer vibrator in a raffle.\n\nStudents exploring the sex themed raffle prizes(USC Annenberg Media/Maria Vittoria Borghi).\n\nCultural phenomena like USC Sex Week are important. There\u2019s no way to know who needed to see the \u201cALL ARE WELCOME\u201d sign towering the panelists at the Sexploration Tent. In a few weeks, someone might decide to reach out after finding the contact card reading \u201cYou Have An Advocate\u201d in their pocket. The same reasoning applies to Sex Education: seeing Aimee Gibbs (Aimee Lou Wood) finally dating people who respect her begs viewers to think about boundaries. Witnessing the emotional rollercoaster caused by her sexual assault experience, and the reactions of her friends, paves the way for those who want to show up for their friends in situations without a playbook.\n\nThis is what the series and the USC initiative have in common \u2013 they bring crucial conversations about sexuality and identity to the real world. From where I was standing, the response was beautiful to watch.\n```"}

And, how far can LAFC advance in the MLS Cup Playoffs?\n\nAngel City FC forward Katie Johnson, center left, runs while watching for a free kick during the second half of an NWSL soccer match against OL Reign, Sunday, Aug. 27, 2023, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan October 20, 2023 at 4:32 pm PDT\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n\nAngel City Rejoice on Decision Day\n\nIt\u2019s not an overstatement to say that Angel City just played its best game in club history Sunday. Yes, the club has only existed for two seasons. And yes, the Portland Thorns didn\u2019t start surefire MVP-winner Sophia Smith. But ACFC still defeated the league-leaders (before Sunday) 5-1 \u2014 the first time Angel City has scored more than three goals in a competitive fixture. Most importantly, Angel City will play its first-ever playoff game. It feels like a weight has been lifted on the club.\n\nFor the amount of noise Angel City has made as an NWSL expansion team \u2014 with their celebrity-laden ownership group, their atypical business model, the drafting of Alyssa Thompson \u2014 the team kind of needed this. It finally feels like the on-field product has caught up to the off-field flash.\n\nOn Decision Day, it seemed like all the players who carried ACFC through the season had standout games. M.A. Vignola, who earned her first call-up to the U.S. women\u2019s national team camp this season, had a goal and an assist from left back. Attacking midfielder Savannah McCaskill, who has saved Angel City on multiple occasions previously, scored her fourth NWSL goal of the season. And centerback Sarah Gorden defended astutely in the final match while becoming one of just seven players to play every minute of the regular season (1,980 in total).\n\nBut even as the usual stars shined, a couple of the players who had struggled more played their best games of the season as well. Winger Scarlett Camberos scored her first goal of the NWSL season. Sydney Leroux, whose time at ACFC has been plagued with injuries, scored a ridiculous bicycle kick to finish the regular season on an emphatic note.\n\nVibes will be high going into the playoffs, where Angel City will face the OL Reign. The last time these two sides met, ACFC won 2-1 at home, but this game will take place in Seattle, kicking off at 7:00 p.m. on Friday. Now that Angel City is in the playoffs, anything can happen. I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out a Cinderella run.\n\nCharting LAFC\u2019s playoff path\n\nFull disclosure: for the good of the content, I\u2019d like to see LAFC advance as far as possible in the playoffs. As you know, in this column I cover LA teams. If LA teams aren\u2019t playing, there\u2019s not much to cover. That\u2019s just the way it goes. And when LAFC doesn\u2019t play, I have to come up with gimmicks like this: let\u2019s make a yet-to-be-finalized MLS playoff bracket!\n\nSeriously, that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do here. Let\u2019s project the Western Conference playoff bracket and see how far LAFC should advance.\n\nThis season, the MLS has adopted a new playoff format, expanding the bracket to nine teams, with an NBA-esque play-in game between the eighth and ninth seeds. The West\u2019s seventh, eighth and ninth overall positions are still up for grabs, with the Portland Timbers, San Jose Earthquakes and FC Dallas all tied on 43 points, and Sporting Kansas City and Minnesota United just behind them in 10th and 11th on 41.\n\nThe Timbers have to play the Houston Dynamo on Decision Day, who could advance from fourth to third with a win, so I expect the Dynamo to play a first-choice eleven. Meanwhile, Sporting KC and Minnesota play each other while San Jose and Dallas play Austin FC and the Galaxy, respectively \u2014 both of whom have already been eliminated.\n\nHere are my picks for those matches, which\u2019ll determine the final seeding:\n\nPortland vs. Houston: Portland defeats Houston 2-1 on home turf, one of the best atmospheres in MLS, securing seventh place.\n\nDallas vs. LA Galaxy: Dallas draws 2-2 with the Galaxy in Carson, with the Bulls falling to 10th.\n\nSan Jose vs. Austin: San Jose beats Austin 1-0 despite its sluggish attack, finishing in eighth.\n\nSporting KC vs. Minnesota: Emanuel Reynoso powers the Loons to an upset over KC, winning 2-0 and capturing the final playoff spot due to having more wins (11) than Dallas (10).\n\nWith those results, San Jose would face Minnesota in the winner-takes-all wild card, in which I have Minnesota advancing despite the Quakes\u2019 home advantage. With Reynoso, Bongokuhle Hlongwane and Norwich City legend Teemu Pukki, Minnesota has playoff-ready firepower.\n\nThat begs the question, who would Minnesota play in the first round? Well, St. Louis City has already locked up the No. 1 spot in the West due to their five-point advantage over LAFC. I still need to decide who finishes in second through sixth, though.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the main team in question, LAFC. LAFC plays Vancouver away on the final matchday, with Vancouver able to leapfrog into third place, while LAFC can\u2019t fall lower than fourth. Considering what head coach Steve Cherundolo has said recently about the unreasonable physical demands of the team\u2019s schedule, I\u2019m guessing the black and gold will play a rotated team in Canada and lose 2-1.\n\nAs to the other Decision Day games, my picks:\n\nSt. Louis City vs. Seattle Sounders: 2-2 draw in St. Louis.\n\nReal Salt Lake vs. Colorado Rapids: Real Salt Lake wins 3-1 away in Colorado.\n\nThe combination of those results would leave the following order from top-down in the table: St. Louis, LAFC (they would still have more wins than Seattle), Seattle, Salt Lake, Vancouver, then Houston in sixth, followed by Portland and San Jose.\n\nThat would leave the following playoff matchups in the first round, best-of-three series:\n\nSt. Louis vs. San Jose\n\nLAFC vs. Portland\n\nSeattle vs. Houston\n\nSalt Lake vs. Vancouver\n\nFirst, I need to say that the MLS playoff bracket is ridiculous and borderline nonsensical. Why does the first round have to be a three-game series when the format shifts to single elimination afterwards? The three-game series was clearly designed to give the higher seeds the advantage and prevent them from exiting the playoffs too soon, while the single-elimination conference semifinals and championship arguably swings too far in the other direction. The UEFA Champions League knockout format, where the teams play each other twice home and away with the aggregate winner advancing, makes much more sense to me.\n\nBut back to picking games. In both meetings in the regular season, Portland scored two goals against LAFC, proving that LAFC can be troubled against the Timbers. But nothing about this Timbers team should really scare LAFC. The Portlanders don\u2019t have exceptional attack or a well-above average defense. If Cherundolo\u2019s men can shut down Evander Ferreira (nine goals, three assists as an attacking midfielder), LAFC should advance in two matches.\n\nThat would leave LAFC to play the winner of Seattle vs. Houston. Seattle narrowly won both regular-season meetings between the pair 1-0, but Houston grew in my estimation as the season progressed and have tallied major victories over Real Salt Lake, Vancouver and Inter Miami since July. I\u2019m picking Houston in three games.\n\nCasual fans may not realize how hard a Houston series could be for LAFC. In two regular-season games, LAFC failed to score a goal against the Dynamo, letting in five at the other end. Both times, LAFC had higher possession and more shots, but it didn\u2019t matter. A counterattacking style suits Houston, and LAFC have yet to productively rein in the chaos they unleash on the pitch.\n\nAs such, it would be journalistically irresponsible of me to pick LAFC in this matchup. Nothing about the team\u2019s recent history against Houston suggests that the black and gold would advance in a one-off, single-elimination game \u2014 even if it was in Los Angeles.\n\nSo that\u2019s how I predict LAFC\u2019s season to end: With a 2-1 loss to the Houston Dynamo in BMO Stadium. It\u2019s not that I think LAFC doesn\u2019t have a championship-caliber roster, but winning back-to-back MLS Cups is really hard. Only three clubs have ever won back-to-back, and no team has done it since the 2011 and 2012 LA Galaxy teams that had David Beckham bossing midfield and Robbie Keane banging in goals. If Carlos Vela were a few years younger, maybe I could see this team as repeat champions, but that\u2019s just not the case.\n\nSorry LAFC fans, this season will end in pain. The other 28 teams not lifting the Philip F. Anschutz trophy can relate.\n\nGalaxy earn solid draw vs. Real Salt Lake\n\nWith no playoffs to look forward to, the Galaxy may as well be on the beach \u2014 mentally, at least. But this weekend, their sporting pride still shined through.\n\nIn a 2-2 draw with Western Conference contenders Real Salt Lake, the oft-maligned Dejan Jovelji\u0107 (in this column, at least) arguably had his best game in a Galaxy shirt. The Serbian forward played off the left wing \u2014 not his usual role as a central striker \u2014 and contributed a goal and assist that gave LA a 2-0 lead after just 34 minutes.\n\nNaturally, the Galaxy\u2019s subpar defense let down the team\u2019s voracious attack. Salt Lake\u2019s Ecuadorian striker Anderson Julio scored just before the halftime whistle, a killer blow for team confidence going into the mid-game team talk.\n\nThe Galaxy then held onto the one-goal until the 76th minute, when Diego Luna (not the \u201cAndor\u201d actor) equalized.\n\nAs we approach the end of the regular season, when we\u2019ll have a full referendum on the Galaxy\u2019s season, this game does seem like a perfect microcosm of the Galaxy\u2019s season: look excellent in attack for a while, but completely and utterly collapse at the back.\n\nLike I said in the last column, they were fun, but they weren\u2019t good and the defense absolutely held them back over the course of the season. Expect more goals in the season finale against Dallas.\n\nNext games:\n\nLAFC: Saturday, October 21 vs. Vancouver Whitecaps (away)\n\nAngel City: Friday, October 20 vs. OL Reign (away)\n\nLA Galaxy: Saturday, October 21 vs. FC Dallas (home)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d runs every Wednesday.```"}

Newsom notified his travel plan through a tweet on Thursday, showing his support to victims affected by the attack from Palestinian militant group Hamas. Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog took to X, formerly twitter saying, \u201cI thank you Governor of California @GavinNewsom for your solidarity visit to Israel today.\u201d The tweet was accompanied by a photo of the two, \u201cWe will never forget the true friends of the State of Israel - those who chose to stand with us in our difficult times.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Politico, \u201cThe Governor adjusted his planned international trip and will briefly visit Israel ahead of going to China,\u201d spokesperson Erin Mellon said in a statement. His visit comes after New York Governor Hocul\u2019s trip to Israel on Wednesday, offering solidarity and support. Newsom shared some photos from his visit to his social media account saying, \u201cMy heart is heavy for every innocent person experiencing excruciating loss.\u201d The post also stated, \u201cCA will be sending much needed medical supplies to the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cNewsom\u2019s effort is of course political as he has national election ambitions and is lacking serious foreign policy credentials.

On Wednesday, the governor authorized immediate expansion of funds to bolster safety and security at religious institutions in California amid the ongoing conflict. The state will also be sending medical aid and supplies to the region, including Gaza, where Israel has launched a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d and cut off supplies of food, power and water, Newsom\u2019s office said.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is one of the largest economies in the world and has a diverse population reflecting the many communities suffering in the Middle East\u201d Bellantoni added. California is the second largest home to the Jewish population in the U.S. according to the Jewish Virtual Library, and the state with the most Arab American population in the country, as per Arab American Institute. Newsom is scheduled to visit China on Monday, for a week-long trip discussing climate action and partnership between two of the world\u2019s largest economies. The seven-day visit starting in Hong Kong includes stops in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, and the province of Jiangsu.\n```"}

Fans waited for over an hour and a half to enter the Galen Center to snag the best seats in the arena.\n\nHoopLA put on a wide variety of contests that featured players from both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, and even surprise guests from the football team, including junior quarterback Caleb Williams, junior safety Calen Bullock and senior wide receiver Brenden Rice.\n\n\u201cI am most excited to see all the players,\u201d Ahori Yadav, a sophomore studying computer science and business administration, said. \u201cI grew up around Los Angeles, so I have been watching the basketball team for a long time.\u201d\n\nKicking off the event was a DJ set from USC alum Zack Bia, who was sporting a black USC jersey, with the No. 6 on the back to represent freshman guard Bronny James. Bia pulled out fan favorites, remixing songs from Bad Bunny, Sexyy Red, Drake and Peso Pluma, getting the crowd energized early for a night of madness.\n\nThe long-awaited reveal of the new women\u2019s and men\u2019s basketball teams had fans on their feet to see all the new recruits and returning players. This offseason, USC was able to land the top-rated freshman recruits in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, guards Isaiah Collier and JuJu Watkins. Both were awarded the Naismith Prep Player of the Year award last year, given to the best high school player in the country. USC became the first school ever to sign both Naismith winners in the same year.\n\nThe player introductions started with the women\u2019s team. Watkins got a huge cheer as she was announced for the first time in the Galen Center this year. Many fans were excited to see No. 12 walk-out, as it begins a new chapter in the women\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cI am really happy that [Watkins] is bringing a lot of rep to women\u2019s basketball,\u201d Yadav said.\n\nFollowing suit was the men\u2019s team, giving fans the first opportunity to see highly-touted freshmen Isaiah Collier and James take the court. Out of the men\u2019s rosters, Ben Llados, a freshman studying business administration, said, \u201cBy far, Isaiah Collier,\u201d as the player he is most excited to watch.\n\nWhile Collier and James were the spotlights of the introductions, sophomore center Vincent Iwuchukwu \u2014 a native of Imo State, Nigeria \u2014 stole the spotlight with his walk-out in a traditional Imo outfit over his uniform that featured an overflowing jumper covered with lion heads.\n\nThe event started with a skills competition, which had four teams of three players: one from each of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams, plus one football player. The Veterans, a trio composed of juniors guard Kobe Johnson, center Rayah Marshall and Bullock, from the football team, came out victorious. In an impressive 29 seconds, the squad scored from close-range before sinking a half-court heave to win the HoopLA skills competition.\n\nThe highly anticipated dunk-contest came next, which featured some high flyers with freshman forward Brandon Gardner, Collier and even the First Team All-American safety Bullock, who got to show off his multi-sport athleticism by throwing one down. But Gardner had the highlight of the night at HoopLA, as he cleared Heisman quarterback Caleb Williams for a tenacious slam dunk. The crowd erupted into cheers, as Gardner tried to do his best Aaron Gordon impersonation.\n\nThe freshman showcased what fans can be expecting to see from the freshman this year on a fast break: Showtime.\n\nThe 3-point competition was a thrilling showdown between graduate guard India Otto and fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis, who both cruised through the first round. With 21 points, including a clutch finish, Ellis defeated Otto to win it. That didn\u2019t come to a surprise to many Trojan fans: one of them being Llados who picked Boogie Ellis to win the 3-point contest right before the event.\n\nOver the last few seasons, Ellis has had some clutch finishes to seal victories, with the most notable one being last year\u2019s game-icing three that capped his career-high 31-point performance versus crosstown rival UCLA.\n\nDuring a quick intermission between contests, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s team broke out into a spontaneous dance-off. Boogie Ellis and redshirt freshman Aaliyah Gayles put on the moves, going back and forth to see which USC basketball team had the best dancers.\n\nA great night of celebration for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, and welcoming of new recruits at HoopLA, was capped with a performance from another USC alum, Saweetie. She was accompanied by the Cardinal Divas, USC\u2019s majorette team. However, the Divas weren\u2019t the only ones to share the stage with Saweetie during her performance. Los Angeles native and rapper YG made his entrance to his song \u201cBPT,\u201d which had both players and students surprised and excited.\n\nThe two artists performed their familiar fan-favorites, giving fans a great end to the first annual HoopLA at the Galen Center.\n\nWhile both teams crashed out of the NCAA tournament in the first round last season, the hype surrounding men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball has never been louder. Both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams will begin this season ranked No. 21 in the nation.\n\n\u201cI think they have a lot of potential to do good,\u201d Yadav said. \u201cI just want them to live up to their potential.\u201d\n\nBoth teams will tip-off the new season in Las Vegas on November 6 in the Hall of Fame Series. Women\u2019s basketball will face off against future Big Ten opponent Ohio State at 11 a.m., before men\u2019s basketball takes on Kansas State at 7 p.m.\n\nCollege hoops are back!\n```"}

(Photo by ESPN)\n\nBy Jonathan Martin October 20, 2023 at 2:43 pm PDT\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship legends Alexander Volkanovski and Kamaru Usman stepped in on eleven days\u2019 notice to keep UFC 294 alive amidst two of the original fighters having to pull out of the event due to injury. This is a key example of why the UFC and the world of mixed martial arts have grown tremendously in the last thirty years.\n\nUFC 294, taking place in Abu Dhabi, was supposed to feature a lightweight championship fight between current champion Islam Makhachev and No. 1 contender, former lightweight champion Charles Oliveira. Oliveira was forced to pull out of the fight due to a gash across his eye sustained during sparring. Middleweight Paulo Costa was scheduled to fight in the co-main event against Khamzat Chimaev, but is instead recovering from an elbow surgery to combat bursitis. Former welterweight champion Kamaru Usman is now stepping in for Costa to fight Chimaev.\n\nUsman and Chimaev have been chirping for a few months about a fight, and now fans are getting what they want. The previous meeting between Makhachev and Volkanovski was non-stop action. UFC 284 in Perth, Australia garnered an attendance of 14,000 with a total gate revenue of $4 Million, the seventh UFC event held in Australia since 2010.\n\nVolkanovski had a total output of 164 significant strikes and Makhachev had a total of four takedowns, but Makhachev\u2019s total control time was from 7:37 to Volkanovski\u2019s 2:55. Makhachev won via decision victory to retain his champion status.\n\nThe UFC is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, and viewership has increased dramatically since the league\u2019s start. This is due to the social media spotlight and the league\u2019s ability to matchmake fights with the top MMA fighters around the world. The fight promotion has sanctioned forty-nine events and counting. Sponsorships with companies like ESPN, Crypto.com and Monster Energy have also helped to grow the sport.\n\nMore recently, the UFC announced a merger with the WWE. Time will tell what can come out of that mega-partnership. The UFC has consistently had events with pay per view models that sold over a million pay per views in the last decade alone, the biggest being Conor Mcgregor vs Khabib Nurmagomedov (2018) with a PPV sale of 2.4 million buys in the United States alone.\n\nNot only was this the most watched UFC event ever, but also one of the top-viewed sporting events in history, ranking up there with Floyd Mayweather Vs. Manny Pacquiao.\n\nEric Lambkins II, 40, is a retired army veteran who used to train in MMA, and has been an avid fan of UFC since its inception in 1993. Lambkins believes that UFC\u2019s single-promoter system leads to stronger matchups than are often seen in boxing. \u201cUFC I think has usurped the world of boxing in terms of quality of fights, there is no room or opportunity for you to duck any fighter...you have to fight whoever is placed in front of you.\u201d\n\nThe UFC opened 2023 with a series of highly-anticipated fights, including UFC 283 Teixeira vs. Hill. On March 4, fan-favorite Jon Jones took on Ciryl Gane. Jones made his highly anticipated return to the octagon after three years off and quickly proceeded to defeat the No. 1 contender for the heavyweight championship in under two minutes via submission.\n\nUFC 285 saw 19,471 fans at the T-Mobile Arena in Nevada. Dana White, president of the UFC, stated that the gate revenue was over $12 million.\n\nRobert Carvajhol, 43, is a South Los Angeles-based muay thai trainer and former competitor in muay thai. He attributes the UFC\u2019s immense growth to fighters pushing their personal backstories leading up to the fights. \u201cPeople want to see what is entertaining, like a story behind it. You know, if somebody\u2019s just fighting just to fight, like they rather have somebody that has a beef.\u201d\n\nRecently, the UFC has done a great job of drawing in a younger audience with younger fighters. The youngest UFC fighter ever, Raul Rosas Jr., made his debut in 2022 at the age of 18. Rosas has found success in the ring with his wrestling and grappling ability.\n\nRosas has inspired other young fighters like Cristian Carrasco, a 20-year-old Los Angeles-based kickboxer with a professional record of 1-0 in the International Fight Showdown organization. \u201cSeeing him I was like, \u2018Dang, he\u2019s 18 and he\u2019s already in the UFC,\u2019\u201d said Carrasco. \u201cHe manhandled the guy he fought...obviously it inspires me to keep going and if I really want to make a push.\u201d\n\nCarrasco said that he felt that the limitations of traditional boxing stifled his ability to grow, and believes that by continuing to learn different fighting disciplines, he can develop into a professional fighter.\n\nBoxing has lost some of its brilliance due to so-called up-and-coming fighters amassing wins in the amateurs against less skilled competitors, leading to impressive undefeated records that aren\u2019t representative of their abilities. Many title belts that undermine one another across different fighting sanctions and fighters ducking qualified opponents to avoid losses make the sport less appealing to a modern audience.\n\nOn the other hand, the UFC has one belt per weight division. The path to that belts lies in beating top-ranked fighters and taking the risk of brawling fighters of different styles. Current UFC champions are all well-rounded, with an emphasis on either striking, wrestling, grappling or jiu jitsu.\n\nLambkins II recalled how he had to become versatile in the army due to losing many wrestling matches and grappling fights in the military. He learned that in the military you need a variety of fighting styles to be successful in combat. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I really put some blood and sweat equity inside the sand pit to learn how to fight off my back and how to counter that my fighting trajectory took off.\u201d\n\nThe UFC\u2019s global reach has strengthened its popularity. Unlike boxing, it has top fighters from Africa, Mexico, Iceland, Russia, China and Canada. Every continent in the world is represented in the UFC. As the events become even more widely watched, the venues will step outside of America.\n\nThe UFC has had success in globalizing their sport with the second-largest pay per view in organizations history that took place in Abu Dhabi on the UFC fight Island. UFC 257 where Ireland\u2019s McGregor faced off against Louisiana native, Dustin Porier for the trilogy fight. The event sold over 1.5 million pay per view buys.\n\nUFC 275 is another great example of the UFC\u2019s global reach. This main event saw a 40-year old Brazilian jiu jitsu fighter Glover Teixeira versus a young muay thai fighter Jiri Proch\u00e1zka who hails from the Czech Republic. The event took place in Kallang, Singapore and sold out with an attendance of 10,787 and a ticket revenue of $1,546,732.\n\nWith the rise of the UFC comes a concern around injuries. Fighting disciplines like boxing, kickboxing, karate, kung-fu and Muay Thai have high rates of head and facial injuries. Disciplines like jiu jitsu, judo and wrestling have right rates of joint damage.\n\nAccording to the Sports Health, \u201chead and facial injuries comprise between 57.8% and 70% of competition injuries in these athletes.\u201d The article found that, \u201cA prospective study of 950 Brazilian jiu-jitsu athletes found that joint injuries, particularly of the knee and elbow, were the most common injuries during competition (64.5 percent). A study of Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitions (2005-2011) found that 78% of injuries were orthopedic in nature, with the elbow being the most frequently injured joint.\u201d\n\nBut Carrasco says he\u2019s not afraid of injury. He sees them as an opportunity to learn and grow. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about that to be honest,\u201d Carrasco said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even about that, a lot of this is relatable to real life situations. We all go through things and you see it in MMA training, we get hit and it\u2019s our job to get up and go through it.\u201d\n\nThe UFC will end its 30th year anniversary with UFC 295 and UFC 296. These two fight cards have some of the rosters\u2019 most beloved and infamous stars fighting. Fans dream of the fights that the promotion consistently put out.\n```"}

Toward the close of the hour-long performance at the Roy and Edna Disney Cal/Arts Theater (REDCAT) in Downtown Los Angeles, the real-life and theatrical emcee is on his knees using the floor as his imaginary paper, frantically scribbling from right to left in quick cursive hand movements. At the end of every new line, he slides his hand from left to right, as he mimes pushing the carriage of a typewriter back to begin the next line. Saunders also lyricizes the same meditations from earlier in the performance. These meditations set the scene for his story as a young emcee in Philadelphia on Girard Avenue. He finishes another line and scoots backward. Another, and he sheds a layer of clothes; leaving only his sweatpants and a white long-sleeve top. Traces of Moses Sumney\u2019s haunting melody, \u201cDoomed,\u201d echo in the background: \u201cAm I vital, if my heart is idle? Am I doomed?\u201d Suddenly, a beam of yellow light radiates from above the emcee and he glows in its warm hue. Standing up, his lyrics become slow but no less emphatic. Finally, he looks up at the light and proclaims his final lyric, \u201cGod is the roots,\u201d and he walks away from the crowd, the stage returning to darkness.\n\nIn this latest showcase of \u201cProphet: The Order of the Lyricist,\u201d running Sept. 21 to 23, dancer and choreographer Marjani Fort\u00e9-Saunders and Saunders, known commercially as 7NMS, put forth a multimedia piece that marries Saunders\u2019 journey with the collective history of Black lyrical expression. With the collaboration of dancer Marcella Lewis, movement composer Sabela Grimes, media designer Meena Murugesan and photographer Marc Winston, \u201cProphet\u201d combines dance, lyricism, audio samples and visual projections. This performance seeks to inspire artists to continue on their journey no matter the setbacks. Yet, one does not have to be an artist to walk away from this piece believing in the power of fortitude and the possibility of redemption.\n\nThe inspiration behind this piece came before their first workshop sessions. Having met in 2008, when she was dancing for the Urban Bush Women and he was in the music industry, the two later married in 2014. Fort\u00e9-Saunders told Ampersand LA it was the hours of conversations and storytelling within their partnership that led to an initial interest in exploring new work. In the very beginning, they thought this would culminate in a book and an album. Saunders has been working on a music-centered podcast called \u201cLive from the Writer\u2019s Bench\u201d since 2013. This show featured conversations about things like the different levels of emceeing; from rapping to emceeing to becoming a lyricist. The hosts also discussed music\u2019s connection to social issues. Saunders recalls doing one episode about Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed in early 2012. During the performance, this influence is seen when Saunders takes the audience to \u201cemcee university.\u201d He demonstrates a boot camp consisting of running, spitting (freestyle rapping) and reciting verses. Saunders does this to show that emceeing is not a \u2018soft skill,\u2019 but one that carries cultural weight and reverence to the Black Americans who developed it.\n\nThis is followed by a conversation that takes place completely through audio bites and samples. Discussing how the therapeutic nature of rap can enable someone to turn their life around, one specific voice likens this process as a \u201ccultural arts programs.\u201d In this way, the duo wanted to create something about the art and journey of emceeing itself, and Fort\u00e9-Saunders suggested they create the work for the stage. This led them to the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York in 2019. This was supposed to be the duo\u2019s first residency before they moved on to others scheduled for 2020. However, as COVID hit, these plans were upended. Luckily, the Saunderses were able to do satellite residencies from home over the pandemic. This was with the support of their presenting partners\u2019 three different grants which helped the couple finance a home studio. The duo was able to continue living on their art, as they had been doing for years.\n\nAs things began opening up, they did an initial tour of \u201cProphet\u201d at three locations: Experimental Media Performing Arts Center in upstate New York, Kelly Strayhorn Theater in Pittsburgh and Abrons Arts Center in New York City. During their recent residency at the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance this fall, they reworked \u201cProphet\u201d to include two dancers. In previous versions, Fort\u00e9-Saunders was the emcee\u2019s lone shadow, but Marcella Lewis joined in these recent shows as the second dedicated mover on stage.\n\nThe piece opens with a duet between Fort\u00e9-Saunders and Lewis. Each dressed in matching costumes of long, sleeveless jackets and sheer, oversized top hats, their movements begin as slow and methodical but steadily increase in pace. As the two communicate through their grooves and gestures, they build off each other until the bass kicks in. Marjani Fort\u00e9-Saunders dancing at the REDCAT presentation of \"Prophet.\" Photo courtesy of Angel Origgi.\n\nWhen Saunders appears on stage, the dancers become complements to his spoken testimony. Whether acting out the emcee\u2019s words or serving as aesthetic frames, Fort\u00e9-Saunders and Lewis play with the shape, tempo, levels and scale of their movements in beautiful form. What is most impressive, however, is that there are not two but three dynamic dancers in this piece. Saunders himself expresses his stories physically, in which he has multiple moments on stage where he is simultaneously dancing and orating.\n\nSaunders told Ampersand LA that this was not originally the plan. While he has danced for choreographers before and worked in the dance world for over 10 years, he said he initially didn\u2019t want to move next to Fort\u00e9-Saunders and Lewis. Through the insistence of Fort\u00e9-Saunders and Grimes, he eventually agreed. But he had one condition: \u201dI don\u2019t want to go on stage and attempt to be a dancer. I don\u2019t want to look like I\u2019m trying to be a dancer, because I\u2019m not a dancer. I\u2019m not trained. I don\u2019t have that background. But I can move according to how I am feeling pulled to move,\u201d he said.\n\nAround the halfway point of the performance, a chilling moment occurs. The emcee progresses from a crawl on all fours to a standing position in no less than five minutes. This progression takes him from one end of the stage to the other, and he never buckles or rushes a transition. Like a wave, he unfolds inch by inch until he is upright. As a dancer, I know the amount of control it takes to move slowly \u2013 and especially the kind of slow where you don\u2019t realize someone is moving until they\u2019re on the other side of the stage. When you put this kind of movement on the floor, you\u2019re creating friction with your whole body \u2013 muscle and bone \u2013 to simulate the illusion of floating. It leaves audiences speechless and dancers bruised.\n\nIn the end, Saunders said the decision to have him dance was for the best. He tells the stories of multiple people in his life who have since passed, which Saunders describes as a heavy and weighted experience. Therefore, dancing allows him to balance that burden. \u201cI think movement just helps my relationship to the character, to the performance, to the embodiment of just this release,\u201d he said.\n\nThese characters are referred to as the \u201cthree kings\u201d within the piece. These are the real-life figures who guided Saunders when he was on the brink of homelessness and struggling to find his path. One of these kings, a Yoruba priest named Abdul, led him to find God outside a bodega in Philadelphia. While Abdul has since passed from cancer, Saunders says this performance allows him to share his mentor\u2019s lessons on a grand scale.\n\nThe idea of passing on generational wisdom gets at one of the central themes of this piece: preserving bloodline through art. In this way, the show, to me, is art about the art (of emceeing) itself. And while we see poems about poetry and books about writing, I think we see less of this work on stages. Due to dance generally being a less literal art form, I think there is a high bar to pulling this off because the performer may lose their audience within the meta layers of the story. However, \u201cProphet\u201d uses timing to its advantage and does not run so long that there\u2019s an intermission. It\u2019s a 60-minute marathon that keeps your attention the whole time. Even if you couldn\u2019t relate to the story at the beginning, we all know what hope feels like at the end when Saunders walks into the sun.\n\nIt is from these lessons and stories that Fort\u00e9-Saunders and Saunders ask artists, and anyone watching the \u201cProphet,\u201d to not give up their passions. Saunders wants artists to walk away feeling validated for their work, even if it hasn\u2019t been recognized by the world yet. Fort\u00e9-Saunders especially calls out to those artists innovating within forms dominated by Eurocentrism. \u201cI\u2019m wanting folks to walk away inspired to sprout. I want them to walk away with the relationship to their practice as persistence \u2013 to stay, to stick it out, to ride it, to seek all of the pockets and ways that this might show up. It might not look the way that you want or the way that you see right now, but your sight is limited,\u201d said Fort\u00e9-Saunders.\n\nThe next steps for the duo will be the release of their book in 2023 and, later on, a musical album of \u201cProphet: The Order of the Lyricist\u201d on digital and vinyl release.\n```"}

Stroud fields questions from reporters following a 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Oct. 1. Photo courtesy of FanDuel sourced via https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en\n\nBy Felipe Londo\u00f1o October 20, 2023 at 10:18 am PDT\n\nC.J. Stroud was a highly-ranked quarterback when he entered the NFL Draft this past spring, finishing his collegiate career as one of the best passers in Ohio State history and earning a top-five pick. Yet prior to his first NFL season, he had never been regarded as the headliner, the No. 1, the star. Be it other quarterbacks like Bryce Young or Caleb Williams, or even his own receiver in Marvin Harrison Jr., there has always seemed to be somebody in the way of Stroud getting his flowers as an elite quarterback \u2014 until now.\n\nPlaying like the best rookie quarterback in football and marching towards an Offensive Rookie of the Year Crown, all while resuscitating the Houston Texans franchise back to relevancy, C.J Stroud is taking the NFL by storm. Let\u2019s dig into Stroud\u2019s fit in the Texans offense, how he\u2019s elevated the unit and what the future could hold for him and the Texans as they advance their rebuild.\n\nThis past spring, Stroud was selected by a Houston franchise entrenched in a complete organizational rehaul. After going 11-38 the three years prior with four different head coaches and immense controversy surrounding the franchise\u2019s former quarterback Deshaun Watson, 2023 was to be a turning of the page with the hiring of former San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans and the drafting of Stroud.\n\nBeing a defensive coach, an instrumental decision early in Ryans\u2019 tenure was to bring over 49ers passing game coordinator Bobby Slowik to serve as the team\u2019s offensive coordinator, a longtime associate who over the last half decade helped orchestrate one of the most productive offenses in the league under the tutelage of head coach and play caller Kyle Shanahan, a bonafide offensive mastermind.\n\nTo sum up the Shanahan offense\u2019s construction and evolution over the years would require a dissertation, but to put it simply, throughout a large part of the last half-decade the 49ers have found tremendous success by employing a heavy play action system built off zone runs, with the goal of beating defenses with finesse in the ground game and and a quick underneath and intermediate pass game reliant on the talent of skill position players.\n\nQuarterbacks like Jimmy Garappolo and now Brock Purdy have been asked to play point guard, utilizing their quick releases and accuracy at the underneath and intermediate levels to get the ball into the hands of superstars like George Kittle, Christian McCaffrey and Deebo Samuel as quickly as possible to maximize yards-after-catch (YAC) production.\n\nSlowik has brought a similar system to Houston, which Stroud has operated to near perfection \u2013 through six weeks, he ranks fourth in passing yards (1660), ninth in pass TDs (nine), and eighth in passer rating (96.4), while the offense ranks eighth in total yards (2084), 13th in yards per play (5.3), and eighth in offensive success rate (42.4 percent).\n\nSure, these stats relate to the offense as a whole as much as they do to Stroud. But when considering that the Texans rank 22nd in total rush yards (533) and 30th in rush yards per attempt (3.2), it is clear that the passing offense led by Stroud is what\u2019s doing the heavy lifting in elevating the unit.\n\nSo how is Stroud doing it? For one, he\u2019s excelling at throwing with accuracy at the underneath and intermediate levels, hitting his receivers with anticipation and consistently good timing while displaying the ability to either rifle throws into tight windows or toss with touch to allow for YAC opportunities.\n\nHis processing looks extremely polished for a rookie, as he\u2019s already showcasing the ability to diagnose coverages pre-snap and execute multi-progression reads with a changing picture. Take the fourth-quarter go-ahead TD in the Texans\u2019 Week 5 loss against the Atlanta Falcons, for example. Stroud told reporters in a press conference last week that he actually altered the route which tight end Dalton Schultz scored on \u2014 after seeing the Falcons in a two-high safety coverage shell, Stroud changed Schultz\u2019s route to a vertical to exploit the coverage hole, resulting in a score \u2013 all this from a rookie in his fifth professional start.\n\nStroud has also taken very good care of the football, another indication of his already advanced mental polish. Prior to his lone interception against the New Orleans Saints last week, Stroud set a record for pass attempts without an interception to start a career with 186, beating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott\u2019s previous number of 176.\n\nStroud has clearly thrived in the Texans offense, which begs the question: if the Shanahan system has been so successful in creating offensive productivity, has Stroud\u2019s success been just as manufactured as that of previous Shanahan quarterbacks like Jimmy Garappolo or Brock Purdy?\n\nThe answer is a definitive no. The key difference is that while Stroud has been a phenomenal point guard, he\u2019s also been the engine behind the Texans\u2019 offensive success, more so than Slowik\u2019s offensive design or the Texans\u2019 supporting pieces.\n\nFor one, having been drafted to the second worst team in football, Stroud is not in a great situation. All year he\u2019s played with Nico Collins, a third year player whose previous career high in receiving yards was 481, and 31-year-old Robert Woods as his top two targets, while operating behind a shaky offensive line that has seen four of its five starters miss 19 games combined through six weeks.\n\nThis is not San Francisco or Miami, where Stroud would get to throw to All-Pro talent at the skill positions or operate in a clean pocket. The Texans offense is far from a finished product and has seen much adversity, yet Stroud has elevated the unit in a way which Shanahan quarterbacks have not been required to.\n\nStroud has done this through his excellent processing ability and accuracy, yet also through an added wrinkle which the Shanahan system has not really seen outside of a few flashes by Brock Purdy \u2014 creation ability.\n\nDespite being knocked by scouts and draft analysts alike for showing little ability outside of structure in college, Stroud has shown plenty of ability to play-make in the NFL, displaying a good feel for pressure and the agility and short area quickness to escape the pocket and create a throwing window or scramble for significant yardage.\n\nSo far this season, he ranks ninth among QBs in total EPA, or expected points added (+23.2), a clear indication he has manufactured success for the Texans offense out of nothing.\n\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg. To this point, Slowik has constructed the Texans offense around heavy play action and underneath-intermediate concepts to best fit the team\u2019s current personnel \u2014 the Texans have a true bruiser at running back in Dameon Pierce, and receivers who do their best work in the underneath and intermediate areas like Nico Collins, Robert Woods and John Metchie.\n\nFurthermore, the heavy play action is a clever way of adding \u201ctraining wheels\u201d to Stroud\u2019s development as he learns to process and operate at NFL speed \u2013 through the threat of a run, play action pass concepts bait linebackers and safeties to come down into the Box, creating an easier coverage picture for quarterbacks.\n\nHowever, as he gets more experience and the Texans rebuild moves along (say, with the acquisition of a true No. 1 weapon like Tee Higgins via free agency or or Malik Nabers through the draft), there\u2019s no reason Stroud couldn\u2019t develop into one of the best pocket passers in football, and the offense couldn\u2019t reach the heights of other high-octane pocket passer led units like those of the Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys or Los Angeles Chargers in years past.\n\nI\u2019m getting ahead of myself here, but the point is that Stroud and the Texans\u2019 future is bright, and it\u2019s about time we give the Ohio State product his credit \u2014 through six weeks, he\u2019s the clear front runner for OROTY and is enjoying a rookie season on par with those of Justin Herbert and Cam Newton.\n\nHe\u2019s helped re-energize a moribund Texans franchise into relevancy, elevating a rebuilding offense into one of the best units in the league through his accuracy, decision making and creation ability.\n\nThe future in Houston is brimming with promise, and it may very well only be a couple of years before we hear Stroud\u2019s name in MVP conversations.\n```"}

The speaker called out \u201cIsraeli apartheid and occupation, and U.S. government complicity in that oppression [as] the source of the violence.\u201d\n\nThose at the protest maintain that the current Israeli-Hamas War is a byproduct of years of tension and conflict. Some context of Hamas\u2019 attack and Israel\u2019s retaliation between October 7 to the day of the protest October 13, is listed below to give insight to events at the top of protesters\u2019 minds at this rally:\n\nIsrael formally declared war on Hamas, a militant group that the U.S. government has designated a terrorist organization, on October 8, in response to the October 7 attack, when Hamas took hostages and launched 2,200 rockets into Israel. This was the largest attack against Israel since the country\u2019s formation 75 years ago.\n\nAfter declaring war, Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d of Gaza, which is home to 2.3 million Palestinians, on October 9, cutting off electricity, food, water and fuel. The blockade and prohibiting civilians or humanitarian aid from entering or exiting the territory coincided with Israel dropping 6,000 bombs in six days according to the Israeli Air Force with the Wall Street Journal noting extensive collateral damage as of the day of the protest.\n\nDozens of fighter jets and helicopters attacked a series of terrorist targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip. So far, the IAF has dropped about 6,000 bombs against Hamas targets.\n\nIn an NPR article the Gaza Strip is described as one of the most densely populated places in the world, considered to be an open air prison since 2007, due to Israel\u2019s closure policy of restricting movement for Palestinians according to the Human Rights Network.\n\nOne protester came to the protest to support freedom from \u201cthis restrictive system.\u201d \u201cEvery human being born freely, they should live freely... [it\u2019s the] biggest open prison,\u201d they said. \u201cAnd that is [why] we are here to support all these people, here for one reason \u2014 to liberate those people.\u201d\n\nAs of October 13, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesperson for the Secretary-General gave a briefing that \u201c423,000 people have already been displaced,\u201d within Gaza and an Israeli military order was given for the \u201centire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza [to] relocate to southern Gaza within 24 hours.\u201d This order would apply to 1.1 million people. \u201cImpossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,\u201d Dujarric said.\n\nSeveral thousand protesters took over the streets with the L.A.P.D. and the sheriff's department diverting traffic and blocking on-ramps to the freeways.\n\nGibani, who marched with protesters, disagrees with the violence and method by which this conflict is being taken out on innocent lives.\n\nMahmud Gibani marched in protest of the situation, calling the past week a \u201cnightmare.\u201d \u201cPeople died and fell, children, infants, hospitals, buildings, they\u2019ve been demolished because [of] what happened with whatever Hamas \u2014 you know, started,\u201d Gibani said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the right war. The right war [goes] out in the empty land, two military, two armies fight each other for an issue; for the case. Don\u2019t kill children.\u201d\n\nGibani has had issues getting in contact with friends he has in Gaza. \u201cA lot of friends from Palestine that I contact every month, every week \u2014 now in Gaza, I cannot contact them due to the connection of the phones.\u201d\n\nIn limiting power, fuel and internet access in Gaza, the Israeli government has made it difficult, if not impossible, for many civilians and journalists to charge their phones, make calls and send messages outside the blockade, CNN has reported.\n\nEman Ismaiel, another protester at the demonstration, echoed her reasons for coming out to the protest. \u201cThis is not about religion. It\u2019s about human rights. It\u2019s the right of children to have safety and water, to be able to sleep,\u201d Ismaiel said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t sleep at night knowing that there are children who are under rubble, are being terrorized and the entire world is silent about it.\u201d\n\nIsmaiel said that even though she is an American citizen, being Arab American and Egyptian American she has felt isolated. \u201cEverywhere I look on social media, including my professional network, everybody is in direct support of Israel,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel very isolated. Our entire professional networks are not there to stand up for us. We cannot talk to our employer. We are getting messages from our kids\u2019 schools endorsing Israel. There is no avenue for us to speak out... We feel isolated. We feel alone. We feel sad. And we have nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nOsama Ellahib walked with protesters wearing something he made to represent ongoing suffering and as an homage to his mom\u2019s suffering in Lebanon when she was a kid that he sees connections to in the news now. \u201cBack in Lebanon when my mom was a kid, she got a metal piece of a rocket, that hit near their building,... really [close to] her heart,\u201d Ellahib said. \u201cThe only way back then was to cut all the way through her stomach to take that metal piece out, so she does not die.\u201d\n\nHe described the attacks on civilian children as terrorism \u2014 an unlawful use of violence and intimidation especially against civilians for political objectives \u2014 and as morally and ethically wrong. \u201cWhat happened to her [his mother], was not ethical, was extremely violent. It was an act of terrorism,\u201d Ellahib said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happening to the Palestinian kids, nowadays, live on TV is an act of terrorism that the world is not speaking about... we all deserve the right to live.\u201d\n\nA few counter-protesters showed up to the protest holding flags and in a stand-off against the crowd. Most counter protesters were in vehicles going with the flow of car traffic waving flags out of their windows.\n\nAlthough the demonstration was largely peaceful, confrontation and shoving arose between the two groups with a counter protester using pepper spray on pro-Palestinian protesters. Footage from the scene shows a group of men, some wearing Israeli flags around their necks, deploying pepper spray in this confrontation before withdrawing from the scene.\n\nSupporters also drove by the protest, vocalizing their show-of-support.\n\nReturning to the front of the Israeli consulate around 3:30 p.m. crowds remained together and steadfast in holding up their voices.\n\nMohammad, a protester who declined to give his last name, doesn\u2019t see how people can accept the killing of civilians happening in Gaza. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how people can\u2019t come out to the protest [when] you see what\u2019s going on in Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cTotally unacceptable. Civilians, children, men, women [who] have nothing to do with what is going on, you know, politically between whether it\u2019s Hamas or whether it\u2019s the IDF. It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s complete genocide to bomb 2 million people.\u201d\n\nMohammad has family friends in Gaza and family in the Palestinian territories, and the only and quickest way to get updates he says is when they post the news online as soon as they get an internet connection. Other than that he hasn\u2019t been able to connect as, \u201cit\u2019s so hard for us to get in contact with them,\u201d Mohammad said.\n\nA protester hangs from the traffic-light pole and waves their Palestinian Flag directly in front of the Israeli Consulate.\n\nRed and green smoke was released in front of the marching crowd.\n\nFor the latest statistics and updates from the Associated Press see here.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/19/the-cookbook-recipes-to-nfl-week-7/", "response": "```\nThe 1972 Dolphins can pop the champagne for yet another year, with the last two unbeaten teams \u2014 the Eagles and the 49ers \u2014 taking their first losses of the season. There was something in the air in New York and Cleveland this week, because I don\u2019t think anyone saw Zac Wilson and P.J. Walker being the two quarterbacks to complete this tall task. P.J. Walker had just been elevated to the active squad on Saturday, and already found himself handing Brock Purdy the first loss of his career.\n\nUp until Monday Night Football, where my Dallas Cowboys won a narrow game versus the Los Angeles Chargers, this weekend of football was not entertaining. In most cases, primetime games are supposed to highlight the great talent in the league. Russell Wilson vs. Patrick Mahomes on Thursday night may have been a marquee matchup five years ago, but now it\u2019s just hard to watch. No exception, the Sunday night game headlined with a Tyrod Taylor-led Giants team versus Josh Allen and the Bills. Everything about the game (except for the final drive) had me watching TikTok more than my TV screen.\n\nSince I did not release an edition of The Cookbook last week, I thought I would share my overall feelings about what conspired two Sunday Nights ago when my boys got pummeled on national television. For starters, I was embarrassed as a fan watching that game. It didn\u2019t take the whole game for me to switch the channel. Clearly what I thought this team was capable of against the 49ers was completely wrong. Red zone issues were a concern I had going into the game, but they didn\u2019t even matter since the team had zero red zone trips! I am still looking at the season with a glass-half-full mentality after their win versus the Chargers, as even though it was not the sexiest performance from this team, it was a much-needed rebound game.\n\nIt won\u2019t take much for this slate of games to top a boring week of football last Sunday. The waiter has arrived, what\u2019s the first meal?\n\nFirst Course | Detroit Lions (5-1) vs. Baltimore Ravens (4-2), 10 a.m. PDT, FOX\n\nI know Detroit keeps finding themselves in the cookbook, but it\u2019s hard not to include them after a great start to the season. There was something brewing at the end of last season when they won five out of their six final games. They have started where they left off last season, but this week will have to play against a tough Ravens defense without feature running back David Montgomery. However, the Lions should look to utilize first-round pick Jahmyr Gibbs a lot more in both the air and ground games, especially against weaker coverage linebackers Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen. Jared Goff will need to continue his hot streak this season of protecting the ball \u2014 allowing only three interceptions in six games \u2014 or else it could be a long day for the Lions offense.\n\nFor the Ravens, this matchup will be a great test of how good their run offense really is this season, as they face the number one-ranked rushing defense. Lamar Jackson currently leads the team in rushing with 327 yards on the ground to go along with four touchdowns. As great as Lamar is, he is going to need help from guys like Gus Edwards if they want to establish a running game early on. The Lions play a very physical brand of football, and will look for any chance to disrupt the Baltimore run game. If the Ravens want to win this game, they are going to have to take shots down the field. Whether it\u2019s Zay Flowers, Mark Andrews, or even Nelson Agholor, one of them will need to step up in a big way for the Ravens to have any sort of success in the passing game versus the Lions.\n\nFries: Sam LaPorta, Lions tight end\n\nThe rookie out of Iowa has been nothing but a reliable target for Jared Goff this season, catching 69 percent of balls coming his way. In just six games he has already become one of Jared Goff\u2019s favorite targets, but also a fan favorite all across Detroit.\n\nDessert: Give me the Lions in a very close game. The strong defense of the Lions will prove to be too much for Baltimore, making crucial plays down the line. Baltimore will find success in the run game, but they will struggle to succeed in the passing game. At this moment, I trust more of what the Lions have going on, and see them improving to 6-1.\n\nSecond Course | Cleveland Browns (3-2) vs. Indianapolis Colts (3-3), 10 a.m. PDT, CBS\n\nBoth of these teams sit in interesting positions in their respective divisions, both sitting a game behind first place. The Browns sent a statement this past week with a huge win over the 49ers, being their largest upset win since 2010. And Browns fans can\u2019t thank Jim Schwartz enough for transcending this Browns defensive unit into arguably the best in football. They have only allowed 1,002 total yards of offense through five games.\n\nWhether Deshaun Watson plays or not, the Browns\u2019 defense will have to do a lot more of the heavy lifting in this one considering they rank 30th in passing offense. Establishing the run game for the Browns early with Kareem Hunt and Jerome Ford will be important to keeping the defense off the field. It\u2019s now been two weeks since Jonathan Taylor has returned to action, and yet he only has 14 carries through the two appearances. I get there is reason to limit his snaps coming off weeks of not being with the team, but if the Colts want any chance in this game they are going to need to involve the former All-Pro running back a lot more.\n\nMac and Cheese: Myles Garrett, Browns defensive end\n\nWhen considering building a squad around one guy, Myles Garrett is one of the players on the shortlist. He has been nothing but dominant this year with 51\u20442 sacks and 14 quarterback hits. He has even pulled out his basketball moves from time to time this season, dusting offensive linemen with a one-two crossover.\n\nDessert: I am riding with the DAWG POUND in this one. The Browns defense will have its way with Gardner Minshew, forcing him into a lot of uncomfortable situations throughout the game. It won\u2019t be a pretty one by any means. This will be an old-fashioned win from the Browns with a great defense performance and a powerful rushing attack.\n\nThird Course | Philadelphia Eagles (5-1) vs. Miami Dolphins (5-1), 5:20 p.m. PDT, NBC\n\nThe NFL did not disappoint with the Sunday Night game with a battle between two high-power offenses. The game has come a lot easier to Tua this year, which has shown through how efficient the Dolphins have been on offense. On the other side, the Eagles continue to punish teams with the versatile run game they have with Deandre Swift and Jalen Hurts. But what it really comes down to for both teams is the rushing attack of the Dolphins versus the rushing defense of the Eagles.\n\nIn a game like this, it is going to be critical to control the time of possession and keep the opposing offense off the field. The Dolphins have the weapons on the outside with Tyreek Hill and Jalen Waddle to punish the Eagles\u2019 weaker secondary, and being able to control the game via the rushing attack could be a massive bonus. Establishing the attack early and keeping Hurts and the Eagles offense off the field is a key to winning this game.\n\nFor the Eagles, their identity is their rushing attack. But after last week\u2019s performance, it will come down to Hurts protecting the ball. He can not have another three-interception night. But this doesn\u2019t mean they shy away from taking shots, because against a very explosive Dolphins offense, they are going to need AJ Brown and Devonta Smith to make big-time plays to keep up.\n\nGarlic Bread: Tua Tagovailoa, Dolphins quarterback\n\nThe Dolphins could not be more excited with what they have at quarterback right now. All the discussion over the last few years was the Dolphins making a mistake not selecting Justin Herbert fifth overall in the 2021 NFL draft. But right now, Tagovaila has outplayed Herbert, leading the league in passing yards (1,876) and touchdowns (14).\n\nDessert: I am riding with the Fins in this one. The offense has almost looked unstoppable to this point in the season, and against a banged-up Eagles secondary, I expect Waddle or Hill to have a huge game.\n\nLast Weeks\u2019 Record 1-2\nOverall Record 5-7\n\nRECIPE OF THE WEEK\n\nEverybody needs tacos in their life, and this gameday meal satisfies that need. Easy to make and super delicious meal for a perfect day of football. This week\u2019s gameday meal is Mission\u2019s Gameday Street Taco.\n\nIngredients\n1 Mission Street Tacos Flour Tortillas\n1 pound of flank steak, cut into thin strips\n2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce\n1 tablespoon of steak rub\n1 teaspoon of olive oil\n2 avocados\n1 sweet onion\n2 medium tomatoes\n1 lime\n1\u20442 cup cilantro\n1 cup of crumbled blue cheese\n\nDirections\nStep 1 - Slice flank steak into thin strips and add to a bowl with the Worcestershire sauce and steak rub. Toss gently to ensure every strip is perfectly seasoned. Cover and put in the refrigerator to marinate.\nStep 2 - Cut avocados and tomatoes into chunks and add to a bowl. Then, add diced sweet onion and lime juice/ Toss together with cilantro.\nStep 3 - Place the Street Taco Flour Tortillas on the grill to warm them up for 30 seconds.\nStep 4 - Add olive oil to a saut\u00e9 pan and heat to medium-high. Once hot, add marinated flank steak and cook for about 3 minutes.\nStep 5 - Take steak off heat and allow to rest. Add avocado tomato salsa to each tortilla.\nStep 6 - Add cooked steak, sprinkle blue cheese on top, and enjoy!\n```"}

Korean Festival draws hundreds of thousands of people to Koreatown. Here, first-generation immigrants can reconnect with their roots and non-Koreans can get a taste of a unique culture.\n\nAttendees wander past the food stands at the 50th Los Angeles Korean Festival. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBy Ethan Huang and Grant Oh October 19, 2023 at 6:45 pm PDT\n\nIf one walked down Irolo St. in Los Angeles over the weekend, the sound of metal clanging could be heard past the residential area over flaming grills and chatting crowds. Squeezing past the fences, attendees found themselves in a long tunnel of tents. Vendors flanked both sides, calling out in Korean to draw potential customers. Slipping through a side entrance, the sun beat down as the source of the clanging could be seen: a grand stage of performers overlooking vibrantly-colored booths with lines of curious visitors trailing through the park.\n\nHundreds of thousands of attendees made their way to Seoul International Park in L.A. from October 12 to October 15 for the 50th annual Los Angeles Korean Festival. The massive event drew crowds, featuring aromatic barbecue, hundreds of vendors merchandise and performances highlighting Korean culture.\n\nIn 1974, the Los Angeles Korean Festival Foundation was founded and sought to support the immigrant community through a yearly parade that would bring them back to their Korean roots. Although the parade still is a part of the festival, it has grown to become something much more. Now, the event stretches beyond the park, blocking off San Marino St., Normandie Ave. and Irolo St. just for the four-day event. Here, attendees get the opportunity to get a taste of Korean culture.\n\n\u201cI just moved to Koreatown a few months ago,\u201d said Ryan Kim, who attended the event. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see a lot of Korean culture and the different products that all these different businesses are offering and showing off here.\u201d\n\nOn the third day of the festival, Hyojawon Food sold out of their award-winning noodles. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nFrom vendors selling food and snacks that capture the idea of Korean street food, to the vibrant energy coming from the colorful cultural performances, the festival combines tradition and modernity. It ultimately creates an immersive experience that captures the soul of Korea right in the heart of L.A.\n\nBut it is not just local businesses showing up, as the festival\u2019s reach is international. Jiho Kim is a freshman at the University of Southern California, but outside of his studies he works as an interpreter for Gyeongsangbuk-do, a province in South Korea looking to promote tourism in the U.S. He wandered the festival, asking attendees to fill out a survey in exchange for a bag full of fliers and a free travel bag. He speaks on his experience at the event.\n\n\u201cBesides the weather, it was really hot, I think the event itself was like a ten out of ten,\u201d said Jiho Kim. \u201cGood food, good small businesses from Korea, good music, obviously.\u201d\n\nAttendees line up to play a game by SodaGift to win prizes. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nA major driving force behind the festival is the goal to help first-generation immigrants build a connection with their home country. Jake Kim\u2019s business represents this very idea. He is the U.S. CEO of SodaGift, a business focused on making shipping goods internationally more accessible.\n\n\u201cAnyone living in the U.S., we send gifts to their loved ones in Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my first time having a booth here. I didn\u2019t expect this much crowd, so I\u2019m really satisfied with how everything is going right now... I\u2019m also surprised there are so many Koreans living in L.A., also, it\u2019s so nice to see non-Korean people trying to experience Korean culture as well.\u201d\n\nFor a four-day event, it might seem like that planning would be a job once a year, but it is quite the opposite. Across the street from the park lies a grand, old building with Korean-style architecture colored in orange and green. Inside the Koreatown Senior and Community Center lies a cluttered office where a team of organizers work tirelessly to keep the festival running. L.A. Korean Festival Foundation Executive Director Hanna Yoon sits in front of a desk full of documents. Between filling out paperwork and responding to security concerns on her walkie-talkie, she speaks on the road leading to the yearly festivities.\n\n\u201cI am here nonstop, working for a whole year to prepare for this one event,\u201d said Yoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hours, especially with going back and forth with vendors and Korea, different times, lots of emails and two different languages.\u201d\n\nInside the Koreatown Senior and Community Center, Yoon and her team work to manage the festival. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nTo Yoon, this work is personal and sees this as a major way that the Korean community L.A. can share their culture generationally.\n\n\u201cMy husband used to come to the Korean festival,\u201d said Yoon. \u201cA lot of people who grow up with it, they call it \u2018jangso,\u2019 which means marketplace. He grew up coming here when he was younger, he would come here with his friends and family, and now I have an eight-year-old and she comes here and she\u2019s been here every year since.\u201d\n\nTheir family is like many others whose grandparents grew up with the festival and now bring their children and grandchildren to share in the festivities. With this 50-year milestone, Yoon still feels satisfied with the growing influence of the event, even with the amount of planning put into it.\n\n\u201cI think that all in itself, it is pretty rewarding, and it\u2019s good to go out there just to see people enjoying themselves,\u201d said Yoon. \u201cBeing able to see different diverse communities come together, enjoying and embracing what Korea and American culture is all about.\u201d\n\nThe KOA Jean Ballet School performs on stage at the L.A. Korean Festival. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nThis cross-cultural appeal has drawn new vendors and attendees alike. Ivan Garcia Contreras works for El Dorado and Hustler Casino. Attendees lined up to spin a large prize wheel as Contreras handed out free tote bags. He says that he enjoys meeting new people while getting to experience a different culture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a good culture mix,\u201d said Contreras. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen any of this stuff. I did buy one thing called cinnamon punch, and it was like a Korean drink and it was delicious. Absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nIn expanding this audience, the vendors themselves have the chance to broaden their cultural reach. USC students might be familiar with Aloha Catering Services, which frequents the weekly Trojan Farmers Market. Eugene Hong is the owner of the business and has been a part of the L.A. Korean Festival since 2001. One can delight in the tantalizing blend of smoky barbecue with a touch of Hawaiian flair, sure to make their mouthwatering experience simply unforgettable.\n\nA member of Aloha Catering Services' staff grills chicken behind their booth. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBeing born and raised in Hawaii from a Korean background, he took the opportunity to combine their cultural flavors.\n\n\u201cI look at it as a great way to diversify, to expand,\u201d said Hong. \u201cKorean culture with food is the best way to share culture as Koreans, we sit down and Koreans are very festive, they\u2019re very cultural, they love to drink and talk.\u201d\n\nHowever, his food has a bit of a twist. To Hong, this is a representation of his approach to sharing his culture.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in Hawaii, living in Hawaii, we get accustomed to many cultures because it\u2019s a melting pot,\u201d Hong said. \u201cYou have the Japanese, the Filipinos, the Koreans, they all came in during the plantation about a hundred years ago or more. So, what happened is that that culture meshed together, and became like this local culture that we have.\u201d\n\nAttendees walk through a row of the Korean food stands (Photo by Grant Oh)\n\nIn its 50th year, the L.A. Korean Festival stands as a testament to the cultural bridge it has built throughout the city, helping others immerse themselves into the tapestry of Korean heritage. As the traditional performances and the delectable Korean delicacies faded into its last night, the festival\u2019s legacy still continues to foster a deep appreciation for diversity and cultural unity in the city. With each year, the festival has not only celebrated the past but it also paved a future where the spirited colors and flavors of Korean culture continue to spread throughout the mosaic of Los Angeles.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/10/19/fantasy-football-start-em-sit-em-week-7/", "response": "```\nFantasy football start \u2018em sit \u2018em, Week 7\n\nLogan Drone is back after a week off to give you his best fantasy plays for NFL Week 7.\n\nWeek 6\u2032s slate of NFL action proved that the unbeatable can be beaten, but the defeated remain defeated. The Jets and Browns pulled off the unthinkable Sunday, upsetting the Eagles and 49ers in dramatic fashion while the Panthers remained winless behind rookie quarterback Bryce Young, who some are already calling a bust. While the NFL season proves to be unpredictable week in and week out, teams get a chance to regroup during their respective bye weeks, and that\u2019s what I did last week. Let\u2019s take a look at how I fared in Week 5 before my bye week:\n\nThe Good: Finally, I have a lot of good to report back. Last week\u2019s running back predictions were spot on aside from Zach Moss. David Montgomery, Alvin Kamara and Breece Hall all finished in the top ten, while Miles Sanders and Jonathan Taylor failed to exceed more than five fantasy points. Puka Nacua proved that he\u2019s still an elite fantasy option even with Cooper Kupp back, finishing with more than 20 fantasy points for the fourth time this season. At the tight end position, Darren Waller bounced back against the Dolphins with a top-ten performance while Hunter Henry failed to record a single catch against a Saints defense that always gives trouble to tight ends.\n\nThe Bad: Anthony Richardson and Daniel Jones had shortened Sundays after leaving their respective games early due to injury. As a result, both quarterbacks finished outside the top 20 for the week. Zach Moss ran all over the Titans defense, finishing with two touchdowns and 195 total yards, good for running back two on the week.\n\nThe Roman Empire wasn\u2019t built overnight (though it still fascinates me every second). It started with a few bricks and then built its way up. I\u2019ve had two weeks to cook to create my favorite picks yet. Let\u2019s build on Week 5\u2032s performance and keep this hot streak firing with this week\u2019s Week 7 Start \u2018Em Sit \u2018Em.\n\nFor the rest of last week\u2019s results, look at the bottom of the article.\n\nQuarterback\nSTART: Brock Purdy (SF) @ MIN\nBrock Purdy looked human last Sunday after losing both Deebo Samuel and Christian McCaffrey to injury, allowing his first turnover while failing to come back against the then 2-2 Browns. Fortunately for Purdy, he isn\u2019t going to face the top-three Browns defense every week, and coming off his first loss as a starter, Purdy has a great bounce-back opportunity this week against the Vikings. The Vikings have allowed the sixth-most FPPG to quarterbacks this season and after dropping less than eight points last week, I expect a twenty-piece from Purdy this week.\n\nSIT: Kirk Cousins (MIN) vs. SF\nOn the other side of the ball, Kirk Cousins faces his first difficult matchup without top receiver Justin Jefferson, as the 49ers have allowed the fourth-fewest FPPG to quarterbacks this season. While Kirk will likely have a negative game script throwing the ball a ton, I envision Cousins struggling from the pressure from Nick Bosa and the 49ers, yielding a poor performance in fantasy for the Vikings quarterback.\n\nSnoozer: Jordan Love (GB) @ DEN\nComing off a bye, the Packers travel to Denver to face the worst defense in football so far this season. With an amazing matchup and extra rest, I expect Jordan Love to cook against the Broncos who have allowed the third-most FPPG to quarterbacks this season. The Packers need a bounce-back win after losing to the Raiders in Week 5, and they get the perfect opportunity to do just that against the Broncos this week.\n\nRunning back\nSTART: Aaron Jones (GB) @ DEN\nStaying in Denver, Aaron Jones should finally be healthy after nursing a hamstring injury since Week 1 and while he may be limited while he works his way back, Jones is still a must-start in fantasy. The Broncos have allowed the most FPPG to running backs this season and are top five in most explosive plays allowed. Don\u2019t overthink this one. If Jones plays, he will finish as a top-ten running back on the week.\n\nSIT: Najee Harris (PIT) @ LAR\nNajee Harris has been a shell of his former self this season and while he may seem like an enticing start coming off a bye, it\u2019d probably be best to keep him on your bench. Harris has virtually been splitting carries 50/50 with Jaylen Warren all season and this will likely remain the same coming off bye. The Rams have allowed the sixth-fewest FPPG to running backs this season, so expect another dud from Harris this week.\n\nSTART: Brian Robinson Jr. (WSH) @ NYG\nOver the last three weeks, Brian Robinson Jr.\u2019s upside has skyrocketed as he\u2019s getting utilized more in the passing game, hauling in eight catches over his last three games. This week, the Commanders square off against the Giants, who have allowed the third most YPG and seventh most FPPG to running backs this season. In a game where Robinson Jr. will be fed both through the air and on the ground, I expect a big performance from the back out of Alabama.\n\nSIT: Rachaad White (TB) vs. ATL\nRachaad White fared poorly last week against the difficult Lions rush defense and this week he gets treated with an equally hard matchup against the Falcons, who have allowed the third fewest FPPG to running backs this season. After splitting carries last week with Ke\u2019Shawn Vaughn, White\u2019s fantasy output took a drastic hit, and with another difficult matchup, you\u2019d be better off keeping White on your bench.\n\nSnoozer: Javonte Williams (DEN) vs. GB\nThis pick is risky considering Williams hasn\u2019t eclipsed ten points once this year, but with a favorable matchup against the Packers in Week 7, I\u2019m buying the bait. Williams has been extremely disappointing to start the season but he\u2019s been most promising in the pass game. The Packers have given up the fifth-most FPPG to running backs this season, allowing more than six receptions per game to the position. With a very favorable matchup, I anticipate Williams surpassing double-digit points for the first time this season.\n\nWide receiver\nSTART: Brandon Aiyuk (SF) @ MIN\nThe 49ers need a huge bounce-back performance, and with Christian McCaffrey nursing an oblique injury, Purdy is going to need to rely on his go-to target in Aiyuk. The Vikings are bottom three in FPPG to receivers this season, and I expect that to continue with a successful showing for Aiyuk. Purdy just lost his first game as an NFL starter; expect him to come out slinging to his favorite receiver.\n\nSIT: Michael Pittman (IND) vs. CLE\nThe Colts just announced that starter Anthony Richardson is out indefinitely after undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery, meaning it\u2019s Minshew Mania in Indianapolis! Michael Pittman has looked good with Minshew to start this season \u2013 yielding multiple games with double-digit targets \u2013 but facing a Browns secondary that\u2019s allowed the fewest FPPG to receivers this season, I expect Minshew and Pittman alike to struggle.\n\nSTART: Marquise Brown (ARI) @ SEA\nMarquise Brown has struggled in step with his team over the past two weeks, hauling in just four catches per game over the team\u2019s last two losses. But this week, Brown and the Cardinals welcome a favorable matchup against a weak Seahawks secondary that\u2019s allowed the most FPPG to receivers this season. Brown has seen double-digit targets in four of his last five weeks, so the volume is there, and I expect the production to finally hit this week against Seattle.\n\nSIT: Courtland Sutton (DEN) vs. GB\nThe Broncos receiving core is extremely hard to trust in fantasy with Russell Wilson under center. Wilson spreads the ball around, targeting eight or more receivers every game so far this season. This week, Sutton enters Green Bay to likely matchup against Jaire Alexander, and the Packers have allowed the seventh-fewest FPPG to receivers this season. With Wilson already distributing the rock a ton, I would not be surprised if he looks past Sutton frequently if he\u2019s draped by Alexander.\n\nSnoozer: Rashee Rice (KC) @ LAR\nRashee Rice has slowly turned into one of Mahomes\u2019 most reliable options on offense, netting five or more targets in three of his last four games. After getting his second-highest snap count of the season in Week 6, Rice\u2019s usage is only going to increase as the season progresses. Facing the Chargers in Week 7, who have allowed the third-most FPPG to receivers this season, I expect Rice to feast for his first breakout game of the season.\n\nTight end\nSTART: Pat Freiermuth (PIT) @ LAR\nThe Steelers have had two weeks to prepare and scheme for the Rams after coming off a bye, and I expect them to come out slinging through the air to exploit the Rams\u2019 weakness: their secondary. The Rams have allowed the third-most FPPG and second-most yards to tight ends this season and I anticipate the Steelers utilizing Freiermuth heavily for those reasons, yielding a big fantasy performance.\n\nSIT: Evan Engram (JAX) @ NO\nEvan Engram is gonna be hard to pull from your lineups as he\u2019s received seven or more targets every week since Week 2, but in Week 7 Engram faces the Saints who have allowed the second-fewest receptions to tight ends this season. In a game where the Jaguars will likely hold the lead and not need to throw, I envision a weak performance from Engram against the Saints who allowed the fewest fantasy points to opposing tight ends last season.\n\nSnoozer: David Njoku (CLE) @ IND\nDavid Njoku saw his second-highest snap count of the season in Week 6 and with Deshaun Watson back this week, Njoku\u2019s volume is only going to increase. The Browns square off against the Colts in Week 7, who have allowed the ninth most FPPG to tight ends this season. With a favorable matchup and more usage weekly, Njoku is a great streaming option for Week 7.\n\nWeek 5 Results\nQuarterback\nSTART: Anthony Richardson (4.42, QB28)\nSIT: Trevor Lawrence (15.7, QB16)\nSnoozer: Daniel Jones (7.16, QB24)\n\nRunning Back\nSTART: David Montgomery (20.9, RB5)\nSIT: Miles Sanders (1.2, RB64)\nSTART: Alvin Kamara (18.7, RB7)\nSIT: Zach Moss (33.5, RB2)\nSIT: Jonathan Taylor (4.4, RB42)\nSnoozer: Breece Hall (28.4, RB3)\n\nWide Receiver\nSTART: Puka Nacua (20.1, WR11)\nSIT: Jerry Jeudy (11.0, WR29)\nSTART: Zay Flowers (12.3, WR25)\nSIT: Deebo Samuel (11.5, WR27)\nSnoozer: Christian Watson (11.6, WR26)\n\nTight End\nSTART: Darren Waller (16.6, TE7)\nSIT: Hunter Henry (0.0, TE55)\nSnoozer: Hayden Hurst (5.1, TE24)\n```"}

The goal was canceled due to a foul. (AP Photo/Kyusung Gong)\n\nBy Michelle Chavez\nOctober 19, 2023 at 5:24 pm PDT\n\nThe Historic Game Recap: 5-1 Angel City FC v Portland Thorns FC\nOctober 15, 2023\nBMO Stadium\nLos Angeles, California\n\nFor the first time since the club\u2019s inaugural season in 2022, Angel City Football Club is heading into the National Women\u2019s Soccer League playoffs after a win that moved Angel City up from eighth to fifth place. It managed to be included in the top six teams that will play for the coveted National Women\u2019s Soccer League Championship trophy. The game included the most one-sided result in the franchise\u2019s history and arguably the most dominant performance the team has had all season.\n\nSummary of Angel City FC 23-24 season\nThe season started off rocky for the newly playoff-qualified team as they suffered from a 2-6-2 record under former coach Freya Coombe who was fired in June. Under the guidance of interim coach Becki Tweed, Angel City embarked on a late-season comeback which led them to lose only one game in 11 regular-season matches. Bringing their overall record to 8-7-7, the Angels earned 5th place on the table with 31 points. For the past 11 games, ACFC has fought hard knowing that each match was essential to closing the point gaps and bringing them closer to a playoff spot. The consistency has not gone unnoticed by fans as the team has climbed their way up the league table and shown improvement in every aspect of their game. Angel City is no stranger to showing up and showing out as the team boasted the highest attendance in the NWSL last season. This year has seen similar numbers bringing an average of 19,690 fans per game, the second-highest average behind the San Diego Wave FC.\n\nPreview of Angel City vs OL Reign Playoffs Quarter Final\nThis Friday, October 15, at 7:00 p.m. Pacific, Angel City is traveling to Seattle, Washington to face the OL Reign in the NWSL Playoffs Quarter Final. The last time the two teams faced off it was Angel City that came out victorious with a 2-1 win. The match featured goals from Clarisse Le Bihan and Madison Hammond in the 13th and 57th minutes while Megan Rapinoe put OL Reign on the board with a penalty shot in the 74th minute. This time around it will be up to Angel City to continue the momentum they\u2019ve been building during the second half of the season. The OL Reign has been able to adapt to opponents in ways that few NWSL teams have. They often play in a 4-2-3-1 shape and use mid-block defending and high pressing against opponents. Meagan Rapinoe is the usual conductor for attack flows on the wing while forward Jordan Huitema continues to be a league leader in blocks, tackles, and clearances. Meanwhile, Bethany Balcer continues to lead in goals. Defensively OL Reign will most likely stick with what\u2019s been working for them: center back Alana Cook, Emily Sonnet, Lauren Barnes and Quinn.\u2019 They should also consider utilizing rookie star center back Shae Holmes who didn\u2019t play against Chicago last match but was named to the  2023 UKG NWSL Challenge Cup All-Tournament  Team and has landed 100% of tackles, registered eight blocks and connected 225 passes in seven matches. Laura Havery\u2019s side is considered to have one of the best defenses in the league so Angel City will need to maintain a strong attacking front utilizing power forwards Sydney Leroux and Claire Emslie while keeping the midfield and defense locked in with Savannah McCaskill, Sarah Gorden and M.A Vignola. Much like OL Reign, ACFC is expected to use the 4-2-3-1 formation throughout the game. In addition, GK Angelina Anderson will need to continue to serve as a wall blocking shots and conceding the least amount of goals possible, just like she did against the Portland Thorns. Keeping the momentum of the season going, ACFC must continue to push the same amount, if not more, of energy and keep possession of the ball. The winner of Friday\u2019s match will face up against the San Diego Wave on November 5th for the NWSL Semifinals matches.\n\nPlayers to keep a lookout for as AFCF heads into the quarterfinals\nAngel City\u2019s roster features ten players who played for the at the 2023 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup, four of whom represented the United States National Women\u2019s Team. Although the starting lineup for Friday\u2019s match hasn\u2019t been released yet, here are some players to keep an eye out for as the team works to come home victorious. Alyssa Thompson: The 18-year-old midfielder is currently the team\u2019s lead goal scorer having scored 4 goals this season along with 1 assist. Having assisted with Jun Endo\u2019s goal in the 80th minute against the Thorns on Sunday, she\u2019s shown she has all the components of a star. Thompson\u2019s skills have also led her to become the second NWSL player to sign a $1 million contract. Alyssa Thompson has also recently been selected to join the USWNT\u2019s roster for friendlies against Colombia next week on October 26th and 29th. Savannah McCaskill: While the superstar is set to become a free agent at the end of this season, she has begun to define the young club with her passion, grit, and ability to execute passes and drives as a fundamental midfielder. With four goals and three assists, McCaskill is a regular starter and has shown she can benefit the club whenever and wherever she steps onto the pitch. M.A. Vingola: Much can be said about the full-back who made an impact on the field in each of the 1198 minutes she\u2019s played this season. In her second season, she started 15 of the 18 games she played, making three goals and completing 303 successful passes proving to be arguably one of the best defenders in the league right now. She will be  joining Thompson on the USWNT  in a friendly against Colombia later this month. Jun Endo: A forward for Angel City and the Japanese Women\u2019s National Football Team, Jun Endo has started 10 of the 17 games she\u2019s played in this season. She\u2019s made three goals from inside the box, has two assists, and has made 255 successful passes so far.\n\nJoin the Celebrations\nAs preparation for the first game of playoffs is underway, Angel City FC will be hosting two watch parties on Friday, Oct. 20th for fans to show their support for the team as they face OL Reign in Seattle, Washington. Both watch parties will begin at 6 pm while kickoff for the match is scheduled for 7 pm. The watch parties will be held at 33 Taps Silver Lake at 3725 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90026 and 33 Taps Culver City at 9739 Culver Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232.

Expand Austin Ekeler failed to impress in his return from injury with only 27 yards on 14 carries.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Joe Glorioso/All-Pro Reels\n\nBy Ben Cohen October 19, 2023 at 5:17 pm PDT\n\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Despite an off-day from their star quarterback, the Chargers again found themselves with an opportunity to tie or win a one-score game, but a late interception by Justin Herbert sealed a 20-17 loss to the Cowboys. Immediately following the two-minute warning, Herbert was sacked by Micah Parsons after the two-time All-Pro burst through the middle of the Chargers\u2019 pass protection to register his first sack of the night. On the next play, the Cowboys again got pressure and Herbert was intercepted, ending the game and sending L.A. to 2-3.\n\n\u201cI think our offense gave us a chance, this was just a really tough game,\u201d said head coach Brandon Staley after the loss. \u201cWhen you have two teams like this that have that much talent on the field, it\u2019s gonna be really close.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers started well in both phases, forcing a three-and-out on the Cowboys\u2019 opening drive, then driving down the field and scoring on a one-yard touchdown pass to Keenan Allen. But, the Cowboys answered fast, tying the game 7-7. Each team\u2019s defense sturdied up from there, though, with just six total points being scored in the second and third quarters. L.A.\u2019s defense held Tony Pollard to two yards per carry, with another standout performance from linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr., who led the team with nine tackles.\n\n\u201cI thought, defensively, we played well enough to win,\u201d Staley said. The Chargers sacked quarterback Dak Prescott five times while Herbert was dropped just once, but again L.A. fell when it mattered most.\n\nAfter three quarters, the Chargers had held the Cowboys to just two conversions on nine third downs, but failed to stop Dallas on four key third downs in the fourth quarter that ultimately decided the game. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Tony Pollard caught a pass for a first down on third-and-11 before breaking a tackle for sixty yards, setting Dallas up in the Red Zone for an eventual go-ahead TD. Then, on their next and final possession, the Cowboys converted on all three of their third down attempts, one of which came via a costly Chargers penalty.\n\nPenalties defined the night, with Dallas taking eleven for 85 yards while L.A. took nine for 79, including two unnecessary roughness penalties against safety Derwin James. James now leads the league in personal fouls with four, though Staley declined to comment on whether he was concerned about the All-Pro\u2019s discipline.\n\nAs is becoming a theme for L.A., Staley\u2019s team played well enough to win in many facets, hanging with one of the best teams in the NFL. But in the clutch, the Cowboys stepped up while the Chargers faltered. When asked about his team\u2019s late-game struggles after the loss, Staley instead praised his defense, citing that L.A.\u2019s is one of the top third-down defenses in the NFL.\n\n\u201cI thought we pressured the quarterback at a high level, but Dak [Prescott] made a couple plays on that last drive and it hurt us,\u201d he said. Wide receiver Joshua Palmer was active despite being questionable with a groin injury, making an incredible one-handed catch in addition to a productive game all-around, while Keenan Allen again showed he is one of the premier wideouts in the league with seven receptions for 85 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBut unlike previous games this season, Herbert failed to find his receivers consistently against Dallas. His 59 percent completion was well below his season and career averages, and a late-game INT cost L.A. the game. The former Oregon Duck twice missed a wide-open Allen on plays that might\u2019ve easily resulted in touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI missed a couple receivers, threw some bad passes,\u201d said Herbert. \u201cThere was a lot left out there, so there\u2019s a lot to work on and a lot to improve on.\u201d\n\nStaley was reluctant to blame Herbert for the loss, and insisted that it wasn\u2019t all bad from his star quarterback. \u201c[Herbert] missed Keenan [Allen] on the double move, but that\u2019s just part of ball. He definitely gave us a chance to win in the game, he competed and we were right there at the end. We\u2019ve got to put this one behind us and get moving.\u201d\n\nAfter coming out of their bye week to a crushing loss, the Chargers will look to Austin Ekeler to get the ground game going as they prepare to play the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium this Sunday. Ekeler returned from injury against Dallas, but not before taking a punch from Cowboys\u2019 Dante Fowler in a pregame brawl during warmups. After an incredible Week 1 performance and subsequent ankle injury, Ekeler rushed for just 27 yards on 14 carries to go along with 35 receiving yards.\n\n\u201cIt takes all eleven people,\u201d Staley said on the Chargers\u2019 struggling running game. \u201cWe\u2019re a work in progress, but we definitely didn\u2019t play well enough at the line of scrimmage and we have to improve.\u201d\n\nStill, the Chargers have plenty of reasons to be hopeful of an upset this week. Though Patrick Mahomes has lost just eight home games in his career, three have come at the hands of the Chargers, more than any other team.) After superstar tight end Travis Kelce, the Chiefs don\u2019t have another proven receiving option. Having slowed down Pollard, if L.A. can do the same to Chiefs running back Pacheco it can give its pass rushers more opportunities against a Chiefs offensive line whose interior is a strength, but is susceptible to pressure from the edge. Kansas City\u2019s defense is much improved this season, ranking second in the league in points allowed per game according to ESPN, but Justin Herbert averages 290 yards and 2.5 touchdowns per game against the Chiefs in his career.\n\nStaring down the possibility of a 2-4 start, I like the Chargers to pull off the upset this week.\n```"}

The show opened with SavageRealm, Lil Toe and Kenny Beats. Kenny Beats performs as the last opener before Joji takes the stage. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nBefore he was known as Joji, George Miller went by two pseudonyms, Pink Guy and Filthy Frank. He launched a YouTube channel with his Filthy Frank persona, which consisted of different challenges and rap songs. With this, Pink Guy was his eccentric dancing and singing alter-ego. Before shelving his YouTube channel, Joji put out an album under Pink Guy which ended up hitting number nine on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums. In 2017, Joji joined 88rising, a music collective that supports artists of Asian descent. He went on to release several songs and had his first live performance as Joji during the same year. In November of that year, he released his EP, In Tongues, and the rest was history.\n\nKicking things off in Texas, Joji\u2019s Pandemonium Fall World tour encompasses most of the states before making its way to Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and more. The much anticipated tour is leading many fans to believe that this could result in the making of a new album very soon.\n\nAfter a night of emotions and eye-catching visuals that left people satisfied, Joji showed his appreciation for L.A. multiple times throughout the show. \u201cYou guys here in L.A. are crazy,\u201d he said on stage. \u201cThis crowd is just so awesome.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheers and sings along as Joji takes the stage for the night.

He just makes you feel whole at the end.\u201d\n\nAside from the setlist and the high emotions in the arena, the visuals were another aspect of Joji\u2019s set that people took note of. All the visuals on stage turn orange as Joji sings \u201cDaylight.\u201d (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\n\u201cI loved the visuals, the cubes, like the optical illusions going on,\u201d said Kure. \u201cThat was really good.\u201d\n\nThe stage consisted of multiple cubes, which were used as projectors to change visuals for each song and as reflectors throughout the night. They were also used as boxes for the musicians to stand on. At the beginning of the show, the center cube rose up to reveal Joji to the crowd. Joji\u2019s set consisted of multiple cubes on stage that rose up to the top. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nBrown acknowledges this as well, saying that the effects elevated Joji\u2019s on-stage presence and brought the show to life. \u201cI think the on-stage presence of him and then also just the effects that are on stage just feel very alive,\u201d said Brown.\n\nBoth Kure and Brown agree that the overall energy of Joji at the Crypto.com Arena is what really brought this show to life and left them with a sense of fulfillment. \u201cI feel like we were surrounded by people who were passionate about the music, which made the whole energy just feel so wholesome and safe,\u201d said Kure. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of mutually feeling the same, that kind of brings us together as a whole.

(Photo by Marta Lavandier, AP)\n\nBy Valeria S Macias October 19, 2023 at 2:33 pm PDT\n\nAfter his 2022 worldwide hit album, \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d lasted 13 non-consecutive weeks on Billboard\u2019s Hot 200, Bad Bunny had no recent mentions of a new album. Now, after releasing his album on Oct. 13, the artist announced a tour today, Oct. 19.\n\nBad Bunny started off his career in 2016 during the peak of trap reggaeton music with his hit songs \u201cSoy Peor,\u201d \u201cT\u00fa No Metes Cabra,\u201d and \u201cChambea.\u201d Then, in 2019, he transitioned into modern reggaeton with a Caribbean influence and dembow beats. Now, \u2018Benito\u2019 became his new persona, leaving behind the Trap Bunny so many original fans grew to love.\n\nAfter months of teasing new trap music, Bad Bunny finally fulfilled his promises and delivered an album filled with nostalgia for the 2016 Benito Ocasi\u00f3 Martinez. \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d is characterized by its Spanish language rap fused with reggae. Similarly to his early single, \u201cWhere She Goes,\u201d some of the new album\u2019s songs include Jersey Club and electronic beats.\n\nThe album is filled with much of Bad Bunny\u2019s responses to the public after a year of scandals and backlash from his fans. Benito spills it all from addressing his highly critiqued romance with Kendall Jenner, the comparisons between him and reggaeton legends like Don Omar and Daddy Yankee, a public lawsuit filed against him by his ex-fianc\u00e9, to a response about why he threw a fan\u2019s phone earlier this year.\n\nBefore the release, Bad Bunny sold out Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest stadium, El Choliseo, in under 30 minutes for his listening party. In the scheduled midnight show on Thursday night, many Latin celebrities made their way to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Artists like Young Miko, Feid, Arc\u00e1ngel, and Mora were in attendance and later were confirmed to be on the new album.\n\nAnother eye-turning attendee at the listening party was Gabriela Berlingeri - Bad Bunny\u2019s ex and muse for many of his songs. Fans were surprised as she reposted his video announcement with the caption \u201cFuap\u201d - a Puerto Rican way of saying \u201cboom.\u201d Gabriela is also mentioned on one of the last album tracks in which Bad Bunny thanks everyone who has been by his side.\n\nFor older fans, the name of Carliz De La Cruz Hernandez will stir up some emotions. Despite the public four-year-long relationship with Gabriela, Bad Bunny was once engaged. He and Carliz began dating in 2011, and five years later, he proposed. However, the wedding was called off two months before as there was speculation that he was cheating. The two publicly said they called it quits once she was accepted into law school and he was signed to his first record label with Rimas Music.\n\nNothing of the two had been heard since 2016. That was until Carliz filed a lawsuit against Bad Bunny for the recording of her voice in his song \u201cDos Mil 16\u2032\u2032. After negotiating to buy the audio clip, Carliz rejected the $20,000 offer in hopes of stopping being associated with him. Yet, Bad Bunny still ran with it and played it throughout his \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d tour.\n\nBenito mentions her in various of his new songs. \u201cUna vez me iba a casar. Gracias a Dios que no, wow, diablo, pero casi,\u201d he says in his song \u201cNo Me Quiero Casar\u201d. On his other song, \u201cLos Pits,\u201d Bad Bunny adds a line about the lawsuit over the audio file, \u201cAhora estas charras demandan porque me vierron en Forbe\u2019. Ya cogiste tu sonido, espero que te conforme\u201d.\n\nCarliz clapped back with a selfie on her Instagram story and song lyrics saying \u201cdame banda\u201d - slang for \u201cleave me alone.\u201d\n\nThe recent album has stirred up commotion as many disses are made to other artists in the genre. Benito called out his former music partner, J Balvin, after they both produced the hit album \u201cOasis.\u201d In his 18th track, he says, \u201cUstedes me han visto con los mismo mientras ustedes son amigos con todo el mundo. Como Balvin\u201d.\n\nIn good spirit, J Balvin replied to this line on his live stream saying, \u201cno s\u00e9 porqu\u00e9 Bad Bunny hizo eso, hicimos una buena dupla, yo lo recuerdo como una buena persona y deseo que la rompa con el \u00e1lbum\u201d.\n\nBad Bunny even sneak dissed Karol G on \u201cVuelve Candy B,\u201d which surprised many as her boyfriend, Feid, is later featured on the album. The line says, \u201cEy, vengo de PR, de donde son la\u2019 verdadera\u2019 bichota\u201d. The slang term bichota deviates from the Puerto Rican word bichote, which Bad Bunny has a song about in an earlier album. However, the word was rebranded by Karol G and is her moniker.\n\nAlthough not explicitly mentioned, Shakira is shaded briefly in the song \u201cLos Pits.\u201d As a result of her recent public divorce, Shakira delivered the iconic line \u201cLas mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan\u201d in her woman anthem with Bizzarap. However, Bad Bunny reversed those lyrics into his own, \u201cAhora los hombres lloran, si. Pero sin parar de facturar\u201d. This caused a backlash from many fans as the two were part of the Latino representation in the 2020 Super Bowl Halftime, in which Shakira invited Bad Bunny onstage during the earlier stages of his career.\n\nHowever, Shakira recently posted a screenshot of those same lyrics and tagged Bad Bunny with the caption, \u201cFacturemos juntos entonces!\u201d\n\nDespite the criticism from fans in the reggaeton community, Bad Bunny continues to rise to the top of the charts and maintain his reign. On the same day of its release, \u201cNadien Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d became Spotify\u2019s most-streamed album in a single day in all of 2023. It became the fourth-biggest album debut in Spotify history, with third place being another Bad Bunny album, Un Verano Sin Ti.\n\nThe album reached nearly 146 million first-day streams on the global Spotify charts. Bad Bunny even broke the record for the biggest streaming day for any male artist, with 195 million streams. He\u2019s the first-ever Latin artist to top charts in European countries like the United Kingdom and France.\n\nThe album was No. 1 in over 24 countries all around the world, according to Apple Music. Even in Latin music, Benito is undefeated. He is the Latin artist with the most No. 1 songs on U.S. Spotify with six of his songs. He\u2019s had the biggest Latin album debuts on Spotify Global Chart history with four out of his seven albums.\n\nFor the first time in history, Spotify Global was seized by all Spanish songs - all being tracks on Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana.\n\nBad Bunny is undeniably globalizing reggaeton music with his hit songs and record-breaking tours. The artist hinted at his new album during his listening party on Friday, Oct. 13 at midnight. \u201cCuando se sepan la(s) canciones me avisan para hacer el concierto\u201d, were some of the only words shared by him at the event.\n```"}

Sebasti\u00e1n Silva wants to show you everything the studios will not: lots of full-frontal male nudity and liberal drug use all tied up into a twisting murder mystery.\n\nWhen speaking about the film at a USC screening, Silva said that he was interested in showing the pores and the sweat of his characters in a way that was \u201calmost grotesque.\u201d During the Q&A, he captured the audience almost as much as his film did with his charisma and reckless abandon.\n\nThe film begins with observations about the malaise of modern life through the use of technology, as Silva stars as an exaggerated version of himself. Silva is a Chilean filmmaker who prefers to work from his personal experiences in the most honest way he can. His character is first seen Googling himself, looking despondent as a human defecates in the park followed by his dog Chima attempting to eat it at the Plaza R\u00edo de Janeiro, a park in Mexico City.\n\nOnce we return to his chic, open-concept artist\u2019s loft, we are introduced to his landlord, Mateo (Mateo Riestra), and the maid of the complex, Vero (Catalina Saavedra). Saavedra brings complete sincerity to the role where it never feels like a performance. Described as \u201cunprecious\u201d by the director, the Chilean actress first showcased her tightly modulated acting chops in Silva\u2019s esteemed project, \u201cThe Maid.\u201d She holds nothing back in her delivery. She brings blood, sweat and tears to her character\u2019s complex unraveling.\n\nFor the sake of authenticity, he wanted to hire a Mexican actress for the role in \u201cRotting in the Sun.\u201d Yet, Saavedra proved she could master the proper accent which won Silva over in the end.\n\nMimicking his real-life experiences at the time, Silva works as a painter, watches Chima, reads a comically existentialist book and snorts copious amounts of ketamine. He talks openly and frequently about committing suicide by taking rat poison called Pentobarbital until he is encouraged by a friend to visit a gay nude beach. This is where he meets Jordan Firstman\u2019s character, also playing himself, with whom he eventually decides to work on an HBO project.\n\nThe real-life introduction between Firstman and Silva inspired their character\u2019s on-screen meet-cute: while visiting Mexico City, the two met and Firstman expressed being a fan of one of Silva\u2019s films. Silva was looking for a \u201cgringo\u201d to add to the story, and while at the USC screening, he described Firstman as \u201ctalking over everyone, showing off his Instagram\u201d and he thought, \u201cThis is the \u2018gringo\u2019 I need.\u201d\n\nSilva is an engaging and uninhibited storyteller. He would frequently wave his arms around expressively, taking the microphone with him. In the film, Firstman makes plans to visit Silva, but by the time he arrives, something has gone terribly wrong. We spend the latter part of the film with Vero, Mateo and Firstman as the three attempt to navigate Silva\u2019s disappearance.\n\nThe film plays so naturally and effortlessly that it feels like it was all improvised, but the director reassured the audience at the Q&A that the script was sharply written and they stuck to it fully. It was fun to see Jordan Firstman charm in his first major on-screen role, but Saavedra as Vero takes center stage and steals the show. Moving between moments of restraint and fervor, we experience the second portion of the film through her vantage point. She brings a silent intensity that boils as she continues to maneuver through the escalating circumstances.\n\nSilva covers plenty of themes in \u201cRotting in the Sun,\u201d most notably turning the spotlight onto himself. Rather than mocking easy targets, he, as a gay man, pokes fun at his own culture. He felt this approach would be more interesting. He captures the restlessness and anxiety that comes with the prevalence of technology in such an intentional way, as he shows himself seeking validation from his online presence and doom scrolling through innocuous Instagram videos.\n\nHe also collaborated with his friend Martine Gutierrez, an American performance artist who plays a less successful one in the film. Together they came up with a comedic exhibit for her character. At the screening, Silva described it as \u201csh\u2014y art which exploits transness for a mediocre purpose.\u201d He explained that it was \u201cso obvious and on the nose and dumb\u201d and this small moment in the film illustrates his nuanced approach to comedy.\n\nSilva charmed a giggling audience with his fearless contrarian takes, especially when he spoke about his aversion to big studios. \u201cStudios are doing their own thing and I don\u2019t belong in that world and I don\u2019t want to belong. I am not jealous of a Marvel movie at all... I find Marvel psychotic and I honestly find it so weird that we think that it\u2019s normal... a guy with panties on, flying around, killing everybody, but no one dies! They are destroying cities and bridges and it\u2019s family entertainment? That\u2019s why America is so f\u2014ed. If aliens came to Earth to study us, they would be like \u2018what the f\u2014?\u2019 It\u2019s just so flamboyant... It\u2019s so gay. Marvel and RuPaul are the gayest things,\u201d Silva said. The crowd was riotous.\n\nThough his observations were playing for humor, Silva genuinely sticks to his guns when it comes to his anti-studio approach. It comes across in the honest and harsh ways that situations are depicted in the film, which makes it feel unexpected, fresh and engrossing.\n\nReflecting on his nostalgia for grittier media, he said that he misses the type of edge that was found in films of the 1960s and \u201870s. \u201c[Since then] we became afraid to make mistakes,\u201d he said, leaving only the most clich\u00e9d and obvious stories seeing the light of day.\n\n\u201cRotting in the Sun\u201d finds moments to inject current and clever humor into even the most thrilling and dire moments. There is a situation when Firstman\u2019s character is attempting to speak Spanish, but knowing very little of the language, resorts to speaking English with an off-putting Spanish accent, hilariously commenting on this oft-used tactic. At another point, a character confesses using Google Translate, but the app jumbles up the context and the vital information falls on deaf ears.\n\nSilva seamlessly finds ways to observe the more embarrassing aspects of the human experience, allowing audiences to ruminate on these commonalities momentarily, without detracting from the story.\n\nSebasti\u00e1n Silva\u2019s unconventional approach has not held him back yet; it has only made his films stronger and more exacting. He can be more specific in his scrutiny and more entertaining because of it. This unapologetic nature might not be appealing to everyone, but it packs a punch and will leave you reeling \u2014more than any Marvel movie ever has.\n\n\u201cRotting in the Sun\u201d is now available for streaming on Mubi.\n```"}

Photo courtesy of Gavin Bond / Bravo\n\nBy Olivia Kelleher\n\nOctober 19, 2023 at 10:03 am PDT\n\nLady Gaga, Britney Spears and Diana Ross walk into a Halloween party. Lady Gaga is dressed in bubbles, Britney Spears is at least 59 years older, and Diana Ross is white? While this gaggle of pop princesses seems stranger than fiction, it is a scene from the reality TV hall of shame; The Real Housewives of New York Season 11 premiere, starring Dorinda Medley as Lady Gaga, Ramona Singer as Britney Spears and Luanne De Lesseps in blackface.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York (RHONY) has always been shockingly unrepresentative of New York\u2019s demographic, a city characterized by vibrant diversity. The core cast of characters plus the rotating friends have always been predominantly white, wealthy and living within the ritzy few-block radius of the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In this fictitious all-white world masquerading as reality, a long list of ill-timed jokes, racial microaggressions and cringe-worthy comments studded the first thirteen seasons.\n\nIn Season five, De Lesseps mocked Native American culture by patting her mouth, chanting and making savage jokes. Carol Radziwill, the cast\u2019s resident downtown liberal cool girl is incredulous and, as always, alone in her feelings. When she attempts to explain the offense, the women laugh her off and the conversation becomes drunken dinner-party fodder. Almost every discussion of race followed that same format.\n\nRHONY has always had a race problem and the Halloween blackface incident was just the tipping point. After a few more rocky seasons, the network eventually dismissed the entire cast. With the new younger rebooted cast debuting its first season, Bravo finally proves that it can discuss race in a nuanced, relevant way that does, in fact, seem real. The audience just had to suffer through a lot to get there.\n\nSince the show\u2019s inception, race has seemingly been a non-factor. The women never spoke about it nor were they confronted with it. The only culture, politics and lifestyle on display was that of wealthy white women. The Housewives\u2019 brushes with race were ignorant and unintentional. When De Lesseps, a long-time fan favorite, arrived at the Halloween party in blackface she was greeted by \u201cI love that\u201d from fellow housewife Bethany Frankle. In a separate confessional, Frankle elaborates, saying \u201cshe\u2019s got the balls of a burglar, you\u2019ve got to give it to her.\u201d Not only does Frankle not condemn De Lesseps, but she also celebrates her, ending her confessional by saying \u201cshe really does not give a f\u2014.\u201d\n\nIt is true \u2014 the women didn\u2019t give a f\u2014. But, after years of only seeing people of color in service positions, recipients of charity or at the butt of jokes, fans started to catch on. Josh Lora, a sociologist and devout reality TV watcher, told Ampersand LA, \u201c[offensive jokes] were played off for laughs. When they\u2019re around like-minded people, it gets glossed over and they get that extension of the benefit of the doubt. I think that\u2019s why the show hadn\u2019t cast a woman of color yet. Keeping it white protected them from these larger conversations. But, it wasn\u2019t working anymore, especially in the political climate of 2019.\u201d\n\nThe series was temporarily resuscitated in Season 12 by the addition of younger, edgier Leah McSweeney. She lives downtown, has tattoos and speaks openly about her torrid past as a teenage New York City party girl. She brought a new kind of social commentary to the show, famously uprooting and discarding tiki torches, fully naked in a Hamptons backyard. Her hate for tiki torches was spurred by their symbolism of white supremacy after they were used at a 2017 rally in Charlottesville, VA, to protest the removal of Confederate statues: \u201cI hate these tiki torches... they represent bullsh\u2014.\u201d\n\nFor the informed viewer, this moment was a feather in her first-season Housewife\u2019s cap. It put McSweeney in stark contrast to her costars, who never used their screen time to comment about social issues related to race. Her first season, which was filmed in 2019 and aired in 2020, was very tense. Leah was at odds with her castmates\u2019 politics. Her at-times unhinged antics, coupled with her liberal political views, made her relatable and likable to a younger audience.\n\n\u201cLeah may be the best rookie housewife of all time. Jumped right in as a New Yorker... held her own. Really, really, nothing but praise,\u201d said Jerry O\u2019Connell, a longtime Bravo superfan and actor. While McSweeny\u2019s message often got lost in her brash delivery, she pushed her castmates\u2019 conservatism into the storyline. It made for compelling TV.\n\nThe progress made in Season 12 was halted when the coronavirus shut production down in 2020. In the same year when the country went through a racial reckoning after the murder of George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, Bravo went through a racial reckoning of its own. As fans binge-watched Bravo favorites such as The Housewives, Vanderpump Rules and Southern Charm, patterns of mistreatment towards Black castmates became even more apparent. Bravo fired a handful of its reality stars for past racist actions \u2014 including Stassi Schroeder and Kristin Doute for suggesting a Black cast member should, without any basis of proof, be reported to the police for theft.\n\nThe New York Housewives\u2019 history of racism, however, continued to go unpunished. Instead, production took another route to address the race issues on RHONY; cast the franchise\u2019s first Black Housewife, Eboni K Williams. With the country\u2019s racial tension at a generation-high, she was set up to fail. Williams had McSweeny as an ally but she was still relatively alone in most situations. She faced an immense amount of pressure as the only racial minority during a highly contentious moment in American history.\n\nRace not only became a topic of conversation for the first time, it underscored nearly every conversation. The show went from being completely devoid of race to a prime-time showing of middle-aged white women confronting race for seemingly the first time in their lives. The racial biases that bubbled under the surface for the 12 seasons prior, now aggressively boiled over.\n\nWilliams took her position as the first Black New York Housewife as an opportunity to directly, but gently, teach her new coworkers, and viewers, about the joys and pains of being Black in America. From a Harlem Renaissance-themed dinner to Black Shabbat, Williams used the events she hosted as a means to educate her ignorant castmates. The other women did not like this, calling Williams \u201cpreachy.\u201d They mocked, complained, and disrespected Williams\u2019 efforts, all of which she handled with an astounding amount of grace and patience.\n\nIn the rare moments that Williams displayed frustration, she was quickly labeled as an \u201cangry woman\u201d by both Singer and De Lesseps. For the audience, Williams\u2019 tokenization was obvious. Reality TV is predicated on juicy drama and petty fights. But, the tension within the Season 13 cast was anything but enjoyable. The season exploited race and the experiences of a Black woman for ratings. The transparent attempt objectively failed, garnering the lowest ratings of any season to-date. Many fans blamed Williams for the season\u2019s failure, but she refused to take responsibility for that.\n\nThis overt discussion of race did more to reveal the weight of white fragility than it did to celebrate affluent Black womanhood. After an argument between Williams and Singer led to them comparing privileges, it was clear that the distance between cast members and their ideologies was more difficult than the show could handle. Williams valiantly tried to bridge that racial gap but the dynamic of the cast was irreparable.\n\nAfter a two-year pause, Bravo debuted a fully rebooted cast for Season 14. This is the most diverse cast in Housewives history, not just in New York, featuring: Afro-Latina Sai De Silva, Brynn Whitfield who is biracial, Somali-Canadian Ubah Hassan, Israeli-American Erin Lichy, the first Indian Housewife Jessel Tank and Jenna Lyons, who is gay. This reboot was thoughtfully cast to represent multiple boroughs and backgrounds.\n\nAs we get to know each new Housewife, they share stories of their upbringing as a means to connect. What the viewers see is drastically different from the privileged outbursts of Singer or De Lesseps. The women primarily support and encourage one another to share the intimate details of their lives. For the first time, race is being discussed on an even playing field and is portrayed as a nuanced gradient of experience, not just Black versus white.\n\nThe Housewives franchise is about voyeurism and criticism. We peep into lives and analyze what they reflect about society as a whole. The old RHONY said a lot about middle-aged women and visibility, life after death and divorce, and navigating businesses, motherhood and relationships. It also said a lot about whiteness \u2014 how it\u2019s perpetuated and protected, its fragility and ubiquitousness, and how it hates to be challenged.\n\nWith the rebooted RHONY, which no longer deals with race as a plot point, but rather a matter of identity. Audiences are finally able to have these nuanced discussions with women of color as well. This season was marred by typical reality TV downfalls; gang-ups, tired plot points and pot stirring. But, it also introduced poignant conversations about the joys and guilt of success, surviving childhood trauma, navigating life as \u201cother\u201d and the varied experiences of motherhood. These themes are experienced uniquely by each woman and their diverse racial identities undoubtedly influence their lived experiences.\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing and finally reflects the real New York. So what does the new RHONY say about what the network thinks of its viewers? It says that we are evolving, that \u201cseeing color\u201d goes deeper than skin tone and there is strength in diversity, especially in lifestyle reality TV. While the original New York Housewives may never leave their white bubble, the rebooted cast of vibrant, interesting, successful New Yorkers show that it\u2019s probably time they do. I\u2019m just happy Bravo is no longer giving them a platform to do so publicly.\n```"}

(Courtesy of Gus Ruelas/USC News)\n\nBy AC Shick\nOctober 19, 2023 at 9:31 am PDT\n\nAre you ready to take part in the annual ShakeOut? Despite the name, the ShakeOut is not a dance, but the U.S.\u2019s largest disaster drill. On Thursday, October 19th at 10:19 a.m. USC will join over 10 million Californians taking part in the one-minute Great ShakeOut earthquake drill by following the steps drop, cover and hold-on. The university has participated since it began in 2008.\n\nThere are many false, and potentially dangerous, misconceptions about what to do during an earthquake. Simply remember: drop, cover and hold-on. This is the safest way to protect yourself according to the Southern California Earthquake Center.\n\nFirst, drop to your hands and knees. This prevents you from falling and minimizes your chances of being hit by falling objects. Staying on your hands and knees also helps protect your vital organs.\n\nSecond, cover your head and neck with your arm. If you are near a desk or table, you should crawl under it for additional support. If there is no sturdy surface, move towards an interior wall.\n\nFinally, hold-on until the earthquake is over. If you find a table or desk, hold onto the surface with one arm. If the shelter moves, you should move with it. If you are not able to find a steady surface, keep covering your head and neck with both arms.\n\nThe ShakeOut drill is a reminder on how to prepare for earthquakes, as they can\u2019t be predicted. Greg Beroza, professor of Geophysics at Stanford University and the co-director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, explains that it\u2019s only a matter of seconds from when shaking is detected that an earthquake hits. This is part of what makes earthquakes dangerous\u2014 once they begin, it\u2019s too late to prepare.\n\nIn recent years, there haven\u2019t been many big urban earthquakes. In 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck a 6.9 magnitude and injured almost 4,000 people. More recently, in 2019, a series of earthquakes hit Ridgecrest, California and were felt by over 47,000 people. The last really big urban earthquake was the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which hit a 7.9 magnitude. Recent research estimates that around 3,000 people died and 225,000 were made homeless. The city had a population of 400,000 at the time.\n\nToday, there is no one alive to remember this earthquake, but in his lifetime Beroza was able to speak to those who had experienced it. \u201cSan Francisco, in their eyes, never recovered,\u201d he said.\n\nBeroza also said that California\u2019s shifting population is one reason many residents have not experienced strong earthquakes in urban areas. This is why drills like the ShakeOut are important. He also recommended knowing the Earthquake Country Alliance\u2019s \u201cSeven Steps to Earthquake Safety.\u201d This list contains steps to take both before and during an earthquake, including which emergency items you should have ready.\n\nSo, remember: drop, cover and hold-on.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/19/frankels-fantasy-files-week-7/", "response": "```\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d is a column by Kyle Frankel about fantasy football. The saying \u201cany given Sunday\u201d has rarely been more evident than this past weekend, as the last two undefeated NFL teams both fell in dramatic fashion. The Philadelphia Eagles were looking to match, or exceed, last season\u2019s magical 8-0 start in which they looked nearly unstoppable. Despite winning every game up until this week, the birds had appeared vulnerable en route to their 5-0 record. Those struggles finally came to fruition on Sunday, as they suffered a 20-14 defeat to the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. After two early touchdowns, they were shutout the rest of the game, including the entire second half. Superstar Jalen Hurts also looked mortal, tossing a rare three interceptions.\n\nMeanwhile in Cleveland, the Browns defeated the previously unbeaten San Francisco 49ers 19-17 with a dominant defensive performance. Brock Purdy was able to lead the Niners on what appeared to be a game winning drive, but it was to no avail as rookie Jake Moody\u2019s field goal attempt drifted wide right, reminiscent of Scott Norwood\u2019s infamous miss in Super Bowl XXV.\n\nMeanwhile in fantasy relevance, I tried to warn you about wide receiver Jameson Williams. Now it definitely wasn\u2019t an eye-popping performance, two catches for 53 yards and a touchdown, good for 13 PPR points, but it was a flash of what type of player he can be if he gets more involved. Moreover, his blazing speed was on full display as he went streaking down the field for a 45-yard score. Now let me dive into some other pass-catchers to help you not miss out on the next Williams.\n\nSteady Samuel\nWhen you get deeper into the season, the waiver wire definitely thins out. It only gets more difficult to find a stud you can slot into your lineup every week. Most of the guys left out there by now won\u2019t have consistent production; instead they\u2019ll boom and bust on a game-by-game basis. Commanders wide receiver Curtis Samuel is an exception to that, as he will rarely explode for a 20-plus point performance. However, you can almost always count on him to reach double digits. He\u2019s averaging 12.6 PPR points per game and has strung together a few strong weeks. The last three games, he\u2019s scored 18.2, 18.5 and 14.5 PPR points and has found the endzone in each of his last two contests. Further, he doesn\u2019t need to rely on home run plays, as he\u2019s tied for second in total targets on his team with 31. We\u2019ve all had weeks where we lost by a few points because the hit-or-miss player we started simply didn\u2019t contribute. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been setting my lineup and wished I just had a reliable guy who I could always trust. Samuel is that guy. He\u2019s the boring move you\u2019ll be thanking yourself for weeks down the line. As of writing, he\u2019s only rostered in 28.6% of ESPN leagues and doesn\u2019t figure to be a hot ticket on the waiver wire this week, so you should be able to snag him.\n\nBourne again\nNow here\u2019s a guy with a bit more volatility. The reason for that is that the Patriots offense is at the bottom of the barrel, ranking second to last in offensive points per game. When wide receiver Kendrick Bourne is able to get opportunities though, he makes the most of them. There\u2019s been two times Bourne has gotten double digit targets this season; he\u2019s scored 24.4 and 19.3 PPR points in those games. This past weekend, despite the Patriots suffering an ugly loss to the Raiders, Bourne had himself a nice week. He caught 10 of 11 targets for 89 yards, scoring 19.3 PPR points without tallying a touchdown. The wide receiver room in New England is also riddled with injuries, as JuJu Smith-Schuster and Demario Douglas are both questionable to return this week. Further, Bourne is the clear-cut number one option, leading the team in total targets by 16. He\u2019s somehow only rostered in 20.4% of ESPN leagues currently so take advantage while you can.\n\nHunting once again\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t give a quick shoutout to Kareem Hunt, back involved in the Browns\u2019 offense and looking like his old self. Hunt took his 12 rushing attempts for 47 yards and a touchdown while catching all three of his targets for 24 yards. All that was good for 16.1 PPR points, not a bad day at the office. He only saw five less rushing attempts than Jerome Ford, as Cleveland is looking to run the ball more while Deshaun Watson is out and seems to be using a committee approach. I think he\u2019ll stay involved even when Watson returns. He\u2019s rostered in just 26.8% of ESPN leagues.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Thai)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier October 18, 2023 at 10:20 pm PDT\n\nAfter getting blown out 48-20 by Notre Dame last Saturday, USC football looks to respond to their next challenge this upcoming Saturday against the Utah Utes in the Coliseum. The Fighting Irish defense exposed a lot of flaws within the Trojans offense, as junior quarterback Caleb Williams threw three interceptions and was sacked six times.\n\nThe Trojans have spent the week adjusting to what went wrong and how they can fix it before taking the field this weekend. \u201cVery basic things: we didn\u2019t communicate, guys just didn\u2019t talk, and it cost us,\u201d USC offensive coordinator and offensive line coach Josh Henson said after Wednesday\u2019s practice. \u201cThen, we got times when technique cost us, times when finishes cost us, so we gotta be better.\u201d\n\nAfter reviewing the game film, Henson concluded that the offensive blockers are getting shed on run plays, and that overall, it was not a good performance from the offensive line. He added that he is constantly evaluating players at every position based on what he and the other coaches see in practice. All decisions on who will start this weekend, however, will be made after Thursday\u2019s practice.\n\nHenson additionally emphasized the importance of working on the fundamentals and that the little things will make the big difference this weekend, as Utah has one of the strongest defenses in the country.\n\nAs a team captain, redshirt junior offensive lineman Jonah Monheim did not hold back his disappointment about the performance of himself and his fellow linemen. \u201cAs an offense, we let the team down. We did not carry our weight,\u201d Monheim said. \u201cDefense played a good game for the most part. We made some plays on special teams, but we didn\u2019t live up to it on offense, which is the most disappointing.\u201d\n\nMonheim added that there needs to be more accountability and execution across the entire line, knowing that when they provide Williams with protection, he can properly execute plays without worrying about being rushed. \u201cIt\u2019s us taking accountability, we\u2019re put in bad scenarios too often, and we gotta execute and be better, because we know that if we do our jobs, then [Caleb]\u2019s the best player in the country and he\u2019ll be alright from there,\u201d Monheim said.\n\nWhen asked about the adjustments across the offensive line this year, Williams maintained confidence in his teammates\u2019 abilities to get better. \u201cIt\u2019s year in and year out. You know you have teammates, new players, new skill positions, offensive linemen and running backs, and all of them have different things, strengths and weaknesses and things like that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut you have to learn and adjust to it every single year, something I talked about before the season even started.\u201d\n\nWilliams also seems to have put the Notre Dame game behind him, and is ready to get his first victory over Utah. \u201cIt\u2019s my first bad game in college, I\u2019d say,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo you endure, and you conquer and keep going.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Williams\u2019 response to the loss, redshirt senior running back Austin Jones was proud of the way his quarterback handled the situation as well as his commitment to getting better. \u201cHe took it like a man \u2014 he said he made mistakes and that he\u2019s gonna be better next week,\u201d Jones said of Williams.\n\nJones is excited for the upcoming matchup with the Utes at the Coliseum and is thirsting for revenge over the team that was responsible for keeping USC out of the College Football Playoff last season. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling, it\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen you lose to a team twice in a year \u2014 we\u2019ve been waiting to get back to playing them.\u201d\n\nJunior wide receiver Michael Jackson III was asked how the team planned to respond after the beatdown in South Bend. \u201cNot much of a response, just kind of a come together, really just saying like, \u2018Okay, we know what we need to work on, obviously, we\u2019re not happy with last week,\u2019\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019ve gotta go on a run. There\u2019s a lot still out there.\u201d\n\nThis Saturday will be another big test for USC, particularly for the offensive line, as Utah, like USC, is trying to keep itself in the College Football Playoff race by avoiding a second loss.\n```"}

The trio, dripped out in Doc Martens and acid wash jeans, were set to perform at 1720 Warehouse that evening following a meet & greet event with their fans.\n\nbrb., composed of Auzaie Zie (Zie), Clarence Liew (CLO), and Marc Lian (Marc), is a trio from Singapore with a discography that combines R&B, funk, hip hop and soul. \u201cYou know us. Our sound is so diverse, we like all kinds of genres,\u201d Marc said during the 1:1 Meet & Greet session in conversation with Annenberg Media.\n\nZie is a keyboardist, vocalist, and a producer and is not only involved in brb. but also a member of Disco Hue, a Singaporean synth-pop quartet founded in 2012. He is also known as \u201cThievves\u201d and directed music videos under Thievves Production.\n\nMeanwhile CLO, has been active on YouTube since 2010 posting covers from artists such as Drake and Sam Smith and even performed for \u201cThe Youtube Stars Concert\u201d in 2012. He is a singer-songwriter and does much of the vocals in brb. songs.\n\nFinally, Marc, a singer, songwriter, and producer, is known for being part of the Singaporean hip hop duo Trick debuting on YouTube in 2012 with original songs, remixes and covers such as English versions of songs by G-Dragon. He was also one of the co-writers and producers of \u201cStylish\u201d by LOONA.\n\nTheir diverse backgrounds and the up-and-coming music scene in Singapore have added to their tracks and their love for performing. Despite their groovy tunes, the concert was high in energy and hype as the members played off the excitement of the crowd with call-and-responses and interaction with fans.\n\n\u201cWe all have different ones,\u201d Marc said when asked what is their favorite song to perform. Zie explained that for him, \u201cIf it\u2019s a more intimate crowd, I prefer the slower ones like \u2018talking to myself\u2019... If it\u2019s like a solid crowd I love doing like \u2018move\u2019 and \u2018on & on.\u2019\u201d\n\nCLO chimed in saying, \u201cMine is \u2018whoops\u2019 and it\u2019s like, you know, a chill crowd and you just want to cry. And \u2018my type.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs for Marc, when \u201cWild Child\u201d was brought up, he responded, \u201cit is one of my favorite songs.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s 90s and 80s inspired beats have been constantly evolving since their first single \u201ccool with it\u201d dropped on August 24th, 2018. One of their more relaxed songs, \u201ccool with it\u201d features a bubbly instrumental line throughout the whole song.\n\nDid brb. have plans to go international since that first drop five years ago? According to CLO, \u201cThat was the idea from the start,\u201d much to the surprise of Zie that exclaimed \u201cReally? Not really.\u201d\n\nMarc responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t have that idea from the start. We just want to have fun making music and see where it goes. We never expected this at all.\u201d\n\nIn return, Zie jokingly asks CLO \u201cSo you saying the first day you met Marc it was like \u2018Yeah I wanna sell these songs overseas?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s my explanation right: So we wrote songs for a couple of months and we got brb. and then that\u2019s when we were like \u201coh this is just a hobby\u201d and we don\u2019t wanna to take it too far - just like okay cool- and then we formed the band and were like let\u2019s get Zie in and lets name ourselves brb.,\u201d CLO said.\n\nEven though CLO did not reveal his big dreams to Zie and Marc until five years later, brb. certainly grew as CLO expected. With over 1.6 million monthly listeners on Spotify, brb. has also collaborated with numerous artists such as SIRUP and Jimmy Brown since their debut.\n\nRecently, brb. released \u201ctrippin\u201d on September 1st \u2013 right before the North American tour began on September 16th. With falsettos, multilayered percussion lines, and a groovy base, this song highlights brb.\u2019s signature funky style with an upbeat melodic line.\n\nThroughout the concert, the members of the group were all dancing, jumping, and having fun on stage, and their energy was definitely reflected in the crowd. With everyone cheering and singing, brb. took audience phones, took their own videos, sang into cameras, and even held hands with fans at the barricade.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? Any new songs? \u201cOh we have tons [of songs]. There\u2019s tons,\u201d the trio began chatting over each other. \u201cWe have some exciting songs coming up... Something new?... It will slowly [evolve]. We don\u2019t want to shock everyone you know?\u201d\n\nZie then teased, \u201cThere are actually like bossa nova-ish things.\u201d\n\nSince the end of the tour, the group hosted a YouTube live stream on October 12th as a teaser to their upcoming performance at the 2023 ROUND Festival hosted in Indonesia on the 21st and 22nd of October.\n\nWith exciting upcoming performances and new music set to come out, brb. fans around the world definitely have a lot to look forward to from this trio.\n```"}

The Rams ended the game with 179 rushing yards after having only five in the first half.

The European Union affirmed payments to the Palestinian Authority will not be suspended. (Photo by Alexandra Goldberg)\n\nBy Alexandra Goldberg\nOctober 18, 2023 at 4:47 pm PDT\n\nBRUSSELS \u2013 Payments to Palestine will continue to flow amid the conflict between Israel and Hamas, financed by the Palestinian Authority\u2019s largest donor\u2014 the European Union.\n\n\u201cWe are the biggest supporter of the Palestinian Authority in the world. It\u2019s about \u20ac600 million a year,\u201d Josef Borrell, the high representative for European Union foreign policy, said during a news conference on Oct. 10.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the European Union affirmed in a press release that financial aid will not be suspended to the Palestinian Authority. The EU does not recognize Palestine as a state, according to the European Commission website. The funding portfolio amounts to a multiannual sum of nearly \u20ac681 million from 2021-2023. That\u2019s roughly $720 million that aids development assistance under the main money vault, the Neighbourhood and Development Cooperation Instrument.\n\nThe payments support a broad range of programs such as investments in schools or health care, according to Commission spokesperson Peter Stano. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, announced that a funding review process is in place to ensure payments don\u2019t end up in the hands of Hamas, a militant group recognized as a terrorist group by both the U.S. and the EU.\n\nThe Commission added that the review will not freeze payments or delay cooperation with the Palestinian Authority. Borrell called the review process \u201cnothing extraordinary\u201d and said he doesn\u2019t believe funding is aiding Hamas. \u201cBut let\u2019s check it,\u201d he said.\n\nBorrell called an informal meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers on Oct. 10 in Muscat, Oman to solidify a stance with the 27 member states of the EU. Some ministers joined from Muscat, and some virtually from their capital cities. The ministers of foreign affairs in Palestine and Israel were invited but were not present.\n\nThe review is underway \u201cto be sure that there is no link between our support and the Hamas terrorist activities,\u201d Borrell said in a press conference. He added that he doesn\u2019t know when the next payment will be. He pledged to continue humanitarian support through payments divided into programs such as a United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. The EU contributed \u20ac97 million to that program in 2022.\n\n\u201cIt will be a mistake [if funding is halted] because it will be the best present that we could give to Hamas and it will jeopardize our interest and our partnership with the Arab world,\u201d Borrell said.\n\nThe statement cleared up miscommunication within the Commission when Hungarian Commissioner Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi said that all EU payments would be immediately suspended. \u201cThere can be no business as usual,\u201d the EU Enlargement Commissioner wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nIn the meeting of foreign ministers, Borrell said the common denominator between foreign ministers was a strong condemnation of terrorism and inhumane treatment.\n\nOn Oct. 8, the European Union issued a statement condemning Hamas for \u201cmultiple and indiscriminate attacks across Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EU stands in solidarity with Israel which has the right to defend itself in line with international law, in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks,\u201d the statement read.\n\nBorrell reiterated the European Union\u2019s condemnation of the terrorist attacks and attack on civilians, while supporting the release of hostages, protection of civilians and respect of international humanitarian law. He added that Israel has the right to self-defense, but within the limits of international law.\n\n\u201cSome of the actions \u2014 and the United Nations has already said that \u2014 as cutting water, cutting or atrocity, cutting food to a mass of civilian people is against international law. So, yes, there are some actions that are not in accordance with international law,\u201d he said in a press conference after the special convening of foreign ministers.\n\nStano, lead spokesperson for foreign affairs, discussed where the European Union stands in the conflict after the foreign affairs ministers met in Muscat on Oct. 10. Here is a question-and-answer session with Annenberg Media. It has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nAnnenberg Media: On Monday night, the Schuman roundabout was lit up with a projection of the Israeli flag, just a day after the European Union issued a statement condemning the indiscriminate attacks of Hamas. There is a sense of support for Israel\u2019s right to self-defense, but also a sense of continued support to financially aid the Palestinian Authority. What is the update to the EU\u2019s stance on the conflict since the convening of foreign ministers in Oman?\n\nStano: The European Union absolutely stands united in solidarity with Israel because what we have seen in the scale of the aggression against Israeli civilians is unprecedented. The sheer scale of how civilians have been massacred by Hamas extremists is something unheard of, even in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That\u2019s why the European Union decisively stands in solidarity with Israel and confirms the right of Israel to defend itself in the face of this aggression.\n\nOn the other hand, we are saying this attack was conducted by Hamas extremists. Hamas is a terrorist organization per the EU. And, we make a very clear distinction between the perpetrators of this attack \u2014 the terrorists from Hamas \u2014 and the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian people. That\u2019s why we are stressing the importance of continuing our cooperation and support for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people.\n\nThe European Union has been, for a very long time, the biggest donor for the Palestinian Authority and for the financial needs of the Palestinian people. And we are also saying while Israel has the right to defend itself, it needs to do so in line with international law so that there is no more civilian suffering inflicted on the people in Gaza. International humanitarian law needs to be respected while Israel has the right to go after those who organized and executed these brutal attacks.\n\nAM: Borrell pledged an unhampered continuation of payments to the Palestinian Authority and a Commission review process. What funds are being allocated to Palestine and what will this funding review process look like?\n\nStano: The review is just tightening the controls to make sure that all of the money that we are spending for Palestine every year is reaching the recipients, which are rightful recipients, and is used for the objectives we are intending. The objectives are to alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people, investments in schools and in the healthcare system and helping the Palestinian Authority run the institutions in the occupied territories. So it\u2019s basically ensuring the basic running and surviving of the Palestinian population.\n\nWe are also one of the biggest donors of a specialized U.N. agency which takes care of the Palestinian refugees, it\u2019s called UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees]. We have several pots of money that are designed for different purposes. One is humanitarian assistance and this has been mostly for the people in Gaza because there was a huge humanitarian crisis in Gaza before the outbreak of the latest escalation. Then we have another budget which is development assistance or bilateral cooperation programs from which various projects are being financed. It goes to the Palestinian Authority so that they can have this budget for the schools, for the hospitals, for the payment of the civil servants, for example. The third category goes for projects which are specifically dedicated to civil society. For example, independent journalists, thinktankers, people who are dealing with community issues or trauma related issues.\n\nFor the review, I think it is part of the prudent process to ensure that we really make sure that this money goes to the objectives we set ourselves and that no one who might be connected to these attacks indirectly can benefit from this money. The review does not mean that we have suspicion, we just want to ensure that in this new very dramatic context that nothing like that is happening.\n\nAM: How frequent are the payments and do you have an idea of when there will be a future payment?\n\nStano: There is no suspension of payment and the payments are disbursed on their contractual nature. The money is allocated on a yearly basis and then dispersed through different budget lines based on the nature of the contract. So basically every three or every four weeks there is some kind of payment for a project disbursement of the money.\n\nAM: Does the EU send any aid to Israel?\n\nStano: I\u2019m not aware that Israel will be in need of these types of assistance programs. Israel is not in the category of countries that would need financial assistance from the EU in the form of how we provide to other partners. Specific programs which we are financing in Israel are, for example, research support, scientific support and student support. There is some money that goes from the European Union for specific projects which are focused on enhancing the cooperation between the EU and Israel. So it\u2019s not for basic needs of the Israeli people, but it\u2019s really just added value to our partnership to bring it to a higher level, bring better results and better benefits for the societies on both sides.\n\nAM: Commissioner Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi called to freeze funding just one day prior to the convening. Was this statement made in consultation with anyone in the Commission, or did he have ground to speak on behalf of the EU?\n\nStano: No, it was a misleading statement put out on Twitter, which was made in a sole action. That means that without any backing from the Commission. And the Commission later clarified the issue saying nothing has been suspended. Any kind of action would follow only after completing the review. If in the course of the review it stands out some of the money went into the wrong hands, then there is something wrong in our system and someone within the Commission will need to take political responsibility because there are specific people who are tasked with the oversight of this money.\n\nAM: Is there a general sense of fracturing among the different member states in the Commission when it comes to financially backing Palestine or Israel?\n\nStano: Absolutely not. The European Union always acts as one. It is natural, however, that we are an organization composed of 27 member states, and these member states are basically representatives to their nominees in the European Commission. So it\u2019s natural that we have a variety of views. We are not the Soviet Union, where everyone has to have the same opinion. And the good thing about the European Union in general, is that we are united in diversity and that also goes for different views and approaches. We always manage to work out and iron out any differences and find a workable compromise that reflects EU unity.\n\nAM: What is expected for the future participation of the EU in the conflict?\n\nStano: We are always meeting, we are always discussing and trying to adjust our positions and our decisions on what is going on in the world. It sounds a little bit cynical, but for us, it\u2019s the usual way of how we work. This is a new topic \u2014 a new crisis \u2014 on our table, but this is not the first crisis. So unfortunately we are dealing with too many crises and we have mechanisms on how to deal with them at the level of the Commission, at the level of the member states and also in the European Parliament.\n```"}

Students marched on campus for more than two hours chanting in support of Palestine and calling for an end to Israel\u2019s occupation, which they characterized as actions of apartheid and attempted genocide against the Palestinian people whose freedom of movement has been restricted by a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade since 2007.\n\nUSC Department of Safety officers and USC Free Expression ambassadors stood by, keeping watch while maintaining distance from the crowd, which remained peaceful throughout the night. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased with the turnout,\u201d An Iranian senior, who requested anonymity because they said they received threatening notes about being at the protest, said. \u201cI think it\u2019s become extremely polarizing; whenever you criticize Israel, you\u2019re [accused of being] antisemitic.\u201d\n\nThe protestors also criticized USC President Carol Folt for what they described as pro-Israel aligned comments, and accused her of not supporting all students. Folt\u2019s original Oct. 8 statement following the attacks in Israel by Hamas received widespread complaints from the USC community for not explicitly condemning the mass murder and hostage taking of civilians by the organization. This led to a revised post from Folt\u2019s official Instagram account, which then neglected to mention civilian deaths in Gaza following retaliatory strikes from Israel. Unlike the first post, the comments for the revised statement were turned off.\n\nA Lebanese junior studying economics said they wanted to be able to respond to the statement. \u201cShe\u2019s silencing us,\u201d said the student, who asked for anonymity out of concern for how they could be treated on campus. Asked why comments were turned off on the Instagram post and further questions about student concerns regarding USC\u2019s public position on the conflict, the university\u2019s public relations team only referred Annenberg Media back to Folt\u2019s statement. They did not respond to further inquiry.\n\nAnother issue that was raised at the protest was safety. \u201cWe had to keep this under wraps,\u201d the Iranian senior said. \u201cIsraeli students don\u2019t feel the need to cover their faces, but our security is threatened by something called Canary Mission, which is a website that puts names of students who have gone against Israel on North-American campuses.\u201d The Canary Mission, an organization that is not audited by any third party, publicly displays students\u2019 names that have made statements against the State of Israel. Canary Mission also includes private information such as students\u2019 private social media profiles and has been criticized for combatting free speech. Annenberg Media also asked the USC PR team about Canary Mission and did not receive a response.\n\nAs the march continued on from its starting point at the Hoover-Jefferson entrance to campus, more students joined in, chanting slogans rallying around Hahn Plaza next to the Tommy Trojan Statue. DPS estimated that more than 150 students were in attendance. After the demonstration ended, a small group of Muslim students gathered in front of Tommy Trojan for the Maghrib prayer, the fourth of five mandatory prayers in sects of the Islamic faith meant to take place after sunset. The prayers were led by Talha Rafique, a junior, who told Annenberg Media that while the Maghrib was a general prayer, students who participated added prayers for the Palestinians in Gaza, and for peace in the region.\n\nAnother group of protestors attended the USC Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, filling the hall to capacity, to request a statement in support of Palestinians in Gaza, as well as Palestinian students at USC. USG previously passed a resolution in September to recognize the Azerbaijan incursion into Nagorno-Karabakh as a genocide against Armenians. During a public comment period, students who had been protesting noted the previous resolution. By the end of the meeting, multiple senators agreed to work with concerned students to craft a similar resolution for the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza, where Israeli strikes have killed over 2,800, with nearly two-thirds being children according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.\n```"}

(Photo by Myriam-Fernanda Alcala Delgado)\n\nBy Myriam Alcala October 18, 2023 at 12:01 pm PDT\n\nEmbarking on one final friendship bracelet-making journey brought joy to the cool fall wind. Placing the beads all in a line with \u201cDress\u201d lyrics and adding shades of pink, August truly did slip away. Memorialized on the big screen, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Eras\u201d Tour brought back every itching emotion from summer along with new feelings of excitement seeing the production of a lifetime up close. It all began with a clam.\n\nThe \u201cEras\u201d Movie is more than just a revival of the music, it\u2019s a rival of the feeling. Upon entering Dolby Cinema at Burbank 16, the line was packed with dresses, glitter, Eras merch and of course, bracelets. Everyone was trading and taking photos, smiling and snagging Eras popcorn bowls. \u201cDo you want to trade?\u201d An AMC employee came up the the counter to ask. \u201cOf course!\u201d Everyone was a friend because everyone was a Swiftie.\n\nOnce the lights went down in the theater and sound came up slowly, it felt like the cheers of 70,000 all in one room. It was no longer just a theater, it was a portal into the life that was the \u201cEras Tour.\u201d The concert film captured audiences worldwide. (Photo by Myriam-Fernanda Alcala Delgado)\n\nThere was no bad seat as the layers of pink, orange and purple clam leaves revealed the singer. \u201cMiss Americana\u201d began while fans stood from their theater seats to jump and dance along. I was still in shock seeing Taylor Swift towering over the screen, she looked different from section 100 at Empower Stadium back in July.\n\nIt was around \u201cLover,\u201d the fifth song of the night, when I began to cry. The camera panned to Swift\u2019s face, she was wearing pink glitter eyeshadow and sweat started to form on her upper lip. \u201cFearless\u201d felt like high school.\n\nThe thing about the \u201cEras Tour\u201d is that it all happened so fast. Three and a half hours passed in two seconds and after a few months that feeling of happiness fades. The radiating smiles from both the theater audience and the fans on screen along with the ache in my own smile during \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d was unlike anything else.\n\nNothing could\u2019ve prepared the theater for \u201cTolerate It\u201d though. The Dolby cinema screen was a perfect medium to truly see the production of the Eras Tour. The costumes, makeup, dance, screens, set. The performance of \u201cTolerate It\u201d sparked conversations immediately. Swift made her way to the prop dining table next to the piano after \u201cChampagne Problems\u201d and began to set up the silverware. The song about not being appreciated for the love you give is gut wrenching to hear, but to see Swift act and throw the cups and plates, hit different.\n\nUnderstandably so, there were a few songs cut out from the movie. The ones they picked to cut however, were shocking: \u201cThe Archer,\u201d \u201ctis the damn season,\u201d \u201cno body, no crime,\u201d \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d \u201ccardigan\u201d and ... \u201cLong Live.\u201d The \u201cSpeak Now\u201d song dedicated to her fans did not make the final cut. Although it did play at the end credits, out of all the songs that were cut, this one was the most heartbreaking.\n\nThe effects of the movie, transitioning every era, sent waves of theories during the \u201cReputation\u201d transition. We definitely will be seeing that visual again (hopefully very soon). Many fans were excited to see Swift's facial expressions up close on the big screen. (Photo by Myriam-Fernanda Alcala Delgado)\n\nThe costuming was something that was a bit hard to see live, the theater screen brought on an entirely new appreciation for the patterns on the evermore dress, the reference costumes of Swift during \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d and of course the (very queer) loafers during the \u201cRed\u201d set. Being up in the \u201cFolklore\u201d cabin with Swift also brought a new sense of intimacy to the concert. The back shots and camera close ups to Swift during times in the tour when she can\u2019t be seen by everyone made it feel like in a theater of a few dozen people, it was just me and her.\n\nNow who can forget the surprise songs? The maroon \u201c1989\u2032\u2032/surprise song outfit was always a personal favorite. The theater shouted the words to \u201cOur Song\u201d and lifted their arms in the air during the lyrics \u201cmake the friendship bracelets\u201d from \u201cYou\u2019re On Your Own, Kid.\u201d We weren\u2019t alone.\n\nThe essence of Taylor Swift came to life through the screen, music and fans. By the time \u201cMidnights\u201d was introduced, there was a sort of peace in the crowd knowing that although the movie was coming to an end, the memories we all made (maybe for the first time for those who did not attend the tour) would stay forever. As the credits started to roll with pictures from people across the U.S. in costume, smiling at the tour it felt like a scrapbook closing on an event that will never truly be gone. There\u2019s glitter everywhere in the theater now, maybe even a bracelet hidden between seats. That\u2019s a real legacy.\n```"}

Sure, maybe we\u2019ve been stripped of the title and the playground cred that accompanies it, but Gen Z fashion is championed by a two-fold, delicate balance: the youthful nature of experimentation and the cool-factor of nostalgia from decades past. As a generation widely known for our prioritization of sustainable fashion practices and mental health, the therapeutic buzz of \u201chealing your inner child\u201d has not only threaded its way into the fabric of our beings, but also the clothes that we choose to dress ourselves in. So, here we are. Samba shoelaces, silk camisole straps, cowboy boot tassels, hair elastic decorations \u2014 you name it. Ribbon-made bows are adorning just about every article of clothing imaginable, and this trend is certainly here for the long haul.\n\nIt would be remiss not to mention that bows have been a prominent motif throughout fashion history. A longtime symbol of femininity and status, ancient Sumerian hair ribbons previously displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art date back to as early as 2600-2500 BCE. Granted, these ribbons were made with gold, but it\u2019s arguable that the societal value they currently hold is even more esteemed than their socioeconomic symbolism throughout history. Now, ribbon or similar narrow fabrics might find us before we even think to seek them out. Everything from hanger straps of summer dresses to gift bag closures have been used as bow-fuel for the sought after fashion detail.\n\nBows have effectively infiltrated the growing list of Gen Z dominated digital subcultures \u2014 coquette, balletcore, cottagecore and other hyper feminine aesthetics \u2014 early on, and have since made their way onto pieces as casual as oversized sweaters and denim. But still, one might pose the question: Why ribbon and why now? Ribbon is an accessory that\u2019s, well, accessible. With greater access, there is room for more creative freedom. And after the summer of girlhood, ruled by Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras Tour\u201d and Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d takeover, it was only a matter of time until the colorful material answered the call to this rekindling of childlike crafts.\n\nThere\u2019s a freedom in embracing the individualistic essence of the ribbon-to-bow process, a familiar but often discouraged sense of creativity in fashion that women face as they enter adulthood. But particularly for Gen Z women, there is a simultaneous recalling of the \u201cinternet big sister\u201d figures that encouraged DIY culture, but were momentarily lost in the shuffle of growing up. Commonly known as \u201clifestyle YouTubers\u201d during their 2015-2017 viewership peaks, this female-dominated niche produced countless videos featuring picturesque daily routines made aspirational through practical, yet trendy arts and crafts. Some of the most well-known creators included Lauren Riihimaki (LaurDIY), Eva Gutowski (MyLifeAsEva), Alisha Marie, Meredith Foster, and Meghan Rienks \u2014 with the latter four creators traveling across several states to host the \u201cGirls Night In Tour\u201d in 2015. DIY flower crowns and Halloween costumes ring a bell, anyone?\n\nBut as these creators and their viewers aged up, so did the content made and consumed. The inevitable style shift, both literally and figuratively, became less saturated and more serious. However, as the notorious year of 2020 came along, lockdown restrictions brought about an ample amount of downtime to reconnect with the crafty habits so many of us subscribed to during those formative years. With less money to spend and little else to do, upcycling thrifted clothes or what was already hanging in our closets became an increasingly popular hobby. Plus, many of those same YouTubers expanded their reach to the short-form world of TikTok. Whether they are reacting to their old videos, reintroducing themselves or offering more creative life hacks, just the resurfacing of their profiles alone have inspired Gen Z viewers to lean into do-it-yourself glory once again.\n\nFrom bows to beaded friendship bracelets, there is a collective sense of creativity that unites and empowers us as young women. These vivid, youthful displays of style offer a rather blunt statement of modern femininity: I will wear what I want, and I will be taken seriously regardless. That wraps things up quite nicely. But hey, don\u2019t forget to add a bow.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Dylan Huey)\n\nBy Runyu Li October 18, 2023 at 11:38 am PDT\n\nIn the heart of the University of Southern California, a groundbreaking movement is underway. USC Reach, led by Silicon Valley native and Reach CEO Dylan Huey, has evolved into a force that transcends conventional social media clubs. Through the voices of Asian and Asian American influencers Dylan Huey, Victor Ye, and Natalie Park, USC Reach emerges not just as a club but as a transformative community that champions diversity and amplifies underrepresented narratives.\n\nDylan Huey: Pioneering Influence and Inclusivity\n\nHuey\u2019s journey is a testament to the transformative power of social media. A mixed-race student with Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Spanish, and Caucasian heritage, Huey says Reach not just as a platform for personal expression but as a movement to empower creators. From addressing issues of mental health and bullying, Huey\u2019s content transitioned into lifestyle and entertainment, symbolizing the broader shift within USC Reach itself.\n\nOver his seven years in the social media space, Huey\u2019s content evolved from addressing mental health-related issues to embracing lifestyle and entertainment. Today, he serves as a spokesperson for the creator economy, emphasizing the importance of building a supportive community. Huey\u2019s journey led to the founding of Reach, a national organization that started as a club at USC.\n\n\u201cReach\u2019s mission is to nurture aspiring influencers and provide them with the tools to navigate the creator economy successfully,\u201d he says. His leadership has transformed Reach into the first and largest collegiate student influencer organization, boasting 2,000 creators nationwide with a collective following of 300 million. Huey emphasizes the inclusive nature of Reach, welcoming individuals passionate about social media, irrespective of their follower count.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big advocate of working hard. I go by the motto of moving one percent every single day to your goal,\u201d Huey says. Dylan Huey, the CEO of Reach. (Photo courtesy of Dylan Huey)\n\nHuey\u2019s vision extends beyond USC, aiming to expand Reach to 150 universities in the U.S., with aspirations of reaching more than 5,000 creators by the year\u2019s end. His success is marked not only by numbers but by the recognition on platforms like Good Morning America, signaling the growing acknowledgment of collegiate influencer organizations.\n\nVictor Ye: Unearthing Histories Through Sound\n\nVictor Ye, a member of Reach who runs the podcast \"Untextbooked\" (Photo courtesy of Victor Ye)\n\nYe, a member of USC Reach and a junior studying communication, has harnessed the power of podcasts to create a sonic tapestry of history. \u201cI was worried about our democracy as well as trying to discuss more about what American identity looks like, and that\u2019s when I started to create content related to understanding the history of our past, in order for us to become effective people to make heavy impacts in our communities.\u201d\n\nYe acknowledges the scarcity of Asian American role models in the media industry but sees it as an opportunity to shape his unique journey. He aims to be a beacon for aspiring creators, providing mentorship and fostering a sense of community within the USC Reach organization.\n\n\u201cBeing an Asian American has been empowering for me to create a career myself that represents other Asian Americans within the realms of media, entertainment, fashion, and just anything related to the culture industry,\u201d he says. His podcast, \u201cUntextbooked,\u201d explores diverse historical topics, including Asian American history and the culinary arts. Through his work, Ye seeks to elevate underrepresented voices and foster a deeper understanding of the nation\u2019s history.\n\nBeing a Chinese American, Ye recognizes the importance of elevating underrepresented voices. In a poignant episode during the second season, he explored the Asian American experience with historian Erica Lee, delving into issues of representation in Hollywood and the impact of movements like Stop Asian Hate and the pandemic.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to inspire and educate others about finding their own history backgrounds of their interest... so that they actually need to know the history of the place that they came from in order for them to affect change,\u201d he says. While acknowledging the scarcity of Asian American role models in the media industry, Ye remains optimistic about the future, aspiring to expand \u201cUntextbooked\u201d into multimedia formats beyond podcasting.\n\nNatalie Park: Evolving with Authenticity\n\nPark, a USC Reach e-board member and a Korean American influencer, embodies the evolution of social media over the past three years. From her early days of blogging in 7th grade to navigating the realms of Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, Park\u2019s content mirrors her personal growth and changing interests.\n\n\u201cYou want your audience to kind of grow with you,\u201d Park says. Being Korean American, Park sees social media as a platform without bounds, offering opportunities that traditional media might lack for people of color. She acknowledges the success stories of fellow Asian American creators as a source of inspiration, driving her to break barriers in the industry.\n\nHer authenticity shines through her branding strategy, emphasizing the importance of aligning content with personal values. Financial challenges faced by creators find resonance with Park, who appreciates USC Reach as a space for sharing insights and strategies.\n\nFor Park, USC Reach is more than a club; it\u2019s an integral part of her college experience. Drawn to USC partly because of Reach, she highlights the incredible friendships and unique experiences, such as attending the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie premiere with fellow Reach members.\n\n\u201cReach has been such an important part of my college experience... I was drawn to USC partly because of Reach,\u201d Park says. Natalie Park at the \"Barbie\" campaign coordinated by USC Reach (Photo courtesy of Natalie Park)\n\nPark\u2019s journey is a testament to the expansive opportunities that social media provides for people of color. Her goal is to create a name for herself in the social media world, breaking free from traditional molds.\n\n\u201cBeing on social media has really expanded my visions of what I could be and the success that I could achieve because there are so many Asian American creators that I have looked up to throughout the years,\u201d Park says.\n\nUSC Reach: Beyond a Club, a Community\n\nUSC Reach, founded as a social media club, has transcended its initial purpose. Huey, Ye, and Park, each in their unique ways, embody the spirit of Reach as more than just an organization. For Huey, it\u2019s a family that empowers aspiring influencers. For Ye, it\u2019s a community fostering diversity in creativity.

USC Reach (Photo courtesy of Dylan Huey)\n\nAs USC Reach moves forward, it continues to be a transformative force in the lives of creators, a community that shapes narratives, challenges stereotypes, and champions diversity in the dynamic world of digital creation. According to USC Reach\u2019s mission statement, \u201cWhat started as a way to build community amongst a growing social media industry in a college setting has quickly grown to be much more.

(Photo by Yufei Hong)\n\nBy Victor Kevorkian\nOctober 18, 2023 at 9:07 am PDT\n\nNotre Dame forces five turnovers, dominates USC, 48-20\nThe Fighting Irish had their way in their storied rivalry with Southern Cal, putting on a show for the home crowd in South Bend. Notre Dame\u2019s defense set the tempo early, intercepting quarterback Caleb Williams on the fourth play from scrimmage. Williams undoubtedly had his worst game of the season, quite possibly the worst showing of his college career, throwing for just 199 yards and one touchdown with three interceptions. The Fighting Irish offense created scoring opportunities from all three of Williams\u2019 first-half interceptions, giving them a 24-6 lead going into halftime. Running Back Audric Estime added 95 rushing yards and two touchdowns to his impressive 2023 campaign. The Trojans showed life in the second half, cutting the lead to 11 early in the fourth quarter thanks to a touchdown pass to Brenden Rice. But the momentum was short-lived, as Notre Dame\u2019s Jadarian Price returned the ensuing kickoff for a 99-yard touchdown. The Irish rode this wave of momentum to an impressive victory, adding a defensive touchdown late to seal the deal. USC (6-1) suffers their first loss of the season and drops to No. 18 in the AP Top 25 Poll. Notre Dame (6-2) jumps six spots in the poll to No. 15.\n\nAlabama narrowly avoids upset, tops Arkansas, 24-21\nAlabama found themselves down 6-0 late in the first quarter, but quickly flipped the script as quarterback Jalen Milroe found receiver Kobe Prentice for a 79-yard touchdown to close out the period. The Crimson Tide would go on to score 24 unanswered points, easing the minds of the over-100,000 fans in attendance in Tuscaloosa. In a turn of events, the Razorbacks came out swinging late, scraping together two touchdown drives to cut the lead to just a field goal. Alabama was able to avoid the monumental comeback, remaining undefeated in SEC play. Alabama (6-1) sees no movement in its poll position, staying at No. 11. Arkansas (2-5) remains unranked.\n\nWashington seizes Pac-12 crown, holds off Oregon, 36-33\nWashington quarterback Michael Penix continued his Heisman campaign with an electric performance in a marquee matchup of two Pac-12 powerhouses. The Huskies signal caller threw for 302 yards and four touchdowns with one interception. Receiver Rome Odunze led the team with eight receptions for 128 yards and two touchdowns. While Washington had its way on offense, this contest was a constant back and forth battle. Each team had an answer for the other\u2019s success. Fellow Heisman hopeful Bo Nix was also impressive, throwing for 337 yards and two touchdowns. Ducks receiver Troy Franklin led the team with 154 yards and a touchdown, while running back Bucky Irving ran for 127 yards and a score. Penix found Odunze for a go-ahead touchdown with 1:38 remaining in the game, leaving time for Nix to respond. Oregon was able to drive down the field to set up a potential game-tying field goal from 43 yards out. Kicker Camden Lewis barely missed and Washington escaped with the win. Washington (6-0) jumps to No. 5 in the Ap Poll, while Oregon (5-1) drops just one spot to No. 9.\n\nOklahoma State rallies late, shocks Kansas, 39-32\nThe Cowboys put up 554 yards of offense in an impressive upset win at home. Running back Ollie Gordon led the way with 284 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns on 35 touches. Kansas was also electric offensively, as quarterback Jason Bean threw for 410 yards and five touchdowns with two interceptions. The Jayhawks quarterback spread the ball nicely, completing passes to eight different receivers. Oklahoma State found themselves down 32-24 late in the third quarter, but was able to string together 15 unanswered points to pull off the come-from-behind victory. Kansas (5-2) slips out of the rankings after recently cracking the poll at No. 23. Oklahoma State (4-2) remains unranked.\n\nPittsburgh dominates second half, upsets Louisville, 38-21\nThe Cardinals found themselves up 21-14 at halftime vs the Panthers, but failed to score a single point coming out of the break. Pittsburgh was executing on both sides of the ball in the second half, starting with an impressive defensive performance. The Panthers sacked Louisville quarterback Jack Plummer four times and intercepted him twice, including an 86-yard interception return for a touchdown. Panthers quarterback Christian Veilleux played clean football, throwing for 200 yards and two touchdowns including a 31-yard touchdown strike to receiver Konata Mumpfield late in the fourth quarter to cap off a 24-0 scoring run. Louisville (6-1) falls seven spots to No. 21 in the AP Poll. Pittsburgh (2-4) remains unranked, but must feel optimistic moving forward after its biggest win of the season.\n\nReeling Washington State falls to Arizona, 44-6\nAfter nearly upsetting two highly ranked Pac-12 opponents in the past two weeks, the Wildcats finally pulled off their upset last weekend in Pullman. Washington State capped off an impressive 11-play, 4:59 minute opening drive with a touchdown to set the tempo moving forward, but would fail to reach the endzone for the remainder of the game. Arizona\u2019s defense was wildly impressive, intercepting quarterbacks Cameron Ward and John Mateer twice. The Wildcats sustained offensive success throughout all four quarters thanks to an efficient game by quarterback Noah Fifita, who completed 34 of his 43 pass attempts for 342 yards. All five of Arizona\u2019s touchdowns came on the ground, with three of them coming from running back Jonah Coleman. He added 70 rushing yards to his hat trick. Arizona (4-3) remains unranked, but has been wildly impressive in its past three matchups. Washington State (4-2) finds itself unranked after losing two straight, a major dropoff from its previous spot at No. 19.\n\nNorth Carolina bests Miami in high-scoring contest, 41-31\nUNC running back Omarion Hampton totaled 217 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns in the Tar Heels\u2019 electric win. Quarterback Drake Maye looked sharp, throwing for 273 yards and four touchdowns. Receiver Devontez Walker accounted for 132 of those yards and three touchdowns. The Hurricanes looked to bounce back after their late-game blunder last week, but found themselves down 35-17 heading into the fourth quarter. Quarterback Tyler Van Dyke put up good numbers, throwing for 391 yards and four touchdowns. But his two interceptions, combined with running back Henry Parrish\u2019s fumble, were not affordable turnovers, as North Carolina looked unstoppable on offense. While Miami rallied late, it was not enough to overcome the deficit. North Carolina (6-0) jumps 3 spots to No. 10 in the Ap Poll. Miami (4-2) is now unranked.\n\nOregon State impresses in big win vs. UCLA, 36-24\nDefensive back Ryan Cooper intercepted Bruins quarterback Dante Moore for a 67-yard touchdown return to close out the first half, putting the Beavers on top 23-10 heading into the break, and setting the tempo for an impressive defensive showing. Oregon State\u2019s defense would end the day with three interceptions and five sacks, allowing little second-half production from Moore and the offense. The Beavers offense held its own, as quarterback DJ Uiagalelei threw for 266 yards and two touchdowns. Running back Damien Martinez led the team with 90 rushing yards, while receiver Anthony Gould hauled in seven catches for 87 yards. The Beavers made it look easy against a highly touted UCLA defense, albeit they were shut out in the second half. UCLA saw a big day from running back Carson Steele, who rushed for 110 yards and a score. However, the Bruins were unable to eclipse their halftime deficit, in part due to a lackluster performance from Moore, who completed just 42 percent of his passes. Oregon State (6-1) jumps two spots to No. 12 in the poll, while UCLA (4-2) drops seven spots to No. 25.\n\nMissouri stuns Kentucky, 38-21\nFailing to get anything going offensively and down 14-0 in the second quarter, Mizzou resorted to the back of the playbook in hopes of gaining momentum. On fourth-and-ten from Kentucky\u2019s 39-yard line, the Tigers lined up to punt. Punter Luke Bauer received the snap and threw the ball deep down the left sideline to receiver Marquis Johnson, who made an athletic catch-and-run for a touchdown to put the Tigers on the board. This play sparked the momentum for Missouri, propelling them to a 17-14 lead heading into halftime. The Tigers offense played gritty, exploding in the fourth quarter with 18 points to put the game away. Kentucky was unable to find much success in the second half offensively, as quarterback Devin Leary failed to meet expectations. Leary tossed two interceptions while completing just 51 percent of his passes for 120 yards. Wildcats running back Ray Davis impressed, rushing for 128 yards and one touchdown. Missouri\u2019s (6-1) impressive road victory granted them the No. 20 spot in the AP Poll. Kentucky (5-2) expectedly exited the poll.\n```"}

USC's loss to Notre Dame dropped them to #18 in the AP Top 25.\n\nBy Will Camardella October 17, 2023 at 10:38 pm PDT\n\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. In some ways, last week made my job easier. In others, my job became more difficult. After seven weeks of the college football season, every team in the Pac-12 besides Arizona State has played a road game against a team currently ranked in the AP Top 25, a game against a team ranked in the top 10, or at least two games against ranked opponents. This means that every team has now had at least one opportunity to prove itself as a contender to win this conference, and perhaps make it to the College Football Playoff.\n\nWe saw some teams rise to the occasion this weekend; Washington asserted itself as the favorite to win the Pac-12, while Oregon State handled the previously surging UCLA Bruins. On the other hand, USC and Washington State were exposed in blowout losses. How teams handle the challenges that come with massive games and major audiences goes a long way toward telling me where they stand in the conference hierarchy, so do not be surprised when I value those matchups more than weak non-conference games and bouts with Stanford in my rankings.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\n1. Washington Huskies (6-0, 3-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nIn perhaps the biggest Pac-12 game in recent memory, Washington proved to the nation why they are not just the best team this conference has to offer, but a bonafide National Championship contender. The Huskies\u2019 offense has looked outstanding all season, but to do what they did against an Oregon defense that entered the game ranked in the top five in scoring defense is their best feat yet. Michael Penix Jr. and his outstanding core of receivers played perfectly to type on Saturday with explosive play after explosive play in the passing game. Washington\u2019s five touchdown drives averaged just over six plays per drive and took an average of less than three minutes off the game clock. An offense that can score that quickly is about as demoralizing as it gets for an opposing defense, and if the Ducks cannot slow down Rome Odunze and Ja\u2019Lynn Polk \u2013 who each had over 100 receiving yards \u2013 I do not know what team can. UW\u2019s defense was hardly perfect last weekend, and it is an average unit statistically for the season. However, when the offense is as potent as it is, all the D really needs to do is get off the field in crucial situations. The most important stat from this game is that Oregon was 0/3 on fourth down attempts, with the final stop leading to the game-winning touchdown two plays later. The Pac-12\u2032s final undefeated team finally found its signature win, and the entire country should be on notice.\n\n2. Oregon Ducks (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nYes, Saturday was an absolutely brutal loss for Oregon to take coming off a bye, but that game should not dissuade anyone from believing the Ducks are a contender. Yes, the defensive performance was a massive disappointment, as Washington did just about whatever it wanted to in the passing game. However, I am not sure there is a defense in the country that can completely shut down the Huskies. The reality is that Oregon walked into one of the most hostile environments we\u2019ve seen in college football this year \u2013 a crowd of over 70,000 raucous fans in Seattle \u2013 and executed its game plan fairly well en route to a lead late in the fourth quarter. The offense proved it has more overall balance than Washington by outgaining the Huskies in both the running and passing game. Bo Nix was surgical, Bucky Irving made noise regardless of down and distance, and the Ducks won the turnover battle. If just one of three third-down attempts worked out for Oregon or if Camden Lewis had just made a 43-yard field goal, we would be talking about Dan Lanning\u2019s group as a National Championship contender. I had to drop the Ducks a spot because on-field results trump all, but I like their chances if these two teams meet on a neutral site in December.\n\n3. Oregon State Beavers (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nOregon State got kicked in the teeth early in conference play but has bounced back from adversity better than any team in the conference. First, the Beavers took out the defending conference champs. On Saturday night, they decisively defeated a UCLA team that was looking ready to become a dark horse. DJ Uiagalelei has replaced Cam Ward as the least talked-about Pac-12 signal caller after the two-week stretch he has put together. After putting up a 50-burger in a road game against Cal, Uiagalelei threw for 11 yards per attempt and two touchdowns against a UCLA defense that was one of the conference\u2019s best entering the weekend. More to the point, OSU\u2019s defense has returned to its dominant self after a troubling performance in Berkley. The Beavers forced three interceptions and recorded five sacks on Dante Moore. Their 22 sacks this season are tied for first in the Pac-12. Oregon State has made Corvallis one of the toughest places to win a football game this season, recording two ranked home wins in its first four weeks of conference play. Jonathan Smith\u2019s team is on the rise and the whole conference should be on notice.\n\n4. USC Trojans (6-1, 4-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nAfter USC struggled once again to put away an inferior team one week ago, I asked if it was playing down to its competition, or if those performances were just indicative of what the team is. After the Trojans took a 48-20 drubbing in South Bend, I have no choice but to conclude the latter. Because of the way 2022 ended for USC, everyone had placed their ire on Alex Grinch\u2019s defense the second the team began to struggle. However, it seems that Lincoln Riley\u2019s vaunted offense was the true area of concern all along. In the past four games, the offense was out of sorts in Tempe, only managed 14 second-half points on Boulder, scored just 28 regulation points against Arizona, and was completely dysfunctional against Notre Dame. Caleb Williams threw a career-high three interceptions on Saturday night as the Irish defensive front had him under siege from the first quarter. USC failed to run the ball effectively, receivers struggled to get open, and Riley did not adjust his game plan until it was far too late. I said in my introduction that each team\u2019s biggest tests would be the primary factor in my rankings, and the Trojans completely flopped in their only notable game thus far. The fact that USC still has an incredibly talented roster and has yet to lose a Pac-12 game prevented me from dropping the Trojans further, but with games against Washington and Oregon still coming down the pike, I believe the Trojans\u2019 dreams of a National Championship in 2023 are just about dead.\n\n5. Utah Utes (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nUtah took care of business the way it needed to on Saturday, handling Cal by 20 points on the road. The Utes\u2019 defense is the best in the conference in my opinion, and they have a better win than USC does. The reason I refused to move this team past the Trojans this week is their offensive limitations have not subsided enough. Kyle Whittingham committed to beating the porous Golden Bear defense by running the ball over and over again with great success. Overall, Utah churned out a whopping 300 yards on the ground, thanks in part to Sione Vaki\u2019s 10 yards per carry. On the other hand, Bryson Barnes only mustered 128 passing yards and did not throw for a score. In six games this season, the Utes have only thrown four touchdown passes, the third-fewest in the country. No one has any idea when Cam Rising will return to the field, and until that day comes, this team is too one-sided to be considered a serious contender. Utah can prove me wrong against USC next weekend, but I\u2019m not sure even Alex Grinch\u2019s defense can make Barnes look good.\n\n6. Arizona Wildcats (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nArizona was one of the first teams I wrote off in the Pac-12 this season after a demoralizing overtime loss at Mississippi State in week 2. However, since Noah Fifita has taken over at quarterback, the Wildcats are experiencing a revival. They played Washington \u2013 a bonafide National Championship contender \u2013 and USC \u2013 a top 10 team at the time \u2013 in back-to-back weeks and lost by a combined nine points. While I may have drawn those performances up to elite teams overlooking an inferior opponent, their 36-point drubbing of Washington State in Pullman has proven that Arizona is for real. Johnny Nansen has had one of the toughest assignments in the nation over the last three weeks having to gameplan for Michael Penix Jr., Caleb Williams and Cam Ward three weeks in a row, yet all of them looked like mere mortals. On the other side of the ball, Arizona\u2019s offense has become rather effective without Jayden de Laura turning the ball over. Fifita had his best game since taking over as the starter; he completed just under 80% of his passes for 342 yards with zero turnovers en route to a 44-point scoring day. The Wildcats are a different team with Fifita under center, and they will have a chance to make some serious noise when they host Oregon State in two weeks.\n\n7. UCLA Bruins (4-2, 1-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nDante Moore has a serious road-game problem. Twice the Bruins have gone into opposing territory with a chance to earn a statement win, and twice the UCLA signal caller discovered the moment was too big for him. In road games at Utah and Oregon State, Moore completed less than half his passing attempts and turned the ball over four times. He has not recorded a QBR above 30 in a Pac-12 game this season. UCLA did some good things in Corvallis, especially in the running game, but those trivial results are not significant when its true freshman quarterback gives the team no chance to win. If the Bruins want to win a big game away from the Rose Bowl in 2023, Moore will have to grow up fast. For now, I consider them a below-average group in this conference.\n\n8. Washington State Cougars (4-2, 1-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nNo team fell harder in the rankings this week than Washington State after suffering the second-largest margin of defeat in the conference to Arizona in its building. Cam Ward went from the most underrated Pac-12 quarterback to a turnover machine over the last two weeks, throwing three picks and losing a fumble in that span. It hasn\u2019t helped Ward that the Cougars averaged just 1.6 yards per rush on Saturday, It hurt even more that Arizona scored on eight of its 10 offensive drives that did not end the first half or the game. I do not know how this WSU team went from Pac-12 dark horse to completely outmatched overnight, but that is exactly what happened.\n\n9. Colorado Buffaloes (4-3, 1-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nI always knew Colorado was going to come back to the pack after a 3-0 non-conference slate, but what happened in Boulder on Friday night was nothing short of embarrassing. Blowing a 29-point halftime lead is bad enough, but losing to a Stanford team that has looked hapless all season is even worse. Even with Travis Hunter back at cornerback, the Buffaloes\u2019 defense was atrocious in the second half. They allowed nearly 400 passing yards to Ashton Daniels, a quarterback who had struggled to even solidify the starting role for the Cardinal. In the seven second-half possessions Stanford had in the second half and overtime, they scored seven touchdowns and kicked two field goals. The lone positive for Deion Sanders is how much better his offense looks with Hunter on the field; he had 14 catches for 140 yards and two scores in his return to Folsom Field. However, this team\u2019s weaknesses have not shown signs of improvement, and after this loss, it will be an uphill climb to bowl eligibility in Sanders\u2019 first season.\n\n10. Cal Golden Bears (3-4, 1-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nIt is a different kind of demoralizing when a team enters a game only able to do one thing offensively, and does it anyway. Utah\u2019s only way to get consistent offense against Cal was to run the ball. Cal knew that, yet allowed 300 rushing yards. Bad defensive performances have been nothing new to the Golden Bears, as Washington and Oregon State scored over 110 combined points on them earlier this season, but allowing over 30 points to a Bryson Barnes-led Utah team may be even more embarrassing than those two results. Since Pac-12 play began, Cal has allowed an unfathomably-high 41.5 points per game. The offense has had good moments this year, but until this team tightens up on the other side of the ball, the Golden Bears will continue to be an afterthought.\n\n11. Stanford Cardinal (2-4, 1-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 12\nColorado is a flawed team, but Stanford had every reason to pack it in at halftime on Friday night, given their 29-point deficit and how poorly the season had gone so far. The Cardinal deserves credit for not doing so. This was a really important road win for Troy Taylor to get given how his first season as head coach has gone thus far. Having given Stanford some credit, I do not see this performance being sustainable in any way. After all, this is the first time the Cardinal offense has eclipsed 30 points since the Hawaii game in Week 1, and their home matchup against Cal is the only winnable game left on their schedule. Friday was an important moment for a rookie head coach, but it does not change the overall disappointment of Stanford\u2019s season.\n\n12. State Sun Devils (1-5, 0-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\nThe Sun Devils were the only team in this conference enjoying a bye week, but I had to drop them in the rankings due to Stanford\u2019s big upset win. Yes, I think the Cardinal\u2019s worst moments this season were worse than Arizona State\u2019s, however, ASU has not had a win this season which even comes close to impressive. Playing USC tough a month ago does not look as impressive as it may have before, and the reality is that wins have to count for something. Stanford taking down Hawaii and Colorado, both on the road, trumps a three-point home win over Southern Utah. Until the Sun Devils find a way to earn a Pac-12 win, they will remain in the basement of my rankings.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/17/clippers-la-splits-first-preseason-games-vs-utah/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Clippers fans should relax about one thing before the regular season kicks off: Kawhi Leonard looks healthy and confident. The Clippers haven\u2019t wowed in their first two preseason games \u2014 losing to the Jazz 101-96 on Oct. 8 before beating them 103-98 two days later \u2014 but Leonard\u2019s availability matters more than anything else at the moment. And Leonard, who\u2019s known for not being the most communicative star, seems not only available, but seriously invested in his team.\n\nLaw Murray, The Athletic\u2019s Clippers beat reporter, recently wrote that \u201c[t]he vibes are admittedly strong with the Clippers after two weeks of training camp. Leonard is engaged.\u201d The Orange County Register\u2019s Janis Carr\u2019s most recent Clippers\u2019 report captured a similar vibe: \u201cFor the first time in two years, Leonard is healthy, on the court, and participating in drills without limitations. He\u2019s also smiling.\u201d\n\nHis enthusiasm behind closed doors has shown up on the court too. In the first preseason game, Leonard scored an efficient 11 points in fewer than 15 minutes of action. He shot at a higher volume in game two against the Jazz, jacking up 10 three-pointers in about 20 minutes, but still managed to sink them at a 40 percent clip. Leonard has been an efficient shooter throughout his career, so we can expect to see more of the same this season.\n\nA healthy, \u201cengaged\u201d Leonard can still be a top ten player, if not higher.  ESPN\u2019s NBArank exercise  had Leonard as the 24th-best player in the league, but that\u2019s a function of durability more than anything else. Would you rather rely on Anthony Davis ( ranked 10th ) or a healthy Kawhi Leonard in a Game 7? I\u2019ll admit that \u201chealthy\u201d can be a big if, but Leonard\u2019s resume suggests that he is one of the NBA\u2019s most impactful players come the playoffs.\n\nNow, time to talk about the Clippers\u2019 other star. We haven\u2019t entered panic-mode yet, but Paul George hasn\u2019t had the same pop so far. Perhaps it\u2019s a function of preseason playing time amid crowded rotations, but George has just 11 points from two games, shooting 4-16 in 35 minutes. If he comes out swinging in the regular season, this puny sample size won\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s something to track, especially as the Clippers prepare for two preseason games against the reigning NBA champions.\n\nThe Clippers will host the Nuggets at  Crypto.com  Arena this week in the final tune-ups before the regular season, offering head coach Tyronn Lue and his crew an opportunity to test their depth against one of the NBA\u2019s most solid rosters. Even without Bruce Brown and Jeff Green, the Nuggets have compelling options at their disposal. Reggie Jackson has assumed the role of backup point guard, with league sophomore Christian Braun likely to assume Brown\u2019s minutes \u2014 albeit in a different role.\n\nGeneral manager Calvin Booth has also taken some interesting stabs in the last two drafts, in addition to Braun. Former UCLA wing Peyton Watson has high-level NBA athleticism and could emerge as a crucial defender in the playoffs. And against the Bulls on Sunday, 2023 late first-rounder Julian Strawther got hot and went for 23 points in 25 minutes, including 4-9 from deep. Second-rounder Hunter Tyson also breached 40 percent on three-pointers with seven attempts.\n\nPreseason might just be preseason, but the Nuggets appear to be successfully rebuilding their rotation on the fly. It\u2019s hard to see the Clippers matching the Nuggets\u2019 depth over the course of this NBA season without some serious wheeling-and-dealing in the trade market. But the Clippers did adopt a similar draft strategy to the Nuggets this past June.\n\nOne theme fans might have noticed from the 2023 Draft is teams using later picks to select older college players, the rationale being that upperclassmen are better prepared to contribute in a playoff series. Like the Nuggets (Strawther was a junior, Tyson was a senior), the Clippers did this twice. First, to select Missouri senior Kobe Brown with the 30th pick, then later to take fellow 23-year-old Miami senior and March Madness breakout star Jordan Miller with the 48th.\n\nFrom a pure scoring perspective, neither Brown nor Miller has popped yet in preseason. But Brown could yet emerge as floor-spacer, having shot 45.5 percent from beyond the arc in his senior season at Mizzou. Miller, on the other hand, clearly doesn\u2019t have Lue\u2019s trust yet, earning just eight minutes in the second Jazz game. Expect him to spend a lot of time with the G League\u2019s Ontario Clippers.\n\nIt\u2019s just hard to see how this Clippers rotation will advance deep into the playoffs \u2014 no number of preseason games will change that. The NBA may be about stars, and the Clippers have two of the league\u2019s best wings when healthy, but real contenders need six or seven reliable, hard-nosed playoff guys. The Nuggets had that last season and will again in 2023-24. The Celtics have arguably the best top six in the NBA right now. Even the Lakers had Rui Hachimura and Lonnie Walker IV play crucial roles against the Warriors and Grizzlies.\n\nBeyond Leonard, George and Russell Westbrook, who will matter on this Clippers team? Terance Mann has yet to average more than 11 points in a season. Nicolas Batum is a reliable distance shooter, but, per The Athletic\u2019s Murray, requested to play in the second unit in last season\u2019s playoffs. Marcus Morris is entering his 13th NBA season and declined in points per game, field goals attempted and field goal percentage last season. Someone has to take a leap.\n\nBut if Clippers fans need a reason to stay positive, they can rest assured that they have one of the league\u2019s best coaches. While the Miami Heat\u2019s Erik Spoelstra ran away with first place in the  annual NBA GM Survey , Ty Lue came in second, earning 10 percent of GMs\u2019 votes. Perhaps more importantly, GMs ranked Lue as the third-best motivator behind only Spoelstra and Steve Kerr, and the second best at making in-game adjustments. In the latter category, Lue narrowed the gap between him and Spoelstra to just 13 percent of the vote.\n\nIt\u2019s clear among front office circles that Lue has title-winning coaching chops, even without a generational talent in LeBron James, whose prime Lue benefitted from with the Cavaliers. But whether or not he secures a ring in LA will depend on his stars\u2019 health and his off-the-bench personnel. The games against the Nuggets will provide a crucial window into how the Clippers\u2019 depth stacks up against the West\u2019s best.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/17/the-big-ten-breakdown-vol-2-big-ten-big-12-acc-and-how-will-the-former-pac-12-fare/", "response": "```\nThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d is a column by Terence Holton about the new look of college football. The Pac-12 has been absolutely incredible in its honorary final season. This past weekend gave us two possible games of the year as Stanford beat Colorado in double overtime, earning their first Pac-12 win, and then-No. 8 Oregon and then-No. 7 Washington gave us a game for the ages that came down to a missed field goal with no time left. The \u201cConference of Champions\u201d has had it all this year. However, with all but two parties currently set to leave the conference and tread uncharted waters (except Colorado who was previously in the Big 12 until 2010), I wonder how long it will be until we see a former Pac-12 team is atop its new conference?\n\nThe Big Ten\nProbably the hardest conference to be joining at the top, maybe outside of the SEC, Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State will be incredibly hard to dethrone. Lucky for Pac-12 fans like myself, arguably the best of the best is being sent to the Midwest. USC, Oregon and Washington make up three of the four current top teams in the Pac-12 standings. While all three will likely be saying goodbye to their star quarterbacks, they are well-coached teams that will create turmoil within the Big Ten. That\u2019s not even counting UCLA, who\u2019s head coach Chip Kelly ran one of the most exciting offenses of the 2010s back at Oregon. With freshman quarterback Dante Moore, UCLA will not bow out easily to anyone.\n\nOne issue UCLA and Washington may stumble into is recruiting. According to 24/7 Sports,  Washington  currently has the 45th ranked recruiting class and 13th in the Big Ten, while  UCLA  has the 56th best class, ahead of only Michigan State and Northwestern in the Big Ten class rankings, two teams who currently do not have head coaches. Oregon and USC are proven recruiters. While USC is lower this year in recruiting rankings than fans are used to, head coach Lincoln Riley has brought in back-to-back top five transfer portal classes and I wouldn\u2019t expect the next few years to be any different.\n\nRealistically, it will be a while before any of these teams will take down Ohio State or Michigan from their golden pedestal, however I believe that Oregon and USC have the best shot of winning the Big Ten, possibly within their first three to five years of joining the conference. It sounds like a long time, but with how good the top of this conference has been, it will be hard to crack into that coveted group of Big Ten champions.\n\nThe Big 12\nThe conference that got the southwest Pac-12 squads may be the most wide open. With the top dogs of Oklahoma and Texas leaving for the SEC, this conference is as open as the holes in the USC offensive line against Notre Dame last week (I\u2019m still angry). With teams like back-to- back Pac-12 champions Utah and the new spectacle in college football, Colorado, joining the conference, I truly believe that these teams could come in and win immediately. Let\u2019s not forget about Arizona and Arizona State though. Arizona just walloped Washington State after barely losing to USC and Washington in the weeks prior, and redshirt freshman quarterback Noah Fifita playing out of his mind, the Wildcats may compete in this conference sooner than some might think.\n\nArizona State is led by Kenny Dillingham, an experienced offensive coordinator who is the youngest coach in Division 1 football. Dillingham also has a freshman quarterback, Jaden Rashada, who has shown flashes of greatness. These four teams all could very easily be competing for the Big 12 in year one of joining. Whether it\u2019s Deion Sanders\u2019 swagger at Colorado, or Kyle Wittingham\u2019s hard knocks football at Utah, I think one of these teams will win a Big 12 championship within their first two years in the conference.\n\nThe ACC\nWith the two most prestigious academic schools currently in the Pac-12 \u2014Stanford and Cal\u2014 joining a conference all the way across the country, I am very curious to see if travel fatigue ends up becoming a major factor in these two\u2019s performance on the field. Disregarding travel however, both these teams have not been great this year. Cal has actually not been horrible, sitting at 3-4. The Golden Bear offense has not been half bad, including a narrow loss to Auburn and a shootout with Oregon State. However, joining the ACC may be the best thing for them. One could argue Cal would be a much better team in a weaker conference. After all, three of their losses are to top 15 teams.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to really hear me out on this one, but I believe Stanford could be on the brink of something special. Stanford sits at 2-4, however their  top 25 national recruiting class , and a 296 yard game from sophomore wide receiver Elic Ayomanor, shows the Cardinal have something brewing. I seriously wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Stanford is contending for the ACC within three years.\n\nWhile I cannot predict the future, I believe the Pac-12 teams may be back on top sooner than some may think. \u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

The members of the self-proclaimed \u201cgreatest band in the world\u201d \u2014Katie Gavin \u201815 (lead vocalist), Josette Maskin \u201816 (lead guitarist) and Naomi McPherson \u201815 (producer, guitar and keys) \u2014 met in USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music\u2019s popular music program in 2013.\n\nMUNA opened the show with \u201cWhat I Want,\u201d and the crowd matched their explosive energy until the encore started with the band\u2019s 2017 single \u201cI Know A Place.\u201d The show ended Muna\u2019s inaugural album cycle, leaving a bittersweet feeling in the hearts of fans and the band alike. \u201cWhen we started as a band, playing the Greek was our imagined finale... I feel like I\u2019m at my funeral,\u201d Gavin said at the Friday concert.\n\nNaomi McPherson (left) and Katie Gavin (right) of MUNA performing \u201cNumber One Fan\u201d at the Greek Theatre on Oct. 12. (Photo by Kate Stuzin)\n\nProfessor Chris Sampson, founder of the popular music major, taught and mentored the trio throughout their four years at USC. He followed Gavin\u2019s musical journey during high school when he worked as her instructor at GRAMMY Camp. \u201cKatie spent considerable time trying different chord progressions [and] different production approaches. I gained so much respect for her,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cExperimentation was important in discovering her own voice, which she brought to the band, and they collectively shaped it into something unique.\u201d\n\nExperimentation brought the band together, and they fuzed their passions of pop and social justice. In songwriting classes, MUNA bonded over intellectual concepts and discussions, which Sampson recalls as the \u201cdifference maker\u201d in their career path.\n\nSophomore popular music major Meghan Chen attended the Oct. 11 show. Chen took MUSC 255: Songwriting I with Sampson last year and noticed his influence on MUNA in the coursework. \u201cThe song \u2018Anything But Me\u2019 uses lots of idioms, like the lyric \u2018I\u2019m on a high horse, but I think my horse is regular sized.\u2019 We had a lesson in songwriting, where we\u2019d transform idioms. I can see the overlap and thought that was pretty neat,\u201d Chen said.\n\nSampson notes that the band became comfortable performing together during Thornton\u2019s popular music showcase and discovered their sound at the 2015 Tommy\u2019s Place PopFest. \u201cWe talked about how the absence of the other live musicians didn\u2019t enhance their sound, that they could use a drummer and bass player,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cThey took that analysis and recognized they had the ingredients for breaking through, for doing something new, for making an impact and for longevity.\u201d\n\nOne of MUNA\u2019 first gig\u2019s at PopFest 2015 at Tommy's Place. (Photo courtesy of Chris Sampson)\n\nThis suggestion followed suit as drummer Sarab Singh and bassist Geo Bothelo joined MUNA onstage at the Greek Theatre. To prepare for the show, Gavin had a voice lesson with Professor Jeffrey Allen, showcasing the ongoing role of the USC community in the band\u2019s success.\n\nSampson\u2019s impact can also be seen in the band\u2019s production style as he organized private lessons for McPherson with Young Guru, Jay-Z\u2019s producer and engineer. From then on, the band started to find their voice, platform and audience.\n\nSampson mentored lead guitar player Maskin for her senior project \u2014 planning and executing MUNA\u2019s trip to the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. \u201cThe demands of radio promos, interviews, and performances showed them what they were in for. It was a bit overwhelming,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cThen they steadily started releasing music, and they survived the ups and downs of the industry. They were signed to a major record label. They were dropped by a major record label. All of this is part of the journey of a band that usually wipes bands out, but they persevered because they had such a strong foundation.\u201d\n\nMUNA released two LPs \u2013 2017\u2032s debut \u2018About U\u2019 and 2019\u2032s \u2018Saves The World\u2019 \u2013 under the major record label RCA. In 2020, the label dropped them, citing cost-cutting measures. In May 2021, MUNA signed with Phoebe Bridgers\u2019 record label Saddest Factory. MUNA then released their first-ever viral hit, \u201cSilk Chiffon,\u201d featuring Bridgers, allowing them to bring their \u201cqueer joy\u201d anthems to a larger audience.\n\nTo close out the two shows, MUNA brought out the members of Boygenius \u2014 Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker \u2014 as a surprise to sing \u201cSilk Chiffon.\u201d \u201cThat was the partnership they needed because Phoebe understood what they were going for, understood them as a band,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cOpening for Taylor Swift up on that stage was a growth moment, and another landmark is the Greek Theater. We\u2019re seeing these touch points along the way of them coming into themselves, and we were remarking recently that it\u2019s a ten-year journey.\u201d\n\nSupporting the band since 2017, MUNA fan Becca Cox, 25, waited at the gates at 9 a.m. to claim her front-row spot in the pit. \u201cI flew into L.A. from New York to see my 11th and 12th show, which was a bittersweet time since it\u2019s the end of their self-titled album cycle,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI love their commitment to the power of music, but also empowerment, self and living authentic queer lives. They\u2019ve all been big role models for me.\u201d\n\nThe band was initially wary of labeling themselves as a \u201cqueer band\u201d but said that it \u201cmakes sense\u201d for the type of music they create. Fans consider the concerts a safe space and much of that is because of how the band shows up for the LGBTQ+ community.

Makenzi Johnson: It\u2019s such a good show and I love all of the movies Will Smith is in. Omg Tolu, speaking of Will, have you heard the news about Jada Pinkett and Will Smith?! Okegbenro: Actually I have! You know I love being on Twitter, oh my bad \u201cX\u201d all day. Johnson: Haha yes you do. I always see you on it during your breaks. For those who don\u2019t know, The Today Show previewed a special interview with Jada Pinkett Smith on her new memoir where she revealed that she and Will have been separated since 2016. Okegbenro: Okay, not too much Makenzi about me on X. We all have our guilty pleasures in life. I am just really interested in what people think about their relationship because dating politics is a huge thing in Generation Z and so many people are shocked by the news, me included. Johnson: You know what, you\u2019re right. I guess that\u2019s why we decided to talk to some students on campus and share what they thought about the situation. Let\u2019s recap what people had to say. Okegbenro: Some students like Marissa Yeh had not heard the news yet and were shocked when we told them the news Marissa Yeh: That\u2019s insane. I thought they were a happy couple especially after that whole Chris Rock thing when he beat him up. They\u2019re separated? Johnson: Haha I had the same reaction when I found out. Other students like Abonie Blount questioned Will\u2019s actions at the Oscars last year. Abonie Blount: I want to say I\u2019m not surprised but I am. I was under the assumption that they were in an open relationship and I know sometimes that doesn\u2019t - that\u2019s not the same as being separated. With the whole August Alsina stuff and the mess and the Chris Rock stuff, oh my goodness like he is going to war over this woman for them not to be together. What\u2019s 10 minus three? Seven years! That\u2019s just crazy. Okegbenro: Maybe I don\u2019t want that Jada and Will love after all. Johnson: No yeah, this is worse than the Bradgelina break up.

The numbers are startling: 1200 Israelis dead. A similar number of Palestinians also dead. 5000 wounded in Gaza. 2 million Palestinians are now encountering extreme shortages of water, food, fuel and medication after the Egypt-Gaza border was destroyed by Israeli bombing.\n\nOne British-Palestinian, who doesn\u2019t want his name used, talks about how the conflict is affecting him and his family.\n\nBritish-Palestinian: Now there\u2019s a complete siege. So no supplies, no water. I mean, 98% of the water in Gaza is is unclean to begin with. So imagine now where you don\u2019t have water, you don\u2019t have electricity. The one power station that was working in Gaza has today run out of fuel.\n\nEarlier today, the Israeli military closed off a large land area around Gaza. And now, fuel is running out at Gaza\u2019s only power plant.\n\nWael Buhaissy, a Palestinian-American, is having difficulty communicating with his family in Gaza due to the blockade.\n\nWael Buhaissy: When my cousin talks to me... we do Facebook Messenger...he said this will have to be quick because we\u2019re going to lose electricity any time.\n\nWho\u2019s to blame for the conflict? It\u2019s complicated, says Sandy Tolan, a USC professor and author of several books on Israel-Palestine.\n\nSandy Tolan: This started on Saturday. No, it didn\u2019t. It really goes way back. And there are there are a lot of bad players in this and a lot of it is the extension of how Israel has essentially tried to take over more and more of the land and keep Palestinians in place while they continue to build out settlements and keep Gaza essentially under lock and key. Does this justify what happened? Absolutely not. Does it help understand the power and fury that results in this kind of action defense? Indefensible as it is? Yes, it does help explain that.\n\nThe Palestinians understand how this conflict is affecting the Israeli population too.\n\nBritish-Palestinian: I understand why people in Israel might be upset, because obviously, you know, that\u2019s their own people. But at the same time, the Palestinians are people you know, it\u2019s a two-way street here. You know, their life isn\u2019t less valuable than our life. I hope that the international community will come to their senses and wake up and essentially try to find a reasonable solution that can minimize the bloodshed, because that\u2019s the most important thing. No one, no one in their reasonable mind wants to see this. Innocent lives being lost is not an ideal situation.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/17/the-boy-and-the-heron-review-miyazakis-movie-about-a-long-goodbye/", "response": "```\n\u2018The Boy and the Heron\u2019 film and book review: Miyazaki\u2019s movie about a long goodbye\n\nAfter ten years, Hayao Miyazaki takes up the director\u2019s seat again to bring his favorite novel to life, taking audiences on a winding journey about enduring, sacrifice, and as always, venturing into a wonderfully enigmatic unknown.\n\nThe latest in Studio Ghibli\u2019s beloved filmography is Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s,\u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u201dis based on one of the director\u2019s favorite books, \u201cHow Do You Live?\u201d by Genzaburo Yoshino, first published in 1937. The book underwent cycles of editing, censorship, and banning during the interwar periods of Japan in the 1930s where the film is also set. The original edition was restored and brought to the hands of readers from all countries and ages where new characters and worlds breathed life into the classic story. One such version comes from the minds of Studio Ghibli.\n\nBy Olivia Siu October 17, 2023 at 9:00 am PDT\n\nContent warning: Film contains minor depictions of self harm and bloody violence\n\nWithout a whisper of official marketing, trailers nor even an announced plot summary or cast, \u201cHow Do You Live\u201d broke records in Japan as the biggest opening weekend in animation giant Studio Ghibli\u2019s history. The film earned $13.2 million (1.83 billion yen) from this past summer\u2019s release date of Friday, July 14 to the following Sunday, which blew past the 1.48 billion yen debut of \u201cHowl\u2019s Moving Castle\u201d in 2004. The renowned animation director Hayao Miyazaki expressed anxiety about the zero publicity plan, as this film\u2019s release has spotlighted his return from a ten-year supposed retirement hiatus. This is on top of a suggestion from a Ghibli executive that alluded to more films ahead that would be under Miyazaki\u2019s name.\n\nThe film\u2019s own emphasis on separation, loss, and belonging may be the most insight into how the famed animation creative may already be thinking about goodbyes. As for filling theater seats in the first place, it is already the case with Japanese moviegoers that both a new film\u2019s popularity and prestige travel fastest by word of mouth.\n\n\u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u201d first released as\u300c\u541b\u305f\u3061\u306f\u3069\u3046\u751f\u304d\u308b\u304b\u300dor in Romaji, \u201cKimitachi wa D\u014d Ikiru ka,\u201d literally translating to \"How Do You Live\" in Japan on July 14th at theaters such as Toho Cinemas in Shinjuku. The L.A. premiere will be at the Animation is Film Festival on October 18th, with a U.S. theatrical release on December 8th.\n\n\u201cOut of all the past Studio Ghibli films, I would say \u2018Spirited Away\u2019 is the most similar to \u2018How Do You Live,\u2019\u201d said Mitchell Kazumaru Christ, a software developer who travels between Japan and the US \u201cat least twice a year\u201d as a dual citizen. Christ saw the film shortly after its summer release and had, until then, missed the in-story worlds of Ghibli. He commented on the possible difference in reception non-Japanese audiences may have to \u201cThe Boy and the Heron,\u201d stating \u201cthe only thing foreigners may not immediately pick up is the cultural and historical nuances,\u201d but said otherwise, worldwide audiences will likely enjoy it as is.\n\nIn anticipation of a local theatrical release, non-Japan audiences can connect directly with Miyzaki\u2019s inspirational source material: Genzaburo Yoshino\u2019s novel \u201cHow Do You Live.\u201d This is what M.S. Game Design and Development \u201824 student Seleny Xie did before attending the advanced Los Angeles screening on November 22nd. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this is a film adaptation, but rather both the film and book draw on the same emotions. You won\u2019t be able to necessarily match specific pages to a scene,\u201d says Xie who also translates classic film franchises to VR platforms under Sony Pictures Virtual Reality.\n\nThe New York Times critics who reviewed the book\u2019s first English translation might have agreed, who proposed Yoshino\u2019s philosophies as \u201cfairly dense and demanding\u201d in a 2021 review when the film existed only in rumors. The creators of Studio Ghibli usually encourage viewers to immerse themselves first in the films\u2019 landscapes before contemplating their deeper meanings, with this film in particular prioritizing world-building over character relationship dynamics.\n\nWhen released in the U.S., \u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u2019' may reward repeat viewings by being a treat for the escapists in childhood fans and Ghibli newcomers alike. The Oscar-winning 2001 film \"Spirited Away\" is an international classic and one of the more adventure, open-world features in Studio Ghibli\u2019s filmography.\n\nSimilar to the Oscar-winning \u201cSpirited Away,\u201d the narrative arc of \u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u201d progresses like a journey spiraling inward to more supernatural, but intimate scenes. Viewers will follow the young protagonist, Mahito, as he begrudgingly moves to a new home in the countryside and begins to encounter odd phenomena like sneering animals and hyper-realistic dreams. What is in the film\u2019s first few seconds of rushed chaos shows a somber signal of heavy topics ahead. This opener is the spark for Mahito\u2019s inner motivations and torments, and can explain why these would bubble beneath a young boy\u2019s stone-cold resolve. In other words, do not arrive late and miss this movie\u2019s beginning.\n\nSince the start, this film held its ground standing on the mature end of Ghibli films, but also animation films at large. The fantastical nature of the world is disorienting, and perhaps haunting in a creeping feeling that only something from the hand-drawn uncanny valley can depict. Mahito and other characters seem to sense their surroundings\u2019 swarming and increasingly supernatural nature. Ghibli fans will recognize the studio\u2019s uniquely staged physics where rivers look like billowing ribbons and tears squeeze out of eyes in large droplets. Yet something red also falls down Mahito\u2019s face, but his gaze is unfettered, and suddenly \u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u201d is about something very real.\n\nMinor, but bloody depictions of self-harm are shown on screen which could seem like a first for Ghibli or animation movie watchers. However, gently and knowingly, a mutual revealing of scars from healing is also shown later. Playing in surround sound is Joe Hisaishi\u2019s original soundtrack for the film, which sounds less like a lullaby and more like a long goodbye. He performed one of the tracks, \u201dAsk Me Why\u201d solo on piano during his Symphonic Concert Tour this past year, which Jake Cunningham of the UK-based Ghibliotheque Podcast recounted as the moment he cried from Hisaishi\u2019s \u201cvulnerable and compassionate\u201d playing.\n\nWhile Cunningham, like many fans that night, had not seen the film, he appreciated that the song, standing alone from its movie, purely lent itself to \u201cthe theater of the mind.\u201d\n\nOne other motif too intricate to be labeled only as a conversation of grief or loss, is how the past overtakes the present moment. It can come quietly and deeply sink oneself into imaginary water or it can break down the front door with ferocity. Mahito carries these things and more and marches across the screen in many instances. As a Ghibli protagonist, he is young and he is decisive. He cries, yet grits his teeth and aims a weapon. He is not noble, but determined.\n\nMahito, the film\u2019s protagonist, adjusts to life in a new house and upbringing in the countryside. Even if given an open door to turn back, he continues forward as if to not lose sight, as if he was left behind first. Eventually, Mahito interrupts his own present path and, against the warnings of folklore, follows a gray heron or \u201cAosagibi\u201d down a perhaps not-so-proverbial rabbit hole. The tale that unfolds after is a thrilling and heartfelt adventure that marks Miyazaki\u2019s grand return to cinema.\n\nThe pivotal challenges along the way are gritty, yet hard-won lessons making \u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u201d a worthy spectacle standing out from the already extraordinary legacy it continues.\n\nWondering what to watch while you wait for tickets? In anticipation of the December 8 U.S. release of \u201cThe Boy and the Heron,\u201d prepare to meander through passageways of other worlds tilted from the reality we know with a hint of nonsensical and nostalgic: \u201cSuzume\u201d (2022), CoMix Wave Films \u201cKubo and the Two Strings\u201d (2016), Laika Entertainment \u201cTreasure Planet\u201d (2002), Walt Disney Pictures\n\nRead the book, of which \u201cThe Boy and the Heron\u201d is based on: How Do You Live?

(Photo courtesy of Noelani Day.)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino October 16, 2023 at 9:48 pm PDT\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d is a column by Anthony Bottino that talks about elite USC athletes who aren\u2019t on one of the school\u2019s Division 1 teams. USC has produced countless Olympians, some from the past, some from the present and more to come in the future. From track to water polo, USC\u2019s Division I athletic programs boast Olympians throughout. There is, however, one Olympian swimmer who stands apart from the rest and is not on the D-1 team.\n\nNoelani Day, a 20-year-old junior studying human biology, is a world-class and determined swimmer. She brings the same passion and dedication to her schoolwork on her path to becoming a physical therapist. Day is an international student from the island of Tonga, a small South Pacific island in the Coral Sea, located about 3,000 miles off the coast of Australia. Up until college, Day lived in Tonga her whole life, and her upbringing differs from that of most at USC.\n\n\u201cTonga is a really small island where everyone knows everyone,\u201d Day said. \u201cSo I was surrounded by family all the time. I grew up in a really small village where everyone is related.\u201d\n\nThis different lifestyle also brought about unique approaches to swim training. Since Tonga is a small island without swimming pools or an actual swim team, Day had to adopt alternative methods. When she was eight, a volunteer from Australian Aid came to Tonga and formed a group of kids interested in swimming. She would take them off the island for lessons but left after only two months. Other volunteers came and went, but the program eventually ended. Afterward, Day\u2019s mother took charge.\n\nIn her quest to continue training, Day\u2019s mother discovered scholarships for swim camps around the world. Day received multiple scholarships to attend camps in countries such as Japan, China, Thailand and Fiji. These camps played a significant role in honing her skills to compete at an elite level; however, this constituted only about 10% of her training regimen. The remaining 90% consisted of training in the ocean back home in Tonga, setting her training process apart from that of her competitors.\n\n\u201cMy competitors have pools, coaches, access to everything and that intimidated me a lot when I was young,\u201d Day said. \u201cI grew up doing dives on a rock, and I was lucky to do dives because it had to be high tide. I learned how to do flip turns on coral walls. Things like that you have to train double for and on your own.\u201d\n\nThe unconventional training paid off, and Day saw significant success, preparing to take her talents to the next level. From the moment Day discovered the Olympics, she was determined to compete at the pinnacle of all sports. Not only that, but she wanted to represent her country like no one before. Day may not be the first Tongan swimmer in the Olympics, but she is the island\u2019s first homegrown swimmer. In Tonga, when athletes reach the next level, they often leave the island to train and live elsewhere. This was not the case for Day. While she gained experience in camps and training outside of Tonga, her primary training involved ocean swims on the island, providing her with a historic opportunity to be the first Tonga-based Olympic Swimmer.\n\nWhen the qualifications for the Tokyo Olympics came around, Day was not going to let years of hard work go to waste. After dedicating years of her life to Olympic training, she was finally given her chance to qualify. In Tonga and other small islands, Olympic qualification is determined by a universality spot. This spot is given to the fastest male and female athletes in the country. Day had to outperform everyone who was training overseas, and that\u2019s precisely what she did.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t really hit me at first,\u201d Day said. \u201cI was happy, but it was like, \u2018I finally did it.\u2019 I was happy for myself but for everyone who helped me, especially my mom. I was thinking about back home how I was the first homegrown swimmer to make it; we\u2019ve only had people from elsewhere make it.\u201d\n\nDay was confident that she would one day make it to the Olympics, and she never lost sight of where she came from and who helped her along the way. She takes great pride in this, and everything she does represents her family and home. Her pride is shown within her and literally on her. Day has two highly significant tattoos. The first is the iconic Olympic rings, symbolizing her proudest achievement and marking her as a world-class athlete. The second is a traditional Polynesian tattoo on her back, created specifically in honor of her grandmother, who was like a mother to her and played an extremely important role in her life. These tattoos serve as constant reminders of who and what she\u2019s doing all of this for. Being far from Tonga, they help her stay connected to her roots.\n\nDespite all her training overseas and in the ocean, as well as her journey to the Tokyo Olympics, it might seem like Day had no time for academics. However, that\u2019s not the case at all, as she takes her studies as seriously as she takes swimming. Her commitment to academics is what eventually brought her to USC.\n\n\u201cI googled top physical therapy schools in America, and USC came up and the deadline was in two weeks,\u201d Day said. \u201cI had no idea how applying to school in the U.S. even worked, I didn\u2019t think I would get in but then I did.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Day didn\u2019t even realize what it meant to get into USC, especially with a major like human biology. Initially, the prospect of coming to the U.S. for school while still pursuing her swimming career seemed daunting. However, with support from her family, she made the courageous decision to attend USC. As a human biology major studying to become a physical therapist, she faces a rigorous workload. Combined with her swimming commitments, it\u2019s a lot to handle, but Day has managed to figure it out.\n\n\u201cBack home, I was training and took every opportunity I could to leave the island, so I was gone for months at a time,\u201d Day said. \u201cI was already used to self-studying, figuring things out and managing my schedule. If I have time I go to the gym in the morning, I train with club swim, and I generally just train when I can in the Lyon Center.\u201d\n\nDay is full of confidence and is an amazing athlete, but she decided not to join D-1 the team.\n\n\u201cI actually had no idea that we even had a swim team until I got here,\u201d Day said. \u201cI had no idea that sports existed on this scale. What people don\u2019t understand is that this is a whole other level, and I come from a very different background. Balancing that with school and family obligations is a lot. It\u2019s time for me to devote myself to school and to my family.\u201d\n\nDay has already accomplished her life dream of representing Tonga in the Olympics and now she is focused on the next goal: becoming a physical therapist. While pursuing her degree, she is still able to compete with club swim and in her National Federation. Life has significantly changed for Day since the last Olympics, though she still has her sights set on Paris. But this time, with a different perspective.\n\n\u201cIf it happens for me, it happens and that would be great, but I didn\u2019t want to devote all my time to that,\u201d Day said. \u201cI have other priorities that have taken over.\u201d\n\nDay\u2019s next competition is in late November for her regional games. With Paris 2024 in mind, she is still focused on becoming an Olympian and a physical therapist. Noelani Day has a lot going on in her life, but despite it all, she has never forgotten her roots and everything she does is for her family and home, Tonga.\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d runs every other Monday.\n```"}

Washington won 36-33. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade October 16, 2023 at 5:27 pm PDT\n\n\u201cShout\u201d is a column by Matthew Andrade about college football.\n\nIt was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Oregon had a lead late. Washington\u2019s offense erupted to take it back. And what\u2019s driving the discourse after the game is Oregon head coach Dan Lanning\u2019s fourth-down decisions. It was the same result as last year except, this time, Lanning\u2019s crucial decision to go for it on fourth down in the closing minutes was even more justified.\n\nLast year, a minute and a half remained on the game clock with the game tied and the Ducks facing a fourth-and-1 at their own 33-yard line. Oregon went for it and was stopped. This year, the Ducks were up four points and faced a fourth-and-3 at the Washington 47-yard line with 2:16 left. Needless to say, Oregon went for it and senior quarterback Bo Nix\u2019s pass fell incomplete.\n\nThe first thought rushing through many fans\u2019 brains was, did Lanning not learn from his mistakes last year? How does he blow a game like this two years in a row? First of all, it wasn\u2019t the same decision as last year. This was 20 yards further down the field and a first down meant a win. The Ducks converted 80% of their fourth-down attempts coming into the game, according to Dennis Dodd of CBS Sports. Any team would be counting its lucky stars if it needed just three yards to beat the No. 7 team in the country and had converted that down 80% of the time heading into the game.\n\nIf you punt instead, you\u2019re giving Washington\u2019s prolific senior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. the opportunity to march down the field and score. \u201cThey had proven to be an explosive offense regardless of where they get the ball,\u201d Lanning said of the fourth-down decision late in the game. \u201cIt gave ourselves the ball back with plenty of time to score.\u201d\n\nTo Lanning\u2019s point, it would likely have taken Washington an additional 30 to 40 seconds to get to the end zone if the Ducks punted and pinned the Huskies deep in their own territory. After Oregon went for it on fourth down and failed to convert, the Huskies scored in 33 seconds. That left the Ducks\u2019 offense 1:38 to just get into field-goal range. If the Ducks punted, Oregon probably gets the ball with under 1:10 left. That\u2019s not a recipe for success.\n\nSecond of all, it wasn\u2019t a mistake. It\u2019s well known that Lanning is part of the new wave of head coaches who base their in-game decisions primarily on analytics. That is, they\u2019re making decisions using percentages to determine what would have the highest chance of winning the team the game. Some coaches use analytics early in the game when it\u2019s less risky. Some use it only at the end to determine how to essentially close out the win. Lanning uses analytics the entire time.\n\nIn fact, before the most controversial fourth down, Oregon had already faced two fourth-and-3\u2032s in the game. The first was in the final seconds of the first half at Washington\u2019s 3-yard line. The other was in the third quarter at Washington\u2019s 8-yard line. Both could have been easy field goals. Lanning opted to try for touchdowns and the Ducks were stopped on both attempts. After those fourth downs were stuffed, it would make sense to abandon the strategy, right? Wrong. If you\u2019re committing to analytics, you have to commit to it all the way.\n\nESPN\u2019s Bill Connelly wrote that Oregon\u2019s offense gains at least three yards on 70% of plays. That means the Ducks had approximately a 70% chance of converting on each of these fourth downs by just running their traditional offense. If you fail twice, you should still feel very confident you can convert on the third try. The stats eventually have to get back to the mean.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the film Moneyball where Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane puts together an unconventional team. The team is assembled with everyone in the exact right position for the A\u2019s to win. Deviating from that strategy would put the team in ruins. Oakland\u2019s manager is reluctant to adopt the strategy and once he does, the team loses just about every game. But Beane persists with the lineup he created and eventually the A\u2019s go on one of the longest win streaks in MLB history. That\u2019s how you have to treat analytics. You can\u2019t be reckless, but you have to trust the numbers. Eventually the stats have to break Oregon\u2019s way in one of these big games. It has to, or so the numbers say.\n\n\u201cShout\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

Despite outgaining No. 21 Notre Dame, 302 total yards to 251, the No. 10 Trojans ultimately couldn\u2019t overcome five turnovers, four of which led directly to 28 points, while being handed their first loss of the season, 48-20.\n\nThe 94th meeting between the Trojans (6-1) and Fighting Irish (6-2) extended Notre Dame\u2019s winning streak against USC in South Bend to five games. The last time the Trojans beat the Irish at Notre Dame Stadium was 2011.\n\nThe Irish, energized by a raucous sellout crowd of 77,622, improved their all-time record in the series to 51-38-5.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to play nearly good enough football to win tonight,\u201d Coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cThe team had great resolve at halftime, very much believed at halftime that we were going to win the football game.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame led 24-6 at the half, which also happened to be the halftime score of the teams\u2019 1974 matchup at the Coliseum in which the Trojans battled back to score a stunning 49 unanswered points in the second half en route to a historic 55-24 victory.\n\nTo start the third quarter on Saturday night, a 31-yard touchdown run by MarShawn Lloyd gave the Trojans some hope that USC\u2019s second-half surge from nearly 50 years ago might repeat itself.\n\nThe Fighting Irish, however, had other plans. Sixth-year quarterback Sam Hartman hit senior wide receiver Chris Tyree six plays later on a slant across the middle for a 46-yard catch-and-run touchdown, pushing the Trojans back into an 18-point deficit.\n\nBut USC showed signs of life as standout freshman Zachariah Branch, who returned after missing the last two games due to a reported knee injury, took a Notre Dame punt 60 yards to set up a short field for Trojan quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nFive plays later, Williams found a familiar touchdown target, senior receiver Brenden Rice, who reached over the goal line for a gritty 7-yard score.\n\nNow trailing by a manageable 11 points, 31-20, with 9:04 left in the game, the Trojans\u2019 special teams had a major blunder, allowing a 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by redshirt freshman Jadarian Price.\n\nGame over.\n\n\u201cIt felt like all the way up until the kickoff return for a touchdown, we were right there,\u201d Riley said.\n\nNotre Dame finished the game on a 14-0 run, including a 15-yard fumble recovery for a score by redshirt junior safety Xavier Watts with 3:27 left.\n\nAlthough giving up 48 points would typically indicate poor defensive play by the Trojans, who have struggled on that side of the ball all season, Riley said he thought USC\u2019s defense played well enough to win the game.\n\n\u201cThe defense stepped up and did a lot of great things there, but we put them in some terrible positions,\u201d Riley said.\n\nThose \u201cterrible positions\u201d came courtesy of five turnovers by the USC offense \u2013 three of which were first-half interceptions thrown by Williams.\n\nHis first two picks, both by Watts \u2013 a converted wide receiver \u2013 set up short fields of 12 and 2 yards.\n\n\u201cWe were able to capitalize off of what I\u2019m sure he [Williams] would call mistakes,\u201d Notre Dame Coach Marcus Freeman said. \u201cInstead of just having PBUs [passes broken up], our guys turned those into takeaways, which were huge for our entire team.\u201d\n\nThe Fighting Irish turned each Williams interception into a touchdown, uncharacteristic for the Heisman Trophy winner, who came into the game with 22 touchdowns against only one interception.\n\n\u201cI made mistakes that I usually don\u2019t make,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNights like that happen.\u201d\n\nWilliams finished 23 of 37 passing for a season-low 199 yards. Hartman, the Wake Forest transfer, was 13 of 20 for a modest 126 yards, with two touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nRiley emphasized his belief that the Trojans will gel in the coming weeks as USC continues its most challenging stretch of the season in the highly competitive Pac-12 race.\n\n\u201cWe play in, right now, what I think is the best conference in college football,\u201d Riley said. \u201cEvery opportunity that we want is waiting for us, including a big one seven days from now in Los Angeles that we\u2019ll be excited to get back and prepare for.\u201d\n\nNext Saturday, USC returns home to face two-time defending conference champ Utah, which beat the Trojans twice last season, at 5 p.m. at the Coliseum.\n```"}

Another streak was snapped as well; it was the first time the Trojans scored less than two goals in a game since Aug. 27 at No. 3 North Carolina.\n\n\u201cWhat we told our players at the end was that the only time we\u2019re unhappy as a staff is if players don\u2019t work hard and don\u2019t give it their all,\u201d USC head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cWe felt in this game that the players did give it their all. It\u2019s always disappointing when you don\u2019t get a result, but we know that we\u2019re still alive and continuing our pursuit of a Pac-12 title.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans made their mark early on. In the third minute, junior forward Kayla Colbert received a swift lofted ball from junior midfielder Helena Sampaio and beat her defender to the ball. Colbert then dribbled into the box, cut away from the defender and tucked the ball into the bottom left corner with her left foot for the first goal of the game.\n\n\u201cWhat Helena Sampaio and Kayla Colbert do is both very special,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cHelena\u2019s service from deep through balls and her vision are incredible. Kayla Colbert has been a clinical finisher for us. It\u2019s a really nice duo along with our other great attackers.\u201d\n\nColbert\u2019s team-leading sixth goal was a part of a gameplan USC has employed often. The Trojans have attacked their opponents quickly, scoring in the first 10 minutes in four out of their six games in Pac-12 play.\n\nUSC continued to attack early, but Colorado picked out the Trojans\u2019 defense on a counter attack that led to a penalty for the Buffalos in the 10th minute. Senior forward Shyra James converted the penalty to level the score at 1-1.\n\nColorado\u2019s goal was the first that USC has allowed since Sep. 28 against Washington State.\n\nColorado broke through the Trojans\u2019 defense again on a counter attack in the 31st minute, when the Buffaloes drew another penalty. Sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson saved the initial penalty to her right, but the referee blew the whistle and allowed Colorado retake the kick, ruling that Dickinson jumped off her line too early.\n\nThe redo didn\u2019t phase Dickinson, as she dove to her left this time and made the save to keep the game even.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to save one, but it\u2019s very hard to save two, so I was really proud of her in that moment,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cI think that was probably the biggest moment of her career to date, and there\u2019s many more to come.\u201d\n\nUSC barely outshot Colorado in the first half (six to four), but it poured on the pressure in the second half. The Trojans did everything they could to find a go-ahead goal, notching 13 shots in the second half.\n\nThe Trojans had many chances to take back the lead, with their closest attempt being a curving shot from the top of the box by junior defender Brooklyn Courtnall that hit the crossbar in the 74th minute.\n\nUSC had two good chances from junior forward/defender Izzy Kimberly and junior forward Simone Jackson that were each saved for a corner kick in the 81st and 82nd minute.\n\nColorado pushed quickly in the 84th minute and almost turned a corner into a goal, as the shot hit the crossbar and came back into play.\n\nThe Buffalos followed that up with another shot that was saved up high by Dickinson.\n\nThe Trojans had one final chance in the last minute of play, as Jackson had to chip Colorado\u2019s junior goalkeeper Jordan Nytes in close, but her shot just went over the crossbar.\n\nUSC will look to bounce back on the road next week when it travels to the desert to face Arizona State and Arizona. The Trojans will face the Sun Devils on Thursday at 7 p.m. and the Wildcats on Sunday at 1 p.m.\n```"}

Caleb Williams was unable to withstand pressure in the first half, throwing three interceptions. USC is down 24-6.\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie October 14, 2023 at 6:30 pm PDT\n\nNo. 10 USC did not have a strong start to its 94th matchup against historic rival No. 21 Notre Dame. An early interception from a heavily-pressured Caleb Williams led to an easy touchdown for Notre Dame redshirt freshman running back Gi\u2019Bran Payne just three plays later. The game has yet to improve for the Trojans. After a series of punts, USC managed a methodical drive that ended in a 25-yard field goal. The first quarter ended with a 7-3 Notre Dame lead.\n\nAn explosive drive by Notre Dame, ending the first quarter and starting the second, featured 16-yard gains by senior receiver Chris Tyree and freshman receiver Jordan Faison. The drive ended with a field goal. USC was later kept alive on fourth-and-6 by a running into the kicker penalty, allowing Williams to convert a fourth-and-1 with an eight yard run toward the right sideline. Williams ran for a 38-yard touchdown later that drive, but lost it to a holding penalty. The drive ended with another attempt on fourth-and-1 for the Trojans, but was unsuccessful that time as senior Notre Dame linebacker JD Bertrand stuffed both redshirt senior running back Austin Jones and Williams during the handoff.\n\nOn USC\u2019s next possession, an escaping Williams threw a pass into triple coverage. Notre Dame redshirt junior safety Xavier Watts took his second pick of the game to the 2-yard line, which junior running back Audric Estim\u00e9 quickly turned into a touchdown. The very next drive for USC, Williams was intercepted yet again, this time by sophomore corner Benjamin Morrsion. It\u2019s the first three-interception game of Williams\u2019 career, and it comes at a bad time, with three general managers who could be looking for quarterbacks \u2014 the Giants\u2019 Joe Shoen, the Bears\u2019 Ryan Poles and the Vikings\u2019 Kwesi Adofo-Mensah \u2014 all in attendance.

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza October 13, 2023 at 11:01 pm PDT\n\nUSC comes into its matchup on Saturday against Notre Dame as underdogs. It\u2019s no surprise considering its play, specifically on defense, over the past few weeks. If USC has any hope of keeping its undefeated season intact, it will have to rely on the play of its defense to silence graduate quarterback Sam Hartman and the Irish.\n\nThe Irish are struggling to score over their past three games \u2013 they\u2019ve averaged just over 18 points per game. A big key to keeping them off the scoreboard is in the play of the linebacker position. In his weekly presser, head coach Lincoln Riley spoke of that group\u2019s play last week and what he looks to get out of them in South Bend.\n\nEach of senior Mason Cobb, junior Eric Gentry, redshirt senior Shane Lee, freshman Tackett Curtis and junior Raesjon Davis have earned significant snaps at the position so far this season.\n\n\u201cWe felt like all of those [linebackers] practiced well enough that we were gonna play them,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAfter the first quarter, we got settled in and had a pretty good stretch of ball from the backers. We had the one big mistake on the seam ball for a touchdown, but other than that we were doing good things in the linebacker world. Shane came in ... he, Mason and Gentry were all playing at a high level. I feel like that group, certainly with Raesjon [and Tackett Curtis] still in the mix, we feel like there are five that we are very comfortable with.\u201d\n\nA big key heading into Saturday will be the continued leadership of guys like junior safety Calen Bullock to ensure the Trojans stay focused and sharp, considering the challenges they\u2019ve faced the past couple of weeks and the inherent challenges of playing on the road.\n\n\u201c[Calen] has played a couple years for us now. He knows the defense, he knows the culture, he knows the guys \u2014 specifically in the defensive backfield with our secondary guys,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHaving some leaders step up there is very important for us. You need it on offense, you need it on defense, on special teams. But in these different pods within the team, you need those guys to step up as well.\u201d\n\nAnother issue for the Trojans has been converting on third downs. Over the past three games, they are just 9 for 28 on third-down conversions. Riley believes the key is ensuring that they get more third-and-short opportunities and staying away from the third-and-long shots that they\u2019ve taken.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hardly run any third-and-short plays the past few games. You\u2019d be the best team in the country if you convert 30% of your third and longs. It\u2019s just the name of the game,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of opportunities that we\u2019ve missed on some manageable ones that we have to make. Number one thing is we have to stay off third and longs more than we have the past couple weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will travel the furthest they have all season for the game on Saturday, and they will seemingly play in some pretty cold and rainy conditions. On top of the game being an extremely important one for the fans and because of the storied rivalry, the weather conditions add an extra layer that the team needs to be ready for.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the intangible side of it, you gotta handle all parts of this,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about the road and the intensity. You gotta handle the elements and whatever the weather does present. A lot of fun, unique challenges. But again, it\u2019s a rivalry game, it\u2019s what it should be like. It\u2019s two good football teams. It\u2019ll be a fun environment.\u201d\n```"}

After a long weekend in Talla-nasty, I\u2019m back to bring you the rundown of this weekend\u2019s college football slate. I hope you missed me \u2014 this weekend has some great games that\u2019ll certainly be worth the wait. Let us not delay any further. Happy Saturday eve.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK \u2014 No. 7 Washington (5-0) vs. No. 8 Oregon (5-0)\nSeattle, Wash. 12:30 p.m. PDT on ABC\n\nThis high-octane PAC-12 matchup will surely go down as one of the best and most pivotal games of the year, with two top-10 teams facing off for only the second time this season. Washington has looked like potentially the best passing offense in the nation, with senior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. climbing Heisman lists due to his jaw-dropping statlines. In just five games, he\u2019s thrown for 1,999 yards and 16 touchdowns on 74.7 percent completion with only two interceptions. Penix is ranked third most efficient of all FBS quarterbacks, and leads a Washington offense that is leading FBS with an average of 569.4 yards per game.\n\nThe fair criticism, however, has been the fact that in five whole games, the Huskies haven\u2019t played much of anyone. They opened the season with back-to-back beatdowns of Group of 5 programs, followed by thrashings of Michigan State (2-3) and California (3-3) before winning a close game against Arizona 31-24 two weeks ago. The Huskies should be fresh coming off a bye week, but will need to prove they can play with the big boys against an Oregon team that ranks second in total offense among FBS schools, as well as sixth in total defense.\n\nThe question mark here is not whether the Huskies will be able to score. They will, end of story. But will Penix and the offense be able to OUT-score Bo Nix and Oregon, who could have a field day against Washington\u2019s 62nd-ranked defensive unit? That\u2019s a bit more doubtful. If Washington is giving up 365 yards per game to mostly under-matched teams, they\u2019ll certainly struggle with a ranked conference opponent. For that reason, I\u2019m with the Ducks on this one. Regardless of the outcome, it\u2019ll be worth tuning in for a sure shootout between two of the best teams in football.\n\nUPSET ALERT \u2014 No. 19 Washington State (4-1) vs. Arizona (3-3)\nPullman, Wash. 4:00 p.m. PDT on PAC-12 Network\n\nArizona has now gone two weeks straight without a win despite coming *this* close to knocking off two top-10 teams in Washington and Southern Cal. It\u2019s time for the Wildcats to finally pull off an upset, and no better team to do it against than a Wazzu squad that is reeling from their first loss of the year last week against UCLA. Felipe Londo\u00f1o did a great job of breaking this down when he filled in for me on Saturday eve last week, correctly predicting UCLA\u2019s upset, so I\u2019ll spare the details for those that read his column. But basically, the Cougars are great at passing the football and pretty bad at just about everything else. They got by early in the season by just outscoring any opponent in their path, but a legitimate defense like UCLA\u2019s proved too much for such a strategy.\n\nIt seems like things are bound to fall apart for Wazzu, and Arizona will come into their second straight road match looking to snap their 0-2 streak of one-possession losses to ranked teams. Freshman quarterback Noah Fifita has started in the Wildcats\u2019 last two games after an injury to junior Jayden de Laura, and has used his opportunity well, completing 52 of 74 passes for 535 yards and eight touchdowns with two interceptions across the two games. If the Wildcats can pull it together in the fourth quarter in Pullman, the big upset they\u2019ve been teasing for weeks may finally come to fruition.\n\nON THE RISE \u2014 No. 14 Louisville (6-0) @ Pittsburgh, 3:30 p.m. PDT on CW Network\n\nLouisville shocked the nation last week with an upset win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame, bouncing the Fighting Irish all the way down to No. 21 and climbing from the bottom of the poll all the way to No. 14. Now everyone\u2019s eyes are on a Louisville team that has quietly been successful all season. Junior runningback Jawhar Jordan leads a respectable rushing attack that is averaging over 190 yards per game. Jordan has posted three 100+ yard, two touchdown games so far this season, including 143 yards and two scores against Notre Dame. Now the Cardinals face a struggling 1-4 Pitt team and should have an easy path to potentially hop a few more spots in the poll this weekend.\n\nSOMETHING TO PROVE \u2014 Missouri (5-1) @ No. 24 Kentucky, 4:30 p.m. PDT on SEC Network\n\nMizzou was mentioned in this column just a few weeks ago under better circumstances, but a loss to No. 22 LSU last weekend bounced them from the AP Poll and now the Tigers need to squeeze their way back in. Kentucky won\u2019t be an easy opponent, however. The Wildcats are also coming off their first loss of the season in a 51-13 beatdown at the hands of No. 1 Georgia. They\u2019ll be angry and ready to defend their home turf. Missouri\u2019s 21st-ranked offense should be enough to best a lackluster Kentucky defense, but you never know how teams will react to the kind of blowout the Wildcats suffered last week \u2014 they could bend and break, but we could also see a totally different team take the field Saturday ready to clean things up and dominate at home against Mizzou. Either way, Mizzou was \u201cfirst out\u201d of this week\u2019s AP Poll, receiving 69 votes despite going unranked. A ranked road victory against Kentucky is just what the Tigers need to climb back into the Top 25.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nOctober 13, 2023 at 1:29 pm PDT\n\nConference realignment is going to end multiple long-standing rivalries and replace them with new ones. But for the time being, the battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh is here to stay. This edition of the rivalry between the No. 10 USC Trojans (6-0, 4-0 Pac-12) and the No. 21 Notre Dame Fighting Irish (5-2) has national implications, which often happens when these two teams square off. This is the 35th time where both teams are ranked heading into the rivalry game in what will be the 94th game of the series.\n\nEven though USC is undefeated, the Trojans are coming in as underdogs according to multiple betting websites. USC is coming off a 43-41 win in triple overtime over the unranked Arizona Wildcats, with the win pushing the Trojans down in the AP poll for the third consecutive week despite winning each game. Since the Trojans are coming off an underwhelming win, many are expecting the Irish to hand USC its first loss of the year, which would be the seventh time the Trojans have lost their first game of the season to a Notre Dame squad.\n\nHowever, the margin is quite slim here with the Irish losing two of their last three games, all against ranked teams. Those two losses \u2014 to Ohio State and Louisville \u2014 provide a blueprint for the Trojans to win the game: keep junior running back Audric Estim\u00e9 under 75 rushing yards. In Notre Dame\u2019s two losses, Estim\u00e9 rushed for 70 yards and 20 yards, respectively. In all Fighting Irish wins, Estim\u00e9 eclipsed 75 yards easily.\n\nThe Trojans used this model effectively in their 38-27 win over Notre Dame last season, holding Estim\u00e9 to only 43 rushing yards. The Fighting Irish quarterback, graduate Sam Hartman, does not pose much of a threat on the ground with only two rushing yards on the season, so if USC wants to stop the run, the defense just has to stop Estim\u00e9.\n\nUSC\u2019s defense this season is 90th in the FBS for run defense as it allows 157 yards per game on the ground. This was highlighted last weekend when Arizona\u2019s running back, sophomore Jonah Coleman, rushed for 143 yards. While stopping Estim\u00e9 \u2014 third in the FBS with 692 rushing yards \u2014 seems like a tall task for this defensive unit, the Trojans proved they have the ability to do it just last year.\n\nIf USC can slow down Estim\u00e9, it still has to deal with a quarterback in Hartman who is tied for third in the FBS with 16 passing touchdowns. However, Hartman\u2019s lack of mobility plays directly into USC\u2019s pass rushing prowess. The Trojan defense is tied for second in the FBS with 22 sacks on the season, although the unit has slowed up the past two weeks.\n\nUSC gave up 41 points in back-to-back games the past two weekends and only had six sacks between those games. But against Arizona State on September 23, USC held the Sun Devils to 28 points and recorded eight sacks. The Notre Dame offensive line, headlined by junior offensive lineman Joe Alt, has only allowed 11 sacks, so this matchup is strength against strength.\n\nBut if the Trojans can get into the backfield and disrupt a relatively non-mobile Hartman, they have a good chance at limiting the Notre Dame offense and putting the game in the hands of junior quarterback Caleb Williams. If the USC defense can at least slow down Estim\u00e9 and disrupt Hartman\u2019s rhythm enough, then Williams just has to play like his normal self for the Trojans to win.\n\nWilliams and the offense did not play like themselves at the start of the game last weekend, though, as USC fell into an early 17-0 hole, which it then had to crawl out of to win the game. In South Bend, Williams and the offense need to have a fast start to keep the crowd out of the game as much as possible.\n\nThe Trojans have struggled against rambunctious crowds thus far, with both of their away games reported as sellouts, and will need to make sure it keeps the crowd a non-factor in this one. The Trojans have all the pieces to beat a Fighting Irish team with two losses, one of which came at home, which is why USC is ranked higher than Notre Dame.\n\nBut USC is coming in as a betting underdog because of its struggles in road games so far and unimpressive wins each of the last two weeks.

What\u2019s next? What I have learned from volunteering at the 2023 Four Continents Championships.\n\nBy Valerie Fang October 13, 2023 at 12:14 pm PDT\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. Happy Friday the 13th! I hope everyone did awesome in their midterms and is enjoying the Fall Break. Skate America will be kicking off the much anticipated Grand Prix series next weekend in Allen, Texas. Before the season gets in full gear (once the Grand Prix starts, we will have major competitions taking place almost every weekend), I thought I could write another fun piece to chat about something this column has not yet covered \u2014 volunteering. This article will use my personal experience at the 2023 Four Continents Championships (4CC) to discuss how to find volunteer opportunities at figure skating competitions, what to expect during your shifts and some hopefully helpful notes.\n\nWhere to locate volunteer opportunities\nBefore every season starts, the International Skating Union (ISU), which governs figure skating, synchronized skating, speed skating and short track speed skating, announces the host cities for each of its competitions. The host cities are responsible for organizing the assigned events, including recruiting all the local volunteers. So, the first step would be to check out the season schedule online and find out which competitions are being hosted by U.S. Figure Skating, the national governing body for this sport. You are welcome to look for opportunities in other countries as well! For example, I\u2019m on the look out for volunteer postings from Shanghai, because the city is hosting this season\u2019s 4CC. It is also especially fun to volunteer in countries where figure skating is one of the more popular sports \u2014 namely Japan, which hosts the annual NHK Trophy.\n\nBack to the United States. The next step would be to create an account in U.S. Figure Skating Event Management System (EMS). While the ISU makes the final call on assignments, it is tradition for the U.S. to host at least one competition, Skate America, which is usually the first Grand Prix stop. Once you are in the system, you should be able to see all the competitions that are available to volunteer at. You can start the application process by clicking on the ones that interest you, and the rest is self explanatory. The application will ask for your previous volunteer experience and then require you to fill out some standard paperwork, such as Assumption of Risk, Consent to Emergency Care and Media Release.\n\nWhat to expect before and during my shifts\nOnce your volunteer request has been approved, U.S. Figure Skating will send out an email specifying the window for shift selection. In the case of the 2023 4CC, the window opened roughly one month prior to the competition. During the selection process, I was able to see the types, hours and required skills of all the shifts. This really helped me figure out my travel itinerary in advance, as I had to fly from Los Angeles to Colorado Springs for the event. You can also expect to receive invites to an online EMS introduction and a Know Before You Go webinar. The former trains the volunteers on selecting shifts in the system, while the latter gives a rundown of what will happen during the Championships. The federation usually also sends out a volunteer handbook for our information.\n\nDepending on the shifts selected, you could be contacted by the volunteer coordinators (from either the ISU or U.S. Figure Skating) before the competition about what to expect during your shifts. For instance, I received a briefing from the media team detailing the goals, general workflow, day-of procedures, some team documents and how to navigate the Mixed Zone. Once the Championships started, I received daily email reminders of my next-day shift schedule from U.S. Figure Skating. Those emails do matter and you should read them promptly, as they have to modify the competition schedule sometimes and switch our shifts around.\n\nSome useful (I hope) notes!\nFear not if you haven\u2019t volunteered at a figure skating event before! Some of my shifts involved working as the ice monitor for both practice and competition sessions. I had zero experience with it and was pretty nervous going into my first shift. But the staff at the venue was there to help go over things and support all of us. With this being said, it is still important to stay attentive and be proactive. Like all sporting events, things happen quickly and sometimes unexpectedly at figure skating competitions, which makes it a great opportunity to train someone in adapting to changing circumstances, thinking fast and seizing the moment.\n\nAnother tip on how to find the shifts at your preferred events. Note that the events I\u2019m referring to here are competitions within individual disciplines such as Men\u2019s Short Programs and Women\u2019s Free Skate. While selecting shifts, I pulled up the event schedule side by side with the selection window so that I could find those shifts that matched the starting time of my favorite events. It took some strategizing but, hey, I ended up attending all my favorite events right next to the hockey boards.\n\nIt also goes without saying that it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity to make friends (and maybe even professional connections depending on your career goals). Everyone is there because they are passionate about this sport, making it easier for you to find kindred spirits. And who knows, if you volunteer often enough, the skaters could recognize you, too! For me, so many memories at the 2023 4CC are worth treasuring forever. I was so close to the rink. I could feel the icy breeze on my cheeks, reminding me of how blood rushed into them because I was just so thrilled. I will never forget how wonderstruck I felt when I turned around and found out that six top skaters in the world were lining up behind me, ready to take the ice. When I noticed that the legendary coach, Tracy Wilson, was standing next to me during one practice session, I told her I was very excited and honored to be there. And she said: \u201cYeah! You really get to be a part of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Dylan Luden\nOctober 12, 2023 at 9:27 pm PDT\n\nAhead of one of the most anticipated matchups on USC football\u2019s schedule, the team has been striving towards fixing the imperfections that\u2019s plagued them after last Saturday\u2019s 43-41 nutty triple-overtime victory over Arizona. USC and Notre Dame may have to lean on their rushing offenses more than usual during Saturday\u2019s game, with the forecast calling for rain throughout the day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been wetting the balls and practicing with them to do what we need to do in order to go out there and make the game a lot easier,\u201d redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd said. Besides wetting the balls and making them more slippery, USC Athletics staffers were seen spraying punt returners with a hose in catching drills during the open part of practice in the hopes of preparing the returners for possible in-game scenarios.\n\nBoth teams can run the ball well, and the rain should increase their rushing numbers. However, Notre Dame struggled rushing in its upsetting loss last Saturday to Louisville, as it tallied just 44 yards on the ground. USC\u2019s rushing offense struggled in the first half, but a combination of Lloyd and junior quarterback Caleb Williams salvaged the rushing attack for the day. The team tallied 146 yards on the ground and scored five of their six touchdowns on rushes.\n\nThe Trojans will look to their running game to help push them over the edge on Saturday. \u201cThere were definitely some key plays specifically in the run game that we came through on,\u201d redshirt senior offensive lineman Justin Dedich said. \u201cWe were a little more physical on two touchdown plays that we ran up the middle. It\u2019s something we practiced all week, and it got me fired up.\u201d\n\nEven though the weather forecast suggests the run will be a big factor, USC won\u2019t shy away from passing the ball all game. Against Arizona, the pass protection for Williams fell flat at times, as he was sacked four times. USC has been prepping for Notre Dame\u2019s defense all week, as it\u2019s one of the best units in the country. The Fighting Irish defense ranks third in the nation in passing yards allowed per game.\n\n\u201cBecause those [linebackers] are so good, they like to blitz them, so we\u2019ve got to be ready to pick up those blitzes,\u201d offensive line coach Josh Henson said. \u201cThey\u2019re big and strong inside and use their hands very well on the interior, and be ready for their interior pass rush.\u201d Henson also mentioned that he still hasn\u2019t decided who will start at right tackle on Saturday. USC will use its last practice of the week on Thursday to determine who makes the start at the position between redshirt senior Michael Tarquin and redshirt sophomore Mason Murphy.\n\nUSC will look for its first win at South Bend since 2011 during the 94th matchup between the two schools, with kickoff on Saturday scheduled for 4:30 p.m.\n```"}

She shared the show announcement just a day before, giving fans a one-hour notice to buy tickets for the concert before sales opened. Rodrigo\u2019s show came in partnership with American Express. It served as the opener to \u201cAmex Member Week,\u201d a week-long celebration for Amex credit cardholders featuring similar special events and ticket offers from Oct. 9 until Oct. 13. Tickets to Rodrigo\u2019s L.A. show were all priced at $25 exclusively for Amex cardholders. All proceeds were donated to \u201cFund 4 Good,\u201d Rodrigo\u2019s newly launched non-profit that aims to support women-centered causes like reproductive healthcare.\n\nFans who were lucky enough to snag tickets noted their relief in getting a chance to see Rodrigo perform ahead of her arena world tour scheduled for next year, which was notoriously subjected to dynamic pricing because of the high demand. \u201cThe experience of buying tickets for the tour was stressful. My plan was to go to as many shows as possible and travel; I was even going to go to her Europe shows, but plans changed when I saw the prices,\u201d attendee Valeria Perez said.\n\nFans like Perez were shocked to see the surprise show\u2019s comparably inexpensive cost, but were quick to accept their good luck, especially given that Rodrigo shared intimate stories in between her hits at Monday\u2019s performance. Though now residing in New York City, 20-year-old Rodrigo attributes her artist roots to growing up in Los Angeles. The SoCal native\u2019s return could not have been a more ideal homecoming, having also performed at The GRAMMY Museum just a week before.\n\nMonday\u2019s show was held at The Theatre at Ace Hotel in Downtown L.A. Reopened in 2014, the venue was reflective of other renovated historical movie theaters along the South Broadway strip, compared to the arenas she will take on in 2024, like The Kia Forum. Rodrigo's concert was the kickoff event to Amex member week.\n\nThe singer-songwriter said Los Angeles still remains a constant in her current songwriting process and noted that she even took classes at USC last year. Rodrigo shared on stage, \u201cI took a poetry class and one of the poems I wrote for the assignment was this poem that I loved a lot called \u2018Lacy,\u2019\u201d before performing the eponymous fan-favorite. The setlist consisted of other acoustic renditions from her newly-released sophomore album \u201cGUTS,\u201d with many of the songs having their live debuts that night. Rodrigo performed seven of the 12 songs on the album with long-time producer and collaborator Dan Nigro.\n\nRodrigo\u2019s vocals powered through the theater\u2019s ornate halls and the crowd quickly noticed her strong, now mature tone as she opened with her single \u201cVampire.\u201d From depicting a toxic relationship in \u201cThe Grudge\u201d to tackling the reality of entering her 20s in \u201cTeenage Dream,\u201d Rodrigo gave attendees a sneak peak to her highly-anticipated tour. She concluded the night with \u201cTraitor\u201d from her debut album \u201cSOUR,\u201d a final homage to her roots, ending the concert on a rather sweet note.\n\nThe experience didn\u2019t stop with the one-night-only performance, which can now be streamed on YouTube. Rodrigo\u2019s team and American Express pulled all the stops to create an interactive and memorable night for everyone in attendance, as attested by fans like Arely Macedo, who shared, \u201cThe freebies were so thoughtful and it was just the most perfect evening.\u201d The venue featured photo booths and backdrops inspired by Rodrigo\u2019s music videos. Attendees were gifted with a variety of treats including matcha drinks, pins, lipstick samples and glass cups. An \u201cOlivia\u2019s Tacos\u201d stand was set up next door to the theater with a menu of classic L.A. tacos, all complimentary for attendees.\n\nDuring the concert, Rodrigo and Nigro shared tidbits about the making of \u201cGUTS,\u201d which they both agreed involved quite a bit of \u201ctoiling.\u201d Both were eager to let the new project grow outside the shadow of its wildly-successful older sister, \u201cSOUR.\u201d While Rodrigo is known for her poignant bedroom ballads, half of \u201cGUTS\u201d leans more on the rock spectrum, of which \u201cSOUR\u201d had only dabbled in. Nigro said he is thrilled that fans will be able to see \u201cthe more sarcastic side of Olivia,\u201d further encouraged when he asked the audience to stand for all of her upbeat songs like \u201cGet Him Back!\u201d Rodrigo admitted on stage that her pop-punk ditty \u201cAll-American Bitch\u201d is the number she\u2019s most excited to play on tour. Her performance of the song that night included a heartfelt banshee wail, which attendees were quick to join in the screams. The theater that once was a movie palace for silent films in the 1920s now inhabited the joyful bellows of the young audience. The collective release was proof enough that the world was ready for Rodrigo\u2019s edgier era. Rodrigo and Nigro chitchat in-between songs about the process of writing \"GUTS.\"\n```"}

(Photo by Eric Lambkins II)\n\nBy Adam Bradford\nOctober 12, 2023 at 6:54 pm PDT\n\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 On Sunday afternoon, the Los Angeles Rams fell to the Philadelphia Eagles at SoFi Stadium by a final score of 23-14. The Rams did get the good news before kickoff that star receiver Cooper Kupp would return from the hamstring injury that kept him out for the first four weeks of the season. Kupp suffered the injury last November, and had not played since.\n\nKupp picked up right where he left off in his season debut, catching eight passes for 118 yards. Rookie Puka Nacua, who stepped up as Los Angeles\u2019s leading receiver during Krupp\u2019s absence, added seven receptions for 71 yards and a touchdown. Together, they should form one of the league\u2019s most formidable receiving duos.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford completed 21 of his 37 pass attempts for two touchdowns and no interceptions. While it was Stafford\u2019s first game of the season with multiple touchdown passes, it was actually a season-low for him in terms of both passing yards and touchdowns. However, it was not enough to overcome the defending NFC champion Eagles and their high-powered offense.\n\nQuarterback Jalen Hurts completed 25 of 38 passes for 303 yards, a touchdown and an interception, while also adding 72 yards and another touchdown on the ground. It was a season-high in total yardage for the MVP candidate.\n\nThe Rams were actually able to contain star Philadelphia receiver Devonta Smith, holding him to just one catch for six yards. However, Pro Bowler A.J. Brown, the other half of the Eagles\u2019 elite wide receiver duo, torched Los Angeles\u2019s secondary with six receptions for 127 yards. Tight end Dallas Goedert also added eight catches for 117 yards and a touchdown.\n\nWith the win, Philadelphia improved to 5-0. They are one of two undefeated teams remaining in the NFL. The Rams, on the other hand, fell to 2-3. The Eagles visit the New York Jets this Sunday afternoon, while Los Angeles hosts the Arizona Cardinals.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Mark Lenniha).\n\nBy Alexandra Donovan October 12, 2023 at 3:19 pm PDT\n\nAre Skittles now banned in the state of California? Not quite. On Saturday California Gov. Gavin Newsom approved Assembly Bill (ab) 418, which has been falsely dubbed the \u201cSkittles Ban.\u201d This law, the California Food Safety Act, will ban four commonly used food additives, but this will not include the coloring used in Skittles. Newsom addressed the Skittles concern stating that, \u201cthis particular bag of candy comes from the European Union \u2014 a place that already bans a number of chemical additives and colorants. This is demonstrable proof that the food industry is capable of maintaining product lines while complying with different public health laws, country-to-country.\u201d\n\nAlthough Skittles are safe, according to the Environmental Working Group, the additives addressed in this bill are used in roughly 12,000 other food products such as cereals, sodas and candies that are sold across the United States. This includes Entenmann\u2019s Little Bites, Peeps, Candy Corn, Little Debbie\u2019s Cosmic Brownies and more beloved junk food items. California just became the first state in the nation to ban these additives, prohibiting their manufacturing, sale or distribution in the use of food for human consumption. These additives include brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye 3.\n\nAlthough they continue to be used by Food and Beverage companies, these additives have never been approved for consumption by the Food and Drug Administration, and consumer advocates state that it would take 30 to 50 years for them to even be reviewed. The National Confectioners Association, who would be hit the hardest by this bill, claims that it \u201creplaces a uniform national food safety system with a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements created by legislative fiat that will increase food costs.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, the FDA banned the use of Red Dye 3 in cosmetics based on animal research that suggested a link to thyroid cancer. However, the FDA continues to allow it to be used in food, drugs and dietary supplements. Brominated vegetable oil has been found to harm skin membranes and can even cause memory loss with overconsumption. Some studies have suggested propylparaben can affect fertility, and more specifically, decrease sperm count in rats. Potassium Bromate has been shown to cause kidney, thyroid, and gastrointestinal cancer in animals.\n\nThe European Union has already banned the use of these chemicals because of this scientific research on their effect on cancer, fertility and developmental problems in children. Additionally, many brands such as Coke, Pepsi, Gatorade and Panera have already stopped using the additives because of concerns about their effect on human health. This law is a huge step in working towards protecting Californians from toxic chemicals in our food supply. It will also have a tremendous impact on the country as a whole. California\u2019s large economy will force manufacturers to produce one additive-free version of their products, rather than going through the trouble of creating two products\u2014one for California and one for the rest of the country.\n\nThe state of New York is also working on a similar bill that would include the ban of titanium dioxide, which is used to enhance the white color of foods, in addition to these four additives. The CA law will take effect in 2027, providing companies with enough time to change their formulations before being fined up to $10,000 for their use.\n```"}

Members of USC men\u2019s basketball gathered with other teams from across the conference to preview the upcoming season, the Trojans\u2019 last in the Pac-12. Head coach Andy Enfield traveled to Vegas with fifth-year senior guard Boogie Ellis and junior guard Kobe Johnson. Ellis was named first-team Preseason All-Pac-12 on Tuesday, while Johnson was a second-team selection. They are co-captains of the team and pillars of USC\u2019s system in the upcoming season: Ellis made the Pac-12 All-Conference first team last year, while Johnson was named to the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team.\n\n\u201cBoogie is a natural scorer, but he\u2019s come a long way in his decision-making,\u201d Enfield said on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s a really tremendous lead guard right now.\u201d Ellis led the Trojans with 17.7 points per game during the 2022-2023 season and tied for the league lead in 3-pointers made with 83. Enfield also had high praise for Johnson, calling him \u201cthe best defensive player in our league and possibly the United States.\u201d Johnson had 72 steals last season, second in the Pac-12 and tied for 17th in the nation. \u201cNo doubt,\u201d Johnson confirmed. \u201cI come out every game and guard the best player, so I see myself as the best defender.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Ellis and Johnson\u2019s awards, freshman guard Isaiah Collier also received preseason Pac-12 first-team honors. Collier was the consensus No. 1 recruit in the nation this year. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my close friends,\u201d Ellis said of Collier. \u201cOn and off the court we have a great relationship, and he makes the guys around him better.\u201d Collier is not Enfield\u2019s only exciting new recruit: forward Brandon Gardner, guard Bronny James and forward Arrinten Page fill out the remainder of USC\u2019s freshman class. Graduate forward DJ Rodman also signed on with the Trojans in May after four years at Washington State.\n\nThe team was shaken up in July when James suffered a cardiac event at a team practice. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well. I think at the appropriate time the James family will give further updates,\u201d Enfield said about Bronny. \u201cUnder any medical condition, we respect the privacy of the young man. But I think everybody is very supportive and hoping he gets back quickly.\u201d\n\nUSC recently announced its full schedule for the upcoming season. Notably, the Trojans will host their home opener vs. CSU Bakersfield on Nov. 9. The team kicks off Pac-12 play with a matchup at Oregon on Dec. 28. The Crosstown Rivalry against UCLA will take place on Jan. 27 at the Galen Center and down the road at Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 24. USC also plays some other exciting non-conference matchups coming soon, taking on Gonzaga on Dec. 2 and then traveling to Auburn for a game on Dec. 17.\n\nIn a vote among Pac-12 media officials, Arizona was selected as the favorite to win the Pac-12 title this season, while USC was picked to come in second. The polls correctly predicted last year\u2019s champion and have correctly chosen the Pac-12 champion 18 out of 34 times. USC will play at Arizona on Jan. 17 and host the Wildcats on March 9 for the final game of the regular season. USC tied for second in the Pac-12 last year with a 14-6 conference record (22-11 overall) and will look to build on the momentum of a third straight NCAA tournament appearance. The Trojans open the season on Nov 6 against Kansas State at the 2023 Hall of Fame Series in Las Vegas.\n```"}

Last week, New England suffered the worst loss under their infamous head coach when the Cowboys annihilated them in a 38-3 victory at Jerry\u2019s World. This past week, they incurred their worst home loss under Belichick, being shut out in a 34-0 route courtesy of the Saints.\n\nThe real problem in New England could be their stadium renovations. Since they constructed their new hilariously wide jumbotron and oddly tall lighthouse, they\u2019ve earned an 0-3 season at Gillette. In all seriousness, it\u2019s just jarring to see a Patriots team not only this bad, but also this dysfunctional.\n\nOne thing that will never change though is the cycle of the Cowboys. The preseason Super Bowl hopefuls once again showed out in their first few games, demolishing lackluster competition and everyone overreacted, coining them as true championship contenders. Then the rubber met the road Sunday night and the 49ers showed them what a real Super Bowl caliber team looks like embarrassing them in a 42-10 victory in primetime.\n\nEnough of regular NFL football, we\u2019re here for fantasy glory and there\u2019s plenty to unpack from Week Five.\n\nIs King Henry\u2019s Reign Over?\n\nSince being drafted in the NFL, the Titans\u2019 Derrick Henry has defied the expectations of elite running backs, playing at a seemingly inhuman level. Not only is he incredibly talented, but he\u2019s also built like a monster truck at 6\u20323\u2032\u2032 and 247 lbs. He makes use of his towering frame, not shying away from contact and often delivering hits rather than taking them. Since he was drafted in 2016, Ezekiel Elliot is the only player with more carries than Henry and no one has rushed for more yards over that span. He is the epitome of a workhouse back, making fans wonder over the last couple years when his decline will inevitably come. When will all the hits he has taken start to show their toll?\n\nSadly, we could be witnessing the beginning of this superstar\u2019s fall. He has only surpassed 100 rushing yards in one game, an oddity for him. He is usually on the field constantly, but lately rookie ball carrier Tyjae Spears has been lurking. The first year back only took 6% and 10% fewer snaps than Henry in the last two weeks. Spears\u2019 rushing attempts are not eye-popping, as Henry will still take the bulk of the carries, but he\u2019s on the field and active in the passing game (which Henry is not), seeing at least four targets in four of five games this season. It\u2019s also not unrealistic to think that Henry\u2019s physical playstyle could catch up to him and leave him injured, in which case Spears would assume the lead role. He\u2019s not a flashy guy, but he\u2019s a steady hand who should give you solid numbers every week and has the potential to boom later on this season. He\u2019s also widely available, only rostered in 25.6% of ESPN leagues prior to waiver claims going through. If you have some room on your bench and want some depth, he\u2019s well worth a stash.\n\nLogan Leading the Pack\n\nLogan Thomas is still playing? Not only is the fourth round tight end from 2014 still suiting up for the Commanders, but he\u2019s doing so at an extremely high level. He\u2019s actually vying for the No. 1 passing option in a pretty talented Washington receiving room that includes the likes of Terry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson. He is fourth in the team in total targets, but leading his squad in targets per game with 6.25 (having missed one game this year due to injury). Quarterback Sam Howell seems to be fond of him as well, helping Thomas explode for a monstrous game this past Thursday. He snagged nine of 11 targets and took them for 77 yards and touchdown, 20.7 PPR points. He\u2019s fifth, yes FIFTH, in PPR points per game among TEs with 11.6. That\u2019s more than guys like George Kittle, Dallas Goedert and Darren Waller. Washington is a frisky team and their offense is better-than-expected, middle of the pack in points per game. The fact that Thomas is only rostered in 8.1% of ESPN leagues at the time of writing is a straight up fantasy sin. If your tight end is anything less than elite, you should be claiming Thomas before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

Sometimes life (and midterm season) gets in the way, but to make up for it, I wrote an extra section this week.\n\nSavannah McCaskill to the rescue (again)\n\nYou can\u2019t accuse Angel City of lacking grit. After last week\u2019s 1-0 loss to the Orlando Pride at home, it seemed like Angel City\u2019s second NWSL season would end the same way as the first: missing the playoffs by a small margin. Despite ACFC dominating the Pride in possession and chances to score, soccer can be a cruel game, and a few unlucky bobbles undid the black and pink.\n\nAll good things come to an end, as they say. That result was Becki Tweed\u2019s first loss as Angel City\u2019s head coach, adding an even more bitter note to the already sour brew of a late-season defeat. But it\u2019s a testament to the mentality Tweed instilled in her players that after three periods of losing football, the team rescued its season with a second-half rally on the road.\n\nBefore we assess ACFC\u2019s winning performance against the Houston Dash, I want to share some postgame quotes from defender Paige Nielsen after the Orlando loss. It struck me as noteworthy in the moment and even more so in light of this weekend\u2019s win.\n\n\u201cI like to think of the positives,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cI feel so much joy playing with the group of players out there ... we\u2019re getting way better and I think it\u2019s just taking it game by game and not looking at the table anymore and just growing for the future.\u201d\n\nNielsen didn\u2019t stop there. With a later question, she shared an anecdote about an interaction she had with Tweed after the match.\n\n\u201cI just gave her a hug right before I came in here and said I was so blessed and excited to be playing under her,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cShe\u2019s made it super competitive, has uplifted us but also motivated us, sets the right tone at training and it has carried us to success.\u201d\n\nThe combination of Nielsen\u2019s quote and Sunday\u2019s result proves that Tweed deserves to keep her job beyond the 2023 season, regardless of ACFC\u2019s playoff status. Players don\u2019t typically make unsolicited glowing statements about their team and their coach when they\u2019re staring down a pair of do-or-die games. Not only did Nielsen offer rapturous support \u2014 her words proved completely correct just six days later.\n\nIn their 2-1 win over the Houston Dash, Angel City found themselves down 1-0 at halftime against fellow playoff contenders in the Dash, who entered the game only one point ahead of ACFC. Houston\u2019s goal came from midfielder Andressa Alves, whose left-footed shot went between forward Jun Endo\u2019s legs and past rookie goalkeeper Angelina Anderson at the near post.\n\nBut all hope was not lost. Angel City just needed a spark. And Alyssa Thompson provided it. The former No. 1 overall draft pick entered the game in the 65th minute and scored just three minutes later from an impressive piece of Angel City build-up.\n\nCenterback Sarah Gorden, ever comfortable with the ball at her feet, evaded pressure with a dribble take-on and played the ball forward all the way to the feet of striker Sydney Leroux. Leroux tapped the ball first-time to the attacking midfielder McCaskill, who took a touch and played a through ball to give Thompson a one-on-one with the Dash\u2019s goalkeeper.\n\nA one-on-one with the goalkeeper looks deceptively easy. With the game on the line and a crazed goalkeeper running out to cut off the shooting angles, Thompson could easily have missed wide or into the keeper\u2019s grasp. She dispatched it with ease.\n\nThompson slotted the ball into the bottom left corner and gave Angel City a chance. The Dash kept the pressure on Angel City for the whole match, totalling 27 shots in 90 minutes. But cult hero McCaskill wasn\u2019t going to let Angel City\u2019s season die in H-town.\n\nIn the 91st minute, Thompson chased down a long ball forward and laid it off to Katlyn Johnson, also a substitute. Johnson then saw McCaskill point forward, signaling her run into the box. The Dash defenders had their backs turned, focused on Johnson with the ball, completely oblivious to McCaskill\u2019s move.\n\nJohnson slid the ball across the box and put it in the perfect spot for McCaskill to strike it first-time, handing Angel City the win.\n\nJust like she\u2019s done before for Angel City, McCaskill saved one of her best performances for when her club really needed it. Now, Angel City sits in eighth place, one point from the sixth-place playoff berth. The team probably has to beat the first-place Portland Thorns on the final matchday to qualify.\n\nConsidering the Thorns can lock up the NWSL shield, given to the best regular season team, with a win, Angel City won\u2019t be facing a heavily-rotated Thorns team. It\u2019s not an enviable position. But at least Angel City has a chance. I recommend you tune in for Decision Day this weekend. Who knows, maybe McCaskill has more theatrics left in her.\n\nWill the real LAFC please stand up?\n\nLooking at Los Angeles Football Club\u2019s results since August 1, it\u2019s near impossible to decipher whether Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde will emerge in the playoffs. For a little while, it seemed like the result of September\u2019s El Tr\u00e1fico was more a fluke than a reflection of LAFC\u2019s quality.\n\nThe attackers played like fireworks on the Fourth of July in that match, but seemed unable to score against any other opponent. In four consecutive matches after the rivalry showdown, LAFC failed to score, enduring two draws, one defeat and a loss on penalties in the Campeones Cup.\n\nAfter that stretch, LAFC had a record of 4-6-2 (counting the Tigres match as a loss) since early August. For a team associated with glitz, goals and winning, it suddenly felt bleak. Right back Ryan Hollingshead was complaining about the refereeing and head coach Steve Cherundolo was criticizing the MLS\u2019 roster rules for his team\u2019s sluggish results.\n\nA whining LAFC was an unusual sight. But left winger Denis Boaunga decided his team wouldn\u2019t enter the playoffs meekly. With five goals and an assist in the club\u2019s two previous matches, the Gabonese winger has almost single-handedly raised the spirits of his teammates and fans alike.\n\nLAFC beat playoff-candidates Minnesota United 5-1 and followed that with a 4-2 road victory versus Austin FC. However, I urge LAFC fans to be cautious. We\u2019re witnessing the double-edged sword of having Bouanga as the team\u2019s best player.\n\nBouanga, for as well as he\u2019s played in 2023, hasn\u2019t proved he can be a particularly efficient goalscorer. Bouanga has taken 129 shots total this season to score 19 goals, an average of about 6.8 shots per goal. That\u2019s a lot of shots required to score just once!\n\nMore importantly, Bouanaga is the only player at LAFC who shoots with volume. The MVP candidate takes 4.8 shots per 90 minutes, while midfielder Mateusz Bogusz has the second most shots on the season with 57 total and about 3.1 per 90. Even worse, Carlos Vela, who\u2019s had a 34-goal season in the MLS, takes just 2.45 shots per 90 in 2023.\n\nSure, Vela may not have the goalscoring juice now that he possessed during his first few MLS seasons, but his new tactical role has almost completely eliminated goalscoring as an attribute in his game. With Cristian \u201cChicho\u201d Arango\u2019s departure over the winter (first to Pachuca in Mexico, then to LAFC competitor Real Salt Lake), Vela has shifted roles, playing up front more often.\n\nBut Vela interprets the number nine role differently than Arango, who scored 16 goals in LAFC\u2019s title-winning 2022 season. As a striker, Vela frequently drops deep to receive the ball, turn and lay it off to other attackers. He doesn\u2019t have the same speed he used to, so it does it make sense to use him as a hub to control the ball rather than make him run onto passes like he did previously.\n\nBut that new role, and LAFC\u2019s lack of a go-to right winger, has forced the entire attacking burden on Bouanga. So when Bouanga scores, LAFC tends to win. And when he doesn\u2019t score, LAFC struggles for goals. It\u2019s a perilous position to occupy ahead of the playoffs.\n\nCherundolo and his coaching staff just have to hope Bouanga can handle the postseason pressure.\n\nThe Galaxy weren\u2019t good, but they were really fun\n\nThe LA Galaxy have officially been eliminated from the 2023 MLS Cup playoffs. And while I\u2019ve openly admitted that I have a slight LAFC bias, I am legitimately disappointed that the Galaxy won\u2019t participate in this year\u2019s postseason.\n\nWhen the Galaxy played, the team always had the capacity to surprise. Out of the MLS\u2019 four worst teams in the Supporters Shield standings, the Galaxy never seemed as hopeless as the Colorado Rapids, Toronto FC or the pre-Messi Inter Miami (even La Pulga At\u00f3mica couldn\u2019t save that squad\u2019s MLS season).\n\nEven without a reliable striker, the Galaxy had enough top-of-the-line skill to stay interesting at the very least and legitimately compelling at best. If Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hernandez had stayed healthy and the front office had crafted a competent defense, Riqui Puig might have put forth an MVP-worthy campaign.\n\nHe had 11 goal contributions from a deep-lying midfield position while surrounded by chaos. I\u2019ve already marked him down as a dark horse for the award in 2024, pending his club\u2019s offseason moves.\n\nBut the Galaxy always had a good result in them, none more notable than the 2-1 win over LAFC at the Rose Bowl. That El Tr\u00e1fico showdown saw the highest single-match attendance of any game in MLS history and the Galaxy won it \u2014 something fans will always remember the 2023 season by.\n\nMost of the bottom table teams are both bad and boring. The Galaxy were certainly bad, but they never bored me. Long live the chaotic LA Galaxy.\n\nUSL Championship Update: San Diego Loyal to shut down, why the U.S. needs pro/rel and who\u2019s Milan Iloski?\n\nThe MLS rather famously doesn\u2019t have promotion and relegation, but that doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. has no second-division league. It\u2019s called the United Soccer League (USL) Championship.\n\nYou may not have heard about it, but Southern California has two quality teams: Orange County Soccer Club and the San Diego Loyal. U.S. Men\u2019s National Team legend Landon Donovan actually co-founded the Loyal and serves as their executive vice president of soccer operations, having coached the team for its first three seasons.\n\nUnfortunately, the Loyal announced that the club will cease operations when the 30th MLS team, San Diego FC (the club\u2019s working title), debuts in the 2025 season.\n\nOrange County, closer to our primary city of interest, sits third in the Western Conference, having announced that their star striker, Escondido native Milan Iloski, will sign with Danish club FC Nordsj\u00e6lland when the January transfer window opens.\n\nYou might think I\u2019m getting deep in the weeds to discuss that transfer, but it\u2019s a sneaky-important deal for Iloski and U.S. second-tier soccer. The Danish Superliga may not be the Premier League, but Nordsj\u00e6lland have proven to be one of Denmark\u2019s best clubs in recent seasons and have duly qualified for the Europa Conference League as a result.\n\nNordsj\u00e6lland came second in the 2022-23 Danish Superliga championship round, having led the league at the halfway point. That second part is notable, because the Danish league divides into two mini-leagues before the final ten matches, leaving the top six clubs to only play each other.\n\nIloski\u2019s transfer to a quality European team proves why U.S. soccer\u2019s lack of promotion and relegation makes it harder to develop and identify late-blooming players. While a player in England \u2014 Jamie Vardy, for example \u2014 can rise through the ranks of a fluid football pyramid, the gap between the USL Championship and MLS seems too large for MLS clubs to risk a transfer on an Iloski-type player.\n\nBut if Iloski can play for Nordsj\u00e6lland, he definitely could have filled a role for an MLS club. The former UCLA star has 15 goals and four assists this season and 41 goals in 67 total games in Orange County, showing his output is not fluky.\n\nHe already had a cup of coffee in the MLS for Real Salt Lake, but if he returned now he would stick. You can\u2019t tell me the Colorado Rapids have a better striker than Iloski.\n\nI find this especially relevant in light of Cherundolo\u2019s recent criticism of MLS roster rules. Iloski would command a reasonable wage in the MLS, making it difficult for certain clubs to fit him into their rosters. But if the league loosened its rules, perhaps Iloski could\u2019ve stayed in the U.S. and been a backup striker for an MLS contender.\n\nThe Galaxy could have used him all season, for that matter. The MLS has to realize that the European leagues do a better job of helping domestic late-bloomers grow and find a system of roster rules or club partnerships to capture more of the talent pool.\n\nI support pro/rel in the U.S., but I unfortunately doubt MLS will ever adopt that system. Regardless, USMNT fans should keep an eye on Iloski. His progress in Europe could tell us a lot about the future of the USL Championship and player development in this country.\n\nNext games:\nLAFC: Saturday, October 21 vs. Vancouver Whitecaps (away)\nAngel City: Sunday, October 15 vs. Portland Thorns (home)\nLA Galaxy: Saturday, October 14 vs. Real Salt Lake (home)\nPlus:\nOrange County SC: Saturday, October 14 vs. Monterey Bay F.C.

In California, that will all come to an end soon as Governor Gavin Newsom has just signed a bill known as the California Food Safety Act banning the toxic dye along with three other additives from food and drug products.\n\nWe spoke with Aydin Nazmi, a Professor of Food Science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, he offered further insights on the impacts that Red Dye 3 along with the other banned additives have on our health as Americans.\n\nAydin Nazmi: Exposures can have lifelong effects, So really bring these key developmental phases, you know, the first periods of growth, adolescence, puberty, keep toxins at a minimum, especially through the food supply. Red dye number three, due to pressure from advocacy groups, consumer groups, a lot of companies have already started removing it.\n\nBack in the 90\u2032s researchers found that prolonged and repeated exposure to Red Dye 3 caused thyroid cancer in lab-tested animals. After this discovery, the pigment was banned from beauty and cosmetic products across the U.S., but it\u2019s remained a staple in Americans Diets for the past thirty years.\n\nJensen Jose: For nuances in the law, it was harder for them to make to make changes to their food regs than the cosmetic regs, because the cosmetic regs were provisional, provisionally reviewed or provisionally approved where the color additive regs were not provisional at the time I believe.\n\nJensen Jose, serves as Regulatory Counsel with the non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington D.C. Jose: it\u2019s good that we have that California decided to just go ahead and not wait for FDA to what you know, it\u2019s been like 30 years is enough time more than enough time.\n\nCompanies manufacturing and distributing food within California have until January 2027 to comply with the new regulations.\n```"}

What appears to be an inconspicuous transparent bin serves a small yet powerful purpose in reducing waste and promoting sustainability. The initiative exists as part of a nationwide effort of costume swaps to curb fashion wastage. At the hub, students are invited to drop off their gently used costumes, clothes and accessories and peruse available items. However, visitors may still collect costumes without bringing their own. The event will run daily from Tuesday, Oct. 10, through Monday, Oct. 23, from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. After this window, all unclaimed items will be donated.\n\nOctober is a month rife for fashion wastage. An October 2019 study of Halloween costumes by Hubbub and the Fairyland Trust found that, at the 19 major UK retail outlets surveyed, plastic makes up 83% of the materials needed to make Halloween costumes. In the US, total Halloween spending is expected to reach a record $12.2 billion, exceeding last year\u2019s record of $10.6 billion, according to a National Retail Federation survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics last month. The NRF survey found that more than two-thirds of those celebrating Halloween plan to buy costumes \u2013 the highest in the survey\u2019s history. The NRF projects that overall costume spending will rise to a record $4.1 billion in 2022 from $3.6 billion. This year, a record 73% of people \u2014 up from 69% in 2022 \u2014 will take part in Halloween-related festivities.\n\nIn-store Halloween decor options and fast fashion websites can tempt shoppers looking to celebrate conveniently, and on a low budget, said students. Elisa Xia, a senior majoring in communications and the Sustainability Hub Programming and Events Intern on the President\u2019s Sustainability Internship Program, believes in using what you already have. \u201cA lot of people could find bits and pieces of items that could form an outfit that they like. That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m doing this semester where I am planning to be a pirate,\u201d said Xia. \u201cTake some kind of red skirt and a white top and then just form it together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you really don\u2019t have a specific item, that\u2019s what the Hub\u2019s drop and swap is for,\u201d said Xia. \u201cTake inspiration, and maybe decide from there what you want to be for Halloween. Clothing swaps are probably the best way for people to \u201cchange up what\u2019s in their closet,\u201d she said.\n\nWednesday marked only the second day of the event, and people were already dropping things off, filling up the once empty basket. Some students recognized the larger significance of the Drop \u2018N\u2019 Swap. \u201cThe initial reaction and fun of it would be to check out what is here,\u201d said Xia. \u201cBut on a deeper level, I think ultimately people know that this Drop \u2018N\u2019 Swap is here to promote sustainability\u201d.\n\nThe Halloween costume exchange is one of the Sustainability Hub\u2019s many programs pushing toward sustainability. One other major program is Assignment Earth, a university-wide effort towards greater sustainability. Some of its aspirations and programs for the campus include climate neutrality, net zero waste, hydration stations and education opportunities.

Trojans are sticking close to campus\n\nMany students are staying near campus this week, even with Thursday and Friday off.\n\nBy Amanda Murphy, Heather Mimikos and Shadi Angotti\nOctober 11, 2023 at 5:51 pm PDT\n\nMany USC students are planning to stay close to campus for this year\u2019s fall break, despite not having to attend any classes from Oct. 12-15. Fall break, a four-day weekend that was first worked into USC\u2019s academic calendar for 2019\u2032s fall semester, gives students the opportunity to step away from academics for a period of time shorter than spring break yet longer than a typical weekend. The long weekend usually lands around the eighth week of the fall semester, right around midterms.\n\nWith four days off from school, there are a plethora of options for students who either want or need something to do. For some students, fall break simply means staying put. Jennie Duong, a junior studying engineering, said she might just end up staying in her apartment and \u201cchilling.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrying to road trip, but I\u2019m broke,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m actually on the verge of burning out, so I\u2019m really glad that this break is coming up.

I\u2019m gonna sit at home and finish my homework that is overdue.\u201d\n\nOther students, alongside their friends and significant others, are using the recess as a way of exploring the many activities, events and places that Los Angeles has to offer.\n\n\u201cOne of my really good friends actually goes to LMU so I\u2019m gonna hang out with her tomorrow,\u201d said Alison Mitchell, a freshman double-majoring in theater and Spanish. \u201cProbably grab dinner together, go to the beach, watch a movie, and then catch up on homework and then explore L.A. because I\u2019m not from here, and so I\u2019m definitely going to take the opportunity to go see the sights and hang out with friends and enjoy the nice weather.\u201d\n\nJoon Chun, a mechanical engineering major, has a couple of plans in mind: \u201cGoing to be hanging out with my girlfriend and some of my other friends.

There\u2019s been a lot of things that she\u2019s been wanting to eat in L.A. because New York is expensive.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released on May 2, 2018, that announced that the inaugural fall break would take place in the following fall semester, Michael W.

This Saturday\u2019s weather forecast for South Bend \u2014 around 50 degrees and rainy \u2014 is far from optimal for the undefeated Southern Cal team, who will travel for the 94th meeting of the great USC-Notre Dame rivalry.\n\nIn a video filmed by Smith, while players were attempting to track where the football was, USC Athletics staff were shown spraying water out of a portable hose directly at the punt returners during catching drills. The practice may seem unconventional, but may be necessary, as wide-receivers Zachariah Branch and Dorian Singer dropped a ball each.\n\nThe video, originally posted by Smith on X, gained over 1.4 million views, and was reposted by several sports media accounts, including ESPN CFB, Bleacher Report, and Sports Illustrated.\n\n#USC staffers sprayed water at punt returners today during practice in hopes of simulating the rainy environment the Trojans will face in South Bend. pic.twitter.com/7k4nU5J9Jw \u2014 Jack Smith (@jacksmithpxp) October 10, 2023\n\nAccording to an interview with Smith, who works as an intern reporter for uscfootball.com, this moment was captured during Tuesday\u2019s practice, which is open to the media in the afternoon. Smith said he posted the video later on Tuesday, and it started to blow up.\n\n\u201cAt first I thought it was cool, like it\u2019s happened with some [posts] before, but not to that extent. And I just thought it was kind of random,\u201d he said. \u201cI posted the video expecting fans to be interested in it, but I think it got caught by the algorithm, got put on the feeds of different fan bases that dislike USC, and that started to drive the engagement.\u201d\n\nThis practice strategy is puzzling some football fans, who are left asking if there are any other weird ways teams prepare for specific in-game situations.\n\n\u201cMost games that USC\u2019s going on the road, they will practice with crowd noise,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnyone that\u2019s walking across campus I\u2019m sure can hear it, they are using speakers to pipe in crowd noise ... to simulate a road environment.\u201d\n\nSmith said that weather, and specifically rain, is a little bit harder to prepare for without wasting too much water.\n\n\u201cI thought it was an interesting strategy... Is it going to be the most game-changing in the world? No. Can you completely prepare for the rain that\u2019s going to come on Saturday? Probably not,\u201d said Smith. \u201cBut they\u2019re trying to put in some level of an effort, and I think it\u2019s better to be slightly prepared than not prepared at all.\u201d\n\nOpposition media outlets do not feel the same way. Michael Chen of the Fighting Irish Wire, a Notre Dame sports website, said, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of silly, if you ask me, typically teams just soak the balls with water before they\u2019re used. If you think about what the Trojans are doing, it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Take a look for yourself... At this point, after seeing how they handled the punts in the rain, we should hope it pours.\u201d\n```"}

As one of the many events hosted over Trojan Family Weekend, Wasserman Music, in partnership with USC, held a panel to spotlight different music professionals and to highlight what it takes to build and represent an artist.\n\nThe panel, moderated by USC Vice Provost for the Arts, Josh Kun, included music manager Mike Power and Dylan Johnson, EVP for Wasserman Music Lee Anderson, Vice President of A&R at Universal Music Taylor Testa, and the artist himself, Kenny Beats.\n\nKenneth Blume III, known musically as Kenny Beats, has been a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to creating music, producing for household rap and hip-hop names from Kendrick Lamar, Ski Mask the Slump God, Denzel Curry and Vince Staples and crossing into genres like indie pop with Dominic Fike, Joji and Omar Apollo. Last year, he gave us a taste of his own voice through his album \u201cLouie\u201d\u2014a heartfelt montage of vocals weaved with a vintage soul to express the complex relationship with his father.\n\nIt\u2019s not common to have already built a loyal fanbase as a producer before the release of an album, nor is it common to have your name on records, or to work on long-term projects and full albums with artists. So how was Kenny Beats able to make a name for himself in an industry that makes it hard for producers to stand out in? To him and his team, it was the shared understanding that they needed to build something \u201cirreplaceable culturally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be music videos, that\u2019s going to involve live shows, that\u2019s going to involve merchandise, and that\u2019s going to take a lot of people around Kenny to service what he\u2019s able to do as both an artist and producer,\u201d said Mike Power, long-term friend and manager to Blume.\n\nAccording to Power, the first deal they struck for Blume was in 2017, when an artist offered $200 for his beat. It was also when he realized how disposable producers were in a rapidly expansive industry, one where artists could easily get beats from anywhere.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we started everything,\u201d Power said. \u201cJust seeing how little value a lot of the industry placed on producers. We wanted to build something where people had to come to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cave\u201d\u2014a YouTube series to showcase the behind-the-scenes of Kenny Beats making music\u2014did exactly that, racking up 700,000 subscribers in the first year. The channel features videos of Blume producing music for artists like Doja Cat, Joji, and Zack Fox, who freestyle over the beat that Blume makes in the episode.\n\nThe producer and artist also took to Twitch to expand his reach. On top of opening up to his audience about his music production process and giving out tips and advice to other producers, he also hosted weekly beat battle competitions that producers of all ages from the world competed in for prizes. The channel has over 350k subscribers and is the most viewed music-oriented Twitch stream, according to the team.\n\nHis Discord, with 135k users, has become a networking haven of sorts, where producers often work together, share music, and give advice to others wishing to pursue music.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard to build this community with a lot of people around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all these people could all make music together and learn from each other, we\u2019re doing a much bigger thing than any record released.\u201d\n\nNot only did merging music production with the digital space create a long-lasting community, but efforts like Kenny Beats\u2019 beat battles became a way for producers to gain attention from his audience. Breaking into the music industry and being valued as a producer has been a known challenge to producers, and it\u2019s even more challenging for marginalized communities.\n\nA study conducted by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative for 2022 found that women only made up 2.8% of producers in the music industry, and only 26% of those were women of color. But the anonymity of the submission process in Kenny Beats\u2019 beat battles helps to dispel this disparity. Moderators on stream are also there to make sure the platform is a safe space for everyone \u201ccoming from anywhere,\u201d according to Blume.\n\nIn fact, the winner In the last season of the beat battles was a female producer originally from Japan, by the name Izumi.\n\nBut gaining attention from the public is different from creating a lasting career. Mike Power emphasized how important it is to take your time when building your brand, and says that success and finding those who understand your worth\u2014especially in the music industry\u2014is something that can\u2019t be rushed.\n\n\u201cOvernight success takes ten years,\u201d Power said. \u201cBeing a good person and building great relationships are paramount to that journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my best friends and people wanting to create value for me as a producer, I never would have gone into the content-side,\u201d Blume said. \u201cWhen I started working with my friends was when my career worked.\u201d\n\nTaylor Testa, Blume\u2019s publisher, had been friends with him before they were business associates but admitted she delayed signing with him because she didn\u2019t work in hip-hop. She changed her mind after realizing that Blume was well-versed across multiple genres, and when she saw the \u201cundeniable\u201d work ethic behind his then-team\u2014something she says is pivotal when she\u2019s looking to sign someone.\n\n\u201cKenny was doing 30 sessions a day to make sure that he was really putting in the work...and that\u2019s just not something you can teach,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m looking at signing somebody, I don\u2019t sign anyone who has a plan B\u2014you\u2019re either all in or you\u2019re not in.\u201d\n\nTo students, the panel gave hope to those interested in pursuing the music industry. Ari Segal, a junior studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics and visiting from Emory University, talked about what it meant to be able to hear from Kenny Beats and music professionals.\n\n\u201cI thought it was really informative to hear from him alongside his team about the business as well as the creative process,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a music maker, it really helps to see different opportunities in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how Kenny Beats knew he felt \u201cready\u201d to dive head-first as a full-time producer, he mentioned how important it is for artists to take their time working on their craft, but said it ultimately came down to taking that first leap of faith.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never ready,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just got to do it.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Lifan Zhang)\n\nBy Lifan Zhang October 11, 2023 at 5:19 pm PDT\n\nThe Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands has strongly demanded the restoration of flights to China. This U.S. territory, located about 4,000 miles west of Hawaii, is actually closer to East Asia than it is to the U.S. mainland. Saipan Island is the most famous tourist destination in the commonwealth. Between 2015 and 2020, Chinese tourists made up 40% of all visitors. The CNMI has submitted an application to the U.S. Department of Transportation, hoping that Chinese tourists can return to the scenic islands.\n\nHowever, this initiative, aimed primarily at attracting tourists and boosting the economy, might inadvertently provide a new family reunion solution for Chinese students stranded in the U.S. due to visa issues. The CNMI are the only U.S. territory with visa-free entry for Chinese citizens. When students cannot leave the U.S. due to visa reasons, and their families cannot obtain U.S. visas either, these exceptional Pacific islands become one of the few possible places for them to meet.\n\nYet currently, flights between China and the Northern Mariana Islands are suspended. Before the pandemic, China Eastern Airlines and Sichuan Airlines operated regular routes from Mainland China to Saipan, all of which were interrupted during the COVID outbreak. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, in consideration of flight rights reciprocity, Chinese and American airlines currently operate a maximum of 36 flights per week between China and the U.S., half from each side. The routes from mainland China to Saipan Island are also included in this count.\n\nSince the current approved number of flights is only 11% of the 2019 figure, the demand from China to the U.S. mainland cannot be fully met, and Chinese airlines do not have excess flight rights to restore the Saipan route. But once the flights are resumed, Saipan Island will become the only destination where Chinese students in the U.S. and their family members can arrive without applying for a visa.\n\nGenerally speaking, when an F-1 student visa expires, one simply needs to return home to renew it, and the typical processing time is only a week. However, the increasingly strict visa reviews by the U.S. for Chinese students have obstructed many from reuniting with their families. The U.S. began tightening visa restrictions on Chinese students during the Trump administration, especially for students in STEM fields. The most notable ban was Proclamation 10043, signed by Donald Trump, which directly prohibited students from a list of Chinese universities from obtaining F-category study visas and J-category scholar visas.\n\n\u201cThe major difficulty is the administrative processing of unknown duration, commonly referred to as \u2018check,\u2019\u201d Rebecca Liu, a Chinese graduate student in artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University, told Annenberg Media. \u201cEssentially, almost all students from STEM majors will encounter this process, which can range from a few weeks to half a year, even if you have all the necessary documents in order. All Chinese students in our major have been \u2018checked,\u2019 with the process lasting around two months for everyone. Meanwhile, most STEM students receive an F-1 visa with a validity of only one year\u2014whereas typically, an F-1 visa lasts for five years.\u201d\n\nDue to the pandemic and the expiration of her visa, Liu hasn\u2019t returned to her home country for four years. She is set to graduate with her master\u2019s degree and start working by the end of this year, but the issue of renewing her visa has become her biggest concern. \u201cThe company requires me to provide a start date, but if I return home to renew my visa, there\u2019s no way to guarantee the timing.\u201d If the visa renewal takes too long, students might even lose their eligibility to work.\n\n\u201cIf the \u2018check\u2019 takes longer, exceeding the grace period, then not only does the company\u2019s offer become invalid, but the Optional Practical Training (OPT) eligibility is also voided. It would then be impossible to return to the U.S.,\u201d Liu said. Optional Practical Training (OPT) allows international students who have studied at U.S. universities to have work eligibility for 1-3 years after graduation. During the OPT period, even though the students have already graduated, they still maintain their F-1 student status. If they need to re-enter the U.S., they must hold a valid F-1 visa.\n\nThere are strict regulations on the duration of unemployment for students under OPT. Students must start working within 60 days after graduation; otherwise, their eligibility automatically expires. However, if a student is waiting outside the U.S. for visa approval, even if they have already received a job offer, this waiting time still counts towards the 60 days. Even if students are considering employment, the prolonged waiting period of several months can severely impact their studies.\n\nAfter the U.S. recovered from the COVID pandemic, universities gradually stopped accepting remote classes via Zoom for students, and prolonged absences may lead to students being asked to take a leave of absence. For example, at USC, students who are more than one week late are asked to defer their attendance to the next semester. Furthermore, for students who need laboratory research, remote learning means they cannot conduct experiments in person.\n\nLiu\u2019s parents obtained U.S. visas, so they could visit her. Liu said, \u201cMy parents provided a lot of documents at the time, including proof of assets, proof of income, etc., to show that they had no intention of immigrating.\u201d However, not all students and their families are so fortunate. In 2021, the U.S. visa rejection rate for Chinese citizens for tourist visas was close to 80 percent. Even after the easing of the pandemic and the U.S.-China visa disputes, the rejection rate still exceeded 30 percent.\n\nOn the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, there have been hundreds of posts this year by Chinese students studying in the U.S. sharing their parents\u2019 visa rejection experiences. If a student\u2019s parents don\u2019t have much travel experience in developed countries or substantial financial proof, obtaining a visa is not easy, some posts say. In addition, the current waiting time for processing tourist visas at the U.S. consulates in China is astonishingly long. At the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, it currently takes 196 days just to get an appointment for an interview, and that\u2019s just the beginning\u2014a significant proportion of Chinese citizens even for tourist visas encounter \u201cadministrative processing.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Chinese students with expired visas who wish to meet their families can travel to Canada, Mexico or an adjacent island through the Automatic Visa Revalidation Program. However, obtaining visas for these regions in China is not necessarily simpler than getting a U.S. visa. At the same time, even if the student\u2019s status in the U.S. is still legal, meaning their I-20 and I-94 forms are still valid, the decision to allow re-entry is still made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, and there is uncertainty that they might not be allowed to return.\n\nHowever, Saipan is a U.S. territory so this issue doesn\u2019t exist when traveling there. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement website indicates that students don\u2019t need a valid visa to visit Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Mariana Islands unless their route passes outside of U.S. territories. Jason Givens, a CBP Press officer, told Annenberg Media, \u201cEvery situation is unique, but since Saipan is a U.S. commonwealth, the student would be \u2018in status\u2019 when traveling and returning to the mainland if the student never leaves U.S. territory. Although it might not be required, I recommend the student carry the expired F-1 visa and valid I-20 in case proof is requested.\u201d\n\nSince Oct. 3, 2019, the CNMI has tightened visa-free restrictions for Chinese nationals. If one has a record of being refused a U.S. visa, they cannot enjoy the visa-free entry policy. This means that student families need to assess their odds and make a choice between taking the risk of applying for a U.S. visa and reuniting in Saipan. As Givens mentioned, students cannot leave U.S. territory throughout the journey. To meet this requirement, the only available option is to fly from the U.S. mainland to Hawaii, then take UA201 from Honolulu to Guam, transfer to UA174 to Saipan and then return the same way.\n\nThe route of family reunion. (Map by Lifan Zhang)\n\nWhether this plan can proceed mainly depends on whether the U.S. DOT approves the CNMI\u2019s request. \u201cThe economic repercussions CNMI is enduring from the restrictions on Chinese travel go beyond transportation and strike at the heart of the CNMI\u2019s ability to fund and provide basic services to its citizens,\u201d wrote the CNMI Ports Authority.\n\nAfter the dual blows of hurricanes and the pandemic, the finances of the CNMI, which is supported by the tourism industry, are in an extremely tight situation. The CNMI Ports Authority gave an example: earlier this year, the CNMI was forced to limit, reduce and suspend Medicaid services due to financial constraints and required cost-cutting measures.\n\nThe CNMI Ports Authority believes that since no U.S. airlines are interested in opening routes from Saipan to China, the U.S.-China flight restriction not only fails to protect American interests on the China-to-Saipan route but also causes significant economic harm thereby infringing on the interests of the CNMI residents who are U.S. citizens.\n\nJets spanning the Pacific connect more than just the continents on either side. When they finally land, the islands in the Pacific may soon bear witness to more heartwarming moments.\n```"}

It depends who you ask.\n\nNational political polarization has ripple effects at on campus debates and political organizations\n\nBy Nicholas Corral October 11, 2023 at 5:17 pm PDT\n\nPolitical polarization has been on the rise since the 1970\u2032s, as congressional Democrats and Republicans have moved away from the ideological center according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. In the months prior to the 2020 election, the Pew Research Center found that, \u201croughly eight-in-ten registered voters in both camps said their differences with the other side were about core American values.\u201d\n\nUSC students are not motivated by the elections and political pressures that drive the most extreme behavior and positions among politicians. Bob Shrum, the director at the USC Center for the Political Future, found that, with the exception of one class immediately after the 2016 election, students at USC are more likely to have respectful debate than one might find on the national stage.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re all students. For the majority of the people in our clubs, they don\u2019t want to pursue politics after college and they just want to have friends and talk about politics,\u201d said Sara Steinecker, president of the Trojan Democrats and a junior majoring in Political Science\n\nDespite not seeing a direct increase on campus, political groups at USC agreed that national trends in polarization have had ripple effects. Stienecker said that her organization as well as young Democrat organizations across the nation have seen increased membership since the election of Donald Trump and particularly since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. She acknowledged however that the increased national polarization could also be intimidating to people she spoke to, who opted not to affiliate with a particular party as a result.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two sides of the coin, where some people are turned away from politics because of the polarization, but at the same time, a lot of people are more interested in politics because the polarization is caused by such consequential issues,\u201d said Steinecker.\n\nVernon Norman, a 2023 USC MBA graduate who works with the Los Angeles County Young Republicans, highlighted that with increased polarization has also come changes in the language used to discuss political issues.\n\n\u201cLook at a press conference by Pramila Jayapal and go look at one by Kevin McCarthy and see the difference in communication, what\u2019s communicated, and the way the issues are presented. I would challenge you to look at that and then ask yourself how did we get to the point where the way we talk about issues is so different,\u201d said Norman.\n\nOne of the most visible areas of impact of national polarization on campus is in the political debates hosted each semester by the Political Union and Political Assembly. Political Union Communications Director, Duncan Law, pointed to national polarization and political trends as a cause of what he perceived as less productive debates.\n\n\u201cThe past few debates I\u2019ve noticed have been less of debates and more of each side just getting at what they want to say,\u201d said Law. He also cited national candidates\u2019 efforts to produce viral moments as a cause for the appearance of one liners at on-campus debates.\n\nDespite the ripple effects of polarization on campus, across political groups, individuals pointed to the conditions on campuses as being effective tools towards thawing polarization nationally as much as they are vulnerable. Professor Thomas Hollihan, who teaches a class on campaign communication, emphasized that the transition to college can actually result in less politically informed students as civics classes are no longer required for students.\n\nNorman and Law both highlighted the importance of personal communication toward bridging political divides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just listening honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter who the person is or what they identify as politically or otherwise. You just listen and as long as I do that rather than lecture, I\u2019ve never had a problem connecting with anyone,\u201d said Norman.\n\nAnd despite acknowledging that on campus debates could at times be heated, Steinecker emphasized their continued value for students.\n\n\u201cI really hope they leave with a sense of understanding and education about both sides of the issue, even if they want to join neither of the clubs afterward,\u201d Steinecker said.\n```"}

For the first time this season, USC is not predicted to win the game on the betting line, with Notre Dame favored by two-and-a-half points, according to ESPN.\n\nWe spoke with some sports-betting USC students to gauge their thoughts on this weekend\u2019s spread. Senior Ryan Johnsen bet that USC would cover the spread, but he says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the undefeated Trojans pick up their first loss.\n\nRyan Johnsen: \u201cI can definitely see the reasoning behind that, just given our recent wins and how sloppy they\u2019ve been, how our defense has looked, and so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised going to a hostile environment if we ended up losing. That\u2019s obviously not what I want, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\nSo far this season, USC is 2-4 against the spread, meaning the Trojans have only beaten two teams by as many points as they\u2019ve been predicted to. In addition, with USC\u2019s defensive front not performing as well as expected, sophomore Reed Rodman says he would bet on Notre Dame this Saturday.\n\nReed Rodman: \u201cIf the line was even and I was simply a betting man, not a USC fan, I would take Notre Dame, just because they do better against ranked teams. They allow less points.\u201d\n\nThird-year Carter Rocket-Munk agreed.\n\nCarter Rocket-Munk: \u201cI think that I believe in our offense. I don\u2019t know if I technically believe in the defense, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rodman says, despite the Trojans\u2019 defensive struggles, it\u2019s really hard to bet against last year\u2019s Heisman winner, Caleb Williams.\n\nRodman: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go against a potential double Heisman candidate like Caleb Williams, but with their defense, we haven\u2019t really seen Caleb Williams against a high level defense like this.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans take on the Fighting Irish in South Bend Saturday at 7:30 Eastern.

This game is one of the season\u2019s tough tests for USC as they open up as an underdog to the fighting Irish with a spread of +2.5. \n\nAs sports betting grows across the United States, the industry is constantly adding more users. ESPN produced an article overlooking the rise of the Colorado football team and Coach Prime\u2019s impact on the betting market. Colorado\u2019s Week 1 game against Nebraska fetched a higher amount of money on the game than any of the Week 1 NFL games. You can expect the Notre Dame vs. USC contest this weekend to fetch a high amount of bets. \n\nFor USC to cover the spread of +3, the favored team, Notre Dame, must either lose or win by two points or less. For Notre Dame to cover, they need to win by three or more points. \n\nBen Fawkes, a longtime journalist in the sports betting industry, reported that as of August 2023, New York is leading the way in bets with $1.12 billion, with New Jersey second at $725.8 million and Nevada at $431 million. \n\nUSC did not cover the spread as a 21-point favorite against the University of Arizona Saturday, winning 43-41 in 3OT. In Weeks 2 and 3 of the college football season, USC did cover their games, beating Stanford and Nevada by substantial margins. \n\nThe bookies are companies like DraftKings or BetMGM that set the score margins and take money from gamblers, placing it on the games of their choosing. In all of their first six games, USC was a consensus favorite, being favored by 20 points or more in each game. However, the team has not fared well for the betting market, going 2-4 against the spread to start the season. \n\nDylan Long, an avid sports bettor and member of the Headed into Overtime Podcast, said that he feels this is a game Vegas wants to be one-sided in terms of the betting. \u201cThey can get around 70-80% of the public on USC and then Notre Dame cleans up for the casinos. That\u2019s why they got all the money in Vegas, spots like this where they can get the public all on one side,\u201d said Long. \n\nFawkes stays away from the public eye of sports betting. \u201cIt\u2019s something I enjoy doing kind of on a very small scale. Just because I\u2019ve been in the industry for so long, I know how difficult it is,\u201d said Fawkes. \n\nMany USC students themselves find this to be a tricky line set by the sportsbooks and don\u2019t want to bet on the game. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet at all because I\u2019ve lost money betting on USC before, and I also just wouldn\u2019t feel good about betting on Notre Dame. That just doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d said USC senior Ryan Johnsen. \n\nJohnsen went on to say if he had to pick a side he would go with USC, expecting a big game from Caleb Williams. \u201cIf I could bet on player props I would definitely bet on Caleb, I think Caleb is going to put on an absolute show.\u201d \n\nSophomore Reed Rodman felt a conflict of interest as a student at USC. \u201cIf the line was even and I was simply a betting man, not a USC fan, I would take Notre Dame. Just because they do better against ranked teams,\u201d said Rodman. \u201cObviously you don\u2019t want to go against a potential double Heisman candidate like Caleb Williams, but you know with their defense, we haven\u2019t really seen Caleb Williams against a high-level defense like this. So yeah, that\u2019s why I would take Notre Dame.\u201d \n\nWhen it comes to sports betting, it is important to understand the overall stakes are against you, and it proves difficult to beat the book, said Colby Olson, a regular contributor on the Not Gambling Advice Podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s best to treat sports gambling like putting money into the stock market. You can\u2019t put all of your eggs in one basket and succeed,\u201d said Olson.\n```"}

This past weekend, USC students were treated to a special DJ\u2019s set by one of their classmate\u2019s dad. You might know him as Will Ferrell. In a backwards cap, dark sunglasses and head-to-toe USC merchandise, Will joined his son Magnus Ferrell and other college students to DJ at his son\u2019s fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu.\n\nWebb Hayes, a senior brother at the fraternity studying real estate development, said that Magnus Ferrell is a member of the fraternity and is one of the house\u2019s DJs. \u201cHe thought it would be a fun gig to have his dad pretend to DJ for 15 minutes,\u201d Hayes said. He said all the brothers of the fraternity were \u201cstoked.\u201d He added that it was \u201cplanned ahead, but kept very lowkey up until the day of.\u201d\n\nStudents took videos of Ferrell and posted them to their social media platforms with pride. Soon after, the videos went viral on TikTok and Instagram. Media outlets like the Rolling Stone and celebrities like Snoop Dog reposted the videos.\n\nPani Disyadej and Paige Huben, sophomores studying business administration, were captured in the viral tiktok video of Ferrell DJ-ing. \u201cHe played a lot of throwback songs like \u2018Eye of the Tiger,\u2019\u201d Huben said. \u201cI was so surprised when I saw him on the DJ stand, my mouth dropped wide open. But I thought it was so fun that he came back to USC because he himself went to USC. So it\u2019s like it\u2019s his alma mater.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got kicked out because we weren\u2019t supposed to be sitting on those stands,\u201d Disyadej said. \u201cBut it was funny that the two minutes we were there were the two minutes that went viral on TikTok.\u201d\n\nHuben also added, \u201cI was so surprised he was there, but I thought he did a great job DJing. Being in the video with him that went viral was so cool because I was close to him.\u201d\n\nEleanor Brooks, a sophomore studying business administration who was captured in the video that Rolling Stone posted, said \u201cit was incredible and such a blast to see Will Ferrell DJ at Sammy.\u201d \u201cI have been a big fan for years, he is hilarious. I hope he pulls up to another party this year. A few of my friends from home flew in for family weekend so it was kind of a flex that he was DJ-ing,\u201d she added.\n\nTamara Almoayed, a sophomore studying journalism said, \u201cWill Ferrell DJ-ing at USC? That\u2019s a great way for college students to show their parents that we are getting their money\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nHayes, the fraternity member, said \u201cfamily weekend is a great time for every member of the fraternity to give their family a glimpse into their life at USC.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re able to introduce each other to our parents, siblings and hometown friends,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that Magnus was able to include his dad and make the day special for all those involved.\u201d\n```"}

Newsom\u2019s bill approval\n\nUSC responds to the new legislation, which introduces some measures already in place on campus.\n\nUSC Engemann Student Health Center. (Photo by Sareen Habeshian)\n\nBy Shei Marcelline October 11, 2023 at 4:30 pm PDT\n\nCalifornia college students will now have wider access to rape kits following a new bill that will provide anonymous assistance in cases of sexual assault. Assembly Bill 1138 was signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday. It is one of the many bills signed by the California governor this week.\n\nTaking effect in the 2025-26 school year, the bill will require public universities to partner with relevant existing on-campus organizations. The legislation does not specify what organizations. Together, they will provide free assistance \u201cin a manner that protects student confidentiality\u201d and gives access to \u201ctransportation to and from a local Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE) or Sexual Abuse Response Team (SART) exam center[s],\u201d according to the legislation.\n\nThese new protocols are similar to ones already in place at USC. USC Student Health Center offers a Confidential Advocate Program that provides students with 24/7 support services to survivors of sexual assault and gender-based harm at no cost. They began offering services in 2019 and have since been financially supported by the Student Health Fee. Since the services are free, they do not bill insurance, ensuring privacy to those who use them.\n\n\u201cArrangement for transportation to and from an SART center for a forensic exam, with the accompaniment of a Confidential Advocate, is part of the established services for students,\u201d said the USC Health Center.\n\nIn addition to assisting with treatment center visits, the program\u2019s Confidential Advocates also \u201cwalk clients through reporting options, including to EEO-TIX and law enforcement, and accommodation arrangements on campus, including with academic programs and housing arrangements,\u201d said the USC Health Center in an email to Annenberg Media.\n\nAs public colleges and universities begin to adopt similar practices under the new bill, the anonymous drivers to and from centers may consist of campus student health center employees, according to the legislation.\n\nSanaiya Bhatt, a senior studying global health and Student Health Center ambassador, feels that all college students should have access to sexual assault treatment resources. \u201cIt helps students have a voice,\u201d she said. \u201cOftentimes people are scared to reach out and find somewhere to go for help. So just offering that transportation access to go to [treatment] centers would be beneficial for all students.\u201d\n\nEliminating the obstacles of cost and fear is what Assemblymember Akilah Weber envisioned when she wrote Assembly Bill 1138. In an interview with the LA Times, Weber said, \u201cCollege campuses are often miles away from the nearest center and for students without a reliable or quick method of transportation, that distance can be insurmountable...The last thing a victim of sexual assault should worry about is the transportation to the local exam center.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), the nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual violence organization, 26.4 percent of female students, 6.8 percent of male students and 23.1 percent of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, nonconforming) students are raped or sexually assaulted in American universities every year. Their reports indicate the wide population of college students in need of the resources that Assembly Bill 1138 can help provide.\n\nForensic exam costs and transportation aren\u2019t the only two services offered to students through this bill. According to the legislation, Services including \u201c...counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, and legal assistance, including resources for the accused\u201d will also be made available.\n```"}

Abortion rights and anti-abortion activists held rallies Saturday in Washington and across the country to call attention to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling on June 24, 2022, which upended the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nBy Corlie Zhuang October 11, 2023 at 4:07 pm PDT\n\nA year after the U.S. Supreme Court shut down her women\u2019s health clinic in Mississippi, Diane Derzis continues to fight for abortion rights, opening new clinics in Tennessee and Illinois and providing transportation for women who live in restrictive states.\n\n\u201cIt was a clear message that I\u2019m not doing enough,\u201d Derzis said, of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. Since the June 24, 2022 ruling, 14 states have passed laws restricting abortion. Iowa, the latest state to limit abortions, made the procedure illegal after six weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for rape and incest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve relied upon men in the law to take care of us,\u201d Derzis said. \u201cThis is what we get. People forget that freedom is not free. They think, \u2018The government won\u2019t take away my rights.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince the laws were passed, abortion rates have declined by 96% in states with the strictest bans like Idaho and Mississippi, according to a report by the Society of Family Planning.\n\nDerzis\u2019s new clinic in Bristol, Tennessee prompted a lawsuit by her landlords, Chase and Chadwick King. \u201cThey said we didn\u2019t tell them we were doing abortions,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they want to get us out.\u201d The clinic remains open and Derzis said she is not intimidated by the lawsuit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do some more hiring,\u201d she said.\n\nNeither of the King brothers responded to several requests for an interview.\n\nDerzis recently opened a clinic in Chicago and plans to start a new clinic in Maryland. \u201cThat\u2019s a safe state,\u201d she said. She chose Maryland, Chicago, and Bristol because they are easily accessible for women living in a group of 11 surrounding states where abortion rights are limited. Her Bristol clinic is right on the Tennessee border; in fact, part of the clinic is in Tennessee. She also runs clinics in Virginia and New Mexico.\n\nWith women facing government restrictions in 14 states, one of her goals is for women to \u201crealize there are other ways to get out of there and that they still can have an abortion.\u201d She raises money to help pay for their travel to obtain abortions not available in their home states.\n\nAlthough she was in the national spotlight, Derzis is still focusing on the individuals who need her help. Derzis became an advocate for abortion rights 45 years ago, when she was 21 and had \u201can abortion when I was married.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s stayed with me all these years,\u201d she said. \u201cRecognizing that if I had not had that choice, that I would not be where I am today.\u201d\n\nAfter having a safe abortion, Derzis decided to devote her life to fighting for the freedom of choice to those who have lost it.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re going to give a fertilized egg more rights is an outrage to me as a woman,\u201d Derzis said. She urges people to continue advocating for women\u2019s rights to have control over their bodies.\n\n\u201cYou know, this is the country where [we think] if we elect pro-choice individuals, they will take care of us,\u201d she said. Instead, they turned on the people the first chance they had. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put it ourselves in action,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s an insanely exciting time to do any clinics, but it\u2019s so depressing if you look at the reason why we\u2019re here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my passion.\u201d That\u2019s why she keeps fighting.\n\nUnlike Derzis, many people are unwilling to fight against these restrictions at such an intense level. Still, she says that most people can support abortion rights and continue to advocate.\n\nDerzis said people can donate to \u201cthe Pink House Fund, which is the nonprofit that also helps with... travel and abortion expenses.\u201d She also says that people can write op-ed pieces, letters to the editors, and speak out about the issue to contribute to the fight.\n\nPeople can get involved in many ways \u201cwithout going overboard and getting arrested or any of that.\u201d Instead of donating to huge groups like Planned Parenthood, Derzis recommends contributing to independent clinics, with the money directly helping women in need.\n\nWith abortion bans in place across the United States, the future for women\u2019s reproductive rights remains threatened. Younger generations will experience these restrictions the most.\n\nA high school student in Starkville, Mississippi, Tamarias Lyles, worries about Mississippi\u2019s abortion laws. \u201cOne day I may need the use of contraceptives,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now that [is] threatened.\u201d\n\nDerzis is worried, too. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst that it could ever be,\u201d she said. \u201cContraceptive pills will be the first to go.\u201d\n\nDerzis refuses to let that happen without a fight. By allowing abortion restrictions to pass without a fight, it will set the scene for the governments to pass even more restrictive laws.\n\nWhen asked about what she would do if a young woman came to her asking for help, Derzis said, \u201cIf abortion was her choice. I\u2019d do whatever it took to help her get there.\u201d\n\nHer clinics have helped thousands of women. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough that we do have lots of funding groups that are able to help those women with travel and abortion expenses.\u201d\n\nEspecially after the Dobbs vs. Jackson case, funding increased for patients at Derzis\u2019 clinics needing help with travel and abortions.\n\nDerzis said she will remain on the frontlines of the battle for abortion rights. \u201cI think that [the government is] using the law now to scare the hell out of people. That if you help someone, they\u2019re going to come after you. And they very well may,\u201d Derzis said.\n\n\u201cYou know, in my lifetime and probably in yours, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see abortion allowed in all the states again.\u201d\n\nCorlie Zhuang is a student at Interlake High School in Bellevue, Washington.

People waited outside the California Science Center in Exposition Park on Wednesday morning to witness the arrival of two solid rocket boosters that were used on the Space Shuttle Endeavour. The rockets, donated by Northrop Grumman, made a nearly 100-mile trek from the Mojave Air and Space Port to their final resting place at the museum. They will be added to the Endeavour space shuttle exhibit.\n\nThe addition of the 116-feet long rockets to the museum\u2019s exhibit comes 11 years after the Endeavour performed its final flight over Los Angeles in September 2012. \u201cIt is a part of Los Angeles history. The fact that [the space shuttle] is going to soon be fully on display, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d said Branimir Kvartuc, who came to the Science Center to witness the arrival of the rockets.\n\nVolunteers at the California Science Center said they were also excited to see the complete Endeavour, citing the historical significance of the craft. \u201cI think for any of us of a certain age, we grew up watching the shuttles go up, and it just became a kind of internal part of us,\u201d said Science Center tour guide Tom Reinsel. \u201cWhen I give tours to these people I emphasize it\u2019s your shuttle now, not NASA\u2019s or the government\u2019s, but your shuttle to witness.\u201d\n\nAccording to their website, the California Science Center is planning to display Endeavour, which is currently being displayed horizontally, in lift-off position in the near future with the addition of the rockets and a 65,000-pound external fuel tank.

The Bruins found themselves down 10-9 at halftime, but rallied in the second half to pull off the upset. Quarterback Dante Moore shook off two early interceptions, including a pick-6 to end the first half, and commanded a rejuvenated UCLA offense out of the locker room. Moore completed 22 of his 44 pass attempts for 1 touchdown. The star of the Bruins\u2019 offense was running back Carson Steele, who rushed for 140 yards on 30 attempts. Washington State\u2019s offense was held in check for a majority of the second half, only scoring one touchdown. The Bruins defense forced two fumbles on top of Ward\u2019s two interceptions, giving their offense plenty of opportunities to score. It took two touchdowns in the fourth quarter from running back Keegan Jones for UCLA to take the lead and eventually win. UCLA\u2019s (4-1) impressive win jolted them from a previously unranked position to No. 18 in the AP Top 25 Poll. Washington State (4-1) dropped from No. 13 to No. 19.\n\nOklahoma tops Texas in Red River Rivalry, 34-30\nThe most anticipated collegiate matchup of the week came down to the wire, as Sooners quarterback Dillon Gabriel found receiver Nic Anderson for the go-ahead touchdown from 3 yards out with 15 seconds remaining. Anderson\u2019s only catch of the day came during the game\u2019s biggest play. Gabriel was efficient through the air, but was especially dominant on the ground. He led the team in rushing, running for 113 yards and a touchdown on 14 attempts. Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers had a completion percentage of 84%, throwing for 346 yards on 31/37 passing. Running back Jonathon Brooks had himself a day, totaling 163 yards on 27 touches. The Longhorns offense was efficient throughout all four quarters, but succumbed to self inflicted wounds. This back-and-forth contest came down to the turnover battle, which Oklahoma won 3-0. All three of Texas\u2019 turnovers came from quarterback Quinn Ewers, who threw two interceptions and fumbled once. Oklahoma (6-0) jumped to No. 5 in the AP Poll after their biggest win of the season. Texas (5-1) finds themselves out of the playoff picture for the first time since their road win vs Alabama, falling to No. 9.\n\nLSU explodes offensively to best Missouri in shootout, 49-39\nLSU quarterback Jayden Daniels put himself on the Heisman watch in an impressive dual-threat showing. Daniels threw for 259 yards and 3 touchdowns, all while rushing for 130 yards on 15 attempts. Daniels consistently drove the Tigers down the field in the second half, leading a comeback effort and making it look easy against a very respectable Missouri defense. Missouri quarterback Brady Cook completed 15 of his 21 pass attempts for 259 yards and 3 touchdowns. Cook also tossed two interceptions, one resulting in a pick-6 on a potential game-winning drive. This high-scoring bout came down to which defense would be the first to make a play, and LSU answered the call. LSU\u2019s (4-2) exhilarating win resulted in little movement for them in the Top 25, moving up one spot to No. 22. Missouri (5-1) sees themselves unranked in the poll, falling from No. 21.\n\nLouisville dominates second half, upsets Notre Dame, 33-20\nIn a display of defensive excellence, Louisville forced five Fighting Irish turnovers. This matchup was knotted up at 7 a piece going into the half, and an inspiring speech from Head Coach Jeff Brohm must have lit a fire under Louisvilles\u2019 roster. The Cardinals picked off quarterback Sam Hartman three times, sacked him five times and stripped the ball from him twice. Hartman had yet to throw an interception this season, but found himself committing all of the team\u2019s turnovers on a night he was constantly running for his life. Louisville\u2019s offense took full advantage of their defense\u2019s efforts, as running back Jawhar Jordan rushed for 143 yards and two touchdowns in a bounce-back performance. The Cardinals scored 16 of their 33 points in the fourth quarter, asserting themselves as a team not to be taken lightly. Had it not been for Notre Dame\u2019s late touchdown with 1:35 remaining, the true dominating nature of this game would have been properly relayed in the score. Louisville truly proved themselves in their first true test of the season. Notre Dame (5-2) slips from No. 10 to No. 21 in the AP Poll, with this loss essentially ending their hopes of a playoff appearance. Louisville (6-0) climbs to No. 14 in the poll after entering the rankings just last week.\n\nUSC survives Arizona in 3OT, 43-41\nThe Trojans found themselves down 17-0 early in the second quarter at home, facing their first real adversity this season. Arizona\u2019s offense, led by quarterback Noah Fifita, had their way for the majority of the contest. Fifita completed 25 of his 35 pass attempts for 303 yards, five touchdowns and one interception. Running back Jonah Coleman rushed for 143 yards on 22 attempts, and receiver Tetairoa McMillan led the team with 138 receiving yards. USC\u2019s defense, a group that has struggled this season, has now given up 41 points two weeks in a row. This defense needs to get it together with a tough string of Pac-12 games coming up. The Trojans\u2019 offense struggled early, and Heisman frontrunner Caleb Williams played his most lackluster game of the season. Williams found most of his success on the ground, rushing for 41 yards and three touchdowns. A pair of touchdowns from each team in the fourth quarter saw this game going into overtime, in which both teams scored seemingly easily. A second overtime had similar results, and the game headed into a third extra period. Williams was able to rush for a two-point conversion, and USC\u2019s defense rallied to make the game-sealing tackle on Arizona\u2019s attempt. USC (6-0) finds themselves slipping to No. 10 in the AP Poll, a second straight week of regression despite two wins. Arizona (3-3) remains unranked, but surely feels like they can pull off an upset this season after nearly taking down a Top 10 opponent.\n\nLate blunder by Miami leads to Georgia Tech win, 23-20\nMiami Head Coach Mario Cristobol\u2019s curious decision to run the ball up late in the game opened the door for a miracle comeback by Georgia Tech. A low-scoring affair through 21\u20442 quarters turned into a highly dramatic, high-scoring second half at Hard Rock Stadium. A combined seven turnovers and nine punts made for a disaster of a game from both programs offensively. Quarterbacks Tyler Van Dyke and Haynes King both struggled immensely, but eventually put together late scoring drives thanks to each others\u2019 turnovers. Hurricanes running back Donald Chaney was able to rush for 106 yards on 24 attempts but will be remembered in this game for all the wrong reasons. Miami found themselves up by three at Georgia Tech\u2019s 30-yard line with 34 seconds remaining in the game. The Yellow Jackets were out of timeouts, and a knee by Miami would have effectively ended the game. Miami instead handed the ball to Chaney, who was gang-tackled and eventually stripped of the football, giving life to Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech drove the ball down the field in just four plays, which ended in a 44-yard touchdown bomb from King to receiver Christian Leary with just one second remaining. Miami (4-1) dropped eight spots in the poll to No. 25 after this embarrassing loss. Georgia Tech (3-3) remains unranked.\n\nOhio State avoids first-half scare, beats Maryland, 37-17\nTaulia Tagovailoa found receiver Kaden Prather early in the first quarter for a 15-yard touchdown to set the tone early for the Terrapins. A pair of field goals from either team and a pick-6 from Buckeyes safety Josh Proctor highlighted the second-quarter action. Ohio State found themselves knotted up at 10 a piece vs unranked Maryland at halftime. Maryland\u2019s offense took the second-half kickoff down the field and capped it off with a 9-yard touchdown run from Tagovailoa. Maryland was looking to be on its way to a generational upset. But Ohio State went on to score 27 unanswered points in the second half, putting any chances of said upset to rest. Buckeyes quarterback Kyle McCord was efficient in the win, completing 19 of his 29 pass attempts for 320 yards and 2 touchdowns. Standout wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. accounted for 163 of those yards and a score. Thanks to Texas\u2019 loss, Ohio State (5-0) leaped to the No. 3 spot in the AP Poll. Maryland (5-1) remains unranked.\n\nAlabama slips past Texas A&M in sloppy win, 26-20\nIn what seemed to be a trend in Week 6, the favored Crimson Tide found themselves down 17-10 at halftime vs the Aggies. Quarterback Jalen Milroe and wide receiver Jermaine Burton decided they had enough, and exploded in the third quarter. Milroe found Burton for 15 and 19-yard scores in the third, putting Alabama in front. Milroe completed 21 of his 33 pass attempts for 321 yards, three touchdowns and one interception, cementing himself as a starting-caliber quarterback. Burton led the team in receiving yards, hauling in 9 catches for 197 yards and 2 touchdowns. Alabama found themselves in such a close game mostly due to self-inflicted wounds. 14 penalties committed by the Crimson Tide made for a much closer contest than anticipated. Texas A&M\u2019s last hope came down to an onside kick, which Alabama recovered. Alabama (5-1) sees no movement in the Poll, remaining ranked No. 11. Texas A&M (4-2) remains unranked.\n```"}

(Photo by Abigail Rawlinson of ANNENBERG MEDIA\n\nBy Abigail Rawlinson October 11, 2023 at 1:45 pm PDT\n\nOn Sept. 6, Franklin Foer published \u201cThe Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden\u2019s White House and the Struggle for America\u2019s Future.\u201d Granted exclusive access to Biden\u2019s inner circle, Foer takes the reader into the White House as the Biden administration sought to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the passage of infrastructure and spending bills, the invasion of Ukraine and the 2020 midterms. Insider testimony, personal observations, and historical accounts paint a picture of a White House at a crossroads in American history, with officials seeking to understand how to generate political unity and overcome the pressing challenges of the post-COVID era. The book is a must-read for political buffs, Biden fans and history nerds, but if you don\u2019t have the time for a read, here are some top takeaways from Foer\u2019s book:\n\nBiden felt made for the moment... Foer argues that the 2020 electorate \u201cturned to Joe Biden as a balm... Voters hoped the kindly grandfather might impose calm and decency, a bit of boredom.\u201d Instead, Biden rejected this assumption once in office, proposing broad reform and returning to civility in the first two years of his administration. Biden, from Scranton, \u201chadn\u2019t waited his whole life to be a placeholder,\u201d and he ensured that his term goals reflected his lifelong ambitions.\n\n...And his experience shines through in the narrative Biden\u2019s experience is the heartbeat of the book. Lessons from decades in politics define his character and governing style. Foer emphasizes that Biden\u2019s experience is the bedrock of his greatest strengths. The behind-the-scenes nature of \u201cThe Last Politician\u201d illustrates that political impulses and assumptions helped him shepherd his legislative agenda through Congress, strengthen the NATO alliance and collaborate with foreign leaders. Foer concludes that his experience becomes apparent while coalition-building during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 prior knowledge and challenges cast him as a role model for other foreign leaders that only years in public service can provide.\n\nBeing VP comes with challenges Vice President Harris doesn\u2019t appear many times throughout \u201cThe Last Politician.\u201d But, when she is mentioned, Foer provides readers with a look into the difficulties of being vice president. Foer explains that Biden wanted Harris to feel like a critical administration member, seeking her counsel and opinion on matters and in meetings. Foer writes that while Biden\u2019s years in Washington complimented President Obama\u2019s less experience, this was not the case for the Biden-Harris administration: \u201cBiden didn\u2019t need Harris in the same way Obama needed Biden.\u201d Foer also implies that Vice President Harris struggled with finding her voice and role within the Biden administration. She told White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain that \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to work on women\u2019s issues or anything to do with race.\u201d Klain found that she boxed herself in, making portfolio-building difficult. Nevertheless, Foer explains that her straightforward questioning and desire to better the lives of the American people bettered high-level conversations and complemented the style of Biden.\n\nThe US suspected Russia\u2019s plans for Ukraine long before the February 2022 invasion U.S. military intelligence saw the beginnings of the eventual war in Ukraine in April 2021 when Russia amassed troops on its border with Ukraine. Still, aides alerted Biden of more concrete Russian war plans in October 2021. Biden immediately recognized the severity of the situation, a few days later telling the G20 that \u201cthis is the real deal.\u201d In November, Secretary of State Antony Blinken informed Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky about the intelligence and Russia\u2019s plans to invade Ukraine. Foer recounts that Zelensky \u201cstruggled to absorb the warning that his neighbor wanted to erase his country\u201d and \u201crefused to believe [it],\u201d making war preparations difficult.\n\nBefore the Russian invasion, the Biden-Zelensky relationship was complicated Foer describes Zelensky telling \u201caides that he regarded Biden as weak\u201d and held the view that \u201cBiden had undermined the Ukrainian economy.\u201d Conversely, Biden did not think \u201cmuch about his Ukraine counterpart\u201d and was taken aback by Zelensky\u2019s straightforward demands from the U.S. while in conversation with Biden, finding him untraditional and lacking respect for assumed meeting norms.\n\nBiden wrestles with his faith in \u201cbetter angels.\u201d Foer pulls back the curtain on Biden\u2019s insecurities and inner turmoils, showing a portrait of a leader who can sometimes feel backed against the wall. Foiled by detractors in legislative aims, confronted with failure in the withdrawal from Afghanistan and frustrated by COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, Foer reveals that Biden faced difficulties keeping faith in \u201cbetter angels,\u201d a line he often repeats in speeches.\n\nFoer addresses questions about Biden\u2019s age With the upcoming election, where Americans must once again decide who will occupy the Oval Office, Foer\u2019s book can play an essential role in allowing voters to see how they feel about Biden\u2019s presidency by providing greater access to its operations. Most importantly, however, his treatment of Biden\u2019s age arguably provides the most essential takeaways from the book and the most fodder for Republican candidates to harness against Biden in 2024. A recent poll from AP-NORC shows that 69% of Democrats felt Joe Biden was too old for a second term. Foer\u2019s book provided an opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look into what being president at 80 years old means. Foer explains that Biden struggles with \u201cindiscipline and imprecision\u201d when fielding questions from reporters and battles with how to get \u201canswer[s] out cleanly\u201d because of a stutter in his childhood. These assessments, however, are not as crucial as how Foer ends the book. \u201cIt was striking that [Biden] took so few morning meetings or presided over so few public events before 10 a.m. His public persona reflected physical decline and time\u2019s dulling of mental faculties that no pill or exercise regime can resist. In private, he would occasionally admit that he felt tired,\u201d he wrote.\n```"}

As a singer-songwriter and producer, JCR\u2019s own personal experiences are echoed into the DNA of his music. Finding music production and songwriting from the Play it Back Music Program with Teen Cancer America, he speaks about how being a cancer survivor has impacted the level of openness and vulnerability in his music.\n\nIn his recent release \u201cFarewell,\u201d JCR told the story of his and his family\u2019s journey through grief after the passing of his father. With specificity to his own experience, he delves into the universal experience of loss and the healing journey that many listeners can relate to.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with JCR to learn more about how personal identity, vulnerability, and self-expression are integral to his work. Full transcript has been edited for clarity. Editor\u2019s note: This episode was recorded in April 2023.\n\nJCR: I\u2019m Juan or in terms of my artist project JCR, and I am a music industry major. I\u2019m a junior right now. I\u2019m also in the music production minor. I am from the San Fernando Valley, which is part of L.A. I\u2019ve gotten into some funny, not serious arguments with friends before over whether it\u2019s part of L.A. or not. And yeah, I mean, I\u2019m an artist. I\u2019m a producer, engineer. I love to songwrite. I love to just create in general. I do all this music stuff. I love to do it with other people, for other people, for myself. And when networking fails, you are your best collaborator. So I have definitely, right now - I\u2019ve been concentrating a lot on my music right now, and it comes from like a really deep part of myself.\n\nBecause a big part of me, of who I am, is the fact that I am a cancer survivor and that I\u2019m a first gen student and that I\u2019m an orphan of my father - my dad who died in 2019, sadly. And yeah, I mean I\u2019m obviously like every other person. I\u2019m made up of a lot of complex blocks and everything. But this aspect of my cancer experience of me and seeing it in my dad and then seeing it in other people that I know of, other survivors, patients, it is a core of who I am also in terms of my songwriting and my music, too.\n\nJCR: So these parts of my life, my personal life, have affected my songwriting, my music by - basically, first in a kind of not serious way, it\u2019s like a treasure trove, honestly, of material to write about. Because at the end of the day, what I love about music is how it\u2019s a beautiful form of expression, a beautiful way of not bottling up. And that, for me, has been like one of the most important things to do in the midst of all the trauma and the sadness and the darkness. I am an open book. Like I\u2019m kind of shy. But then once we strike up a conversation, I will happily be someone that can be easily read and everything. I can lay out my whole story.\n\nAnd yeah, I mean, it\u2019s a lot with all that I\u2019ve gone through and how it affects my music. My music is like just an echo of me, an echo of my experiences. And so naturally, I\u2019m going to - for something that\u2019s been so impactful in my life - I\u2019m going to naturally want to write about it, sing about it. But also at the same time, I do very much care in my songwriting to not be too on the nose. I like to keep a certain open endedness to it because as much as I care about me as a songwriter, as an artist or another artist when I\u2019ve collaborated, as much as I care about the self-expression, I also care about the connectivity. I very much care and sometimes even prioritize what the listener experiences.\n\nAnd I guess in a weird kind of selfless way, I don\u2019t know, I also aside from loving to create music, I love consuming music. I love listening to music. And when I was sick at my worst, listening to music was such a great escape. If anything, I listened to more music than I created when I was at my worst physically with my health and everything. And yeah, it is just a beautiful thing. And as a music industry student right now, I very much have gone towards the direction of A&R, that kind of stuff is very attractive to me. And for anyone who doesn\u2019t know what A&R is, that\u2019s just more of the talent scout seeking type of thing. And so I love discovering and listening to new voices and new sounds. And yeah, just, honesty is really important for me in what I make. And I love hearing that in others.\n\nJCR: My music, the way I can describe it is always kind of weird. Usually my go to nowadays is indie alternative soft rock bedroom pop [laughs] - it\u2019s all of this together. And it\u2019s definitely also because of how I was raised because there is a big part of my childhood where my dad was the one who had to, for different health reasons and just like how the situation was, he had to be the one to stay home. And my mom was the one who worked for like, I don\u2019t know, seven, eight years. And we would take her downtown to where she worked a lot. And it was almost for me and my little world as a kid like I took a road trip. \u2018Oh, yeah, this is cool.\u2019 I get to spend what felt like hours, even though it was probably like 30 minutes on the road, on the freeway, listening to all of my dad\u2019s favorite music. And it definitely left an imprint on the music that I love to make. And it kind of developed into me listening to and then wanting to create music in the kind of alternative pop kind of genre.\n\nAnd I always like to take out my phone to check my Spotify when people ask me, \u2018Oh, what kind of music inspires you?\u2019 And at the top of my head, it\u2019s it\u2019s again, like, like my music, a mix of a lot of things like Adele, Gorillaz, SZA, Omar Apollo. And those are already like people that are more recent and everything. But then there\u2019s also like Queen and the Police. It\u2019s so much. But yeah, that\u2019s how I could describe the best I can.\n\nJCR: Ironically enough, as a USC student, I did go through all my treatment at UCLA, which is funny. But there\u2019s a great child life specialist, which just basically was these types of people who aren\u2019t nurses, but they\u2019re like - because I was a minor. So I was in pediatrics, not really surrounded by a lot of teenagers, but more like kids going through childhood cancer. And those workers are there to accompany and be a support for those kids and play with them and things like that. And so there was a great worker who loved to just at the minimum chat with me and I would already really help with the experience. And she knew of this producer named Kenli Mattus, who is part of an organization called Teen Cancer America, but specifically under there\u2019s this program called the Play It Back Music Program. And its purpose is basically to allow survivors and patients who like music or to create music, to pair them and allow them to make music with this producer from scratch and learn how to do songwriting and some production and things like that.\n\nAnd so she linked me up with this program and with him, and I have been working with him since then. This song is actually mixed and mastered by him. And this opened the doors for me to get into this side of music, because before then, in high school I only did instrumental music. I did like performance[s] of classical music, jazz, [and] played lots of different instruments like violin, drums, percussive instruments. And it was only through this program and through meeting Kenli that I started to finally get into creating something from scratch and learning how to make a good recording. And it was perfect because I already wanted to create, even though I really didn\u2019t have experience in how to do it. I loved improvisation and improving with my violin, which is like the oldest instrument that I had and which was my gateway to music in seventh grade.\n\nJCR: Inspiration and meaning for \u201cFarewell\u201d is honestly pretty to the point because the actual story behind the creation of this song was, I was taking songwriting I freshman year. It was all through zoom - boo. And the way the class is structured is you just have to do something like four songs throughout the semester and you slowly have to implement different techniques that you\u2019re taught. And for the first one, I thought like, \u2018okay, why not finish this instrumental idea that I was already playing with before? And yeah, and I don\u2019t know what I can write about it, but I kind of wanted to learn about this\u2019 and I went for it.\n\nThe thing is that previous to that I was in a kind of weird place because I was dealing with COVID itself. I was sick and I had a fever. And even then I was in this creative, I don\u2019t know, mania and manic moment. And I don\u2019t know, I was just thinking a lot about my dad and about how he passed away and the effect it left on my family and me and how our journey has been going in terms of healing. But I didn\u2019t think about - I usually think about lyrics last because of my instrumentalist background. I\u2019m all about the production first and the melodies first. And I just created this kind of hybrid of indie alternative folk music with some classical cinematic feelings, and that ended up being like the instrumental part of it.\n\nBut then with this song, I mean, with this songwriting class, I had the challenge to, you know, just write a song. And I thought, \u2018Why not kill two birds with one stone?\u2019 And I kind of completed it and I guess and I went with that idea, \u2018Oh, like my dad.\u2019 And yeah, so \u201cFarewell\u201d ends up being a mix of me thinking to myself, reflecting on myself and my healing journey, me reflecting on my mom\u2019s journey, me reflecting on my little brother\u2019s journey and seeing how I need to, for myself especially, be able to say farewell to my dad and to be accepting of the situation.\n\nBecause in the chorus there is a moment where it says at the end of two stanzas, it says, \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t have to say farewell.\u2019 And then once the chorus repeats again at the end, it\u2019s like, \u2018at least I did.\u2019 Like at least I got to say farewell because, yeah, I mean, I think that\u2019s the truest thing to my experience. I wish I didn\u2019t have to. It sucked. It sucks still. But I\u2019m glad that I got it because it could have been the situation where I couldn\u2019t have been with him maybe. I was with him until the very end. And how difficult it would have been for me if I wasn\u2019t there with him if things were different. It just leads me to, I guess, the moral of it being everything, despite how sad and difficult it was, was perfect in its own way.\n\nJCR: Yeah. So, I mean, some lines that I would love to like I guess take a deeper dive into. Well first would be, \u2018there\u2019s a hole in your heart.\u2019 That is definitely from me to my mom. If anything, actually me to my mom and my brother cause of course we all have that a hole in that moment. But my first intention was to my mom because she definitely felt it the hardest. You know, it\u2019s her partner in life, partner in crime. And, you know, \u2018there\u2019s a hole in your heart. I feel it, too.\u2019 You know, the empathy and everything that it has been so tough. And I guess it\u2019s an attempt for me to be like, \u2018you\u2019re not alone,\u2019 you know, And actually, fun fact, the very first - when I thought like, \u2018okay, I have the intention to write lyrics to this and to complete this song\u2019 - the first thing in my mind was, \u2018your tears flow out.\u2019 The very first line of the song.\n\nBecause it was an attempt for me to comfort my mom, basically because she\u2019s a very expressive person. And I think she says, she loves to joke that \u2018I\u2019m a crybaby, I\u2019m such a crybaby.\u2019 But in this situation there have been a lot of tears, a lot of tears, especially from her. And this is like a moment of me recognizing the pain. I see you and not only do I see you, but I am with you. And some other lines are like, \u2018they say suppress the pain, but I need to let it drain.\u2019 I think pretty much this is pretty on the nose. And like how I was mentioning earlier on the need for expression and it ties in where there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s right before when it says, \u2018please talk to me, it\u2019ll set us free.\u2019\n\nNow that is directly directed to my little brother. Because in that, after all of that, in seeing my dad passed away and then experiencing that absence in our lives, especially when I wrote this song in like 2020, my brother wasn\u2019t very expressive. I\u2019m thankful at least he was more with my mom, with our mom, but to me, not very much. And it was difficult. It\u2019s usually a difficult topic to bring up. It\u2019s better now. Again, this is all about healing and slowly but surely healing. But this was me just literally just calling out and saying like, \u2018talk to me because I have felt free in talking about this with people and I want you to be free too. And we can be free together. You can talk about how you\u2019re feeling about this situation with me.\u2019 I, if anything, know this. I\u2019m the one person who knows this the most as you, because I\u2019m your brother. And yeah, so it was directly that. But again, like I was mentioning earlier, I love that this is also vague because you wouldn\u2019t know this background unless I told you like I am right now. But because this is kind of open ended, anyone can connect to this. And this ties in perfectly with what I was actually mentioning earlier, because this is a very personal song and this is a beautiful and perfect opportunity for me to express myself and dump it all out. But then at the same time, this is - I always had the intention of making this song, making \u201cFarewell,\u201d be a great opportunity for people who have experienced any kind of loss in their life to connect to it. It doesn\u2019t have to be my exact situation: parent cancer. There you go. No, it could be anyone who lost a sibling, a grandparent, a pet, a friend. Anything. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m just so glad with how this song turned out to be.\n\nJCR: Do I have any fear with being vulnerable in my music? I don\u2019t think so. I think I would be scared of being vulnerable if I had my defenses up I guess or if I had this mask on or if I had this heart of stone and if I had my fists up in a way. But I always like to say personally that my cancer experience and my experience of seeing my dad with his cancer and all that softened me. I was much more of a defensive person before I guess you could say in a way. And I was scared to open up and things like that. But because of how much life made me down, I guess in other words. In these situations, it has caused me to like not - I don\u2019t want to say not be scared of anything. Of course I have fear, but in terms of being vulnerable and I think of that as being open as well, like it\u2019s synonymous. I have no fear because, one, I need, I need to do it. I don\u2019t know how - and I know some people that are like that, but I don\u2019t know how some people can just never allow themselves to be vulnerable with other people. I can\u2019t do that. I feel like it would if I were to never allow myself to be vulnerable, I would be in a deep hole, in a deep pit of sadness and hate towards my situation, towards life. And I know also that me being open and vulnerable can help others to think about these things.\n\nFor many people I know for sure, I\u2019ve talked to some people about this, that I am the first experience of cancer and mortality, like this terrible kind of side of sickness. I\u2019m the first experience for many people that I went to high school with, and I feel like I think that- a big again, this is all my opinion - but I do believe that a big step towards maturity and growth is realizing and accepting that we don\u2019t live forever. We\u2019re not all powerful, even though when we\u2019re young, it feels like it. We\u2019re at the top of our physical strength. And we can do so much and we can juggle so much and yeah, like, \u2018My career\u2019s just starting. I have my whole life ahead of myself. I\u2019m going to die when I\u2019m like 80 or 90. Nothing can stop me.\u2019 And I think it can be dangerous if one only thinks like this. Like, of course, have ambition absolutely. But to think that nothing can ever happen, that\u2019s scary because that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s simply not true. And yeah, I mean, so it\u2019s kind of crazy to think that I was someone else\u2019s, like a friend or a classmate\u2019s first cancer experience or first experience of taking a few steps closer to death. Looking at it, you know. I stared at death in the eye from my perspective and from my dad\u2019s perspective. And it\u2019s crazy that other people in the world right now might be thinking, \u2018Nothing matters right now. Nothing can happen to me. I\u2019m untouchable.\u2019 And, yeah, I don\u2019t know. Just it\u2019s kind of like bringing attention to this reality is important for me, because then that makes life more worth it. And it makes life more beautiful. And I was just talking to a friend today earlier about this, about how it\u2019s so important to live life to the fullest, as cheesy as that sounds. And I, it\u2019s survivor stories like mine and many others out in the world that help ground all of us, whether we\u2019ve gone through this kind of scary experiences, near-death experiences or not, it grounds us. And to be able to do it through music, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s great. And I don\u2019t want to sound preachy or anything, but it\u2019s just this is just where my life, my path has gone to. And I know that I can help others to be open and it especially helps me, too.\n\nJCR: So in terms of the visual stuff, I also have a very big love for visual art and just that medium. Because I also used to be really into photography and graphic design in high school. I was on the yearbook team and everything. And of course all songs and EP"}

(USC Annenberg Media/Sarah Arencibia)\n\nBy Alexandra Donovan and Sarah Arencibia\nOctober 11, 2023 at 9:34 am PDT\n\nDozens of USC students gathered on the lawn of the Gamma Phi Beta Sorority to celebrate World Mental Health Day this Tuesday. The USC Panhellenic community, a collective representing all USC sororities, hosted a resource fair and sound bath for students both in and out of Greek life. This fair partnered with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, Hillel, and WisdoMania, which are organizations at USC and in the LA area dedicated to mental health awareness and suicide prevention.\n\nThese organizations, namely Didi Hirsch, spread awareness about accessible ways to get involved with mental wellness practices and provide free resources that help students nurture their mental health, including providing education surrounding suicide prevention. \u201cOne of the things about Didi Hirsch is that it provides service to those who can\u2019t afford it....Where there is injustice in communities, Didi Hirsch will be there,\u201d said Bobby Narayan, a volunteer for Didi Hirsch.\n\nFor those struggling with their mental health, or those who have loved ones living with mental illnesses, organizations such as Didi Hirsch can provide places of refuge and community. After losing his dad to suicide, Narayan said \u201clife [looked] pretty bleak.\u201d He was in search of a supportive community he could lean on in his time of need and he found that in Didi Hirsch. Narayan is now a member of the organization\u2019s speaker\u2019s bureau and came out to Gamma Phi Beta\u2019s resource fair to represent Didi Hirsch and showcase the lifesaving work they do.\n\nDidi Hirsch partnered with Gamma Phi Beta on World Mental Health Day in aim of \u201c[having] a place on the lawn to let people know that someone is here to listen to whatever it is they may be going through, if they have a friend who\u2019s struggling with anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide....

Losing her mom to suicide in 2017, Ryan turned to organizations like Didi Hirsch and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, as they provided her a necessary support system.\n\nTaylor Ryan, 20, is an undergraduate student at USC majoring in NGOs and social change and is seen here at the resource fair she organized on the Gamma Phi Beta sorority house lawn in Los Angeles, Calif., Oct. 10, 2023. Ryan was inspired to host this event in acknowledgement of World Mental Health Awareness Day.\n\nRyan began volunteering for both organizations, creating the \u201cTeam Sabrina\u201d fundraising initiative to honor her mom\u2019s legacy and prevent others from suffering her mom\u2019s fate. Her work with these organizations is ultimately what led Ryan to her current role as the director of the Panhellenic Health and Wellness Council.\n\nThe motivation in hosting this resource fair was \u201cto make sure that our community [is] aware of this day, because mental health is important every single day, but days like this are really important in raising awareness because of the stigma around mental health,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nRyan is also focusing on mental health year round. As part of her work as the the director of the Panhellenic Health and Wellness Council, she hosts roundtables with the wellness representatives from every sorority. The goal of these round tables is to \u201cmake sure that they know how to lead individuals through making appointments with mental health services on campus or reaching out to any resources they need, as well as making sure they\u2019re up to date on the awareness events coming up,\u201d said Ryan.\n\n\u201cMy mission is that everybody at least knows that they should value their own wellness and that if they can\u2019t be well, it\u2019s going to be hard to support community wellness,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nRyan also invited USC\u2019s Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services to the resource fair, as she is very passionate about everyone having an avenue to feel seen and heard and to seek help. RSVP provides students at USC who have experienced sexual violence with resources and both legal and medical support.\n\nSince there have been several instances of sexual assault in Greek life at USC, Ryan said she thought it would be valuable to have the organization present at the resource fair.\n\nWidsoMania, one of the other organizations at the resource fair, led a sound bath to cap the evening\u2019s events. WisdoMania is a non-profit that offers unique mindfulness experiences, like the sound bath they organized at the resource fair, to schools and communities across Los Angeles.\n\nSound baths are a meditative practice that use the sound and vibration from instruments to reduce stress and provide a sense of relaxation to those listening. According to the Mayo Clinic, \u201cmeditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine and... can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind,... resulting in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cI very much love listening to frequencies and different music to calm my anxiety,\u201d said Ryan. Having been involved with mindfulness practices since losing her mom, Ryan has been a driving force in creating more welcoming and accessible mental health awareness spaces.\n\nAccording to Ryan, \u201cwellness is a new category you are starting to see in a lot of different places, workplace clubs, E-board, everything like that.... I would say not just in the Greek life community, but in all different realms, mental health awareness has gotten better...as a whole and in the Panhellenic community.\u201d\n\nThe role Ryan holds as the director of the Health and Wellness Council within the Panhellenic community is relatively new, as she is only the third person to hold the position.\n\n\u201cObviously we can\u2019t end mental health conditions, but I think it\u2019s really important that you start embracing mental health conversations with everybody around you, and [know] that those conversations are going to be harder sometimes than others, but they\u2019re also ongoing,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nRyan said she hopes that with her volunteer and advocacy work she encourages people to not only pay more attention to their mental health, but to proactively improve and nurture it, before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\u201cIf you are or you know someone who is struggling with thoughts of depression, anxiety, or ultimately even suicide, there is help. 988 is an easy way to reach out if you don\u2019t know where to go, because sometimes your family can\u2019t give you what you need, your friends can\u2019t give you what you need. Didi Hirsch [and organizations like it] provide a community and a really safe, non judgmental channel for help,\u201d said Narayan.\n\nThe Suicide & Crisis Hotline national number is 988. The service provides confidential support for anyone in emotional distress or in a suicide crisis. The hotline is available any hour of the day, every day of the week.\n```"}

Speakers at the vigil, organized by USC Hillel, USC Mishelanu, Chabad of USC and Trojans for Israel, expressed sorrow over the killings that targeted civilians.\n\nThe vigil included speakers, song and prayer as those participating embraced one another, shed tears, shared thoughts and expressed sorrow in solidarity with each other. Many donned blue and white clothes, and draped themselves in Israeli flags, in support of the people of Israel and victims of the attack. Speakers led the vigil in the Mourner\u2019s Kaddish, a prayer for the dead; a prayer for the state of Israel; as well as Mi Shebeirach, a prayer for healing.\n\nStudents such as master\u2019s student Eli Kia were gathering to commemorate lives lost. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people that have lost loved ones and lost friends. There are so many people that feel scared for their loved ones and friends. And so I\u2019m here to show support to my community and to show that an attack on any Jew is an attack on all Jews,\u201d Kia said.\n\nUSC Hillel Student president and senior Maya Grinstein shared her distress for those killed in the terrorist attacks. \u201cEveryday I wake up and I think that it\u2019s a dream, and then I am overcome with grief and emotion... It\u2019s just such a senseless tragedy that took place.\u201d Grinstein, through tears, voiced her anguish during the vigil because many of her family members and friends are currently hiding in bomb shelters. She said she\u2019s also horrified by the senseless violence on social media.\n\n\u201cWhen I open my phone and go on Instagram, I\u2019m not worried about the vitriol I might receive, I\u2019m not worried about the message of hate that I might stumble across,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried that someone in one of those videos might be my family.\u201d\n\nPartway through the vigil, a group of demonstrators in support of Palestine arrived across from Tommy Trojan and stood in silent recognition of those killed over the nearly 80 years of violence. The supporters held signs that read \u201cRemember them too,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re silent to represent the silence of the world.\u201d Most of their faces were obscured by masks.\n\n\u201cWe believe that all lives matter, including Israeli and Palestinian lives matter; however, we need to remember that this has been happening for 75 years and not just the past week,\u201d said Nour Myra, a junior international relations major. \u201cAll lives matter 100 percent, this is what we believe, and this is us saying remember them too.\u201d\n\nEzra Judanin, an Israeli student and senior attending the vigil also extended his thoughts for both Israelis and Palestinians. \u201cI just want everyone to know that my heart is with the Israeli people, the Israeli civilians, the innocent Israeli men, women, children and elderly that died over the past few days. My heart is also with the Palestinian people who have nothing to do with this or who are not part of Hamas and don\u2019t support Hamas in any way.\u201d\n\nHowever, Judanin did not feel that the pro-Palestine demonstrators had a place at the vigil, and expressed his dismay at their decision to attend while hiding their identities. Judanin was part of a group that called for the silent demonstrators to take off their masks as they departed.\n\nAccording to a statement from DPS, the university notified officers before the vigil that the silent pro-Palestinian demonstration would take place. \u201cBoth demonstrations were successful. It was peaceful. No arrests were made, and no one was injured,\u201d said DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle. \u201cThat makes it a good night.\u201d\n\nDave Cohn, Executive Director for USC Hillel expressed his thankfulness for a newly released statement on President Carol Folt\u2019s Instagram, posted just an hour before the vigil, that explicitly condemned the actions of Hamas. The updated statement on the terrorist attacks amended an earlier announcement which did not name Hamas at all, drawing widespread scrutiny from the USC community.\n```"}

The Trojans, who finally ousted the unranked Wildcats 43-41 in triple overtime, are more focused on the path ahead.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re set up to play really well the second half of the season,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said at Tuesday\u2019s practice. \u201cAnd I can promise you, inside these walls, there is no expectation other than to play at a high level here in the second half of this year.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s victory at the Coliseum was hard-fought for the Trojans, who didn\u2019t score at all in the first quarter. Arizona put up 10 points in the first, and an early second-quarter score made it a 17-0 lead. It was an unusual outing for USC, who trailed in a game for the first time this season.\n\n\u201cGoing into this next week, we\u2019ll look at some things and possibly do some check-ins,\u201d defensive coordinator Alex Grinch said. \u201cAnd on the other side of this, guys gotta step up.\u201d\n\nDefense was an issue for USC last year, and it seemed to be resolving itself earlier in the season. However, the team has given up over 40 points in its last two games. The unit ranks 109th in the nation in total defense and 120th in red zone defense.\n\n\u201cYou see periods of lack of trust,\u201d Grinch said about the team\u2019s defensive play. \u201cOne of the things we highlight is the trust element in themselves.\u201d\n\nRiley seemed generally unfazed by the Trojans\u2019 defensive performance this weekend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hiding from the areas that we\u2019ve got to continue to make improvements in, and there certainly are some,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is a much improved unit, there\u2019s no question about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal: everybody in the media had their mind made up,\u201d Riley continued. \u201cA lot of people in the media had their mind made up that the first second there was any adversity this year, it was like, \u2018Oh my god, they should\u2019ve done this and they should\u2019ve made this change and blah, blah, blah,\u2019 and it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nJunior safety Jaylin Smith was also outspoken about USC\u2019s defensive unit and the criticism they\u2019ve received this season. He emphasized the team\u2019s consistent focus on the week to come.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t see,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re working every day. I trust my defense; I trust all eleven guys on the field.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will need that trust to carry them through this upcoming Saturday\u2019s matchup against Notre Dame (5-2). The Fighting Irish dropped 11 spots in the AP poll to No. 21 in the nation after their loss to Louisville this past weekend, but USC is still taking the week extremely seriously.\n\nThe rivalry between the two teams started in 1926, and their matchups are fiercely competitive.\n\n\u201c[Notre Dame has] a very good defense, and it feels like they\u2019ve been energized a little bit,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThey\u2019re a good football team, a very complete football team playing at a very high level defensively.\u201d\n\nUSC seems confident looking toward the second half of the season. The Trojans still have several Pac-12 rivals to face, including Washington and Oregon. Those two teams are ranked No. 7 and No. 8 in the nation, respectively. USC is No. 10, down in the rankings for the third consecutive week.\n\nThe Trojans play at Notre Dame this Saturday at 4:30 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Fatima Shbair for AP)\n\nBy Ethan Huang, Isa Johnson, Nicki Berelson, Erick Trevino, Marie Louise Leone, Estelle Atkinson and Amrita Vora October 10, 2023 at 7:19 pm PDT\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas, a militant political group, escalated this week after Hamas issued an organized attack against Israel on Saturday during the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War and the Jewish festival of Sukkot. Israel launched retaliatory attacks on the Gaza Strip and closed off the borders, limiting civilian access to food and water, which U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk says is against international law.\n\nItay Raviv is a citizen of Israel. For him, this conflict meant an attack directly on his family. Itay Raviv: Five family members of my family. They live in Kibbutz Nir Oz, which is also right on the border. And the connection with them was lost on Sunday morning around the time of 8-9 a.m. after everything, it started at 6:30 a.m. with the missiles... We thought up until today that all of them were [captured] and were abducted by Hamas into Gaza. It turns out, their speculation might have been true, as they received word from members of the village that one of his relatives was recently killed in the conflict. Raviv: So today we found out that Roee was actually murdered by Hamas, and he was found shot to death on the ground, in the kibbutz.\n\nBut beyond the borders of Israel and Palestine, people in the affected communities feel pain, confusion, and grief. Members of Jewish, Israeli and Palestinian communities in the US share their stories about the conflict and their reaction to it. Benjamin Shiff, USC alumni and former president of Chabad at USC says there is comfort in seeing the Jewish community come together in response. Benjamin Shiff: It\u2019s tough that it\u2019s happening for something so tragic. The silver lining is that it has been powerful to see this community, and specifically different factions of our L.A. Jewish community and USC Jewish community coming together during such tough times.\n\nMeanwhile, for Palestinian Americans, the recent news has hit close to home. Sarah Ali, who requested to use a pseudonym, comes from a Palestinian background. Her family once experienced the authoritarian takeover of Palestine by Israel. Sarah Ali: My grandparents were born in Palestine, both born before 1948. So, they were both expelled, and my grandfather lived in a refugee camp. My grandmother was kicked out of her home, and just hearing their stories, that just radicalized me, and I didn\u2019t need for someone to tell me anything else.\n\nTo Ali, the branding of Hamas as \u201cterrorists\u201d is incredibly subjective and doesn\u2019t agree with its classification. Ali: If you\u2019re going to call Hamas terrorists, you should call the U.S. military terrorists, because if you really look at what the U.S. military has done in the past, even 20 years. That\u2019s terrorism, in my opinion.\n\nAnd this complexity of wording and labeling has major effects when it comes to the conversations here in the U.S., says Shiff. Shiff: We\u2019re dealing with people here and people\u2019s lives and in death and destruction. The same way that. Now, Palestinians aren\u2019t necessarily represented by Hamas. Israelis aren\u2019t represented by the Israeli government. And there\u2019s innocent lives, so many innocent lives.\n\nAt the moment, it seems that this is just start, as Raviv looks into an uncertain future. Raviv: I consider myself pro-Palestinian. I support two states... I always talked about not hurting innocent people and not hurting innocent Palestinians... Personally, I believe it has to end with some sort of agreement with Palestinians, with someone. But as of now, as of right now, we\u2019re at war.

The seat he is competing for has been left empty since the passing of former Senator Dianne Feinstein two weeks ago. At the time of her passing, Feinstein was the oldest member of Congress and had served her role since 1992.\n\nGarvey, a Republican who played first base for the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, is likely to face an extremely difficult campaign as he works to fill a seat that has been occupied by a Democrat for more than 30 years. He represents just the latest in a string of celebrities who have recently attempted to run for office.\n\nLast December, former NFL star Herschel Walker lost a very competitive election to current Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock. During the 2020 election, former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville flipped an Alabama Senate seat. The trend goes beyond the state, to federal elections as well.

This was not the first time that a television show or movie commented on celebrities in politics. The 1985 movie Back to the Future had commentary on the trend. Reagan was a Hollywood actor turned president, who began the trend we see today. Reagan\u2019s presidential win as well as Trump\u2019s are examples of celebrity success in running for and securing public office.\n\nGarvey has his work cut out for him, according to USC Professor of Political Science and Public Policy Christian Grose, who gave a written statement.

This $51 on average was broken down by researchers into four main costs. $16 for lunch, $14 for commuting, $13 for breakfast and coffee, and $8 for parking.\n\nWe talked to USC students to find out how much they spend while they\u2019re on campus. Junior Max Kranzler talked about how living far from campus can be a challenge when it comes to saving money on food.\n\nMax Kranzler: It probably ranges from, you know, like as little as like maybe $15 if I\u2019m just like, grabbing a star, maybe I\u2019m grabbing a Starbucks, I\u2019m grabbing like a little booster snack to $50 if I have to if I\u2019m buying on all three meals that I eat... You know, I cook a lot, but I am also not a computer student, but I do live kind of far. I live on 37th drive, so it\u2019s like a few blocks away. So I can\u2019t be in between classes, I can\u2019t go back home and cook and then come back and then make it in time. So I find that I also really have to spend money on the food they have here.\n\nHowever, commuter students, such a senior Gabby Poli, had to account for transportation costs when traveling to class.\n\nGabby Poli: I have not calculated it, but I commute, so I actually don\u2019t I don\u2019t pay for gas. So because I, I drive a Tesla. So that has cut down my costs. But last year, when I was spending money on gas, I was spending a crazy amount of money.

I spend about 15 a day because I\u2019m really trying to save money... So big because of the cost of U.S. I do primarily eat at the dining halls because with my meal plan that I\u2019m already paying for, it\u2019s it\u2019s free. I mean, I\u2019m paying for it, but it\u2019s not an additional cost every day. So I purely eat at the dining halls and try to refrain from buying food just because I\u2019m already paying for food. So I might as well be that food.\n\nYeah. Well there you have it, it seems that many USC students spend the same amount of money on campus as the average working class employee in the office, without the cost of transportation unless you are a commuter.

Co-president of the fashion industry association Simone Brown had an interesting take on the possible trend.\n\nSimone Brown: I think that\u2019s entirely possible, especially because there are other brands like Adidas or Nike, which aren\u2019t necessarily big houses, but other bigger well-known brands that have kind of moved into the field of designing sports clothes or you might see like racing jackets or any of those kinds of things that are made for functionality in sport, that are now made by designer brands and fashion brands. So I think that could definitely be a movement there.\n\nWho knows what is next?

The Olympics is such a such a big global event in the United States. It\u2019s going to be the number one show on television for two and a half weeks around the world. Millions, if not billions of people are going to tune in, which can be just a great platform for these burgeoning sports to grow.\n\nRubinroit also knows that if these sports do get approved, that the coverage of the events not only spotlight the athletes but spotlight the sports as whole.\n\nRubinroit: It\u2019ll be a big educational thing, too. I think that, you know, I think that that half of that is just, you know, at NBC is going to be incumbent on us to educate the audience on, you know, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve done a great job of introducing people to figure skating that they\u2019re watch figure skating before. And I think the same thing\u2019s going to be need to happen with with , you know, cricket as well and even, you know, lacrosse to some extent.\n\nWith the proposal already sent out, it\u2019s only a matter of time before a decision is made. If the proposal goes through, it\u2019ll undergo another approval session in Mumbai, India later this month. Who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll play some squash after the 2028 Olympics.\n```"}

Based in Brussels, she recently returned from Ukraine where she reported on life in the country\u2019s near-empty border towns in the wake of Russian shelling and President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s advocacy for holding elections despite the practical difficulties inhibiting civilians and soldiers from voting, to name a few.\n\nI was able to speak with Preve last night, as the sun rose in Italy, where she is currently staying with her grandmother. She said that the decision to go to Ukraine wasn\u2019t an easy one, and her editors at the Sun had some hesitations\n\nClara Preve-Durrieu: And that was maybe the reason why many journalists are not going to Ukraine right now, you know. The counter-offensive is just going very slow. Rather than prioritizing breaking news coverage, she said many journalists are embarking on feature stories instead.\n\nThe other main reason for the hesitancy was Preve\u2019s own safety.\n\nClara Preve-Durrieu: My editor, he\u2019s been in the newspaper business for many years. But he always says, even though I send a lot of foreign correspondents to the war, it\u2019s never easy. And I understand.\n\nNevertheless, she got the go-ahead. Now, she had to get it from the Ukrainian government as well.\n\nClara Preve-Durrieu: He accepted, he approved of my request, and then it took another month to get my accreditation. Accreditation for Ukraine is really, really slow. They want to check absolutely everything of that person to make sure they\u2019re not a Russian mole or something.\n\nOnce on the ground, the government continues to monitor all accredited journalists. There are specific rules that all press have to follow, such as making sure that their coverage isn\u2019t revealing military locations.\n\nClara Preve-Durrieu: They check absolutely everything that you post, every picture that you take and every video that you\u2019re taking. And if it violates any of the rules, you immediately get suspended.\n\nPreve recounted a time when she stopped to report from a gas station that had been destroyed.\n\nClara Preve-Durrieu: This truck of militars, the soldiers, came over, and we just started talking. And I made a video, and they were like no, no you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t show this gas station. Even though I thought it was impossible for anyone to realize what gas station it was, but no, you can\u2019t actually show absolutely anything.\n\nAs she traveled the country, passing through accreditation checkpoints and meeting more and more Ukrainian people, Preve said she was struck by one thing in particular.\n\nClara Preve-Durrieu: It was fascinating. It was one of the things that I take with me, you know. The generosity of the Ukrainian people when it comes to sharing not only the material stuff such as hazelnuts, but also their story.\n\nThe hazelnuts she mentioned were a gift from a local police officer in a border town who, despite Preve\u2019s resistance, insisted on sharing his food with her.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Estelle Atkinson.\n```"}

With potential new Olympic sports, you might have a chance at being the next famed Olympian. During the International Olympic Committee meeting on Monday, organizers proposed adding squash, cricket, baseball and softball, lacrosse and flag football to the LA 2028 Olympics lineup.\n\nFrom ancient Greece to present day, the Olympic games are evolving every four years and redefining the Olympic standards. To the first Olympians of ancient Greece, flag football may have been an outlier amongst power sports like javelin throwing, jumping and foot racing. Fast forward to the 21st century, and many USC students are in full support of watching people chaotically run around a field and rip colored flags from their opponents waist.\n\n\u201cI think that would definitely be a really interesting change for the Olympics, considering that it\u2019s such a traditional sporting event and bringing in something like flag football would probably have a lot of controversy,\u201d said Hannah Rotchschild, a freshman studying cognitive science. \u201cBut I think it could be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nThe first modern Olympics in 1896 welcomed classic sports like track and field, swimming, gymnastics, weight lifting, wrestling, fencing, cycling and tennis. As time moves forward, the traditional games still exist, but there is also more opportunity to broaden the definition of sport and what it means to be an athlete in the present day.\n\n\u201cIt does legitimize certain sports that I think for a long time have had very healthy fan bases and healthy infrastructures where this a lot of room for growth for an athlete,\u201d said Fernando Hurtado, an Annenberg professor specializing in digital journalism.\n\nIn order to be invited to the ceremonies, flag football and other candidates are considered under five criteria with multiple subdivisions \u2014 Olympic proposal, value added to the Olympic movement, institutional matters, popularity and business model. One of the concerns for sports such as flag football is whether or not there are enough countries and athletes to participate to make the games competitive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a bunch of time abroad, and I know what people know about American football,\u201d said Charles Hastings, a junior studying English literature. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that they\u2019re completely in the dark on. Same goes for lacrosse and softball.\u201d\n\nThe NFL is one of the communities pushing for flag football to take the Olympic field because it is such an all-inclusive sport and is played in more than 100 countries. The sport is becoming a favorite for all ages and genders and not just in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit more inclusive because it allows people who don\u2019t want to be in contact sports to be in the Olympics still and do sports like flag football or what not, because it\u2019s also just a safer way of doing things,\u201d said Antonio McVeigh, a freshman on the USC flag football team. \u201cNot everyone wants to be tackled around or hit, sometimes some flag pulls are enough for somebody.\u201d\n\nAmong many rules to become an Olympic game, the Britannica notes the sport must increase the \u201cvalue and appeal\u201d of the games and maintain its modern traditions. The new shift in games is definitely favoring entertainment, checking off appealing to a crowd and bolstering the community.\n\n\u201cWe also have to think about it from a production and TV media standpoint. And these also just make excellent TV as well. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary that the standard is changing. I think it certainly does move with the trends and kind of what we\u2019re seeing in the world today,\u201d Hurtado said.\n```"}

It\u2019s easy to get lost in the midst of responsibilities and busy schedules that are intrinsic to student life. However, with World Mental Health Day on Tuesday, experts emphasize that it\u2019s important to remember and value personal needs beyond the realm of academics.\n\nThroughout the year \u2014 especially during midterm season \u2014 striking a balance between work and personal life proves difficult. Some students feel they have just begun adjusting to their new surroundings and duties in the middle of the semester, like sophomore and electrical engineering major Marceline Lalama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited because I\u2019m more committed now,\u201d she said. \u201cI started school, I was like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t wanna be here. I still want summer.\u2019 But now I\u2019m halfway through the semester, I just got my head in the game.\u201d\n\nBut there are ways to combat the stresses of life and convert it into something productive. Although unique and tailored to every individual, there are some basic habits most students can abide by. For chemistry Ph.D. student Jingyi Ran, it helps to \u201ccome to the village in the afternoon to have some sun, talk to my friends, and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dr. Sarah Van Orman, vice president and chief campus health officer at USC, reconnecting with friends, nature, and more can alleviate mental health struggles.\n\n\u201cBut use this time to try something new, go out, explore Los Angeles a little bit, go somewhere you haven\u2019t gone before, or just stay in and sleep, get some physical exercise, get outside, spend some time taking care of yourself, maybe trying something new,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cBe with friends, we have a long semester ahead of us.\u201d\n\nPhysical symptoms of stress can also guide students to take a break and be in tune to one\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cI feel like my body sends me signals,\u201d Ran said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not doing well, I have headaches, and I eat a ton or don\u2019t have any appetite and stuff like that. When those kind of signals come up, I will start to go to bed earlier.\u201d\n\nAlthough work life is important and encouraged amongst a student body of intelligent and determined people, it is truly important to take a step back.\n\n\u201cSometimes I talk to students who are like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna get caught up on all my work,\u2019 which can certainly be a valuable thing to do,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cBut I encourage people to take at least some time, at least a day off, to take care of yourself, to reconnect and recharge before we go into the rest of the semester.\u201d\n```"}

In one of the most expensive states to live in, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond focused heavily on the necessity of paid internships for teenagers and young adults in California. According to Thurmond, there are 200,000 homeless students and 10,000 living on their own, and some families are \u201cslipping into poverty.\u201d For many people in California, unpaid internships are not financially possible, limiting their career opportunities. \u201cWe want them to have access to a career, a trajectory that gives them a great life,\u201d Thurmond said at Tuesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cSometimes they struggle and they need dollars in their pocket.\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who joined the summit via Zoom, pointed to $53 million from CalVolunteers that will connect 4,000 young people to jobs and training by May 1, 2024. This, she said, is a crucial part of supporting working class and underprivileged young people. According to Ben Chida, a representative for Governor Gavin Newsom, there will also be $83 million in new permanent annual funding for CalVolunteers operations statewide. Thurmond said that though \u201cschool is at the center of what we do,\u201d the state wants to support students wherever they are, which means providing career advisement, counseling, and housing as well. He applauded the work of various organizations who have been active in this, but said \u201cwe can do more when we shoulder the load together.\u201d For many students at USC, internships are an essential step in pursuing a career. Oliver Leinberger, a freshman majoring in cognitive science, said he hoped to get an internship because \u201cthe lessons you can learn from that kind of experience are unique to internships.\u201d At the same time, roughly two-thirds of students receive financial aid, and whether an internship is paid or unpaid can play a key role in whether a student can get that unique experience. \u201cI\u2019ve done two internships \u2014 both were paid,\u201d said Megan Maclay, a senior studying business. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done unpaid internships.

A study released on Monday found that temperatures are increasing and heat waves are becoming \u201cmore frequent, intense, and longer-lasting due to climate change.\u201d With climate change deniers and skeptics on environmental issues occupying both the political and social space, reporters must be smart in covering these kinds of topics.\n\nFor Los Angeles Times environmental reporter Hayley Smith, one smart and impactful trait in stories when reporting on climate change is the people. \u201cTalk to the people who are impacted by whatever you are covering,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo if it\u2019s a heat wave, try to get those real human stories in there as well, because I think that sharing the story of an individual whose home burned down can show the truth and help tell the broader story of climate change and the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nSmith covers climate change in California and found herself in environmental reporting because to her climate change is \u201cthe story of our lifetimes\u201d and requires compassion. \u201cI think that you should approach environmental reporting just like any type of reporting with compassion because unfortunately, all these challenges have real consequences for human beings, but also ecosystems and biodiversity,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere are real losses here and there\u2019s grief, and so just keeping your humanity about you as you cover these difficult topics will help you be a better reporter and tell the full story.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that when telling the full story, reporters should know how to handle misconceptions and misinformation. \u201cThis \u2018both sides\u2019 in climate change does not exist, because that\u2019s like saying the \u2018earth is flat\u2019 has two sides,\u201d said Brooke Staggs, environment reporter for the Orange County Register. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a gray area, then take time to dispute the misinformation. Just remember to never entertain things that are false for too long, because it can be harmful for the readers.\u201d\n\nAnother tip that Staggs mentions is to not make everything about climate change when more reporting would point to a separate issue. \u201cA little word of caution in being aware of how prevalent climate change is within a situation being reported on \u2014 make sure you take the time to speak to experts and discover more information on a situation like a fire,\u201d Staggs said. \u201cBecause if you keep making climate change the main cause of a problem, when it\u2019s only a component, then readers will start to dismiss it.\u201d\n\nAn example of this is the Maui fire, though outlets stated it was due to climate change, it was discovered to be compound disasters, both natural and human-caused.\n\nAllison Agsten, the director of the Center for Climate Journalism and Communication at USC, aims to create programs for student journalists to better engage readers. \u201cIt\u2019s important to not solely tell doom and gloom stories when writing about climate change, but also write about solutions,\u201d Agsten said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean writing about solutions without a critical eye towards those solutions but offering potential alternatives to create engagement with the public.\u201d\n\nAgsten said learning about climate change would be beneficial to student reporters, though courses are not required. \u201cI think it would be great if all students had a greater grounding of climate change, what it is, how it is now and what we can do,\u201d Agsten said.\n\nFor journalists or anyone interested in learning more about reporting on climate change, the Center for Climate Journalism and Communication will host \u201cResearch to Reality: How to Refute Climate Change Misinformation,\u201d on Nov. 7 at noon on Zoom.\n```"}

USC FIA began hosting their fashion fairs in the fall semester of 2022. Originally, the organization invited five to six vendors to the USC Village via the organization\u2019s outreach team found at local flea markets in the area. Since then, the fair has risen in popularity largely due to the friendships amongst the vendors, according to FIA Co-President Simone Brown, a senior majoring in communications.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all a very tight knit group,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThey\u2019re friends with each other. So when they started coming here and having a good experience here, they started telling their friends to apply and now we get up to about 80 applications every time.\u201d\n\nBrown explained that choosing vendors for the FIA fashion fairs is a mix between returning vendors and new vendors. Typically, if the association receives great feedback on style or prices about specific vendors, they invite them back to return. One of the vendors, run by Garbiela Arias and her mother, started their business 20 years ago and sells Latin inspired and vintage pieces dating back to the 1960s.\n\n\u201cVintage right now is such a thing,\u201d Arias said. \u201cA lot of students have appreciated what we have.\u201d\n\nThe FIA also invites new vendors to the fairs to provide a more diverse selection of styles and products. The qualifications for every vendor is based on affordability, accessibility and diversity in their clothing.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that when [students are] shopping here, they have accessibility to clothes they actually can purchase, but we also want to make sure that there\u2019s diversity of choices,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve had people selling jewelry, rings, waist beads, other things that they hand make hand sewn purses and bags and hats. So there\u2019s a wide variety as well of firsthand creations and secondhand shopping.\u201d\n\nKaitlyn Hajj, a sophomore at USC, explained why she enjoys the fashion fair.\n\n\u201cI just love the style of the vintage clothes here,\u201d she said. \u201cI shop mainly secondhand \u2014 it\u2019s all of my wardrobe basically, like 90% is thrifted or from like a flea. So I just love the styles here.\u201d\n\nThe impact of thrifting on the environment is also a driving factor of her shopping habits.\n\n\u201cI think that fast fashion puts workers under terrible conditions. It\u2019s awful. Like, because of the manufacturer\u2019s carbon emissions,\u201d said Hajj. \u201cOn top of that, I just feel like the quality of clothes and the style, but like, isn\u2019t even that good.\u201d\n\nHowever, USC FIA has not been able to receive a specific recurring date that they are able to host their fashion fairs. It is a struggle in communicating with students who ask when the next fair will be, as well as scheduling vendors to arrive on campus at a certain time. Usually vendors camp out at a spot while waiting for the event to start at flea markets such as the Rose Bowl Flea Market and the Los Feliz Flea Market. At USC, they\u2019re required to wait till 10:45 a.m. before they can head to a spot and quickly set up for 11 a.m.\n\nStudents or vendors interested in selling at their next fashion fair can sign up through the link in the group\u2019s Instagram account.\n```"}

Newsom spoke to this issue in a press release coinciding with the bill\u2019s signature.\n\n\u201cThis particular bag of candy comes from the European Union \u2014 a place that already bans a number of chemical additives and colorants,\u201d Newsom said in the press release. \u201cThis is demonstrable proof that the food industry is capable of maintaining product lines while complying with different public health laws.\u201d\n\nOther foods, such as Peeps, Little Bites muffins and protein shakes also include these additives. Andy Perez, a USC senior majoring in accounting, said he isn\u2019t on board with being told what he can or can\u2019t eat.\n\n\u201cI eat a lot of these products on a daily basis,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI feel like people should be able to choose if they want to eat them or not.\u201d\n\nGracelyn Glebke, a sophomore majoring in psychology, expressed similar concerns but understood the purpose of the change.\n\n\u201cSure, this sucks, but I also think this ban is valid,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously these types of foods are artificial \u2014 I don\u2019t think anyone is eating them to benefit their health. So I think if people are just made aware of health concerns, then they can choose for themselves if they want to buy the product or not.\u201d\n\nAny food affected by the incoming additive ban will have time to reformulate their recipe, and in result, avoid removal from shelves. Many variances of these products already exist. The international variants of popular soda brands and candy have already removed the problematic flavorings since bans in other countries already stand.\n\nConsumer Reports, a nonprofit organization that works on independent product testing, joined many other activist organizations in support of the legislature. Brian Ronholm, the director of food policy at the organization, said the bill will improve health statewide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for years that the toxic chemicals banned under California\u2019s landmark new law pose serious risks to our health,\u201d Ronholm told Consumer Reports. \u201cBy keeping these dangerous chemicals out of food sold in the state, this groundbreaking law will protect Californians and encourage manufacturers to make food safer for everyone.\u201d```"}

The event was paneled by journalists from Roll Call, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe 2024 election cycle features the fiercest California Senate race in more than 30 years. With Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s deteriorating health in the public eye, competition for the seat had started well before her passing last week. Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter and Adam Schiff have emerged as the top contenders, and have been campaigning actively since early this year.\n\nThe trio addressed 20 questions in total, including inquiries about healthcare policies, minimum wage, the Israel-Palestine conflict and a potential Laphonza Butler campaign, Newsom\u2019s interim replacement to finish out Feinstein\u2019s Senate term.\n\nHealthcare policies and minimum wage\n\nAll three candidates expressed full support for protecting civil liberties and expanding the benefits for healthcare workers. Porter\u2019s campaign is centered on standing up to big corporations and protecting consumer interests. She advocated for the \u201cstrongest civil rights protections possible\u201d and said, \u201cWashington should reset the rules.\u201d\n\nRep. Schiff called for addressing the problems with healthcare policies and developing metrics to better assess what is working and what is not. Lee suggested families are critical in health crises and should be engaged in \u201cidentifying mental stress.\u201d\n\nAll candidates supported raising the minimum wage. Lee, when asked to provide a specific amount, proposed $50 an hour. Schiff referred to his working-class father and suggested $25. Porter proposed $20 per hour as the federal minimum wage and $25 for California, though she said wages should be indexed to inflation.\n\nAll three Representatives used this section to reach out to younger voters. Schiff encouraged the growth of a younger healthcare workforce by calling for forgiving student debt, raising educators\u2019 salaries, and training healthcare workers. Porter said the government should \u201cpay them more,\u201d and said the nation \u201cwill have a mental health system [that it needs] if we treat mental health workers with respect.\u201d Lee echoed her colleagues\u2019 support for healthcare workers.\n\nSenate Bill 799\n\nGov. Newsom vetoed SB 799 last week, which would have given striking workers access to unemployment benefits. Poised in front of a union that represents more than 16,000 healthcare workers, each candidate said they disagreed with Newsom\u2019s decision.\n\nLee began with a salute to labor unions and California\u2019s charge on the labor movement, and said striking workers have a right to unemployment benefits, \u201cYou get what you paid in,\u201d she said. Schiff plugged his legislation that aims to provide unemployment compensation for striking workers, saying, \u201cWe need to make sure that the working people are protected.\u201d He also called for solutions to make contract bargaining easier and more enforceable.\n\n\u201cNobody should go hungry for using their legal rights to better themselves and better our entire country\u2019s economy,\u201d said Porter, adding, \u201cGovernor Newsom was wrong here.\u201d She said there should be protections for workers who have voted to unionize but have not yet reached a contract deal.\n\nLaphonza Butler\n\nThe panel asked the candidates whether Sen. Butler should join the Senate race and if they thought she would. The candidates welcomed the prospect of a Butler campaign. All three said they would remain committed to the race no matter Butler\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cCompetitive elections are the heart of democracy,\u201d said Porter. Butler is the former president of a branch of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). In 2019, she advised Uber on how to avoid classifying its drivers as employees.\n\nWhen asked if this record would affect her in the race for Senate, the candidates avoided taking a stance. Lee said \u201cIt is important to have all of [their] records laid out in front of the voters\u201d and to let the people decide. Schiff took the same route and did not directly say how Butler\u2019s history would impact her campaign.\n\nPorter kicked the ball to Butler\u2019s court, saying, \u201cSenator Butler now has the opportunity to show Californians where she stands on the issue.\u201d She offered positive regard for Butler\u2019s past experiences with union workers and said she is \u201cexcited\u201d to see how Butler would create more high-paying union jobs for California.\n\nPaychecks during government shutdown\n\nIn a question submitted by a NUHW member, the panel asked the candidates to share whether they believe members of Congress should continue to receive pay during a complete government shutdown.\n\nLee began by saying everyone in government should follow the \u201csame rules\u201d as employees on furlough and said she would \u201ccertainly\u201d support a change in the current rules. Other federal employees do not have this same protection and will not be paid during a shutdown. However, they will receive back pay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 once the shutdown is lifted.\n\nSchiff claimed he wrote to the House amid the potential shutdown to request they withhold his pay until other federal employees received their paychecks. \u201cI don\u2019t think members of Congress should be paid while federal employees and others are going without a paycheck,\u201d he said.\n\nPorter did not follow suit. Instead, she said there should be a better structure for how federal employees are paid so future shutdowns do not force federal workers to rely on \u201cfood banks,\u201d and that Congress members should not be added to the list. She said Congress members supporting their withheld paychecks reflects their privilege.\n\nPorter added her paycheck goes toward her mortgage and groceries. \u201cDoes my kid going to bed with an empty stomach ease the pain of everybody else\u2019s?\u201d she said, later adding \u201cI am proud to be a member of Congress who lives on their paycheck.\u201d\n\nIsrael-Palestine conflict\n\nHamas militants surprise-attacked the Gaza Strip Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on Hamas. The candidates all condemned the attacks on Israel.\n\nAdam Schiff likened the bombing to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and said he stands \u201cshoulder to shoulder with the Israeli people.\u201d Porter also voiced support for Israel and condemned the loss of life on both sides.\n\nPorter placed blame on the US for allowing \u201cterrorism to flourish\u201d by refusing to take a strong stand against Iran but warned against a repetition of the anti-Muslim hatred that followed the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\u201cI have always stood for Israel,\u201d said Lee, who said she calls for a ceasefire. Lee has also supported H.R. 2590, legislation that would place restrictions on US aid to Israel to ensure the funds are not used to detain Palestinian children.\n\nTerm limits for office\n\nPorter is fairly new to Congress and is currently on her second term as a House member. Schiff is in his 12th term and Lee is serving out her 13th term. When asked if they supported term limits, Porter did not offer an affirmative answer.\n\n\u201cThe American people have told us again and again that they want diverse leadership,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThey want an America that looks like them.\u201d She stressed this means Congress should include multigenerational leadership, incorporating both experienced and newer members into government leadership.\n\nSchiff said he does not support term limits for Congress and instead attributed long Congressional terms to gerrymandering. Schiff said he supports imposing term limits for the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe life tenure of a Supreme Court Justice has led to their arrogance,\u201d he said.\n\nLee said she also does not support term limits on Congressmembers, stating it would take away from the American people\u2019s right to vote for who they want. She agreed the Supreme Court should have term limits and be expanded.\n\nJabs at Republicans\n\nThe panel asked if the candidates had a preferred Republican successor to former Speaker McCarthy. Lee said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not have a preference. She added, \u201cThis is a civil war\u201d between the Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLee said the House should elect Hakeem Jeffries as the Speaker if they want to work in a bipartisan fashion. Porter shared Lee\u2019s stance. She did not have a favorite Republican to take over the Speaker gavel because there is no Republican who supports abortion rights, making all of them \u201cunacceptable\u201d to her.\n\nSchiff directly prodded the former president, saying, \u201cCertainly not Donald Trump,\u201d and joked his endorsement would probably not help any of the Republicans. However, Schiff praised Jeffries as being able to \u201cdo people\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nAttendee and union member Leemore Federman viewed Schiff as someone willing to work with the Republicans to \u201cget things done\u201d and \u201cpass legislation.\u201d\n\nThe NUHW endorsement, based solely on the vote of union members, will be announced on Wednesday, October 11.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/10/pac-12-power-rankings-the-fallacy-of-the-transitive-property/", "response": "```\nPac-12 Power Rankings: The fallacy of the transitive property\n\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. Early on in a college football season, it is easiest to evaluate teams by use of the transitive property. If A is greater than B, and B is greater than C, then A must be greater than C. Likewise, ranking the middle of the Pac-12 conference seemed fairly simple when Washington State beat Oregon State, who beat Utah, who beat UCLA. Obviously, this means that the Cougars are better than the Bruins, right? Well, after UCLA took down WSU at home, deciphering the true pecking order of the second tier of this conference just became a completely chaotic task. Yet, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do. Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n1. Oregon Ducks (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nWith Oregon getting set to battle Washington in Seattle this Saturday, this is the final week that choosing the best team in college football\u2019s best conference will be this dramatic. Both the Ducks and the Huskies enjoyed bye weeks ahead of their biggest matchup of the season, so there is no reason for me to change my opinion from a week ago. As a summary from Week 6, I believe Oregon is the most well-rounded team in this conference. Only one team in the country has both a top five scoring offense and a top five scoring defense. Its average margin of victory is just a tad under 40 points per game. The Ducks have been a dominant force at Autzen Stadium as usual, already have a decent road win against Texas Tech and look like the team to beat this season. Their upcoming stretch against three opponents currently in the AP Top 25, with two games on the road, will prove if Dan Lanning\u2019s team has the mettle to push for a berth in the College Football Playoff.\n\n2. Washington Huskies (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nNo Washington fan should consider this ranking a slight against the Huskies in any way. I have been startlingly impressed about how good Oregon has been to start conference play, and Washington could not jump past them with both teams on a bye week. I still think this offense is more than capable of scoring with the Ducks, but I am not certain that the team\u2019s defense is quite ready to get the big stop when it needs it. The Huskies\u2019 pass defense and run defense is below average by Pac-12 standards in yards per game, and Oregon has the personnel to exploit those weaknesses and turn them into big scoring days. On the other hand, Washington has not lost a game in its own building since 2021 with 10 consecutive victories. Home field advantage is one of the biggest factors in any big college football matchup, and with the gap this thin between these two teams, it may be the difference between winning and losing.\n\n3. USC Trojans (6-0, 4-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nWhile USC has looked lackluster for three consecutive games now, there is no way I could justify dropping the Trojans below a team that already has a loss on its schedule. That being said, the gap between second and third in these rankings widened over the weekend, not because I saw anything new from Oregon or Washington, but because I watched more USC. It is one thing to struggle in hostile road environments like Arizona and Colorado and show weaknesses, but it\u2019s another thing entirely to look as sloppy as the Trojans did in their return to the Coliseum. It\u2019s easy to place all the blame upon defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s defense that failed to get the game-clinching stop in the fourth quarter, but USC fans have come to expect a lot more from this offense than they saw on Saturday. The Trojan offensive line looked overwhelmed and receivers did not get open, a pretty good recipe for Caleb Williams to complete under 60% of his passes and get sacked four times. USC\u2019s 28 regulation points were its fewest scored in a game Caleb Williams was healthy since September 2022. Everyone can look at their roster and recognize that the Trojans have talent, but winning a conference championship requires a lot more than that. USC has not played a really strong football game in about a month, begging the question: is this team underperforming, or is this what USC is?\n\n4. Washington State Cougars (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nYes, despite the fact that Washington State \u2013 who looked like a Pac-12 dark horse coming into the weekend \u2013 lost an ugly game to UCLA, I am keeping the team at four. At the end of the day, the Cougars had built up more equity with me in the leadup to this game to get one mulligan at the Rose Bowl. Their wins against Wisconsin and Oregon State still look solid, and, despite a 17 point showing on Saturday, the offense is still averaging 40 points per game. If there is one thing that will doom WSU down the stretch if it is not corrected, it would be turnovers. Cam Ward had two awful interceptions last weekend, and the Cougars coughed the ball up twice in the run game. Their nine lost turnovers is the fifth highest in the conference, and was the primary reason they lost the game. While the turnovers are a concern, a four turnover day for this offense seems like the exception, not the rule, to me. Additionally, despite only converting on two of 13 third down tries against the Bruins, WSU is still tops in the conference in that stat for the season. I see its offensive struggles as a bit flukey, as the team has proven how much better it can be on multiple occasions. I expect them to bounce back in a big way when they take on Arizona.\n\n5. UCLA Bruins (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nThrough two conference games, it is clear that this UCLA defense is the real deal. So far this season, the Bruins rank third in the conference in scoring defense, first in yards allowed per game and rush yards allowed per game, and tied for first in forced turnovers. It was one thing to have great defensive stats against Nate Johnson\u2019s Utah and a weak non-conference schedule, but holding Cam Ward\u2019s Washington State under 20 points is a remarkable accomplishment. UCLA\u2019s offense is still not terribly efficient, averaging less than five yards per play against the Cougars. However, this team knows how to stick with a gameplan, control the ball and win the turnover battle, all crucial keys to victory when they face more elite offenses down the stretch. Like Utah, UCLA has one of the few defenses that could possibly slow down the top three teams in the conference. Unlike Utah, the Bruins have a functional enough offense, especially at home, to make their opponents pay for their mistakes. I believe they are slightly better than most give them credit for.\n\n6. Oregon State Beavers (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nBeaver fans should be pleased that DJ Uiagalelei showed out against Cal on Saturday night, leading the offense to a 52-point showing. However, in one of the sleepier road atmospheres in the conference, Oregon State should have won by more than 12. After the Beavers had a strong non-conference run, I expected defense to be the focal point of this football team. In its two Pac-12 road contests, they have allowed an average of 39 points per game. It was particularly disheartening to see Cal of all teams run for nearly 250 yards on this defensive line, which also failed to record a single sack. That is a bad sign for when the team visits Oregon in Eugene on Black Friday, given that the Ducks lead the nation in yards per carry.\n\n7. Utah Utes (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nWhen trying to decipher which of the middle-four teams was the weakest in the conference thus far, I settled on the Utah Utes. Currently, the Utes have the biggest weak point of any of their above opponents: a completely dysfunctional offense. Only Arizona State has scored fewer points per game in the Pac-12, and Utah places dead last in the conference in total offense and passing offense. Without an early pick-six against a true freshman quarterback playing his first road game, it is highly probable that Utah would be 0-2 in conference play already. Is Utah buried? I would not say so, only because this defense is dominant enough to get this team on a serious run in the second half of the season. That run will not happen with either Nate Johnson or Bryson Barnes, however, and there is no indication of if or when Cam Rising will take the field again. If their former quarterback returns and this offense plays just average football, the Utes will be scary. However, the team on the field has been below average by the standards of the Pac-12 this season.\n\n8. Arizona Wildcats (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nIn the last two weeks, Arizona faced a schedule that would be daunting for some of the top-ranked teams in America: hosting Washington and playing at USC. Yes, the Wildcats lost both of those games, but only by a combined nine points. Give this Arizona defense all the credit in the world for making Michael Penix and Caleb Williams, two of the favorites to win the Heisman Trophy, look like mere mortals. Penix failed to throw a single touchdown pass, while Williams had his lowest completion percentage of the season. Head coach Jedd Fisch is leading a team that is ready to embrace big moments, a recipe for future program success down the road. This is not to say that all is well in Tucson. The Wildcats still turn the ball over too much, and the Noah Fifita interception on Saturday created the first spark for the Trojans\u2019 comeback victory. I also thought Fisch had opportunities to be more aggressive in his decision making, especially when he elected to kick a game-tying extra point in overtime as opposed to going for the 2-point conversion for the win. As a three-touchdown underdog playing on the road against a top-10 team, Fisch should have played to win instead of playing not to lose.\n\n9. Colorado Buffaloes (4-2, 1-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nAfter squeaking past Arizona State on Saturday, head coach Deion Sanders declared that Colorado played like \u201chot garbage.\u201d This was not the first time he referred to his team this way. Its issues in the trenches remain significant, as Shedeur Sanders was sacked five times against the Sun Devils, and the Buffaloes averaged less than two yards per rush. The Buffs appeared back on track in the second half against USC, especially after freshman phenoms Omarion Miller and Cormani McClain had major impacts against a top-10 opponent. That progression seemed short lived, as Miller had just one catch for nine yards and McClain was benched in Tempe. Shedeur is a great quarterback in the clutch, as evidenced by his game-winning field goal drive with under one minute to go. However, his offense was outgained last weekend by a team quarterbacked by Trenton Bourguet. Colorado is still a team with too many weaknesses on both sides of the ball; I see 6-6 as its ceiling in 2023.\n\n10. Cal Golden Bears (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nCal may have lost by multiple scores this weekend to Oregon State at home, but I am surprised the Golden Bears had that kind of offensive firepower in them. Unlike the Washington game a few weeks back, most of their 40 points scored came when the game was close; Cal was only down a field goal late in the third quarter. For a team that everyone knows strives to be run-heavy, the Golden Bears had a surprisingly good ground game, tallying 241 yards on the night and over seven yards per carry. So far in 2023, only Oregon has more rushing yards per game in the Pac-12 than Cal. While the offense was much-improved from the ASU game a week ago, two key turnovers sunk any chance of a major upset. This is still a team that is not quite disciplined enough to be a factor in this conference, and the Golden Bears\u2019 defense has allowed a combined 111 points in its two big conference tests this season. When a team only does one thing well, it is hard to rank them very highly.\n\n11. Arizona State Sun Devils (1-5, 0-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\nYes, the Sun Devils continue to lose games, but this is not the same team that was shut out by Fresno State at home a month ago. They now have some stability at the quarterback position with Trenton Bourget, who has thrown for almost 700 yards in his two most recent starts. The USC game got away from them, but they had real opportunities in the fourth quarter to take down both Cal and Colorado. Say what you want about Arizona State\u2019s talent, but that team has not quit on Kenny Dillingham the way I expected them to. Is ASU going to win many more games this season? Almost certainly not. However, the Sun Devils have shown a lot more life in their conference schedule than this next team.\n\n12. Stanford Cardinal (1-4, 0-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 12\nStanford enjoyed a bye week last weekend, and, given that both Cal and Arizona State put up respectable efforts in Week 6, there was no reason for me to drop either of those teams. Frankly, I have not seen much from the Cardinal that would indicate they could hang with a team like Oregon State, even at home. After all, Oregon had no issues keeping Stanford out of the end zone in its most recent home game, and the Cardinal found a way to drop a home contest to Sacramento State. Until it proves otherwise, Stanford is the worst team in the Pac-12.\n```"}

(Photo by Elijah Patterson)\n\nBy Terence Holton October 10, 2023 at 12:33 pm PDT\n\nThis USC team has not impressed me. The Trojan offense has done its thing, averaging 51.8 points on the year through six contests, as well as ranking third in passing yards per game and top five in total offense per game. However, the defense has completely undermined the success of the offense for the second consecutive year, which brings major concerns for the rest of the season.\n\nUSC plays arguably the hardest schedule in college football for the rest of the season, as in the next six weeks the Trojans take on five AP Top 25 teams. The game that most concerns me is a Week 11 battle at Autzen Stadium between the Trojans and the Oregon Ducks. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Notre Dame, Utah, Washington and UCLA will all be incredibly difficult matchups, but Oregon\u2019s play style counters the Trojan defense like no other.\n\nThis brings absolutely zero pleasure to say \u2014 nearly all of my friends attend the University of Oregon, so I have to hear about it from everybody when they win \u2014 However, I had to write this piece as a P.S.A. to all Trojan fans about how this is the game everyone should be most concerned about.\n\nOregon is led by senior quarterback Bo Nix who is putting together a strong early Heisman campaign. Nix is a dual-threat quarterback who can easily run over any would-be tacklers who don\u2019t use their whole weight to take him down. Nix also uses his vision to run an incredibly effective read option, which Oregon loves to utilize.\n\nOregon\u2019s run game benefits from their two-headed monster in the backfield, with running backs junior Bucky Irving and sophomore Jordan James, who have combined for 11 touchdowns on the season. I highlight these three players because they are how Oregon will beat the Trojans.\n\nOregon\u2019s use of the read option will decimate the USC defense, as the Trojan linebackers this season have been downright bad at defending the read option. Colorado junior quarterback Shedeur Sanders ripped off a few big runs against the Trojans because of the linebackers\u2019 inability to read the play correctly. If Colorado can run it well, then Oregon will do it 100 times better.\n\nA second concern of mine is Oregon\u2019s quick passing style. It is rare to see Bo Nix hold on to the ball for more than three seconds. Usually he is slinging it out wide for a wide receiver screen or a quick slant. The Trojans have been okay at defending receiver screens, however slants and quick curl routes have consistently battered the USC defense.\n\nThe Trojan defense has to play a lot closer to the margins and shut down the quick throws to force Oregon to throw it deep so that junior safety Calen Bullock can do what he does best and make a play on the ball. Bullock may not get a chance to make a play on the deep ball though, because of Oregon\u2019s tricky play style.\n\nOregon likes to try to mess with a defender\u2019s head during the play. The Ducks like to fake wide receiver screens and then hit deep plays, run flee flickers and even fake punts. This probably wouldn\u2019t concern most defenses however, we saw Arizona State \u2014 whose head coach Kenny Dillingham was the offensive coordinator at Oregon last year \u2014 play tricky against the Trojans and it worked far too well.\n\nWhether it was a read option or a pass from RB Cam Skattebo, it was incredibly efficient. You just know that Oregon head coach Dan Lanning saw that and made a mental, if not physical, note about it.\n\nLastly, Autzen Stadium will be a huge factor in this game. Speaking from experience, this crowd is booming. Autzen Stadium is not a place where opposing teams flourish to say the least. The Ducks have won 26 of their last 27 games at home, with the only loss coming last November when Washington beat the Ducks in a Pac-12 After Dark thriller.\n\nIf the Trojans want to beat the Ducks, they will need to stay home on the read option and not get too trigger happy with their tackling, as well as be ready to defend the quick passes. Offensively, the USC offense needs to show up and come out firing. If the Trojans can go up early, it will limit the Ducks\u2019 ability to run the ball and force them to pass it more, thus taking more risks down the field.\n\nI will be at this game in Eugene, and for the sake of my experience in Oregon, I am more than hoping the Trojans come away with a win. However, the USC defense and the rowdy environment at Autzen Stadium bring more than just concern for me. Hopefully I\u2019ll be smelling fried Duck all across Eugene on November 11.\n```"}

The twins have been gushed over by fans all over the world since they were just a few months old. These people are often perfect strangers and just a few of the 1.6 billion TikTok users worldwide.\n\nKnight launched her TikTok account in June of 2021, three months after she gave birth to her twins. She first documented the struggles of being a single mother and evolved into producing paid content for companies such as Home Chef, Amazon Essentials and the drinkware company BruMate, with her twins making regular appearances. Her videos now boast over 1 billion total likes, with a follower count of 8.1 million.\n\nKnight\u2019s content is not unique. \u201cMommy vloggers\u201d or \u201cmomfluencers\u201d have exploded online, amassing millions of followers and paid advertising to boot, making their children online celebrities in the process. Mommy vloggers have come under fire for years, with many critics targeting what they say is the exploitation of minors. Some mommy vloggers have also been accused of child abuse.\n\nMost recently, Ruby Franke, the mother behind the now-defunct YouTube channel \u201c8 Passengers\u201d was arrested on two counts of aggravated child abuse in late August after her son was found malnourished with duct tape around his ankles, police said.\n\nSome advocates against mommy vlogging, such as mother and content creator Bailey McPherson, argue showing children in videos is unethical in any situation, as children are unable to consent to their image or personal details being shared online. McPherson says she is also concerned social media content is easily accessed by predators, potentially putting children in harm\u2019s way as they gain popularity.\n\n\u201cObviously we have the danger of child pornography, which I rejected for a while,\u201d she said. Knight began covering her twins\u2019 faces in her videos in December 2022 and deleting old footage from her account. \u201cI am making a choice for my daughters, to protect them,\u201d she said in a video posted to her TikTok late last year. \u201cI am not taking a big stance about showing your kids or not online \u2013 I\u2019m just doing what\u2019s best for me and my daughters.\u201d\n\nKnight did not respond to requests for comment. What used to be a flourishing TikTok feed spotlighting Scout and Violet is now just a handful of videos that still expose their faces. Many fans have praised the decision, commenting on her recent videos they will miss seeing the girls, but support a mother doing what she thinks is best for her now-toddlers. Others demand answers.\n\n\u201cWhy r u [sic] not letting us see the girls that\u2019s why I watch this,\u201d commented one user. Other \u201cmomfluencers\u201d have chosen to take a similar route and remove their kids\u2019 online presence.\n\nMcPherson says she came to see a dangerous side of posting children online after an anonymous person filed a Child Protective Services report against her and her husband alleging neglect and sexual conduct around her then-2-year-old daughter, Noah. McPherson says she downloaded the app in April 2020, right around the time her daughter was born. She was a first-time mother who was feeling bored and in need of community, which she says she found on \u201cMomTok,\u201d an online niche for mothers to discuss and share tips about raising children.\n\nTopics include breastfeeding, sensory activity ideas and nap time hacks \u2013 the digital version of the proverbial village. Many mothers have shared that the community has become a make-shift support group, allowing them to flock to the internet to seek advice on combating the isolation of being a stay-at-home mom or raising a child with disabilities.\n\nMcPherson, who used to make MomTok videos with her daughter on-screen, fit right in with the clique. \u201cI would definitely describe my content in the beginning as more of a mom vlogger,\u201d she said. That all changed the day she received the call that an unnamed individual had filed a CPS report \u2013 first to the wrong county \u2013 alleging she was abusing her toddler, which she credits to her \u201ctrolls.\u201d\n\n \u201c[The report] is crazy, obviously it came from nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cAny information you give the internet they can take and twist and use to their advantage.\u201d Immediately following the incident, McPherson threw herself into damage control, deducing that having her daughter\u2019s face posted online had led to the viperous reaction.\n\n\u201cI deleted everything I could get my hands on,\u201d she said. \u201cThe internet will never see her face again.\u201d McPherson posted a video about the incident to her TikTok account and says she now considers herself to be an advocate against using children in social media content.\n\n\u201cI do think the only way to go about it now is totally just taking your kids off,\u201d she said. Since sharing her experience last year, she has gained thousands of new followers, for a total of just over 370,000. While her engagement has increased since making the switch, McPherson can see why some moms might be afraid to give it up.\n\n\u201cI still feel the shift in the ability to make content,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a stay-at-home mom and your only outlet is social media but you have a kid on your hip 24/7, I see a lot of reasons why moms \u2013 not maliciously \u2013 put their kids in their content.\u201d McPherson feels she can be a personality outside of her child.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s just me: I speak my mind, I talk about marriage a lot, cleaning content, household content, cooking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a struggle, but [being a creator] is more enjoyable now because I get to express who I am as a person and not who my child is.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the debate, some mom vloggers feel there\u2019s an ethical way to make content with their child. Mommy vlogger Brittany Wilson-DeMarco chooses to show her son, Lochlan, on her TikTok account. Like McPherson, she downloaded the app near the birth of her child.\n\n\u201cI was pregnant at the time so naturally my FYP just kind of went into MomTok,\u201d she said. \u201cI started meeting people, I learned a lot of things. I was a first-time mom, I had no idea what the hell I was doing.\u201d McPherson and Wilson-DeMarco had similar beginnings on the app: boredom-induced curiosity that led to posting content with their newborns and seeking advice from other mothers.\n\nWilson-DeMarco\u2019s feed consists of little bits of her life \u2013 she shares videos of herself making dinner for her toddler, taking her son on day trips and the occasional sponsored advertisement to share with her more than 96,900 followers. She says being a content creator has been incredibly rewarding.\n\n\u201cMoms have reached out to me and been like, \u2018Thank you for sharing this. We want to try this career.\u2019\u201d But when she started gaining traction and seeing an increase in viewership, Wilson-DeMarco says she reconsidered the safety of putting her son online.\n\n\u201cI definitely toned it way down after I was like, \u2018Okay, this [account] is going to be something, I definitely need to back off with him being the focal point of all of my content,\u2019\u201d she said. However, Wilson-DeMarco argues her son might just thank her for keeping a digital scrapbook of some of his precious moments.\n\n\u201cI think that he would be really excited to see [these videos] someday when he\u2019s older,\u201d she said. \u201cTrips that we\u2019ve gone on or things that we take him to. I think he would be like, \u2018Oh my god, this is so cool to see.\u2019\u201d Ultimately, she decided to delete some older videos, like one with her son in the bathtub, but continue to create content with Lochlan.\n\nWilson-DeMarco says one of her top priorities is using good judgment. This includes only posting locations she and her son have visited after the fact and disguising distinguishable markers that might alert someone to where they live.\n\n\u201cThe chances of anything happening? Very slim, in my opinion,\u201d said Wilson-DeMarco. \u201cBut there are crazy people out there and it\u2019s not [difficult] in this day and age to find out what state someone\u2019s in and go from there.\u201d Wilson-DeMarco also stressed being cognizant of knowing how far is too far when it comes to content creation, stressing the obsession with Knight\u2019s children is \u201creally, really weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve even done some brand deals that have involved taking pictures of my son with a toy,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s fine. But I think that it gets to a certain point where if that\u2019s all you\u2019re bringing to the table, I think you need to take a step back and question like, are you exploiting your child?\u201d\n\nWilson-DeMarco has also shared business strategies, social media ideas and marketing approaches on her page, being sure not to make her TikTok account too centered on her son, she said.\n\n\u201cMy camera is not constantly in his face all day,\u201d she said, adding \u201cEach child is our own, and we have to just use our own discretion.\u201d\n\nThis idea counters McPherson\u2019s perspective. She said children deserve to consent to all things, likening using their image on social media to piercing their ears or baptizing them without consent. While McPherson took her daughter off the app after a specific incident, she points to other potential harms such as strangers forming parasocial relationships with children online and children\u2019s images being used for sexual purposes.\n\n\u201cI get tagged in videos all the time of people finding Pinterest boards of mom vloggers\u2019 specific children and content that is clearly being used for dangerous reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny the dangers anymore.\u201d Especially haunting, she said, is the advent of deep fakes, which are digitally altered videos that can make someone appear as though they are someone else. AI tools have already been used to make pornographic videos \u2013 something McPherson worries is a serious danger to children online.\n\nLooking deeper, psychologist and USC professor Dr. Immordino-Yang says children face cognitive and developmental risks associated with being the center of online content. Namely, that their online personalities are difficult to live up to.\n\n\u201cBefore kids even curate their own self-image online, parents are doing it for them because there is something cute or interesting or remarkable about that child,\u201d Immordino-Yang said. \u201cAnd then your child has to grow into that image.\u201d Immordino-Yang described how children are always changing, growing and \u201cscrewing up and fixing it again.\u201d An online archive of their lives, however, might cement them in place.\n\n\u201cIt makes you self-conscious,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but define yourself and understand yourself relative to those moments that have been immortalized in public. It\u2019s changing the flexibility to start anew ... the ability to decide who you are and grow into new identities over time.\u201d She explained parents could be implicitly instilling negative values in their children, by placing their children\u2019s worth on their ability to make content and impress others.\n\nFor now, the ethical debate around using minors in social media content is up to parents: those for, against and those who find themselves somewhere in between. Few kids from these channels have spoken out for either side, as most are still young children. However, an anonymous Reddit user posted in a channel nearly a year ago claiming to be one such child and alleging their lack of privacy and paranoia around being filmed, saying \u201cIt ruined my life.\u201d\n\nConstant filming, Immordino-Yang said, could undermine an individual\u2019s ability to feel safe or at ease.\n\n\u201cWe need the space to be ourselves and not be in view, to not be always watched, to not be judged,\u201d she said. \u201cTo just be.\u201d```"}

The conflict began early Saturday when Hamas fired missiles towards Israel from the Gaza Strip, a region more than twice the size of Washington, D.C., that has been under Hamas control since 2007.\n\nThe initial attack and following invasion into Israel by Hamas, which is backed by Iran, have caused the deaths of at least 900 Israelis, an Israeli embassy spokesperson said Monday. \u201cMore Jews were killed during Saturday\u2019s assault than in any single day since the end of the Holocaust,\u201d the World Jewish Congress wrote Sunday.\n\nAccording to the Gaza Ministry of Health, over 687 Palestinians have been killed and over 3,700 more have been wounded by Israel\u2019s response as of Monday. Israel has retaliated since declaring war on Hamas and condemning Hamas\u2019s \u201cmindboggling\u201d attacks with multiple airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cHamas will understand that by attacking us, they have made a mistake of historic proportions. We will exact a price that will be remembered by them and Israel\u2019s other enemies for decades to come,\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday.\n\nLate Monday evening, a spokesman for Hamas said that Hamas will execute one Israeli hostage every time that Israel militants attack civilian homes in Gaza \u201cwithout warning.\u201d The spokesman added that Hamas will broadcast the executions publicly \u201cin audio and video.\u201d\n\nIn a recorded statement following the surprise attack, Hamas\u2019s military wing commander Mohammed Deif, said, \u201cwe have previously warned the Israeli occupation against continuing their crimes and appealed to world leaders to work on putting an end to the Israeli crimes against our Palestinian people and detainees.\u201d\n\nBeyond the territorial dispute, Hamas has a well-documented history of violent antisemitic sentiments. U.S. President Joe Biden condemned Hamas\u2019s actions against Israel in a statement on Saturday. \u201cThe United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAccording to Biden, at least 11 Americans are among the dead. Biden also said in another statement Monday he is aware that \u201cAmerican citizens still remain unaccounted for.\u201d\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been a heavily disputed territory for decades according to the CIA\u2019s World Factbook. After Israel declared independence in 1948, five Arab nations invaded Israel in the first of several Israeli-Arab wars. After several months of fighting, Israel signed truces with the Arab nations and Egypt gained possession of Gaza. In 1967, Israel gained control of the Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt.\n\nAfter decades of conflict, the 1993 Oslo Accords saw parts of the territories, including Gaza, come under the political jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt shared a statement on social media Saturday offering her support for those affected on all sides of the conflict. \u201cThe grave events and the tragic loss of life taking place right now in Israel and Gaza fill us with such sadness. Our hearts go out to the millions of people there and to our own Trojan students, staff, faculty, families, and alumni hurting and in fear for loved ones,\u201d Folt wrote.\n\nWhile Folt\u2019s statement was met with some criticism over a lack of condemnation towards Hamas\u2019s initial attacks, USC\u2019s Professor Emerita in the Department of Middle East Studies, Laurie Brand, told Annenberg Media that the school must provide support to all affected. \u201cThe university\u2019s first responsibility is toward its community, students and faculty,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that there are a lot of students at this point that are dealing with trauma, and that\u2019s going to continue and probably expand in terms of numbers.\u201d\n\nAs the death toll continues to rise, Brand does not expect the number to become stagnant any time soon. \u201cI think the violence is going to get much, much worse in Gaza before we see a sort of an end to this particular episode,\u201d she said.\n\nSarah Gualtieri, a USC professor of Middle East studies and history, hopes for a ceasefire. \u201cIt\u2019s a very terrifying situation. It\u2019s very terrifying for Israelis being held hostage. It\u2019s been terrifying for Gazans under siege. There needs to be a ceasefire,\u201d Gualteri said. \u201cThe situation is terrifying, but it has to be understood as a product of an ongoing military and political conflict that did not need to reach this stage,\u201d Gualtieri concluded.\n\nThere are multiple resources available for affected USC students. Through USC Counseling and Mental Health Services, students have access to a 24/7 crisis support hotline, counseling workshops, one-on-one counseling and group counseling. Students can access these resources through the MySHR student portal.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the safe return of those in danger and captivity, comfort for those who have experienced profound loss, and enduring peace for Israel and its inhabitants, and for all the world,\u201d USC Hillel, a Jewish organization on campus, wrote in a statement on Instagram. The organization is also hosting a community support gathering Monday at 8 p.m. at the Hillel building located at 3300 S Hoover St. On Tuesday, the organization will host a vigil at the Tommy Trojan statue on campus at 6 p.m.\n\nJack Smith contributed to this story.\n```"}

(Photo by Veronica Towers)\n\nBy Nicki Berelson and Veronica Towers\nOctober 09, 2023 at 6:09 pm PDT\n\nAs school boards across the country crack down on LGBTQ+ issues in the classroom, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is recognizing the community with a week of lesson plans and activities. The plan has elicited mixed reactions.\n\nAccording to LAUSD\u2019s Board of Education, the \u201cWeek of Action Toolkit\u201d curriculum was created to provide educators with sample lesson plans in adherence with the California FAIR Education Act, which ensures curricular materials for underrepresented populations are taught in public schools. The week of learning was scheduled to coincide with National Coming Out Day, on Wednesday, October 11.\n\nThe toolkit consists of an \u201cIdentity Map\u201d activity, which allows students to engage in the concept of intersectionality and express their identities. The guide lists daily quotes and brief biographies of prominent LGBTQ+ figures in society as activities teachers can use during lessons.\n\nLAUSD parent Erica Menendez has two children at the 32nd Street/USC Performing Arts Magnet school; her oldest child, an 8th grade boy, and her middle child, a 5th grade girl. She said it\u2019s a positive thing that her kids are learning LGBTQ+ lessons, and she thinks these things should be taught for more than a week.\n\n\u201cI honestly think it will be good throughout the whole year, so they could learn more. But I mean every parent is different,\u201d she said.\n\nMany have taken to social media to express their concerns over the new teaching material. Fox News\u2019 Facebook post about the addition garnered a few negative responses from parents and others.\n\n\u201cHow is this educational for children!! Enough already!!! My children will not be brainwashed with this nonsense,\u201d wrote commenter Selin Asatorians.\n\nOthers do not share Asatorian\u2019s sentiment. Arjun Bhargava is a junior majoring in gender studies. They come from Texas and believe that it is important for students to have their identities acknowledged.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s too young to have a gay uncle or a trans neighbor. You know what I mean? You\u2019re never too young to teach your children how to socialize with other communities,\u201d they said.\n\nThough teachers are not required to utilize the curriculum provided, they are being encouraged to incorporate lesson plans containing LGBTQ+ content. Mary Andres, a professor of clinical education at the USC Rossier school, is in favor of these lessons. She says that a combination of representation and allyship will lead to less depression and bullying in schools.\n\n\u201cWe are in a paradoxical culture where there\u2019s both shame and a lot of exploitation,\u201d Andres said. \u201cSo we see sex in a lot of ways. But then we don\u2019t have a lot of good vocabulary to be able to just talk in a conscious way and use good language to be able to describe what we know about ourselves or what we know about our identities.\u201d\n\nCorinne Hyde, a professor of clinical education at USC Rossier, said that it is important that instructional practice reflects the students who attend LAUSD schools. She believes that it allows for increased academic achievement and better outcomes in terms of mental health.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s developmentally appropriate to teach children that a man and a woman can fall in love with each other or have a family, then it is also developmentally appropriate to teach children that a man and a man could marry and have a family.\u201d\n\nThe LGBTQ+ Student Center and the Queer & Ally Student Assembly (QuASA) are resources that USC offers students. The Los Angeles LGBT center also offers services and programs for \u201clesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\u201d```"}

The purpose of Indigenous People\u2019s Day is for educators to rethink the story of Christopher Columbus\u2019s arrival in North America. Schools have been programmed to teach the glorified story of the Ni\u00f1a, Pinta, and Santa Maria finding the North American continent. But...not all schools shed light on Indigenous perspectives.\n\nNizhoni McDonough: In general, we were just taught about Native American history up to Columbus and then anything after that. Then we weren\u2019t taught anything about Native Americans.\n\nThat was Nizhoni McDonough, a student who is a member of the Navajo Nation on why people lack education on Indigenous Peoples.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day first became recognized in 1977 by South Dakota but gained momentum after President Biden\u2019s proclamation of the holiday in 2021. Proclamations are usually issued by the President to recognize and support ceremonial events. Past proclamations of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day have focused on highlighting recent policy measures concerning Indigenous People\u2019s populations.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center today, 16 states and the District of Columbia recognize some version of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, although it is not an official holiday enshrined in law in all of these states. There are 16 states that observe the second Monday in October as a public holiday known exclusively as Columbus Day.\n\nLawmakers from the House and Senate are still pushing to reintroduce a bill that would make Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day a federally recognized national holiday. The bill was reintroduced in Congress this year.\n\nIn the meantime, anyone can still take part in celebrating the holiday. McDonough talked about ways people can take part in recognizing Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\n\nNizhoni McDonough: I think as a person who isn\u2019t native or who wants to support our community it\u2019s definitely about bringing awareness to issues happening to Native American people today. Take a look at native issues, donate, spread awareness. If you can do any of that, it\u2019s really important.\n\nFor students like McDonough, Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day is continuous and being recognized by Native Americans every day.\n\nNizhoni McDonough: To other people, it is a day to recognize Native Americans, but our community sees it as every day is Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Vishu Reddy\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of The Come Up Show)\n\nBy Kaitlin Becenti and Audrey Serrano\nOctober 09, 2023 at 5:39 pm PDT\n\nRapper Drake released For All the Dogs on Friday, his eighth studio album. For All the Dogs features appearances from SZA, Bad Bunny, 21 Savage, J. Cole, Lil Yachty, Sexxy Red and even Drake\u2019s son Adonis. Hype surrounding the 36-year-old rapper\u2019s eighth album began circulating in January, though the album was just released after months of delay.\n\nFor All the Dogs received mixed reactions from critics and fans, most notably for Drake\u2019s use of misogynistic lyrics. The album has been described as the rapper\u2019s most immature release yet, some critics say.\n\nSome fans are speculating that track four, titled \u201cFear of Heights,\u201d takes shots at musician Rihanna, along with her partner A$AP Rocky. In the intro of \u201cFear of Heights,\u201d Drake repeatedly says the word \u201canti,\u201d the title of Rihanna\u2019s No. 1 2016 album. After reflecting on how fans \u201cmake it sound like [he\u2019s] still hung up on\u201d his ex, the rapper goes on to seemingly diss Rocky with \u201cthat man, he still with you, he can\u2019t leave you,\u201d Listeners are alleging Drake of petty misogyny, wishing that he would just move on and make music about something other than failed relationships.\n\nMusic journalist Will Hodgkinson noted how Drake, \u201ca seriously good rapper,\u201d just can\u2019t \u201cstop himself from complaining all the time.\u201d For some fans, rappers taking digs at other artists has become common and expected. But for some people, like junior Janelle Nwakuche, Drake taking stabs at people is becoming an annoying occurrence.\n\nJanelle Nwakuche: \u201cI feel like Drake is always doing things like this. He\u2019s kind of really annoying. I mean, it\u2019s like I this is stupid. Like, it doesn\u2019t really make any sense. There\u2019s not really even, like, nobody\u2019s really checking for you. I haven\u2019t really heard anything about Rihanna saying anything to him. So I think it was just, like, really annoying.\u201d\n\nSome rappers, says senior Christine Fisseha, like creating drama around their new releases by taking jabs at other people.\n\nChristine Fisseha: \u201cI think it\u2019s not okay how he like how artists do that sometimes, like just take stabs at each other. But I will say, like, maybe it was just for like to create drama and like for the flow and stuff, but I don\u2019t know too much about the relationship. I just wouldn\u2019t think that it\u2019s the best thing to say or hear if it it was directed to her.\u201d\n\nLooking at Drake\u2019s past relationship with Rihanna, many have seen how it\u2019s become a constant meme, at least according to senior Jordan Jones.\n\nJordan Jones: \u201cI know like anytime Rihanna gets in a relationship or has a baby, I know like, there\u2019s always like, oh, Drake\u2019s punching the air right now or something like that. Um, I didn\u2019t listen to those lyrics or like those lyrics specifically, but I could see how he would take digs.\u201d\n\nDrake has announced he will be taking a break from music to focus on his health. Some fans hope this pause will bring back the \u201cOld Drake.\u201d\n\nFor Annenberg Media, this is Kaitlin Becenti.\n```"}

Customers must now ask an employee to unlock items such as toothpaste, skin care and deodorant.\n\nThe implementation of these \u201ctheft-proof\u201d cases followed the retail corporation\u2019s decision to close nine Target store locations due to a rise in shoplifting and threats against employees, according to a press statement released September 26. The security addition to the Target in the USC Village also came just a few weeks after students noticed a similar change to the on-campus Seeds Marketplace, where self-checkout counters and grab-and-go options have disappeared.\n\nStudents and residents of the area reacted to these changes to the Target. \u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit bogus, in my opinion,\u201d said Isai Ortega, a junior majoring in law, history and culture who was coming out of the store. \u201cI think that the way Target tries to secure things is kind of problematic, in the sense that it\u2019s labeling a certain community as problematic or just as a disposable threat.\u201d\n\nKiyah Brown, a junior majoring in business finance, also said the locked merchandise seems like an extreme measure. \u201cI definitely feel like some of the items that they\u2019re locking up are kind of excessive. It\u2019s not necessary to lock up mouthwash and toothpaste,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThose are basic necessities that everyone needs. But I can understand the more expensive items that are $50 and up, and the alcohol, of course.\u201d\n\nAlong with monitored security cameras placed throughout the store for theft prevention, the locked cases are meant to inhibit repeat offenders and also offset the revenue losses Target has experienced in the past years. The corporation revealed in May that it expects losses from theft to increase by $500 million this year, potentially rising to $1.2 billion, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cOur team continues to face an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts, according to the Associated Press. \u201cUnfortunately, safety incidents associated with theft are moving in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nBella Barki, a junior business student and a former Target employee, shared her insights on the decision to implement \u201ctheft-proof\u201d cases. \u201cIt adds a few more steps, but at the same time, I get why they would do it,\u201d Barki said. \u201cThere were a lot of people who would come in [to my store] and attempt to steal. I feel like [the USC Village Target] has pretty good asset protection.\u201d\n\nRegardless of Target\u2019s goal to make up the theft-related profit losses, students such as Joseph Park, a sophomore screenwriting major, have said that they haven\u2019t shopped at Target since merchandise started being locked up. Barki shared a similar sentiment, saying that she has only been to Target once since the cases were added.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s just better ways to do it,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cPutting cases on basic necessities seems like a little bit of a stretch.\u201d\n\nTarget\u2019s media relations department did not respond to Annenberg Media\u2019s request for comment.\n```"}

Behind him are Director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services Mark Ghilarducci, right, and California Department of Public Health Director and State Health Officer Dr. Sonia Angell. Yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a possible first case of person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in California in the general public.(AP Photo/Randall Benton)\n\nBy Chuck White and Daniel Park October 09, 2023 at 5:33 pm PDT\n\nOn Sunday, Governor Newsom vetoed a bill that would decriminalize psychedelics. He stated that work needs to be done in regard to treatment guidelines such as what psychedelics can be used for, proper dosing, and preventing potential abuse of the substances. He said these guidelines need to be set in place before he can sign the bill. A concern from Californian parents is teens having easier access to psychedelics and the unknown long term effects.\n\nClinical Assistant Professor David Dadiomov stated that the centuries long, cross cultural use of psychedelics counters the safety concerns voiced by many Americans and the governmental stance on their use. David Dadiomov: \u201cYou know, because there\u2019s been centuries of use. They are generally safe. There aren\u2019t too many instances where individuals develop addictions to these substances despite the fact that they\u2019re currently schedule one controlled substances.\u201d Professor Dadiomov continued, citing that psychedelics are currently in phase three trials and could potentially be an FDA approved therapy in the near future. Dadiomov:\u201d \u201cWe can feel pretty confident in the safety. But that that is why there is, you know, a whole FDA approved process for making sure the treatments are safe and effective, you know, prior to them actually being released.\u201d\n\nThe Harris Poll conducted a survey, where they found that 65% of Americans with mental health disorders want access to psychedelics for therapeutic purposes. Senator Scott Wiener introduced the bill in late 2022, following the lead of states like Oregon and Colorado where psychedelics have already been decriminalized. Senator Wiener released a statement on Saturday, stating that while Governor Newson\u2019s veto is a setback, he will be introducing legislation next year focusing on the therapeutic uses of psychedelics\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I am Chuck White.\n```"}

Gavin Newsom vetoed state Senate Bill 58, which would have decriminalized a variety of psychedelic drugs for Californians over the age of 21. The bill covered psychoactive mushrooms, colloquially known as \u201cmagic mushrooms,\u201d which include psilocybin, psilocyn, dimethyltryptamine and mescaline. Additionally, the bill covered dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a natural hallucinogen found in various plants and animals, and peyote, a psychoactive cactus.\n\nThe bill\u2019s author, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), said that the governor\u2019s veto goes against the actions of criminal justice reform advocates who seek to reduce criminal penalties for possession and usage of psychedelics. \u201cToday\u2019s veto is a huge missed opportunity for California to follow the science and lead,\u201d Wiener said.\n\nIn his statement, Newsom said while he supports the decriminalization of psychedelic drugs, the lack of protective measures \u2013 dosing information, therapeutic guidelines, rules that prevent exploitation during guided treatments and medical clearance \u2013 pushed him to return Senate Bill 58 unsigned. \u201cPsychedelics have proven to relieve people suffering from certain conditions such as depression, PTSD, traumatic brain injury and other addictive personality traits,\u201d Newsom said in his statement. However, with no therapeutic guidelines in place, he said he could not sign it.\n\nAccording to David Dadiomov, a clinical assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at USC, psilocybin is effective as treatment for mental health related to depression. In an interview with Annenberg Media, Dadiomov said that he is unsure if vetoing because of a lack of guidelines is a reasonable rationale, since these drugs have already shown to have positive effects on patients. However, Dadiomov said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the potential decriminalization of psychedelics, which would consequently propel their usage for mental health treatments.\n\nIn his statement, Newsom said he would work to craft legislation that would \u201cauthorize permissible uses and consider a framework for potential broader decriminalization\u201d once the \u201cguardrails\u201d are set, which would lay out regulated treatment guidelines.\n\nIn a guest commentary for Cal Matters, Joe McKay, a retired FDNY firefighter, advocated for Senate Bill 58, as he said some veterans utilize these substances to heal from traumatic experiences. According to McKay, the criminalization of therapeutic substances has instilled fear in those who want to safely access them. However, he said that daily medications and coping mechanisms are not effective for many first responders impacted by mental health.\n\nAfter first learning about psilocybin mushrooms\u2019 positive effects on cluster headaches, he said he felt \u201chopeful about [his] health.\u201d According to McKay, not only did psilocybin cure his headaches, which would attack him 8-10 times a day, but they revitalized him. \u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that psilocybin gave me my life back. It\u2019s been transformative, and allowed me to feel happiness and joy in a way I never thought I would again,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media, Maggie Cutler Young, an assistant director of employer relations at the USC Viterbi school, said that people should be allowed to use psilocybin if it benefits their health. Young said that she knows friends who use psilocybin mushrooms for therapeutic purposes and find it effective. However, solely relying on anecdotes adds layers of uncertainty around the issue, according to Young. \u201cI can see why it would be scary to people. It\u2019s just like marijuana was very scary, but it was approved to be used. Personally, I don\u2019t have anything against it,\u201d she said.\n\nPatty Wiesbach-Leach, an assistant director at Viterbi said, \u201cIf there are guidelines and studies that show the lack of harm, I don\u2019t have an issue with other people doing it.\u201d She mentioned that decriminalizing drugs can encourage further research and offer more insight beyond acknowledging the benefits these drugs can provide. According to Weisbach-Leach, more research could enable people to understand the harms of psychedelic drugs and be more informed before making their own choices. \u201cMaking things illegal limits things or even research purposes,\u201d said Wiesbach-Leach. \u201cIt would be great to be able to decriminalize something and have a better understanding and do more research so that we have a better picture of what the benefits and the downsides can be.\u201d\n```"}

The Warriors were up by 19 at one point, but there were some positive takeaways nonetheless from the first game of the preseason. Anthony Davis shined in the 13 minutes he was on the floor, collecting 15 points and five rebounds and going two-for-three on three-point attempts. Another big man who impressed behind the arc was Jarred Vanderbilt who also went two-for-three. One main issue that plagued the Lakers last season was their three-point shooting. If Davis and Vanderbilt can be that consistent during the regular season, the Lakers will be able to space the floor more and create more open shots. The new signings the Lakers made during the offseason weren\u2019t impressive during this first preseason game. Guard Gabe Vincent and forwards Christian Wood and Taurean Prince all shot below 35% from the field. To make matters worse, Cam Reddish went down during the game with an ankle sprain and didn\u2019t return. Reddish hit free agency for the first time this offseason and signed a two-year $4 million contract with the Lakers. Second-year guard Max Christie looked great as he led the Lakers in minutes played. He racked up 15 points while shooting 60 percent. Look for the second-round pick from Michigan State to have an increased role in this Lakers rotation during the regular season. The Warriors saw strong play from their younger players as well. Jonathan Kuminga stood out for Golden State, notching 24 points along with eight rebounds and four assists. Like Christie, Kuminga is also looking to have a breakout year with an expanded role in the Warriors offense. The Lakers will travel to Las Vegas to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday, followed by another Northern California opponent the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday. Both games tip off at 7:00 p.m.\n```"}

Monday was also Columbus Day, a holiday no longer recognized by California or USC.\n\nAccording to the Library of Congress, Columbus Day began in 1892 when 23rd US President Benjamin Harrison issued a proclamation recommending \u201cthe observance in all [American] localities of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America,\u201d describing Columbus as \u201cthe pioneer of progress and enlightenment.\u201d\n\nIn recent years Columbus Day has been denounced by activists and Indigenous Americans, and has declined in popularity because of their argument that \u201cChristopher Columbus isn\u2019t an appropriate person to celebrate,\u201d according to Pew Research Center.\n\nPresident Biden officially recognized Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day in 2021 after decades of efforts by activists to replace Columbus Day. The White House stated that \u201cour nation celebrates the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples, recognizes their inherent sovereignty, and commits to honoring the Federal Government\u2019s trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, only 16 states and one territory still observe Columbus Day.\n\nUSC students have varying perspectives on whether these holidays should be observed. Elaine Luiz, a sophomore studying Biochemistry, said she took the day to celebrate her own culture.\n\n\u201cI usually prefer Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day,\u201d said Luiz. \u201cMy family is native Hawaiian, so I prefer to celebrate that.\u201d\n\nSethen Perez, a sophomore studying journalism, said he thinks there\u2019s value in celebrating both causes.\n\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t have a preference [of whether to celebrate Columbus Day or Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.] I think both should be highlighted,\u201d said Sethen Perez, a sophomore studying journalism. \u201cI think growing up there is a heavy emphasis on Columbus Day, especially in schools. I feel like the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day didn\u2019t come around and I didn\u2019t hear about it until recently,\u201d Perez continued. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely important to highlight Indigenous people, to highlight [that] they were here first. Their culture is super important to learn about.\u201d\n\nTo recognize Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, the USC Dornsife Center for Advanced Genocide Research hosted an online lecture called \u201cContested Pasts: Remembering and Forgetting Colonial Violence in Aotearoa,\u201d led by University of Wellington Professor Joanna Kidman, a M\u0101ori sociology academic, and Dr. Vincent O\u2019Malley, a founding partner of HistoryWorks.\n\nAdditionally, USC Visions and Voices is collaborating with LA SKINS FEST, a yearly Native American film festival that celebrates Native American Heritage Month, for a screening and Q&A with the filmmakers of Lakota Nation vs. United States.

The Trojans won the match 4-0 and handed Oregon State its sixth loss of the season. USC improved to 5-0 in conference play after the win and remains tied with UCLA and Stanford atop the Pac-12 standings.\n\nJunior forward Simone Jackson started the action for USC as she scored a goal during the 10th minute. Jackson\u2019s goal was her fourth of the season. The Trojans almost scored their second goal of the game after senior defender Zoe Burns received a pass from junior forward Kayla Colbert, but she could not convert the shot during the 11th minute.\n\nUSC\u2019s second goal of the game came in the 21st minute, as senior defender Angeles Escobar hit a free kick off the crossbar. The ball deflected over to Colbert, who knocked it into the back of the net for her fifth goal on the season. The Trojans almost got their third goal on a similar play, as freshman forward Hana Mizumoto received a long pass from junior defender Brooklyn Courtnall and just missed the shot off the crossbar.\n\nHeading into the game, the Trojans did not want to take Oregon State lightly, despite the Beavers coming off a 6-0 loss against UCLA in their previous outing. \u201cWe knew that they were able to keep some teams scoreless for a bit of time,\u201d USC head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cAs we go through the season, we\u2019ve been implementing more things about exactly how we want to play. I thought the team executed very well in that today.\u201d\n\nNo goals were scored by either team in the remainder of the first half as the Trojans took a 2-0 lead into the break. During the 68th minute, junior midfielder Helena Sampaio scored USC\u2019s third goal of the game off an assist from freshman forward Maribel Flores. Flores\u2019 fourth assist of the year led to Sampaio\u2019s fifth goal of the season.\n\nUSC put the Beavers away during the 75th minute, as Flores got her second assist of the game after junior forward Izzy Kimberly scored. \u201cWe don\u2019t just have a strong starting 11, we have a strong 24 players,\u201d graduate midfielder Kayla Duran said. \u201cWe have subs that will come on and we\u2019ll have the same momentum, which is really impressive.\u201d\n\nNot only is it USC\u2019s fifth shutout in the last six games, but the Trojans have shut out their opponent in three consecutive matches. USC\u2019s six-game winning streak is its longest since 2021, when the Trojans won a program-record 11 matches in a row. \u201cA shutout is huge,\u201d Duran said. \u201cThis week we practiced playing with speed, so that we wouldn\u2019t take any team lightly. They haven\u2019t had the best results, but at the same time, they came out and performed hard.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans made sure to not give Oregon State any sort of edge in the closing minutes of the game, an area USC has been excelling in all season long. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people hanging around with energy in the game,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cIf it\u2019s time to take care of business and close out the game as best we can, we need to do that.\u201d\n\nUSC outshot Oregon State 24-7 during the game and put eight balls on target compared to just four for the Beavers. A key factor in the Trojans getting their fifth shutout in the last six games was four saves from sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson, who played in 83 out of the 90 minutes during the Trojans\u2019 shutout victory. After not appearing in a match during the 2022 season, Dickinson has appeared in seven games this season and has a 0.64 goals against average.\n\nUSC is currently holding teams to 0.82 goals per game this season, and the Trojans are outscoring their opponents 17-1 over the last six games. \u201cThe togetherness of the team has been very impressive,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cEveryone knows that what they contribute to the team is super important, and everyone is taking ownership of their roles and being unselfish.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will take the field at home on Saturday as USC hosts Colorado, with kickoff scheduled for 12 p.m. at McAlister Field.\n```"}

The Diamondbacks started off the game strong at the top of the first inning with six runs off of six hits, including a three-run homer from Gabriel Moreno. Dodgers starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw didn\u2019t last long on the mound, becoming the first pitcher in postseason history to allow five or more runs before recording an out. After getting pulled in the middle of the inning, Evan Sheehan stepped in to try and contain the Diamondbacks offense. Sheehan quickly ended the top of the first after recording two outs off of a groundout and a strikeout. The Dodgers failed to respond in the bottom of the first inning and the Diamondbacks picked up right where they left off. In the top of the second inning, the Diamondbacks added three more runs to their total including Corbin Carrol hitting his second homerun of the postseason. With Arizona cruising comfortably with a 9-0 lead after the second inning, the Dodgers had no answer. Both the Dodgers and the Diamondbacks were held scoreless for the next four innings. In the top of the seventh inning, the Diamondbacks added another run to their run total after Alek Thomas blasted his second homerun of the postseason. After the seventh inning, the Diamondbacks were leading the Dodgers 10-0, and it wasn\u2019t long before the Diamondbacks got back on the offense. In the top of the eighth inning, Tommy Pham added another run to the Diamondbacks\u2019 total after with his first homerun this postseason. With the Diamondbacks leading 11-0 heading into the bottom of the eighth, the Dodgers finally responded. Dodgers catcher Will Smith scored two runs with an RBI triple, butit was too late for the Dodgers to close the gap as the Diamondbacks pulled away with the game 11-2. With a day to rest, the Diamondbacks look to continue their offensive and pitching success heading into game two. The Diamondbacks are likely to start Zac Gallen, who has been one of the top pitchers in their rotation. During the wild card series against the Milwaukee Brewers, Gallen started game two, pitching six innings and only allowing two runs. Gallen has had some success pitching against the Dodgers this season, keeping the Dodgers offense to a .233 batting average. Out of the nine Diamondback hitters in the starting lineup, eight of them recorded at least one hit, including Pham who went four for five in game one. The Diamondbacks only struck out nine times out of a team total 39 at-bats, and scored 11 runs off 13 hits. On the other hand, the Dodgers need to figure things out in order to even the series out in game two. The Dodgers are likely to start Bobby Miller, hoping to utilize his pitching repertoire in order to preserve the Dodgers bullpen. Miller has not pitched since Oct. 1 and is likely to make his playoff debut in game two. The MLB postseason rules cut each team\u2019s rosters to 26 players, so managing the subsitions becomes a problem. Out of the 13 pitchers on the Dodgers playoff roster, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts used six of those pitchers during game one. The team also looks for the offense to pick it up after only having four hits throughout game one. Out of the nine starting Dodger hitters, only three players recorded at least one hit. Dodgers top hitters Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and J.D. Martinez failed to record a single hit in game one. With both teams set to battle it out again, game two of the NLDS series starts at 6:07 p.m. on Monday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of The Come Up Show)\n\nBy Thuanh Su and Eda Katgi\nOctober 09, 2023 at 10:07 am PDT\n\nAfter teasing his eighth studio album all summer during his \u201cIt\u2019s All a Blur\u201d tour, hip-hop artist Drake released his album \u201cFor All the Dogs\u201d at 3 a.m. PST on Friday. Drake pushed the initial album release date from September 22 to October 6. His newest album features collaborations with top artists Bad Bunny, SZA, 21 Savage, J. Cole, PARTYNEXTDOOR, Teezo Touchdown and more.\n\nHere is a list of rankings from the best to worst collaborations for Drake\u2019s new album.\n\n#1 - Best collaboration: Gently (feat. Bad Bunny)\nDrake and Bad Bunny last collaborated six years ago on the song \u201cM\u00eda.\u201d During one of his tour stops in Los Angeles this summer, Drake brought out the three-time Grammy award winner on stage for a shot and announced that Bad Bunny will be featured on the new album. After great success with their first song, this was the most anticipated collaboration. From Drake starting the song in Spanish, to the addicting beat, and then Bad Bunny coming in with his verse, the song has been on repeat since the first listen.\n\n#2 - Rich Baby Daddy (feat. Sexyy Red & SZA)\nWith SZA\u2019s second feature on the album, the theme of this song is about physical attraction and different perspectives on love and intimacy in a relationship. The song title is immediately intriguing and once the song started, we were not let down. This song is a great anthem for the girls and the girls only.\n\n#3 - Amen (feat. Teezo Touchdown)\nThe second song on the album is with Teezo Touchdown, the recipient of the BLACK: Future. Now. inaugural Future Phenom Award, who starts the song with a prayer. The song then leads into Drake praying to God to not reveal his wrongdoings to his girl while she prays for him while he\u2019s on the road.\n\n#4 - First Person Shooter (feat. J. Cole)\nFor Drake fans, hearing J. Cole on the album was a best-of-both-worlds situation. It has been years since the two rappers have collaborated and the feature brings back a sense of nostalgia. Both touched on being \u201cgoats\u201d with their successful careers, respectively, and fans agree.\n\n#5 - Another Late Night (feat. Lil Yachty)\n\u201cAnother Late Night\u201d with Lil Yachty was a typical collaboration for Drake. The collaboration sounded like any other hip-hop anthem; it\u2019s nothing special but still sets the tone for \u201cAnother Late Night\u201d with the dogs.\n\nThis is where it started getting difficult. After the immediate top five, there was a small struggle to rank the remaining songs, as they all received similar reactions after the first and second listens of the album.\n\n#6 - Slime You Out (feat. SZA)\nThe \u201cKill Bill\u201d singer\u2019s collaboration with Drake was released back in September as the album\u2019s only single. Although the song dropped prior to the album, it still blends with the rest of the album despite its separate release.\n\n#7 - Calling For You (feat. 21 Savage)\nDrake can not get enough of 21 Savage. His previous album \u201cHer Loss\u201d featured the rapper who also was a part of Drake\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s All a Blur\u201d tour. \u201cCalling For You\u201d can be compared to their past collaborations as it tells the story of their past loves. The song felt similar to tracks both artists have collaborated on before in the previous album. Therefore, it did not stand out among the other songs.\n\n#8 - All The Parties (feat. Chief Keef)\nThe \u201cI Don\u2019t Like\u201d rapper makes an appearance on the song which starts with an immediate hook. The best part of this collaboration was the beat switch that came later which allowed Drake to rap his heart out.\n\n#9 - Members Only (feat. PARTYNEXTDOOR)\nA PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake collaboration is no surprise. If you have been a long-time PARTYNEXTDOOR fan, spotting out this collaboration should be easy. The two artists have released many tracks together and at first listen to \u201cMembers Only,\u201d you know exactly who is behind this track with the lo-fi R&B intro.\n\n#10 - IDGAF (feat. Yeat)\nLast but not least, the collaboration between Drake and Yeat has been a long time coming. At first listen, it certainly wasn\u2019t a top hit from the album. As the song continues, the beat eventually drops and you are transported to the club. All in all, Yeat shines through in this song.\n\nThis album had a mixture of old Drake which gave it a nostalgic feeling as well as a new style of music that the rapper is introducing to his audience. There are songs on this album that are great for parties, pre-games, workouts, and much more. As the rapper wraps up his \u201cIt\u2019s All a Blur\u201d tour, he shares that he is taking some time away from music to focus on himself, and his fans are excited for what is to come.\n```"}

The day was officially proclaimed a national holiday by President Joe Biden in 2021. To celebrate the holiday, the editors of Black. decided to explore the often unrecognized intersection of the Black and Indigenous communities. To help us and others create a better understanding of what it means to be Indigenous and Black in 2023 we reached out to Radmilla Cody.\n\nCody was born and raised in the Navajo Nation. She was raised by her grandmother and spent her childhood herding sheep, horseback riding, and singing. In 1997, she was crowned the 46th Miss Navajo Nation, becoming the first Black Navajo to do so. She is a Grammy award-nominated singer, domestic violence advocate, educator, co-founder of K\u2019\u00e9 Infoshop, Shim\u00e1 Storytelling Literacy Program, founder of \u201cStrong Spirit: Life is Beautiful not Abusive\u201d campaign and a proud mother.\n\nThis was our conversation:\n\nRadmilla Cody: My name is Radmilla Cody and I am of the T\u0142\u00e1\u00e1sch\u00ed'\u00ed (Red Ochre on Cheeks People or Red Bottom People) Nish\u0142i Naahi\u0142i\u00ed (African American) Bashishchiin Nakai Din\u00e9'\u00e9 (Mexican People Clan) Dashicheii/Maternal Grandparents Naahi\u0142i\u00ed (African American) Dashinali/Paternal Grandparents. I grew up in the Grand Falls area, and that is where I call home.\n\nMaya Packer: You have accomplished so much in your life. How have your identities contributed to your success?\n\nRadmilla Cody: On so many levels, and so many ways. I\u2019m a singer...Music runs in both of my lineages and my heritage. So definitely through my singing and then just being Din\u00e9, Black, Navajo. It\u2019s just been holding truth and [the] personification of two beautiful heritages: joy, pain, resistance and endurance, right? I think in what I have accomplished as a former Miss Navajo, and as a Navajo who broke down racial barriers during my reign as Miss Navajo Nation in 1997-98, coming from two beautiful heritages...has really given me that endurance and that perseverance to continue forward in the work that I do.\n\nMaya Broomfield: Have you ever felt pressure to embrace one of your cultures over the other?\n\nRadmilla Cody: Yes, I have felt pressured because growing up in a predominantly Indigenous society, I always felt like I was not Din\u00e9 enough. You\u2019ll hear this a lot with a lot of Afro-Indigenous relatives because we\u2019re told we\u2019re not Indigenous enough, whatever the nations or tribes that we come from, in my case Din\u00e8 [enough].Then when I was with my Black relatives\u2013 same thing. I always felt that pressure because I wasn\u2019t Black enough. I think how I was able to work through that was my grandmother. She raised me to learn the life sustaining methods of the Din\u00e8 people. Whether I grew up in the predominantly Din\u00e9 society and learned the life sustaining methods and ways of our people [and] the language, it still allowed me to be able to be proud of who I am as a Black person.\n\nMaya Packer: Your bio reads \u201cThe Naahi\u0142i\u00ed is a new term that was passed down to Radmilla from a Din\u00e9 practitioner when she inquired about a more positive, respectful and empowering term to identify those whom she is calling for the African Americans.\u201d How had your African American heritage been previously referred to?\n\nRadmilla Cody: To provide some context behind the Naahi\u0142i\u00ed term movement: As a child, my grandmother who raised me told me to use Naakaii \u0141izhinii to identify my father\u2019s side and those that I\u2019m born for, which is Black people or African American. Naakaii \u0141izhinii generally translates to the dark-complected people because our language is very descriptive. Over time [it] has become a derogatory racist term and is now referred to as the \u201cZ term\u201d. Hearing the term zhinii in a racist manner all your life is traumatizing. I then proactively began looking for a new word inclined to describe our Black relatives in Navajo because I was tired of hearing the Z term.\n\nMaya Broomfield: How did you feel when the Biden administration made an official proclamation for Indigenous Peoples Day in 2021?\n\nRadmilla Cody: Proclamations are as bad as land acknowledgments. What is the proclamation when the land has been destroyed? Rivers and lakes poisoned. Generations lost through the violence of colonization, especially capitalism and Christianity. Why do we solely suffer the consequences of settlers attempting to regain their consciousness? Only 60% of households within the Navajo reservation have running water. The remaining 40% must haul water many miles for their families, livestock and farms. Resource extraction and exploitation have depleted much of our direct water sources.\n\nMaya Broomfield: How do you feel about the country\u2019s alarming decisions of trying to get rid of diversity and inclusion in schools?\n\nRadmilla Cody: For Indigenous people, this is nothing new. We\u2019ve been censored and fighting erasure since this country was founded. I think racism and patriarchy are weapons of capitalism, of imperialism and schools have long been a stronghold of indoctrination of U.S. exceptionalism. When the school started to become more human focused, some states, some sooner than others, are going to limit any threat to its mythologies.\n\nMaya Packer: As a mother, what is the most important lesson that you\u2019re passing on to your children about their heritage?\n\nRadmilla Cody: What my child knows in terms of his history is what he\u2019ll be able to carry forward and his language. Just like my grandmother raised me to know who I am as a Din\u00e9 woman. One of the main things that she really emphasized to me growing up was the language. There\u2019s so much power in language and there\u2019s so much power in culture. There\u2019s so much power in our life ways as Din\u00e9 and there\u2019s so much power in history when you know where you\u2019ve been, where you come from and how you are going to move forward.\n\nMaya Packer: Do you think the trauma that Indigenous communities have experienced, because it\u2019s so tied to the foundation of the United States, that there is still a way forward, a way up and out from the trauma? Will there be generations that don\u2019t have to bear the weight of their communities having experienced genocide?\n\nRadmilla Cody: We may not see it in our time, but we\u2019re putting in the work. As long as we continue to put in the work, that effort. And a big part of that is happening right now with the Black Lives Matter movement, we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re continuing to inspire our younger generations. For all the young folks, I have nothing but the utmost respect for you because you\u2019re a big part of that. You\u2019re a big part of this shift that\u2019s happening right now in our time towards that liberation.\n\nMaya Brooomfield: What do you want people to know about the Navajo Nation? And are there any misconceptions that you often hear or see about Navajo people or other Indigenous groups that you feel are incorrect?\n\nRadmilla Cody: Well, the Din\u00e9 are the largest Indigenous nation with over 400,000 tribal members. We live on our original territory homeland and as a matrilineal society, we\u2019re strongly rooted in our lifeways culture and language. Some commonly held misconceptions [are] that we no longer exist. We only live on the reserves. We don\u2019t pay our taxes. We live free. We get special privileges like free money or tax exemptions. We\u2019re all rich from casinos. We\u2019re all the same. And our tribes are fully part of the so-called USA.\n\nMaya Broomfield: A lot of this conversation has been stifled by the government or powers that be. What are some resources that you are personally aware of that you think people should look into if they want to know about Navajo or other Indigenous communities, where should they start?\n\nRadmilla Cody: Well, definitely reach out to those communities. I can\u2019t speak for other Indigenous tribes. In this case, if you want to learn about Din\u00e9 culture, I\u2019m here as a resource for that and I can help. I can assist you with as much as I can. But if you want to know more about the history of the Din\u00e9 then I can recommend you to Dr. Jennifer Nez Denetdale. She\u2019s an amazing historian [and] a professor who\u2019s very knowledgeable of the history of the Din\u00e9 people. If you want to know how to support and elevate our LGBTQ+ relatives, then you go to those organizations. In this case, if it\u2019s a Din\u00e9, trans or LGBTQ+ relative, then I can recommend Mattee Jim or Stella Elise Martin. I think just reaching out to those organizations that are specific to those resources that you would like to tap into or to learn about. You don\u2019t want to have them to do all the work for you. You want to make sure that you\u2019re [being] respectful in terms of compensating these individuals for their time but also elevating their work in the process of that. There\u2019s a lot of podcasts, like \u201cAll My Relations\u201d, there\u2019s a lot of grassroot movements, like Not Your Mascot. There\u2019s a lot of anti-colonial spaces like The Red Nation, Taala Hooghan, and K\u2019\u00c9. These are amazing organizations that continue to do work at the grassroots level with a lot of our Indigenous relatives and many more.\n```"}

One of those wins included a double overtime victory over the Cardinal on Sept. 24 during the MPSF Invitational placement game. However, Sunday\u2019s matchup against Stanford saw the Cardinal reign victorious in a 14-13 decision.\n\nStanford\u2019s leading scorer was senior driver Jackson Painter as the Cardinal improved its record to 10-5 on the season and USC dropped to 10-4. Stanford\u2019s win over USC was the team\u2019s first since 2020.\n\nThe Trojans got off to a fast start Saturday and took the first lead of the game after junior 2-Meter Luka Brnetic scored a goal on USC\u2019s first possession. That score was the first of three on the day for Brnetic tying his career high in goals before fouling out of Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cLuka was shooting a super high percentage, but unfortunately we lost him in the middle of the fourth quarter,\u201d head coach Marko Pintaric said. \u201cIn the fourth quarter there were some situations that didn\u2019t go our way and it was questionable how he picked up an ejection.\u201d\n\nStanford responded with two goals to close out the first quarter, and entered the second period up 2-1. Brnetic scored his second goal of the game with 7:22 left in the second, followed by a score from redshirt junior Joshua Waldoch at the four-minute mark. At the half, USC and Stanford were knotted at three scores apiece.\n\nBut in the second half, both teams picked it up offensively. Stanford freshman utility Christopher Arakelian kicked off the second half scoring action with a goal, but the Trojans responded once again as senior driver Tom McGuire fired in a goal off an assist from graduate driver Massimo Di Martire.\n\nThe Trojans and Cardinal kept going back and forth as the score was then tied at six with 2:03 left in the third quarter. From there, Stanford began to pull away from USC as the Cardinal scored two goals in the final 34 seconds of the third quarter \u2014one by redshirt sophomore Grant Watson, the other by senior driver Soren Jensen with two seconds left in the period.\n\nStanford did not let up to begin the fourth as the Cardinal scored two more goals to extend the Trojan deficit. Trailing 10-6, USC picked the offense back up at the 5:21 mark in the fourth quarter when freshman driver Zach Bettino scored a goal. From there, Waldoch and Brnetic both scored to cut Stanford\u2019s lead down to one.\n\nThe Cardinal were held scoreless for over two minutes during USC\u2019s comeback. \u201cWe tightened up the defense and executed offensively to get back in the game,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cThere were some defensive errors that cost us a couple of goals.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans cut Stanford\u2019s lead to one after goals by Brnetic and Joshua Waldoch with less than five minutes left in the game. Senior driver Carson Kranz came up big for USC inside the final minute of the period, netting two goals. Kranz\u2019s first score on the day came with 42 seconds left to drop Stanford\u2019s lead to one. His second goal came in the last second, tying the game and forcing overtime at 11 goals apiece.\n\n\u201cThe team is showing that they have poise in these situations,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cWe sent the game to overtime on a 7 on 6 play that was nicely executed. We are creating opportunities and we are finishing.\u201d\n\nIn the first overtime period, Painter opened things up with a goal at the 2:45 mark. Senior 2-Meter Tony Nardelli scored the only goal for the Trojans in the first overtime period to tie the game again. Stanford struck back as freshman utility Alex Gheorghe came up with his second score of the day.\n\nThe game entered a second overtime period where the Trojans tied the score at 13 after Waldoch\u2019s third goal of the day. However, USC gave up a penalty shot to Stanford to go up 14-13 and from there, the Trojans could not muster up another score.\n\nUSC had seven different players score a goal and four of those seven scored multiple goals. Redshirt freshman goalie Bernardo Herzer had 10 saves \u2014 his fourth double-digit save game of the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have multiple players play and feel good about offense,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cLuka (Brnetic) shot a super high percentage and so did Josh (Waldoch). Those two guys really felt it.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the loss against Stanford, the Trojans lost to No. 2 ranked Cal on Sunday and will look to end their losing streak next Saturday at home against UCLA.\n```"}

(Photo by Elijah Patterson)\n\nBy Ethan Galbraith\nOctober 08, 2023 at 10:20 am PDT\n\nAfter a month since their last home game, the Trojans welcomed Arizona for the schools\u2019 final Pac-12 matchup. It may not have been the game anyone was expecting, but the headline was one for the books. USC outlasted the Wildcats 43-41 in triple overtime Saturday night in a bizarre Pac-12 After Dark contest.\n\nThe Wildcats came out of the gates with intensity, forcing the Trojans to punt on all first-quarter possessions while scoring on their first two possessions to jump out to a 10-0 lead. Arizona continued the momentum with a 92-yard drive culminating in an 18-yard touchdown pass, giving the Cats a 17-0 lead just two minutes into the second quarter.\n\n\u201cI give Arizona a lot of credit. Not gonna make a lot of excuses in any way,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cThey played well and played a lot better than us certainly some times in the game.\u201d\n\nSeeking momentum, junior quarterback Caleb Williams completed a 53-yard pass to senior receiver Brenden Rice, giving the Trojans prime real estate on Arizona\u2019s side of the field. The Wildcats did not flinch, however, forcing a Williams fumble on the next play and taking the ball back.\n\nBut to keep the Trojan Family Weekend crowd on the edge of their seats, the Trojan defense took the ball right back two plays later with an interception by redshirt junior cornerback Jacobe Covington.\n\nStarting in the red zone, the Trojan offense only needed three plays for Williams to scramble in for a 4-yard touchdown, getting the Trojans on the board with 9:43 in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cYou come out slow and give a team like that some energy, some juice, they get going, you go down quick,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt was just a tough fought game. We kept fighting.\u201d\n\nTwo sacks from redshirt senior defensive lineman Jamil Muhammad continued the defensive momentum, forcing the first Wildcat punt of the game, only for the Trojans to give the ball right back with their third three-and-out of the first half.\n\nA second Wildcat punt gave the Trojans one more chance to shrink the lead. A 31-yard connection between Williams and Rice helped set up a 5-yard touchdown catch two plays later by redshirt sophomore receiver Kyron Hudson.\n\nAfter falling into a 17-point deficit, the Trojans entered the half down 17-14.\n\nArizona opened up second-half play with a 22-yard field goal, but costly defensive penalties allowed the Trojans to take their first lead of the game with a 10-yard touchdown run by redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd on the next drive.\n\nAfter another defensive stand, the Trojan offense went to work. Caleb Williams cut through the Wildcat defense before more Wildcat defensive penalties gave Williams the chance to power in a 1-yard score to open the fourth quarter and extend the lead to 28-20.\n\nThe Wildcats ended with 96 total penalty yards.\n\nArizona responded on their next drive with a quick touchdown and successful two-point conversion, tying the game at 28.\n\nThe Wildcats had a chance to take the lead on their next possession, too, but missed a 50-yard field goal try, giving USC a chance to win the game in walk-off fashion.\n\nAnd then the real fun began.\n\nThe Trojan offense marched down the field and set up redshirt sophomore kicker Denis Lynch to be the hero, but a botched snap shut down the 25-yard attempt and sent the game to overtime, the Coliseum\u2019s first since 2017.\n\nOvertime saw Williams scramble for a tie-breaking score from 18 yards out, only for the Wildcats to tie the game on their first overtime play.\n\nThe second overtime saw the Wildcats strike first with redshirt freshman quarterback Noah Fifita connecting with senior receiver Jacob Cowing in the end zone for the fourth time in the game, before failing their two-point conversion.\n\nThe Trojans followed suit with an 11-yard touchdown run by redshirt senior Austin Jones before an incompletion on their own two-point conversion.\n\nIt took a third overtime for the Trojans to pull away for good, thanks to a Williams two-point conversion and defensive stand on Arizona\u2019s following attempt.\n\nWilliams finished the game with four total scores, including three on the ground.\n\n\u201cThe longer we go, the better we get. I think that last play was really the epitome of that,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cAny other team with less of a culture wouldn\u2019t have shown up in a moment like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly had a lot of moments where we didn\u2019t play very well, certainly in the beginning of the game,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut our team\u2019s fight and resolve to get back and find a way to win that was some of the just craziness that happened in this game.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans are back on the road next week to face Notre Dame on Oct. 14.\n```"}

His set included music ranging from his recent EP \u201cLe Soir\u201d to past music from his discography. Atlas\u2019 tour covered 11 shows across the country with Pink Skies as his opener in addition to Royaljag as an opener for this night\u2019s show. He toured across the country, including in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas.\n\nThroughout the night, Atlas shone vibrantly as he swayed to the medley of the songs with his band. His charisma was recognized by the crowd during the show, especially by fans who waited excitedly for his performance. Before one of his songs, Atlas acknowledged how great it feels to perform many of the songs where they began. \u201cI wrote a lot of these songs in L.A., most of them,\u201d he said on stage.\n\nAtlas used to live in L.A. before moving to his current residence in New York. There, he had the opportunity to collaborate with many artists. In one highlight from the event, he introduced one of those artists to the stage: singer-songwriter Vel Dalle. Dalle took center stage for a song while Atlas and his band backed the singer with their instruments. They performed a melody with a rich tone and a slow synth beat.\n\nConcertgoers Mariel Sully, Michaela Rodriguez and Daniel Sully attended the concert and were eager to see him live, as this was their first time doing so. Ahead of the concert, Daniel Sully said that he was looking forward to seeing some of Atlas\u2019 latest work brought to life on stage. \u201cI\u2019m excited to hear stuff from the new EP,\u201d Daniel Sully said. \u201cI really like the song \u2018Attractive\u2019 a lot. I think out of all of them that was my favorite, so I\u2019m hoping he sings it tonight.\u201d\n\nTo Mariel Sully, one of the things she enjoys from Atlas\u2019 music is its summery feel. \u201cWhen his music is playing and we\u2019re listening to it, it has good vibes,\u201d Mariel Sully said. \u201cIt makes me feel chill and good overall.\u201d\n\nBut beyond just his music, Atlas represents far more to some listeners. As a Filipino artist, Atlas is able to use his platform to reach people who also come from a Filipino background, including these three fans. Mariel Sully said that she enjoys the intimacy of Atlas\u2019 work compared to more mainstream artists. \u201cI think it\u2019s awesome. The representation is amazing because you don\u2019t see too many big artists like that,\u201d Mariel said. \u201cIt inspires others to do this kind of thing.\u201d\n\nRodriguez echoes this, saying it is also inspiring to see that it is possible for a Filipino artist to pursue a creative field. \u201cI think definitely because we\u2019re Filipino, we can be a little biased, but at the same time it\u2019s really cool to see his real talent,\u201d Daniel Sully said. \u201cSo seeing him up on stage at a venue, selling out shows like tonight is really cool.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mariel Sully, this representation in music is important because it reaches people in unique ways.

Game 1. Kershaw vs. Kelly. Dodgers vs. D-Backs. The perennial contender vs. the up-and-coming underdogs. This is one of my favorite days of the year. I watch my guys compete for something other than just a normal, regular-season win. Every inning counts. Every pitch counts. It\u2019s postseason baseball, and it\u2019s one of the best postseason experiences in all of sports.\n\nOur boys in blue drew the matchup with the D-backs, after they went into Milwaukee and swept the Brewers in two games in the NL Wild Card round. Rookie starting pitcher Brandoon Pfaadt put up an extremely subpar outing during Game 1 and gave up 3 runs. Thankfully for the D-Backs, their bullpen put up zeroes the rest of the game, and they took the first game 6-3. Star pitcher Zac Gallen gave the D-Backs a tremendous outing for Game 2, in which he gave up two runs and went 6 innings. They would eventually win 5-2 and punch their ticket for an NLDS matchup with their division rivals.\n\nThe Snakes will turn to Merrill Kelly to start Game 1, a surprisingly consistent arm. This year, he put up a 4-WAR season, with a 3.29 ERA in 177 innings. The Dodgers will turn to Clayton Kershaw, who although not completely healthy, is still ready to bring his A-game. In September he put up a 2.33 ERA in 19.1 innings.\n\nWhile the Game 1 matchup is one to watch, Game 2 looks to be a good one as well. The Dodgers\u2019 Bobby Miller will oppose Zac Gallen, a potential Cy Young Award winner. Miller looks to solidify this ailing Dodgers rotation that looks as if it will feature Lance Lynn in Game 3 in Arizona on Wednesday.\n\nLA won eight out of the 13 regular season matchups with the D-Backs this year. The interesting thing is that the D-Backs won five out of the eight matchups they had in March and April. However, the Dodgers swept all five games in August, as they really started to hit their stride and show their true potential.\n\nI have every confidence that the Dodgers will take care of the D-Backs. Firstly, the offenses are not comparable. The Dodgers deploy some serious firepower in Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, JD Martinez, Will Smith, James Outman and Max Muncy. Not to mention the lean, mean, Jason Heyward machine. Sure, the D-Backs have future superstar Corbin Carroll to brag about. The guy put up an .868 OPS to go along with 25 homers and 54 stolen bases. He is the face of this franchise, and D-Backs fans have every right to brag about his accomplishments. They even have nice pieces to complement Carroll. Ketel Marte, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and the resurgent Evan Longoria will surely not make things easy for the Dodgers pitching staff. However, while they are good players, the Dodgers can truly say that they deploy true stars. Looking down the D-Backs lineup, the only one I can truly feel confident to call a star is Carroll.\n\nWhere I believe the Dodgers have the edge is in the bullpen. Nobody believes Kershaw or Lynn will go seven innings. The Dodgers\u2019 contingency plans come in the form of Emmett Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Michael Grove, three up-and-coming arms who can act as long men out of the bullpen. The career resurgence of Ryan Brasier, in conjunction with the established arms of guys like Evan Phillips and Brusdar Graterol, surely give the Dodgers the edge over less-established guys like Kevin Ginkel and Ryan Thompson for the D-Backs.\n\nWith the Dodgers roster being released today, I have a gripe, though, with the exclusion of both Ryan Yarbrough and Amed Rosario. Rosario has been a quality bat for the Dodgers since his trade from the Guardians in July. He put up a .256 batting average and cut his strikeout percentage by two points. Yarbrough could have been a more dependable long-man than Michael Grove, but I have every faith that the Dodgers did their due diligence in coming to their decision.\n\nIn the end, I believe I will be right back here next week previewing the Dodgers\u2019 NLCS matchup with the Atlanta Braves. Let\u2019s take care of business. Dodgers in three.\n\n\u201cBleeding Blue\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

The event highlighted the work of ACFC and Monarch Collective, an investment fund that solely invests in women\u2019s sports, discussing how their work has been instrumental in the shaping and investing of women\u2019s sports.\n\nACFC is the National Women\u2019s Soccer League team representing L.A. The club was founded in July 2020, but didn\u2019t begin to play until the 2022 season. Its three co-founders are Natalie Portman, Kara Nortman, the managing partner at Monarch Collective, and ACFC President Julie Uhrman.\n\nUhrman, one of three panelists, said the club had a different pitch than a normal team. She talked about their mission in creating real leadership opportunities for women in sports. \u201cWe want to be an organization where mission and capital can co-exist. We want to be a platform that stands for equity and impact in every single thing that we do,\u201d Uhrman said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use sports and this idea of building a community and creating a sense of belonging to ultimately drive towards equity and bend the curve towards gender equity and pay equity.\u201d\n\nUSC alumna Sophia Bush was also one of the panelists. \u201cThe traditional methodologies of businesses run by men are singular and focused. And as women because we are used to facing more obstacles, paid less, and to do more with less resources, we managed to spin a lot of plates at the same time,\u201d said Bush, who is also an actress, activist and ACFC investor.\n\nOther notable ACFC investors are Becky G, America Ferrera, Jessica Chastain, Eva Longoria, Casey Neistat, Candace Parker and Gabrielle Union.\n\nACFC played their first game to a sold out crowd in March 2022 and finished with a 1-1 draw against the San Diego Wave. ACFC Co-founder Nortman said this is just the beginning of the team. \u201cThe reason we succeeded is because we projected strength and confidence and we made that shift...we moved from \u2018grateful to be here,\u2019 to \u2018we\u2019re going to go kick butt,\u2019\u201d Nortman said.\n\nCo-director of the Student Leadership Academy and incharge Angel City internship Lisa Finegan said ACFC is changing the future of sports. \u201cThey\u2019re model examples of what women can do from leading from the front. They\u2019ve changed the game in so many different ways and they can inspire both men and women globally,\u201d Finegan said.\n```"}

Commander has bitten another U.S. Secret Service employee. A uniformed division officer was bitten by the dog around 8 p.m. Monday, Sept. 25, at the White House, and was treated on-site by medical personnel, said USSS chief of communications Anthony Guglielmi. The officer is doing just fine, he said.\n\nBy David Herrera II and Yana Savitsky October 06, 2023 at 4:10 pm PDT\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s dog Commander is no longer living at the White House after multiple reported biting incidents injured staff and Secret Service, according to CNN. The Secret Service acknowledged 11 different incidents of the dog biting personnel, but told CNN \u201cthe real number is higher and includes executive residence staff and other White House workers.\u201d Injuries vary in severity, with several bites requiring attention from the White House Medical Unit. One bite needed hospital treatment, while others have gone untreated or unreported.\n\nThe reports around Commander\u2019s behavior raise eyebrows and safety concerns, but the 46th president\u2019s dog is far from the first to cause drama in the White House. In fact, the history of presidential pets is filled with tragedy, controversy and even electoral victory.\n\nWarren G. Harding\u2019s dog, Laddie Boy, was the first to receive newspaper coverage. In an article for Smithsonian Magazine, Smithsonian Institution historian Tom Crouch said, \u201cThat dog got a huge amount of attention in the press. There have been famous dogs since, but never anything like this.\u201d Harding loved the dog so much that he ordered to see Laddie Boy as soon as he was delivered to the White House and interrupting his first cabinet meeting, according to the Smithsonian.\n\nThough Laddie Boy was the first to receive coverage and fame from the press, he was not the first animal to call the White House home. President Theodore Roosevelt famously had a wide variety of animals since he had six children, according to Kansas State University\u2019s Dr. Ronnie Elmore. In an interview with the K-State Perspectives, Elmore said, \u201cHe had a whole zoo there at the White House \u2014 all the way from snakes to dogs and cats to parrots.\u201d\n\nAccording to Elmore, a White House legend alleges that you can still see the hoof prints of Archie Roosevelt\u2019s pony, Algonquin, in the elevator after his brothers brought the pony to visit Archie, Theodore Rooselvelt\u2019s son, when he was sick.\n\nTwo dogs are credited with helping presidents win elections. President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Fala, named after a Scottish ancestor \u201cMurray the Outlaw of Falahill,\u201d was consistently photographed by his side at official duties. Republican opponents of FDR began alleging that Fala was accidentally left behind in the Aleutian Islands and a U.S Navy ship was sent to retrieve him, according to the National Constitution Center. FDR was controversially running for his fourth presidential term and could not stand idly by. On September 23, 1944, FDR made his now famous Fala speech about the rumors, \u201c[Fala\u2019s] Scotch soul was furious. He has not been the same dog since. I am accustomed to hearing malicious falsehoods about myself \u2014 such as that old, worm-eaten chestnut that I have represented myself as indispensable. But I think I have a right to resent, to object to libelous statements about my dog.\u201d\n\nWhen President Richard Nixon was about to be removed from the Republican ticket as vice president for having an alleged secret slush fund, he appealed to the public with a speech according to K-State Perspectives. As Nixon outlined his personal finances, he said, \u201cthere is one thing that I did get as a gift that I\u2019m not going to give back.\u201d Nixon was referring to Checkers, a black-and-white cocker spaniel given to his daughters, Tricia and Julie as a gift. After the speech, thousands of telegrams were sent to the Republican National Headquarters stating \u201cKeep Nixon on the ticket!\u201d\n\nAccording to Elmore, over 400 creatures have lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Nearly every president has owned an animal, including President Benjamin Harrison\u2019s goat, Whiskers, who pulled his grandchildren around in a cart. President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s sheep was used to harvest wool for soldiers during World War I, while President Howard Taft\u2019s dairy cow, Pauline Wayne, provided milk for the White House. President Calvin Coolidge allegedly walked his pet raccoon, Rebecca around on a leash.\n\nAs Commander leaves the White House, who knows what pet will come next?\n```"}

The university defines zero waste as diverting 90% of all waste generated away from landfills and incineration. USC President Carol Folt announced the zero waste goal in 2019, when the university only diverted 20% of its waste from landfills and incineration sites. Currently USC is diverting about 50% of that waste.\n\nThis has been achieved by assembling USC\u2019s zero waste team. One of the team\u2019s primary initiatives is spreading multi-stream waste bins around campus. These bins have three openings, one for trash, one for recyclables, and one for compost. The bins are located in several locations, for example, all Marshall buildings are now fully equipped with the bins, and the team aims to have them in all buildings by 2026. There are also exterior multi-stream bins around campus and the USC village that the team is looking to place more commonly.\n\nThe difficulty associated with these bins is that every building and area of campus has its own custodial team that needs to be trained on how to sort these bins and ensure the waste, recyclables and compostable materials end up at the proper destination. These bins take advantage of the fact that 80% of people will throw their trash away in the assigned place, if it is easy to do so. With clearly labeled signage and pictures, the bins make it easy for students to decisively sort their trash and support USC in continuing to work towards the zero waste goal.\n\nAnother project the waste team is working on is limiting the trash produced. As a part of the initiative, the team is working in collaboration with the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to find a vendor that can supply them with recyclable paper cups. They are also working with Everybody\u2019s Kitchen to start using reusable containers instead of single-use for takeout.\n\nThe Sustainability Hub hosts Waste Education Wednesday every week in which one of the waste auditors explains the Zero Waste by 2028 project and answers any audience questions.\n```"}

Along with required masking and daily \u201cTrojan Check\u201d symptom verification, some professors continued to allow students to attend class via Zoom when they were sick. Two years later, campus is noticeably different. The hybrid option is now less common in USC classrooms and in-class attendance is often mandatory. As online lectures become a distant memory, sick students may be forced to choose: skip class and miss lectures entirely or show up contagious \u2014 sniffles and all.\n\n\u201cI have classes that require attendance and when I\u2019m sick I feel obligated to go just because professors don\u2019t excuse [the absence] or offer a Zoom option,\u201d said Yasha Haque, a senior studying mechanical engineering.\n\nDr. Sarah Van Orman, USC\u2019s Chief Campus Health Officer, said students should follow the university\u2019s isolation protocols if they test positive for COVID-19. Individuals who test positive should isolate for five days starting the day after their positive diagnosis. For the next six to 10 days, they must wear a mask. If the individual has no symptoms and has been fever-free for 24 hours, they may leave isolation before the five-day mark. Five days of isolation could mean missing an entire week of classes.\n\nSome students lean on their classmates when absent, like freshman Andrew Giesler who is studying pre-med biological science. \u201cI have friends in classes that I can get notes from so that helps,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s not too much [help] other than that.\u201d Both Haque and Giesler say they only have one class offered on Zoom.\n\nHaque said she feels uneasy when the person next to her is visibly sick or coughing in class. \u201cIt makes me uncomfortable,\u201d said Haque. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the reason that I get sick. It\u2019s just sad because we all have to go for those [attendance] points and there\u2019s not really a way to make it up all the time.\u201d\n\nOthers don\u2019t see sick students in class as much of an issue. Giesler said as long as students with symptoms wear a mask, he feels okay about them coming to lectures. Dr. Van Orman said wearing a mask is \u201cquite effective\u201d at preventing the spread of respiratory illnesses.\n\nTo avoid the issue, Haque suggested professors bring back the hybrid option for all classes so sick students can stay home, though some professors argue online classes have critical drawbacks. \u201cStudents who don\u2019t come to class and just kind of watch the class [on Zoom] just don\u2019t do very well,\u201d said international relations professor Douglas Becker. \u201cI have a pedagogical commitment to ensure that my students succeed.\u201d\n\nBecker is not completely against online lectures and will record them on occasion if there\u2019s a strong enough case to do so. Examples of this include the recent Yom Kippur holiday or multiple COVID cases in his classroom \u2014 instances where a large portion of students will be absent. However, he prefers to post slides and reflection questions for students to catch up on what they missed. Becker said he is committed to making time to meet with students face-to-face to discuss the material.\n\nBecker said these more \u201ctraditional\u201d styles of teaching can be more effective than a Zoom recording, which he said is a falsely labeled catchall for teaching. For Becker, it can be difficult to engage with students on Zoom. He said Zoom lectures underpin the idea that students should sit and listen to teachers instead of participating in discussions. \u201c[Zoom] reinforces an incredibly authoritarian notion of education where [a student\u2019s] job is to pay money, scrape from me all the information you can and give it back to me on an exam,\u201d he said. \u201cEducation needs to be collaborative.\u201d\n\nNot all professors see the same limitations with Zoom classes. Writing professor Daniel Dissinger sees a hybrid classroom as a no-brainer and, if anything, the equitable thing to do. \u201cWhy not?\u201d said Dissinger when asked why he provides Zoom classes for his students. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not just the pandemic ... there\u2019s so many things that students experience in terms of physical health, mental health, emotional health. Coming to class can be a problem, though they want to participate.\u201d\n\nDissinger acknowledged that offering his class on Zoom may mean fewer students show up for the traditional lecture, even if they aren\u2019t sick, but this doesn\u2019t deter him. \u201c[Students] have paid for their education and I want to serve them as best as possible and I want to be on their side,\u201d he said. Dissinger echoed a similar sentiment to Becker\u2019s; both professors said they feel committed to providing a great education for their students, just using different tools.\n```"}

What\u2019s changed since its beginning?\n\nThe iconic Tommy Trojan statue and USC's Bovard Administration Building. (Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy Jennifer Nehrer\nOctober 06, 2023 at 3:33 pm PDT\n\nUSC turned 143 years young Friday. When the University was born, the United States was on its 19th president, the country\u2019s population was only 50 million, and Wabash, Indiana had just become the first electrically lit city in the entire world. The U.S. has changed a lot since then, and so has USC. Here\u2019s a recap of some of the most notable changes:\n\nGrowing Numbers\nWhen USC first opened, it had only 53 students and 10 teachers. Today, the university\u2019s student body is at nearly 50,000. Additionally, USC now employs around 22,000 faculty and staff. In 1930, USC ranked third in the nation in international enrollment, as 10% of the student body was from outside the United States. Today, 26% of students are international. While the acceptance rate for the 2023-2024 school year was just 10%, it hasn\u2019t always been this low. In 1997, USC dropped below a 50% acceptance rate for the first time. The University was first opened as an affiliate of the Methodist Church, but severed all ties in 1952. Today, USC has a multifaith University Religious Center which hosts students and events of many religions, including Judaism, Islam and Hinduism.\n\nBuilding Up and Onwards\nThe first class of students at USC were limited to one building: Widney Hall (now known as the Widney Alumni House). Since then, USC has added, changed and torn down many of the structures that make campus what it is today. The newest group of buildings, those being the USC Village and Wallis Annenberg Hall, were built during the tenure of former university president C. L. Max Nikias. They prominently feature a \u201cCollegiate Gothic-style architecture,\u201d according to The Architect\u2019s Newspaper. One of the more notable changes is the 2021 rededication of the Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International & Public Affairs, formerly known as the Von KleinSmid Center. USC decided to change the building\u2019s name after reckoning with KleinSmid\u2019s history with eugenics.\n\nAcademia\nIn that first campus building, students only learned from the liberal arts. In 1898, USC added its first college of medicine and dentistry. Today, the university has accumulated 23 schools across multiple campuses, including one recently opened in Washington, D.C. The most recent school to be added is the Iovine and Young Academy, which is celebrating its 10th cohort this year. Today, USC is regarded as a top research university; and it continues to add pioneering projects to its already impressive repertoire. Just this year, the University announced an over $1 billion initiative in computing including a new School of Advanced Computing, which will be housed in the Dr. Allen and Charlotte Ginsburg Human-Centered Computation Hall \u2014 currently scheduled to open in 2024.\n\nSporting & Spirit\nUSC played and won its first ever football game against the Alliance Athletic Club in 1888, 35 years before the coliseum became its home turf. Today, USC Football boasts seven Heisman Trophy winners, including Caleb Williams in 2022. The Trojans now play in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which celebrated its 100th birthday earlier this year. In 1904, Emil Breitkreutz became the first USC student to win an Olympic medal when he came third in the 800 meter run. Since Breitkreutz\u2019s bronze performance, USC has built an impressive Olympic repertoire, sending 472 Trojans to Olympic games and earning 305 total medals, 144 of which are gold. If USC participated in the Olympic games as its own country, it would rank 13th in the world in all-time Summer Olympics medals, according to a University website. In April, the University rededicated one of its fields to Allyson Felix, the most decorated female track and field athlete in Olympic history. She has won 11 total Olympic medals, seven of which are gold. Felix graduated from USC in 2008 with a degree in elementary education. Despite the moniker\u2019s presence on many a school t-shirts, the Trojans weren\u2019t always named the Trojans. Due to USC\u2019s previous religious affiliations, the University\u2019s athletic teams used to be known as the \u201cUSC Methodists.\u201d In 1912, sportswriter Owen R.

Memorial Coliseum. The Trojans (5-0, 3-0 Pac-12) hold a 37-8 all-time record over the Wildcats (3-2, 1-1) and have won the last six meetings in L.A. Last year, the Trojans won 45-37 in Tucson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played five of them; we\u2019ve won five of them,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley told the Trojans Live podcast on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it six this week.\u201d\n\nUSC is coming off of a 48-41 win against Colorado last Saturday after allowing the Buffaloes to score 21 unanswered points in the last 16:03 of the game. USC\u2019s defense allowed 498 yards \u2014 403 of them through the air. USC\u2019s defense has struggled with consistency at times this season. Against Arizona State, USC sacked their quarterback eight times, but only sacked Colorado junior quarterback Shedeur Sanders three times. Of course, Sanders is an extremely mobile and evasive quarterback, but he has been sacked a whopping 26 total times through five games, and USC\u2019s second-half tackling was subpar against him.\n\n\u201cWe played about two and a half to three pretty decent quarters of football,\u201d Riley said, adding that his team needs to get more consistent on all three sides of the ball heading into the middle section of the season.\n\nUSC junior quarterback Caleb Williams has been nothing but extraordinary so far this season. Williams has gone 105 of 141 for 1,603 yards with 21 touchdowns and one interception through five games, having played just 16 quarters. Williams has also rushed for three touchdowns of his own. Williams currently leads the nation in passing efficiency (217.7), passing touchdowns (21), points responsible for (146) and points responsible for per game (29.2). Last weekend, Williams tallied six total touchdowns against Colorado, making him the first FBS player in the last 25 years to throw for six passing touchdowns in a game for multiple schools.\n\nAlthough the Wildcats do not have an unbeaten record, Arizona may have some momentum coming into Saturday\u2019s matchup. The Wildcats took on conference foe No. 7 Washington in Tucson, Arizona, falling 31-24. However, what makes Arizona\u2019s narrow loss more impressive is that the Wildcats\u2019 starting quarterback, junior Jayden de Laura, did not compete due to an ankle injury. Instead, backup Noah Fifita made his first career start. The redshirt freshman was 35 of 47 for 232 yards with three touchdowns and one interception. Down two scores with time winding down, the Wildcats showed some perseverance in the final minutes of the game, driving the ball 90 yards for a touchdown to bring the game within one score with 1:08 remaining.\n\nWith Saturday\u2019s starting quarterback still up in the air, Riley said the Trojans will \u201cdefinitely prepare\u201d to take on either quarterback. Three current Trojans are also former Wildcats, which could be another possible weapon that the Trojans have in their preparation efforts. Junior receiver Dorian Singer, redshirt senior cornerback Christian Roland-Wallace and redshirt senior defensive lineman Kyon Barrs all played at Arizona before transferring to USC earlier this year. Riley also commended Arizona for its development since both teams\u2019 last meeting.\n\n\u201cI think (they are) an improved team from what we played last year up at their place,\u201d Riley said. \u201cExpecting nothing but a battle.\u201d\n\nKickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. Saturday.

Now in the second year of baseball\u2019s new postseason format, eight teams participated in four best-of-three series, with winners moving on to the Division Series.\n\nIn the American League, it was the No. 3-seed Minnesota Twins taking care of business at home against the No. 6-seed Toronto Blue Jays. The Twins took Game 1 by a score of 3-1 and won Game 2 2-0 to advance to the American League Division Series. It was Minnesota\u2019s first playoff series victory since 2002.\n\nAlso in the AL, the No. 5-seed Texas Rangers went into Tampa Bay and upset the No. 4-seed Rays. The Rangers took Game 1 4-0 and Game 2 7-1 to advance to their first Division Series since 2016.\n\nThe ALDS kicks off on Saturday. Minnesota will visit the No. 2-seed Houston Astros. Houston is looking to defend its 2022 World Series title, as well as advance to the American League Championship Series for the seventh consecutive season. Texas, meanwhile, will head to Baltimore to face the top-seed Orioles, who shocked the baseball world this season by rising from relative obscurity to finish with the American League\u2019s best record. Saturday will mark the first postseason game played in Baltimore since 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, on the National League side of the bracket, the No. 6-seed Arizona Diamondbacks did not particularly care that they finished the regular season with 84 wins, tied for the fewest of any playoff team. All they did was go into Milwaukee and knock off the No. 3-seed Brewers on consecutive days, by final scores of 6-3 and 5-2. Arizona advances to its first National League Division Series since 2017.\n\nThe other 84-win team to make the postseason did not fare nearly as well, however. The No. 5-seed Miami Marlins traveled up to Philadelphia and fell to the No. 4-seed Phillies. Philadelphia took Game 1 4-1, before delivering a 7-1 rout in Game 2 to move on. Philadelphia is back in the NLDS for the second consecutive season, following last year\u2019s run to the World Series, where they came up short against the Astros.\n\nThe NLDS will also begin on Saturday, with both matchups being intra-division affairs. Arizona will travel to Los Angeles to take on the No. 2-seed Dodgers. After last season\u2019s NLDS disappointment against the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles will be looking to make amends and make it back to the National League Championship Series for the sixth time in eight years. The Diamondbacks, on the other hand, will look to avenge a three-game sweep at the hands of the Dodgers in their last postseason appearance back in 2017.\n\nOn the other coast, the Phillies will head to Atlanta to take on the No. 1-seed Braves. Atlanta rolled through the regular season, finishing with baseball\u2019s best record at 104-58. While the Braves\u2019 ultimate goal is to win it all, first they must exact revenge on a Philadelphia team that bounced them in the NLDS last season.\n\nThis Division Series will feature a unique blend of familiar faces and new blood. The Astros, Braves, and Dodgers all have Division Series streaks of seven seasons or longer, while the Orioles, Rangers, and Diamondbacks are all making their first appearance in the round since at least 2016. The drama starts Saturday. Buckle up.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nBy Channin Zhao\nOctober 06, 2023 at 6:49 am PDT\n\n1. Impact of the in-season tournament\nOn July 8, the NBA announced it would now include a new in-season tournament during the 2023-2024 season. The in-season tournament will tip off on Friday, Nov. 3 and culminate with the Championship on Saturday, Dec. 9. The tournament will consist of two stages: group play and the knockout rounds. During group play, all 30 teams will be divided into six groups of five with their conference based on win-loss records. Each team will play in four games against designated opponents within their group, two on the road and two at home, up to Nov. 28. Eight teams will advance to the knockout rounds: six teams from the best of their group, and two wild cards (the team with best records from each conference that finished second in its group). The Knockout Rounds will be single-elimination games throughout. Qualifying teams will compete for a prize pool and the new In-Season Tournament trophy, the NBA Cup. What does that mean for the regular season? All games played in the cup, except for the championship, will count towards the regular season. For the players, there will not be a significant change of games in the season, but there will certainly be more incentives at the start of the season as there is another trophy to play for. For supporters, the frequency of games may not be as high, but there will be more excitement, not only at the end of the year but also mid-season. Will the NBA Cup ever have significant meaning? Or does this cup ruin the weight of a championship at the end of the season? We shall wait and see.\n\n2. Does Victor Wembanyama pan out?\nVictor Wembanyama is perhaps the most exciting debutant that the league is preparing for this upcoming season. He made his debut during the summer league, and is attracting a lot of traction with his stellar performances. Wembanyama stands at 7 foot 4, with a wing span of 8 feet, which brings him a significant advantage immediately. The Frenchman joined the San Antonio Spurs as the top draft pick from the Boulogne-Levallois Metropolitans 92 of the French Pro A League, which he led with averages of 21.6 points, 10.4 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. Defensively, the 19-year-old could use his wingspan to his advantage and block shots easily. Offensively, he could score anywhere on the floor, from dominating the paint using his height or shooting beyond the arc, in which he has a 25% shot accuracy, not bad for a man of his height. Though exciting, questions were raised about his physicality, as the average weight for a center in the NBA is 251.3 pounds, yet he only stands at 209 pounds. At only 19, however, he could easily develop size, strength and skills over time. His future is limitless, and fans can\u2019t wait to see his rookie season.\n\n3. Last Dance for the Curry-Lebron era\nLebron James and Stephen Curry have dominated the NBA for almost 15 years, yet, as both stars begin closing in on 40, will this be the last time we see these two legends dominate the league in a season? In year 20, James averaged 28.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, 6.8 assists and 0.9 steals in 35.5 minutes, with a usage rate of 32.2 percent and a true shooting percentage of 58.3 percent. These numbers, for a 38-year-old, are unheard of. If Lebron is able to maintain these numbers for another season, he will have blown away every other 39-year-old in league history. Beating the all-time scoring record already, Lebron is now aiming to be the first 20-time All-Star. At 35, Stephen Curry may also be approaching his career\u2019s sunset. Last season, the superstar guard averaged 29.4 points per game, an average that ranks third in his career. With fellow \u201csplash brother\u201d Klay Thompson entering the final year of his contract, the Golden State Warriors also brought in superstar point guard Chris Paul. With a stacked squad full of stars all close to the end of their careers, this season could be a last dance for the modern generation.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/06/saturday-eve-week-6/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy Saturday eve, Week 6\n\nAnother week of college football is here \u2014 TOT previews the best of this Saturday\u2019s slate.\n\nFelipe Londo\u00f1o fills in for TOT editor Sullivan Maley this week, who is in Tallahassee covering No. 5 Florida State vs. Virginia Tech for RedCupNews.\n\nIt may be Week 6 already, but the feeling does not get old. It\u2019s finally that time again, folks. Turn away from your midterm studying, work responsibilities, or whatever is occupying your mind, and let the fact that college football is back tomorrow wash over you. That\u2019s right \u2013 for the sixth time this season, it\u2019s Saturday eve.\n\nThis week\u2019s slate is a juicy one with multiple ranked matchups and the first major blue-blood rivalry game of the season but first, let\u2019s recap last week\u2019s games.\n\nIf there was ever a game where you should have not taken a bathroom break, No. 23 LSU at No. 16 Ole Miss last week was most certainly it, with the Rebels outlasting the Tigers 55-49 in a legendary shootout. My word, what an offensive showing. Both teams combined for 1,343 yards of offense (yes, you read that number right), with quarterbacks Jaxson Dart and Jayden Daniels putting on a clinic of how to play the position.\n\nOle Miss rallied back from being two scores down in the fourth quarter, with Dart leading an 88-yard drive capped off by a pass from the former Trojan to wide receiver Tre Harris with 39 seconds left in regulation. What a game, and what a time for Lane Kiffin\u2019s signature win as Ole Miss head coach after the previous week\u2019s defeat in Tuscaloosa.\n\nFor LSU, they are now definitely one of the biggest disappointments of the season, dropping to 3-2.\n\nThe duel between No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 19 Duke in Durham was certainly another game-of-the-week contender, ending with a memorable Fighting Irish game-winning drive which saw running back Audric Estime wiggle around the Blue Devils defensive line to find the winning score in a 21-14 affair, a fitting way to end a high-rushing attempt contest which saw both teams combine for 348 yards on the ground.\n\nThrough seven weeks of play (the Irish played Week 0) Notre Dame has cemented itself as one of the toughest football teams in the nation, now 5-1 and a 4th & 1 stop versus Ohio State away from being a top-five team. The game doesn\u2019t change much for Duke \u2014 if anything, it just instills more confidence in what head coach Mike Elko is building. Duke isn\u2019t only a basketball school anymore!\n\nThere was more notable action around the country \u2013 our Trojans partook in another shootout versus Coach Prime\u2019s Colorado Buffaloes which saw Caleb Williams reassert himself as the Heisman front-runner. No. 1 Georgia showed why the program is on its way to Alabama-like status after stealing yet another win at Auburn. No. 24 Fresno State continued their reign as the Group of 5 team to beat with a comfortable win over Nevada. Oh, and if you haven\u2019t seen that 4th & 20 conversion in the Baylor - UCF game, you\u2019re missing out.\n\nEnough about last week, though, let\u2019s get into this week\u2019s slate of games. Happy Saturday eve.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK \u2014 No. 3 Texas (5-0) vs. No. 12 Oklahoma (5-0)\n\nDallas, Texas\n9:00 a.m. PDT on ABC\n\nFew games are more iconic in college football than the Red River Showdown, and the final Big 12 iteration looks to bring another special chapter to the rivalry\u2019s storied history. With previous OU dominance under former head coach Lincoln Riley \u2013 for the Trojans reading, our now-head coach won five out of six Red River matchups during his tenure \u2013 and Texas\u2019 absolute domination last October to hand Oklahoma its worst shutout loss ever, the upcoming matchup now finds both teams at a crossroads.\n\nWill Texas cement itself as the bonafide best team in the nation with a victory, or will Oklahoma finally reintroduce itself as a college football power? Let\u2019s dive into this exciting matchup and dissect a potential game-of-the-year contender.\n\nImproving from 5-7 to 8-5 last season, and now ranked No. 3 in the AP poll after a 5-0 start, 2023 looks to be the culmination of Texas\u2019 ascent back to the peak of college football under head coach Steve Sarkisian.\n\nTexas started the season with a comfortable 37-10 victory over Rice, and followed it with the signature win of Sarkisian\u2019s tenure, defeating Nick Saban\u2019s Alabama 34-24 on the back of a strong performance by quarterback Quinn Ewers \u2013 the junior passer threw for 349 yards and 3 TDs, finishing what he started against the Crimson Tide after impressing in but exiting last year\u2019s game early with a shoulder injury.\n\nSince then, the Longhorns have continued their dominant march, dispatching Wyoming, Baylor and Kansas with wins of three scores or greater. Texas\u2019 success has truly been a team effort. Through five weeks, the team ranks 17th among FBS schools in yards per game on offense and yards allowed per game on defense, yet the team has relied strongly on sophomore running back Jonathon Brooks and fifth-year defensive tackle T\u2019Vondre Sweat.\n\nBrooks is spearheading a mighty rushing attack in Austin, now ranking third among all FBS players in rushing yards (597) after a dominant 218-yard game against Kansas which earned him Big 12 Player of the Week honors. He serves as the workhorse back in the Longhorn offense, ranking 17th in rush attempts in the nation, and helps the team obtain success through the ground while setting up the play-action game.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, T\u2019Vondre Sweat has emerged as one of the best defensive tackles in college football, racking up 15 tackles, 3.5 TFLs, one sack and three quarterback hurries. But his impact goes way beyond the stat sheet. Sweat is a lynchpin of Texas\u2019 defense, as he excels at clogging up rush lanes and collapsing the pocket in pass rush, helping Longhorn linebackers play free and fast.\n\nOn the opposing sideline is an Oklahoma team that is on the rise after going 6-7 in Brent Venables\u2019 first year last season. The Sooners are now 5-0 and playing some of the most impressive complementary football in the country.\n\nOklahoma began its season with three multiple-score wins against Arkansas State, Southern Methodist and Tulsa before grinding out a 20-6 win against Big 12 newcomer Cincinnati and handling Iowa State 50-20 in Week 5.\n\nThe Sooners have been a well-rounded football team, ranking top-five in points scored and points allowed (47.4 and 10.8 respectively), largely thanks to steady quarterback play from redshirt senior quarterback Dillon Gabriel and a solid defensive anchor in junior linebacker Danny Stutsman.\n\nGabriel, a transfer from Central Florida, is in his second year with the Sooners and playing some of the best ball of his career, amassing 1,593 yards and 15 TDs on 75 percent completion through Week 5.\n\nStutsman, a Windermere, Fla. native, is playing at an all-conference level, tallying 49 total tackles so far this season (12th in FBS) while also recording a sack and an interception.\n\nTogether, Gabriel and Stutsman have led strong units that have helped the Sooners win games with complete performances on both sides of the ball.\n\nNow, despite the Sooners\u2019 impressive start to the season, it\u2019s important to note OU has yet to play a ranked opponent or suffer through any significant test. On the other hand, this is a battle-tested Texas team that already has a ranked win over Alabama under their belt.\n\nThe game will be tight with both defenses playing at an elite level, but I expect UT\u2019s slightly more explosive offense made up of Ewers, Brooks and star wide receiver Xavier Worthy to give the Longhorns the edge. Texas is a year ahead of their archrivals in the rebuilding process. Look for them to take down the Sooners in the final chapter of the Big 12 Red River Showdown story.\n\nUPSET ALERT \u2014 No. 13 Washington State (4-0) vs. UCLA (3-1)\n\nLos Angeles, Calif.\n12:00 p.m PDT on PAC-12 Network\n\nNow 4-0 and ranked the highest they\u2019ve ever been, the Washington State Cougars are impressively swimming against the tide of the current college football whirlpool. In an age where \u201cmarket size\u201d and media rights deals reign supreme, leading them to effectively be left conference-less and out of the Power 5 landscape, Washington State football is thriving, earning two ranked wins against No.19 Washington and No. 14 Oregon State on the back of its box-office offense.\n\nLed by redshirt junior quarterback Cam Ward, the Cougars have set the standard for quality college football offense. Through Week 5, the unit ranks second in FBS in pass yards per game with 406, and sixth in total yards per game with 533.8.\n\nEverybody is talking about the Cougars offense. OK, maybe not everyone *cough* Pat McAfee *cough*. But discourse surrounding Cam Ward and the great job that head coach Jake Dickert has done has clouded the fact that the Cougars are average or worse in everything except passing the football.\n\nThrough Week 5, the Cougars rank 98th in rushing yards per game (127.8), 100th in pass yards allowed per game (250.8), and 62nd in rush yards allowed per game (132).\n\nNow, it is true that a high-flying, dominant pass offense is the prime indicator of success in a college football team. But Washington State\u2019s deficiencies certainly open the door for a loss this coming weekend.\n\nThis is where our underdog comes in, a UCLA football team that is coming off its bye, matches up well against the Cougars and is eager to bounce back after a close loss to reigning PAC-12 champions No. 18 Utah.\n\nOn the offensive side of the ball, UCLA ranks 54th in pass yards per game, largely skewed by the unit\u2019s outing in Salt Lake City where the Bruins only put seven points on the scoreboard. That number may be tempting you to stop reading, but worry not.\n\nThe game was true freshman quarterback Dante Moore\u2019s first conference game, and he looked excellent in the team\u2019s previous three outings. Washington State isn\u2019t Coastal Carolina or San Diego State, of course, but a home game in a more passive atmosphere in Pasadena could yield a middle ground between the high-flying explosive passing offense we saw from Weeks 1-3 and Week 4\u2032s struggles: a decent passing performance that could trump the Cougars\u2019 below-average pass defense.\n\nAdd this to the fact that the Bruins boast the 19th-best rushing offense in FBS by yards per game and are facing a Cougars defense that ranks middle-of-the-pack in defending the run, and you get a recipe for UCLA success on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nThe big question mark is whether the Bruin defense can hold Wazzu\u2019s explosive offense at bay, and while it certainly looks like an uphill climb, there is definitely an angle for UCLA to slow down Cam Ward & co. enough to obtain the victory.\n\nThe Bruin defense has been stout against the run, ranking tenth nationally in rushing yards allowed per game. They face a Washington State offense that, as mentioned, ranks 98th in rush yards gained per game.\n\nIf the UCLA defense can stuff the run repeatedly and force the Cougars into obvious pass situations, a strong front seven led by NFL defensive end prospect Laiatu Latu and a secondary that ranks top 30 in pass yards allowed per game can go to work.\n\nUltimately, Washington State\u2019s deficiencies outside of throwing the football, UCLA\u2019s favorable offensive matchup and the Bruins\u2019 ascending defense open the door to UCLA\u2019s first major win of the 2023 season. I hate to spoil the raging Washington State party, but there are simply too many signs of a possible UCLA upset this Saturday at the Rose Bowl.\n\nON THE RISE \u2014 No. 14 UNC (4-0) vs. Syracuse, 12:00 p.m. PDT on ESPN\n\nDespite being overshadowed in the ACC media cycle by No. 5 Florida State\u2019s national championship hopes, Clemson\u2019s disaster start and No. 19 Duke\u2019s unlikely ascent, North Carolina is slowly entering itself as a frontrunner to compete with the Seminoles for the ACC title.\n\nNow ranked No. 14 in the AP Poll (second-highest in school history since 2000) the Tar Heels are in prime position to continue their ascent with a game against a feisty Syracuse team in Chapel Hill.\n\nIt won\u2019t come easy, though. The productive Tar Heel offense, led by early first-round quarterback prospect Drake Maye, is facing a top 20 defense in yards allowed per game, and the defense, largely average by most metrics up to this point, encounters a good offense that ranks top 50 in both rush and passing success rate.\n\nAdd that to the fact that the Orange are coming off a loss against Clemson, and this has all the makings of a tough game for North Carolina.\n\nOn the flip side, it\u2019s also an opportunity for the team to inch closer to a top 10 ranking in the AP Poll with a dominant win.\n\nSOMETHING TO PROVE \u2014 No. 4 Ohio State (4-0) vs. Maryland, 9:00 a.m. PDT on FOX\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the type of football team Ohio State is, with coaches (both retired and current) and the media repeatedly questioning the team\u2019s toughness or legitimacy as a top-five team.\n\nThat\u2019s all talk. The bottom line is that the Buckeyes are 4-0 with a close, but marquee win over Notre Dame in South Bend two weeks ago.\n\nComing off the bye, this is a perfect opportunity for the Buckeyes to shut the haters up and cement themselves as a legit top-three team with the 5-0 Maryland Terrapins coming to town.\n\nMaryland is off to a dream start, boasting the 19th-ranked pass offense in the country with redshirt senior Taulia Tagovailoa at the helm (brother of Tua, the Miami Dolphins signal caller). Moreover, the team has also easily disposed of Michigan State and Indiana with wins of 31-9 and 44-17 respectively, showing they can play complementary football.\n\nThose are nice wins, but the competition is not even in the same stratosphere as the Buckeyes, which boast a bonafide top-10 defense and, contrary to a plethora of false accusations, are actually jogging out a solid offense that ranks 33rd in yards per game.\n\nIn the national spotlight with a Big Noon spot, this is a tremendous opportunity for a statement win from Ohio State.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/05/fantasy-football-start-em-sit-em-week-5/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy Fantasy football start \u2018em sit \u2018em, Week 5\n\nTOT\u2019s weekly fantasy update is back with a rundown of this week\u2019s strongest and safest plays.\n\nBy Logan Drone and Sullivan Maley\nOctober 05, 2023 at 11:18 pm PDT\n\nAfter an unforgettable Week 4, the NFL script writers took a week off from football and honed in once more on the saga between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, this time at MetLife Stadium for Sunday Night Football. While some fans were annoyed with Swift getting the spotlight after every Kelce catch, others were frustrated at the blatant missed calls that led to the Chiefs being \u201c2-0 as Swifties\u201d, according to the NFL Instagram. All of that is neither here nor there, but you\u2019re here for one reason: to win in fantasy this week.\n\nAfter things seemingly couldn\u2019t get worse following Week 3, I followed up with a dumpster fire of a performance in Week 4. Let\u2019s take a look at where things went wrong:\n\nThe Good: Hopefully this is the first and only time that this recap is limited to only one paragraph. My tight end predictions were promising with Evan Engram (TE7) and David Njoku (TE11), but an injury to Luke Musgrave knocked him out in the first quarter, making him finish outside the top 50. With difficult matchups, James Conner and Rhamondre Stevenson busted as predicted, both scoring less than seven points and finishing outside the top 30. Finally, Matt Breida finished as the RB16 last week, leading the Giants in scoring after a poor performance against the Seahawks.\n\nThe Bad: Where do I even begin. At the quarterback position, Lamar Jackson proved me wrong, going off against the Browns with four total touchdowns, good enough for him to finish as QB3 last week. On the other hand, Joe Burrow continued his bad start to 2023 with another poor performance, producing just 4.7 fantasy points last week against a weak Titans defense. Along with Musgrave, injuries hurt me this week, as Javonte Williams finished outside the top 50 for runningbacks after he got hurt during the second drive for the Broncos. My worst predictions from last Week 4 came at the receiver position. Tutu Atwell, Jakobi Meyers, and Tank Dell all finished outside the top 50 last week, while Marquise Brown and Garrett Wilson both finished inside the top 25.\n\nAfter last week\u2019s performance, I had to look at myself in the mirror and ponder ways to be better with my predictions. I dedicated twice the time in the lab this week to produce Week 5\u2032s Start \u2018Em Sit \u2018Em below.\n\nQuarterback\nSTART: Anthony Richardson (IND) vs. TEN\nRichardson had himself quite the second half last week, bringing the Colts back to force overtime against the Rams and scoring more than 28 points in the process. This week, Richardson faces the divisional rival Titans at home with another great chance to replicate his performance, as the Titans allowed the fourth-most FPPG to quarterbacks last season. Even with Jonathan Taylor potentially being back, I expect Richardson to shred the Titans porous defense, both on the ground and through the air.\n\nSIT: Trevor Lawrence (JAW) @ BUF\nThe Jaguars are playing again in London this week and while they seemingly have the advantage of not having to travel, Lawrence has to face off against a Bills defense who have allowed the fewest FPPG to quarterbacks this season. This defense just held Tua Tagovailoa to less than 14 fantasy points last week, and I expect another poor performance from Lawrence, who has yet to break 18 fantasy points in a game this season. He may turn things around later this season, but this is likely not the week.\n\nSnoozer: Daniel Jones (NYG) @ MIA\nThe Giants\u2019 season is in jeopardy after their humiliating loss on primetime last Monday, and with another tough game against the Dolphins, Daniel Jones needs to do everything in his power to try and come out victorious. I expect the Giants to come out firing against the Dolphins who have allowed the third-most FPPG each of the last two seasons to quarterbacks. With Saquon likely back as well, the field will be open more for Danny Dimes to cook.\n\nRunning Back\nSTART: David Montgomery (DET) @ CAR\nOn the other side of the ball, the Lions rush attack has looked like a two-headed monster with Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. After missing Week 3 due to injury, Montgomery picked up where he left off in Week 4 with over 30 carries, something unheard of in this day in age. Head Coach Dan Campbell has showed that he wants Montgomery to be the bell cow and against the Panthers who have given up the fourth most FPPG to running backs this season, I expect a big game from Montgomery.\n\nSIT: Miles Sanders (CAR) @ DET\nThe Lions defense has looked elite this season, allowing the least rushing YPG out of any team in the NFL, and with a negative game script for Miles Sanders and the Panthers, I anticipate a dud from Sanders. The Lions have allowed the seventh fewest FPPG to running backs this season and with Sanders\u2019 snap count getting cut into by Chuba Hubbard in Week 4, it might be best to leave him on your bench this week.\n\nSTART: Alvin Kamara (NO) @ NE\nKamara\u2019s return from a three-game suspension last week saw him chart a baffling 33 yards on 13 receptions \u2014 the least yards on that reception tally in NFL history. But in PPR leagues, a point is a point, and even if the Saints may not see the performance as a positive, fantasy owners certainly do. He also carried the ball 11 times for 51 yards, meaning more than 50 percent of his 24 total touches came through the air. This role in the Saints\u2019 system creates an extremely high floor for Kamara, so even without a touchdown or another breakout play, he seems like a safe start this week against a middle-of-the-road Pats run defense.\n\nSIT: Zach Moss and Jonathan Taylor (IND) vs. TEN\nI know that Jonathan Taylor has been a baller in fantasy in recent history but his first week back is not the best time to start him. Jonathan Taylor was just activated off the PUP list this week and is practicing for the first time all season this week and simply put, I don\u2019t trust starting him, especially going against the Titans who have been top 5 in fewest FPPG to running back each of the last two season. With that being said, even if Taylor doesn\u2019t play, I would still advise away from starting Moss \u2014 the target and carry share is too unpredictable to rely on either for fantasy production.\n\nSnoozer: Breece Hall (NYJ) @ DEN\nBreece Hall has been extremely frustrating as a fantasy owner due to his lack of volume, but this is the week I expect things to change. The Jets announced that Hall would no longer be on a snap count and with a great matchup against the Broncos, who have given up the most FPPG to running backs this season, I predict that Hall will eclipse ten fantasy points for the first time since Week 1.\n\nWide Receiver\nSTART: Puka Nacua (LAR) vs. PHI\nThis might be square but it needs to be said with Cooper Kupp returning from injury this week. Puke Nacua is still the real deal and he should be utilized heavily even with Kupp back and Nacua plays more snaps out wide while Kupp plays more snaps in the slot. As a result, I believe Kupp will supplement Nacua well, especially against an Eagles defense which has given up the fifth most FPPG to receivers this season.\n\nSIT: Jerry Jeudy (DEN) vs. NYJ\nAfter looking like Russell Wilson\u2019s go-to target in 2022, Jeudy has been the clear second option behind Courtland Sutton, who has gotten more volume and targets through the first four weeks. Facing the Jets, who have allowed the third fewest FPPG to receivers this season and the fewest last season, I anticipate a weak performance from Jeudy in Week 5.\n\nSTART: Michael Pittman (IND) vs. TEN\nAfter a very weak performance in Week 4 scoring less than five fantasy points, Michael Pittman has a tremendous opportunity to bounce back against a weak Titans secondary that allowed the most FPPG to receivers last season, and are bottom five again this season. Even with the potential return of Jonathan Taylor, I still expect the Colts to throw the ball, yielding for more opportunity for Pittman to score fantasy points.\n\nSIT: Deebo Samuel (SF) vs. DAL\nThis is one might come back to haunt me. After dropping a mere 0.7 fantasy points last week, I anticipate another underwhelming performance from a tough Dallas secondary. Samuel is still nursing his knee and rib injuries and even when he\u2019s fully healthy, he\u2019s still not the main option. The Cowboys have allowed the second fewest FPPG this season to receivers and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Samuel has another disappointing performance in Week 5.\n\nSnoozer: Zay Flowers (BAL) @ PIT\nZay Flowers has gotten double digit fantasy points in three of his first four games while not seeing the endzone once. His touchdowns will come, and against the Steelers who have allowed the most touchdowns to receivers this season, I predict that Flowers finds the endzone for the first time this season. The Steelers have also allowed the fourth most FPPG to receivers this season, so expect a big day from Flowers in Pittsburgh.\n\nTight End\nSTART: Darren Waller (NYG) @ MIA\nThis might seem obvious, but Darren Waller has not surpassed six points in either of his last two games and some fantasy managers are panicking. Rest assured, Darren Waller should bounce back this week against a weak Dolphins defense that\u2019s allowed the eighth-most FPPG to tight ends this season. The Giants need to get the ball moving on offense and when did they last do that best? Week 2 against the Cardinals when both Waller and Saquon were utilized to open the field. With Saquon back in Week 5, I anticipate the field to open up more for Waller to finally prove why you drafted him so early on.\n\nSIT: Hunter Henry (NE) vs. NO\nAfter two 16+ point performances to open the season, Hunter Henry dropped a dud Week 3 against the Jets \u2014 who have allowed the most FPPG to tight ends so far this year \u2014 with just 3.7 points. While he somewhat rebounded last week with a 9.1-point performance against Dallas, the inconsistent target share and red zone use could keep Henry from producing against a Saints defense that ranks fourth-lowest in FPPG allowed to the position.\n\nSnoozer: Hayden Hurst (CAR) @ DET\nAfter dropping more than 15 points in Week 1, Hayden Hurst has yet to eclipse ten fantasy points over his last three games combined. That\u2019s been horrendous, but it hasn\u2019t necessarily been Hurst\u2019s fault; tough matchups and a switch-up at quarterback will provide that. But now that Bryce Young is back and healthy, Hurst faces a lions defense that\u2019s allowed the second most FPPG to tight ends this season, giving up 35 yards to the backup tight end Josiah Deguara last week. With the Panthers likely throwing the ball a ton, I anticipate a lot of checkdowns from Young as Hurst slots back into his safety valve role from Week 1.\n\nWeek 4 Results:\nQuarterback\nSTART: Joe Burrow (4.7, QB28)\nSIT: Lamar Jackson (28.14, QB3)\nSnoozer: Matthew Stafford (16.16, QB16)\n\nRunning Back\nSTART: Javonte Williams (3.9, RB51)\nSIT: James Conner (6.6, RB36)\nSTART: Alexander Mattison (10.8, RB21)\nSIT: Rhamondre Stevenson (6.0, RB41)\nSNOOZER: Matt Breida (12.8, RB16)\n\nWide Receiver\nSTART: Tutu Atwell (7.4, WR51)\nSIT: Marquise Brown (16.6, WR15)\nSTART: Jakobi Meyers (5.3, WR69)\nSIT: Garrett Wilson (15.0, WR23)\nSNOOZER: Tank Dell (3.9, WR84)\n\nTight End\nSTART: Evan Engram (12.9, TE7)\nSIT: David Njoku (10.6, TE11)\nSnoozer: Luke Musgrave (1.1, TE55)\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/05/week-5-college-football-recap/", "response": "```\nWeek 5 college football recap\n\nTOT looks back on the most exciting and important games of last weekend.\n\nNo. 19 Oregon St. cruises to Victory over No. 10 Utah, 21-7\n\nAfter a shootout loss to Washington St. last week, Oregon St. looked to bounce back at home vs. the defending PAC-12 champs. Freshman running back Damien Martinez opened up the scoring for Oregon State, rushing for a 4-yard touchdown late in the 1st quarter. Martinez finished with 16 rushes for 65 yards and a touchdown. Utah is still without starting quarterback Cam Rising, who tore his ACL in the Rose Bowl in January. Rising\u2019s replacement, redshirt freshman Nate Johnson, completed just 8 of his 23 pass attempts, and threw for one touchdown. Both offenses went stagnant after Oregon St\u2019s initial score, making for a 7-0 score throughout two quarters. Beavers quarterback DJ Uiagelelei was finally able to make something happen, finding receiver Silas Bolden for a 27-yard score early in the third. After another quarter of offensive struggles for Utah, Oregon St. added to their lead early in the fourth with another touchdown from Silas Bolden. Utah avoided the shutout late in the fourth when Johnson found tight end Thomas Yassmin for a 41-yard score. A well-fought win vs. a Top-10 conference opponent proved helpful for the Beavers (4-1) in the AP Top 25 poll, bumping them up four spots to No. 15. Now ranked at No. 18, Utah (4-1) is off this week, hopeful for Cam Rising to return for their Oct. 14 matchup vs. California.\n\nKentucky pummels No. 22 Florida at home, 33-14\n\nUnranked Kentucky ran all over the SEC\u2019s top-ranked defense, rushing for a combined 329 yards. 280 of these yards came from senior running back Ray Davis, who totaled 289 all-purpose yards and four total touchdowns. Kentucky dominated from the start, going on a 23-0 run to open the game. Gators quarterback Graham Mertz found tight end Hayden Hansen for a 4-yard TD just before halftime to halt the bleeding. Mertz had a solid game statistically, completing 25 of his 30 attempts for two touchdowns and a pick, albeit a lot of this production came when the game was essentially over. Kentucky quarterback Devin Leary did not have to do much, completing 9 of his 20 attempts for 69 yards and a score. Leary\u2019s lackluster statline shows just how dominant the Wildcats were on the ground. Ray Davis added a fourth touchdown to his historic night early in the 3rd quarter, cementing a dominating win for Kentucky. Florida (3-2) finds themselves out of the AP Top 25 poll after this game. Kentucky (5-0), now ranked at No. 20, will look for a monumental upset vs. No. 1 Georgia next weekend.\n\nNo. 8 USC narrowly avoids comeback vs. Colorado, 48-41\n\nThis highly-anticipated matchup did not fail to entertain. USC jumped out to an early lead on their opening drive via a 27-yard rushing touchdown from junior running back MarShawn Lloyd. Lloyd finished the game with 84 rushing yards on 13 attempts and a score. USC found themselves up 21-0 early in the second quarter after Caleb Williams found receivers Tahj Washington and Dorian Singer for touchdown passes. Washington led the Trojans in receiving yards, hauling in eight catches for 117 yards and a score. Williams continued his Heisman campaign with a strong performance, completing 30 of his 40 pass attempts for 403 yards, 6 touchdowns, and his first interception of the season. Colorado was able to quickly strike back, as Shedeur Sanders found receiver Jimmy Horn for a 30-yard score to cut the lead to 14. Horn finished with 7 catches for 84 yards and a touchdown. Sanders, a bonafide Heisman candidate along with Williams, threw for 371 yards, 4 touchdowns, and an interception. The Trojans did not let up after Colorado\u2019s quick response, as Williams found pass catchers Mario Williams and Brenden Rice for two more touchdowns in what looked like the making of an early blowout. Colorado was able to put together a drive before halftime, capping it off with a 25-yard rushing touchdown from Sanders. After showing signs of life, Colorado still found themselves down 34-14 at halftime. Brenden Rice was able to find the endzone once again in the 3rd quarter, as Williams connected with him for a 6-yard touchdown. But in a wild turn of events, Colorado was able to string multiple touchdown drives together, along with clutch defensive stops including intercepting Williams late in the third. After a missed USC field goal attempt, the Buffaloes found themselves down just 14 with 5:58 remaining. This situation makes for an uptempo offensive game plan, but Colorado was surprisingly conservative. They continuously ran the football, and did not seem to be in any hurry to score. Sanders eventually found Horn for his second touchdown with 1:43 left to play. With so little time remaining, the Buffs\u2019 only hope was an onside kick recovery, which they failed to convert on. USC (5-0) was able to escape Boulder with a win in a game that consisted of 1,062 total yards of offense. Although the end result was satisfactory for the Trojans, they find themselves slipping one spot in the AP Poll to No. 9. As for Colorado (3-2), this game showed that last week\u2019s blowout loss to Oregon was somewhat of a fluke, and that they are not a team to be overlooked.\n\nNo. 1 Georgia rallies late to avoid upset vs. Auburn, 27-20\n\nA game that everyone assumed was over before it started almost became the biggest college football upset of the year. Auburn jumped out to a quick 10-0 start after running back Jarquez Hunter found paydirt late in the first quarter. Georgia struck back in the second via a 2-yard rushing touchdown from Daijun Edwards. This overlooked matchup was knotted up at 10 at halftime. Auburn found themselves in this game because of their ability to run the football, outrushing the Bulldogs 219-107. Tigers quarterback Payton Thorne rushed for more yards than he threw for with 92 yards on 12 attempts. Auburn took back their lead early in the 3rd quarter thanks to a 9-yard rushing touchdown from gadget quarterback Robby Ashford. Georgia would eventually strike back late in the third quarter, and field goals by each team in the 4th set up a tie game with six minutes remaining. Georgia quarterback Carson Beck would lead a seven-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to take the lead, finding tight end Brock Bowers for a 40-yard go-ahead score. Bowers led Georgia in receiving yards with 157, and Beck finished 23/33 for 318 yards, along with a touchdown and interception. Georgia\u2019s defense would go on to stop a potential game-tying drive. Despite the near-upset, Georgia (5-0) remains ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll. As for Auburn (3-2), Tiger fans must feel optimistic about their team moving forward after nearly defeating the two-time defending national champions.\n\nNo. 20 Ole Miss Defeats No. 13 LSU in Shootout, 55-49\n\nOle Miss defended their home turf in a back-and-forth contest against SEC foe LSU. Ole Miss jumped out to an early 21-7 lead, thanks to a combination of a competent passing and rushing attack. Rebels Junior quarterback Jaxson Dart was electric, completing 26 of his 39 pass attempts for four touchdowns, while adding 50 rushing yards and a score. Sophomore running back Quinshon Judkins added 177 yards on 33 rushing attempts, along with 2 touchdowns. LSU was able to take the lead into halftime, out-scoring Ole Miss 21-10 in the second quarter. Senior quarterback Jayden Daniels threw two of his four touchdown passes in the second frame, finishing with 414 yards on the day. LSU was able to throw and run the ball just as effectively as Ole Miss, with leading rusher Logan Diggs going for 101 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. Both teams combined for 1,343 yards, and it felt like whoever possessed the ball last would come out the victor. Ole Miss trailed 42-34 heading into the fourth, but was able to outscore the Tigers 21-7 in the final frame. Jaxson Dart led an eight-play, 82-yard touchdown drive with 39 seconds remaining to take the lead, finding senior wide receiver Tre Harris on a wide-open screen play for the winning score. The Tigers drove down the field quickly on their ensuing drive, but failed to convert on an end zone shot as time expired. Ole Miss (4-1) jumps four spots in the AP Poll to No. 16 after this nailbiter. LSU (3-2) saw a significant drop-off of ten spots, all the way down to No. 23.\n\nNo. 11 Notre Dame Holds off No. 17 Duke, 21-14\n\nNotre Dame found themselves up early in a scrappy contest in North Carolina. After an impressive opening drive capped off by an Audric Estime rushing touchdown, neither offense could get much going. Notre Dame was able to kick a field goal in the second quarter, which had them leading 10-0 heading into the halftime break. After another field goal from the Fighting Irish, Duke finally gave the home crowd something to cheer about. Late in the third quarter, running back Jordan Waters found the end zone from one yard out, cutting the lead to 13-7. Midway through the fourth, Duke quarterback Riley Leonard found receiver Jaquez Moore for a 3-yard touchdown to put the Blue Devils up by a single point. Leonard finished with a mediocre 134 yards passing, along with a touchdown and his first interception of the season. However, he was impressive on the ground, carrying the ball 18 times for 88 yards which led the team in rushing. After forcing a punt, Notre Dame found themselves taking over possession with 2:35 left in the game. Senior quarterback Sam Hartman led a 12-play, 97-yard touchdown drive ending in a 30-yard touchdown rush from Estime to win the game. Estime finished with 81 rushing yards on 18 attempts and two touchdowns. Hartman didn\u2019t blow up the stat sheet, but played mistake-free football throwing for 222 yards on 15 of 30 passing. Notre Dame (5-1) jumps up to No. 10 in the new AP Poll, just one spot away from their highest undefeated ranking of No.9. Meanwhile, Duke (4-1) drops two spots to No. 19 after a close, yet uninspiring loss.\n\nNo. 7 Washington Takes Down Arizona, 31-24\n\nHeisman candidate Michael Penix completed 30 of 40 passes for 363 yards to avoid a major upset in Tucson. Washington opened up the scoring early in the first with running back Dillon Johnson, who found the end zone from four yards out. Johnson was effective in both the run and pass game, totaling 139 yards on 21 total touches along with two touchdowns. Arizona quarterback Noah Fifita had an impressive statistical outing, going 27 of 39 for 232 yards and three touchdowns with only one pick. Arizona found immense success passing the ball by getting all their weapons involved, with four receivers totaling over 45 yards. Fifita found receiver Jacob Cowing for an 8-yard touchdown early in the second quarter, which helped the Wildcats stay in the game early. Cowing led all receivers with 8 catches for 61 yards. A third-quarter Dillon Johnson rushing touchdown put the Huskies up 28-10, but was quickly responded to on the ensuing drive by a Fifita touchdown pass to tight end Tanner Mclachlan. Washington was able to extend their lead by kicking a field goal early in the fourth quarter, and a last-second touchdown catch by Mclachlan made the score a bit more respectable. Washington found themselves in somewhat of a close game due to self-inflicted wounds, totaling 12 penalties for 125 yards and turning the ball over twice. Time of possession was as equal as it can get, as Arizona possessed the ball for just 18 seconds more. Washington (5-0) saw no movement from their No. 7 spot in the AP Poll. As for Arizona (3-2), a chance for spot in the poll is obviously long gone, but a hard-fought game against the highest-ranked team in their conference should serve as a moral victory.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of LA Memorial Stadium)\n\nBy Delaney Polocheck October 05, 2023 at 6:27 pm PDT\n\nOn Thursday, the Big Ten announced a new opponent lineup for the next five seasons, starting with USC\u2019s first year in the conference in 2024. The update made changes to a schedule previously released in June, which had to be revised in August after Washington and Oregon announced that they would also be joining the Big Ten in 2024 alongside USC and UCLA. The conference will be composed of a total of 18 schools, who will each play nine interconference games per season.\n\nUSC will host Nebraska, Penn State, Rutgers and Wisconsin at home in 2024 \u2014 an almost entirely new schedule compared to the June lineup which featured Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin. USC\u2019s 2024 away games will now feature conference matchups against Washington, UCLA, Minnesota, Michigan and Maryland \u2014 a total expected air travel distance of roughly 14,406 miles for the Trojans who were previously scheduled to play Northwestern, Purdue, UCLA, Maryland and Penn State.\n\n\u201cI honestly felt like from the West Coast piece, I think they did what they needed to do,\u201d USC Head Coach Lincoln Riley said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019re still going to play half of our games and, in most years, a little over half of our games on the West Coast, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be hurting for it here.\u201d\n\nBalancing travel by distance, region and time zones was a primary consideration for the Big Ten during schedule development, according to the conference\u2019s website. To design the lineup, the Big Ten debuted a new Flex Protect XVIII model, which \u201cfeatures a combination of protected opponents and rotating opponents for universities.\u201d\n\nThe protected opponents feature was another main concern for the Big Ten, as the conference struggled to balance historic rivalries with the introduction of new teams into the conference. Officials made the decision to \u201cprotect\u201d 12 rivalries, meaning that those matchups will be played every season. UCLA has been designated as USC\u2019s only rival, while Iowa has three and Michigan, Minnesota and Purdue each have two.\n\nBig Ten officials said they examined 262 models before deciding on the newly released schedule, which boasts no repeat matchups in the same location and ensures that every team will play each other at least twice over the five years. The conference\u2019s next big challenge is setting actual game dates, which are expected to be released later this year.\n```"}

He was 76. For nearly 30 years, Tyndall was the only full-time gynecologist at USC. Despite complaints dating back to the \u201890s, he was not suspended from the university in 2016 after a nurse reported him to a rape crisis center. Tyndall resigned from his position the following year.\n\nTyndall was set to go to trial next year for alleged sex crimes related to the care of 16 former patients, a small subset of the hundreds who have accused him of harassment, inappropriate touching and other misconduct. He pleaded not guilty in 2019, and was out on $1.3 million bail while awaiting trial at the time of his death.\n\nLeonard Levine, Tyndall\u2019s attorney, told the Los Angeles Times that he notified the court and will present Tyndall\u2019s death certificate at the next hearing. According to the Times, an autopsy will not be conducted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really sad day for survivors, because we\u2019re now denied justice,\u201d Audry Nafziger, a prosecutor and former patient who accused Tyndall of abuse, said in an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cThis case took more than five years, and four years to get the preliminary hearings completed on a handful of survivors.\u201d Nafziger said the case has been \u201cslow-walked\u201d ever since.\n\n\u201cAnd now, with Mr. Tyndall\u2019s death, the truth will never be publicly known,\u201d she said. \u201cHe took all of the secrets with him to the grave.\u201d Nafziger said Tyndall\u2019s death denies survivors the closure they would have received in open court by hearing how \u201cthis horrible situation evolved and occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the conclusion, where we believe he would have been justly convicted, we were denied the opportunity to see him put back in jail where he belonged because of the atrocious acts he committed against so many women,\u201d she said.\n\nIn February 2020, the university settled a class action lawsuit related to the accusations against Tyndall for $215 million.

Celia Porter, a sophomore majoring in music performance with an emphasis in voice, and a student in the popular music class this semester, said the work that goes into the performance is much more than memorizing a song.\n\n\u201cWe have to learn every song, detail for detail, articulation for articulation, note for note, rhythm for rhythm,\u201d said Porter. \u201cEverything needs to be exactly as it was played on the record.\u201d She said the preparation involves everyone in the show working together to ensure a pitch perfect show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the music all the time,\u201d Porter said. \u201cIt\u2019s about feelings, it\u2019s about people, it\u2019s about working together.\u201d\n\nSophomore Rachel Barton, another student in the popular music class, said her music performance major with an emphasis in songwriting gave her insight on how to best prepare. According to Barton, students in the class are assigned three different songs each week to learn throughout the semester. Two weeks before the showcase, students are given a few of the songs they have already practiced in class to perform for the showcase.\n\nThis year audience members can expect songs ranging from 70\u2032s classics to recent pop, she said. The vocal performers, outside of their individual preparation for the showcase, are also expected to get together with their classmates, assemble a band and coordinate practice time outside of class.\n\n\u201cThere are four vocalists, and two of them also play keys, and then a bass player, a guitar player and two drummers,\u201d Barton said of her band. \u201cSo eight people in my exact band, but we have some songs that need more vocalists or need an extra guitar player or some extra percussion.\u201d\n\nProfessor Chris Sampson, founder of the popular music major, emphasized how the course properly prepares students for their future career. According to Sampson, the major is built upon three pillars: emulation, assimilation and innovation.\n\n\u201cThe life and development of any popular music goes through that cycle in which we first learn by trying to copy \u2014 to emulate great examples,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the next step is assimilation, in which we practice these techniques that we learn over and over again until they become second nature. This practice is for us to have a breakthrough, to lead to the innovation stage.\u201d\n\nHe said at that stage the creation of new music \u201creflects our individuality\u201d by using techniques and traditions as a foundation. Students at the Thursday night showcase will be a representation of the emulation phase, said Sampson.\n\nSean Holt, professor of the popular music course, applauded his students for their hard work and tenacity ahead of the performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing the shifts that take place between their first semester of freshman year and their second semester of sophomore year,\u201d he said. \u201cThey take lots and lots and lots of time to memorize the songs from the scrap list, so I would say it\u2019s substantial the growth that occurs.\u201d\n\nHolt said he loves hearing from families that come to the showcase about the growth they\u2019ve noticed in the students performing from semester to semester.\n\nIn the end, it seems the hard work is worth it, said Barton. \u201cThe showcase is just one of the best parts \u2014 everybody has butterflies, and it\u2019s really a bonding experience,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel really proud that you got to this point, because it\u2019s a hard thing to put together in the amount of time you\u2019re doing it with the detail that you\u2019re doing it. It kind of keeps reminding you why you\u2019re here, and that you\u2019re so in love with what you\u2019re doing with music, with performing.\u201d```"}

The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis in 2005, questions the audience\u2019s capacity for forgiveness, faith and humanity through the use of flashbacks to an imagined childhood \u2014 including testimonies from figures such as Mother Theresa, Satan and Sigmund Freud. The play, currently running at USC\u2019s Bing Theatre, is set in a courtroom in purgatory and tells the story of a court case determining the fate of Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus\u2019 apostles. The USC School of Dramatic Arts opened the 10-show run Sept. 29.\n\nCo-director of the performance, David Warshofsky, who is also Theater Practice and Director of the MFA acting program, said the play\u2019s production was informed by some of the students\u2019 personal relationships with Guirgis. \u201cHe has come to rehearsals, he has come to see the show,\u201d Warshofsky said. \u201cHe has sat down with every member of the company after he saw the show and sort of talked to them and congratulated them and gave them notes and talked about the play and talked about the dramaturgy.\u201d\n\nMorgan Whittam, theater design major and costume designer for the production, said her work helps create characters and add to the visual storytelling effect, adding to Warshofsky\u2019s vision for the play. \u201cThe costumes were essential to the production, because they help make the characters who they are and help the audience understand who the characters are,\u201d she said. \u201cMy favorite thing we got to do in this show was we got to build a pair of wings for the actress who plays Gloria.\u201d\n\nWhittam said the play allows the audience to come to their own conclusions, depending on their personal experiences, since it focuses on \u201cthe gray area between the good and the bad, and how there is good within the worst of us and bad within the best of us.\u201d Warshofsky emphasized that one of the reasons why he loves theater and production is because the students \u201cdon\u2019t run from controversy.\u201d He envisions the audience having a wide range of reactions due to its \u201crevolutionary\u201d nature. \u201c[It] has the potential to be quite reactionary for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Brewer, freshman theater major with an emphasis in acting, attended the play on Monday. She found the performance \u201creally beautiful.\u201d \u201cAs someone who didn\u2019t know the Bible well I could still understand the story. The characters were so well developed by the actors,\u201d Brewer said.\n\nGeneral admission is $17, and tickets can be purchased online at the USC School of Dramatic Arts website, or at the door, depending on availability. The show runs through Oct. 8.\n```"}

He was 76 years old. Tyndall practiced at the campus health clinic for three decades, but, in 2019 he was charged with 27 felonies. His alleged crimes took place between 2009 and 2016. Tyndall vehemently denied the allegations against him. USC\u2019s 1.1-billion-dollar settlement involved thousands of women treated by Tyndall. It was the largest payout in higher education history.\n\nAccording to the L.A. County Medical Examiner\u2019s office, no autopsy was performed, and the death was reported by the LAPD as natural causes. Because Tyndall\u2019s criminal trial was scheduled to begin next year, survivors will no longer be able to get their day in court.\n\nAudry Nafziger is a former patient of Tyndall. She\u2019s now a sexual assault prosecutor. She always worried that before George Tyndall could be tried, he could pass away. Nafziger says...\n\nAudry Nafziger: And this possibility has always been on my mind why this case wasn\u2019t prioritized. Due to the fact of how many survivors there were and how old he was. It\u2019s very hard to understand because the lack of urgency from the district attorney\u2019s office led to this outcome that was really inevitable. That lack of urgency meant that most of thousands of women allegedly assaulted never even had their first hearings.\n\nNafziger: It\u2019s a really sad day for survivors because we\u2019re now denied justice. This case is more than five years in now and four years to get the preliminary hearings completed on a handful of survivors. You know, the LADA filed on just a handful of survivors by being presented with hundreds from the LAPD and the case has been slow walked to this point.\n\nSurvivor Audry Nafziger reflects on what today\u2019s news means to the survivors. Nafziger: And now with Mr. Tyndall\u2019s death. The truth will never be publicly known. He took all of the secrets with him to the grave.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nicole Bednar.\n```"}

Joe Biden: No. There will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration.\n\nThe Biden administration has been quietly moving forward with plans to fast-track border wall construction in Southern Texas. It\u2019s a far cry from his campaign promise to not build \u201canother foot\u201d back in 2020. The White House says they are addressing an \u201cimmediate need\u201d to reduce illegal crossings.\n\nThe Biden administration has waived 26 federal laws, including the Clean Air Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, to speed up the process. Since 2021, the number of people illegally crossing the border has surged. In the last year, that number has increased fivefold - from 4,000 to over 22,000 people.\n\nAnnenberg Media Center director and longtime former political journalist Christina Bellantoni says that the administration is trying to appeal to more right-wing voters.\n\nChristina Bellantoni: They\u2019re not as worried about that Democratic progressive vote. They want to show, particularly as Republicans increasingly say, \u201cso many people coming over the border, so much crime, so many problems, so much despair, you got to do something about immigration enforcement.\u201d\n\nThis one small thing is not going to break President Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, but it will irritate his supporters and, in the end, it\u2019s going to inflame the right.\n\nWith greater numbers of migrants comes ballooning housing costs. Cities across America have struggled to deal with the sudden influx, and New York City alone expects to pay twelve billion dollars over the next three years to house their migrants.\n\nSome high-ranking Democrats are joining Republicans in pressuring the Biden administration to take more decisive action on immigration.\n\nBellantoni: You have heard some Democratic politicians saying, \u2018we\u2019ve got to do something\u2019 but for the most part that line is always comprehensive immigration, you can\u2019t do one thing without the other. You can\u2019t just build a wall without policies in place to support people who are already here.\n\nBiden told reporters this morning that there was nothing he could do to stop the construction. He also admitted that border walls are ineffective.\n\nJoe Biden: I tried to get them to reappropriate, to redirect that money. They didn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t.

The park was named after the first Black mayor of the city of Inglewood, Edward Vincent Jr.\n\nBy Sarah Arencibia\nOctober 05, 2023 at 3:37 pm PDT\n\nThe first of its kind, Woodlums stands as the only club at USC focused on making nature and mindfulness practices accessible to the Black student community. \u201cThe only clubs out here on campus that do [this] are predominantly white, like the university,\u201d said Caleb Flenoury, a computer science major at USC and senior member of Woodlums.\n\nTaylor-Corrine Benton, an undergraduate African American studies major at USC, co-founded the club in the academic year 2022-2023 with fellow student Nia McMillan, in hopes of changing the conversations surrounding mental health, nature, and the Black community.\n\nAccording to Benton, the acting vice president of Woodlums, she \u201c[started] to become aware of how often the adage of \u2018that\u2019s white people shit\u2019 would finish a sentence\u201d when Black children were asked to share their thoughts on hiking and getting out into nature. Flenoury said that many Black people hold a lot of mixed feelings when it comes to nature, as it once had a hand in helping Black individuals escape enslavement, yet has also been associated with \u201cBlack people hanging from trees.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think that, especially when we take a look at how nature has been associated with Black people in the past, especially in America, I think it\u2019s important for us to understand how to rebuild it and...release a lot of stigmas that we might still have around it,\u201d Flenoury said.\n\nHistorically, Black and Brown communities have had less access to nature due to certain systemic environmental racism practices such as redlining neighborhoods to situate these communities closer to industrial development, highways, and oil and gas infrastructure. According to a report drafted by the Hispanic Access Foundation and the Center for American Progress, \u201ccommunities of color are almost three times more likely than white communities to live in \u2018nature deprived\u2019 areas.\u201d\n\nEspecially in places such as \u201cConnecticut, Kentucky, Massachusetts and New York, well over 90 percent of people of color live in heavily modified, nature-poor neighborhoods... and less than 15 percent of primarily white communities are so heavily nature deprived,\u201d according to National Geographic.\n\nAccording to Flenoury, Woodlums\u2019 mission is to get Black people reconnected with these natural green spaces they have been historically and systemically deprived of. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to end environmental racism, but we are doing our part in dismantling it by taking Black people, especially Black kids, Black SC... out on restorative and nature-based outings, because that\u2019s the first thing you can do,\u201d Benton said.\n\nFlenoury said, \u201cthere\u2019s definitely space for us in nature to claim and I feel like Woodlums is an active step in claiming it.\u201d\n\nNatalia Williams, an undergraduate chemical engineering major at USC and new member of Woodlums, said that the club has helped her find peace of mind by bringing her out of the school and city environment and into a space where she can take a break and breathe.\n\nFlenoury said mindfulness and nature are very connected with each other, as nature provides a way for people to visualize their thoughts and feelings in an understandable way. He said, \u201cit\u2019s the ultimate calmness, just feeling as a part of nature, feeling like a tree, like my leaves are like my thoughts, you just let them fall when they can. You can\u2019t really rip them off. You just let the wind take them.\u201d\n\nTo many members, Woodlums has become a place not just to experience nature, but to exercise mindfulness and nurture their mental well-being, practices they had been deprived of in their day-to-day lives before joining the club.\n\n\u201cGetting in touch with nature, getting in touch with anything, to me... that sounds soft. And I feel like masculinity, especially in the Black community, is very hyperbolized, it\u2019s very strong and rigid,\u201d Flenoury said.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see many Black men on campus that I know feel like they align with...getting in touch with nature.\u201d\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, \u201cBlack men are...more likely than White men to endorse aspects of traditional masculine ideology, such as the need to act tough and in control and to avoid emotional expression\u201d in order to \u201c\u2018stave off societal pressures and oppression.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, as a queer man, Flenoury said he has felt less pressure to be masculine, as people often expect him to be more feminine. He said that being queer forced him to get in touch with himself and his mental health very early on, as he had to confront the thoughts he had in his head in order to become comfortable in his skin.\n\nMindfulness looks different to everyone, and everyone\u2019s journey to it is different. Flenoury said he didn\u2019t get into mindfulness until college, during his second semester of freshman year.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have that word in my vocabulary. I only got mindfulness [in my vocabulary] within... the past two years,\u201d Benton said.\n\nNo matter one\u2019s gender, sexual orientation or experience with mindfulness, Woodlums is a welcoming space for all Black students. The club\u2019s emphasis on mindfulness encourages self-expression and individuality.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in tune with your body, you have more trust within yourself and your authenticity can shine louder,\u201d Benton said.\n```"}

Here\u2019s everything you should know. \n\nBy Yvonne Abedi October 05, 2023 at 2:01 pm PDT\n\nWhether you watched \u201cLoki\u201d because you have a crush on Tom Hiddleston or are a Marvel junkie, like me, the show is set to return to your screens tonight on Disney+ at 6 p.m. PST. The upcoming season will consist of six episodes that will drop each week on Thursdays. Sorry binge watchers, you\u2019ll just have to be patient.\n\nThe trailer shows Loki and Mobius back together working to stop another multiversal war from happening. In season one, Loki successfully stole the Tesseract during \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d transporting himself to another timeline. He eventually is caught by the Time Variance Authority (TVA) because he altered the timeline.\n\nFor first-time watchers and those in need of a recap before tonight, here\u2019s the rundown of last season: Mobius is the Time Variance Authority agent that was assigned to Loki\u2019s case when he first came into the TVA, which later becomes his partner in crime as they try to uncover the truth behind the TVA. There was a time when the multiverse existed peacefully until war broke out. This resulted in the Time Keepers, heads of the TVA, creating the Scared Timeline, to maintain balance and order. But as a result of the timeline, multiple versions of a person exist within the universe, better known as time variants. These variants can\u2019t interact or deviate outside of their controlled stories or they split the timeline creating the multiverse. This is where the TVA comes in and erases their existence from the timeline to restore peace.\n\nAfter working with Mobius to find Sylvie (the female variant of Loki), the two begin to form a friendship, leaving Loki conflicted with his moral compass. But in the end, he \u201cturns on\u201d Mobius and the TVA to follow Sylvie and learn whether he can trust her or not. During this time alone, the two begin to grow closer and form a romantic connection. This connection is unorthodox because variants are never supposed to meet and more importantly, fall in love. A moment shared between Loki and Sylvie creates a nexus event, or a new timeline, which leads to their capture by the TVA sending them into confinement.\n\nLoki tries to reconcile with Mobius by telling him all TVA agents are variants whose memories have been erased by the Time Keepers. Mobius refuses to believe him until he comes to the discovery on his own. They want more answers, so Mobius teams up with Loki and Sylvie to stop Judge Renslayer, the head of TVA, and the Time Keepers. They discover the Time Keepers are a hoax and that something bigger has been controlling the timeline for all these years. Before they can take action they are all sent away to a world of banished Lokis, by Judge Renslayer.\n\nWith the help of the Loki variants and Mobius, Sylvie and Loki escape to find \u201cHe Who Remains,\u201d the controller of the timeline. He gives Loki and Sylvie an ultimatum of killing him or for them to take over the timeline. Killing him would not only unleash the multiverse, but also his evil variant, Kang the Conqueror, who was the reason for the initial multiversal war. Sylvie allows her anger to get the best of her and kills \u201cHe Who Remains,\u201d after distracting Loki with a kiss, unleashing all the bad that\u2019s to come.\n\nSo, now that we\u2019ve covered the basics, let me prepare you for what\u2019s to come. In season two, Loki will be \u201ctimeslipping\u201d into other worlds both past and present; where he has seen the destruction of the world time and time again. He\u2019s determined to save the world in the battle for the soul of the Time Variance Authority after it was taken over by Kang the Conqueror. Mobius and Loki \u2014 aka the dream team \u2014 have returned in addition to Hunter B-15, Sylvie, Judge Renslayer and Miss Minutes. New characters like OB and Victor Timely are joining this season, alongside more that haven\u2019t yet been disclosed.\n\nAfter a shocking season-ending kiss between Loki and Sylvie, Loki\u2019s love life is also a topic up for discussion. Many fans, including myself, hope to see Mobius and Loki end up together after seeing their chemistry as friends. Although Loki falling in love with Sylvie (quite literally himself) sounds like something he\u2019d do, the love story of Mobius and Loki would be \u201cout of the cards\u201d and something people would want to see.\n\nThe nature of the TVA is a big discussion as well, after agents discovered the truth surrounding the agency. Kang the Conqueror is now the overseer for the TVA, so what does this mean for the future of the multiverse? Fans are excited to see what variants of Kang the Conqueror, Loki will face during his travel through time. We\u2019ve already seen a sneak peak of Victor Timely, will they be able to withstand his raft. As you can see, all the characters have a lot to face after season one, so tune in tonight to see how they fare in their fight to save the world.\n```"}

Lek\u2019s impeccably detail-oriented art draws inspiration from her Cambodian-American identity\u2014an identity she once struggled to embrace while studying at Long Beach Community College. Now, Lek prefers to let her art do the talking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t always have the words to articulate the space I\u2019m floating in, but it just seems like the paintings do such a great job in expressing that,\u201d she shared. \u201cOnce I left school, with no eyes on me, I finally was able to comfortably unravel what it is that I represent in my own studio.\u201d\n\nAs a first-generation American, Lek relayed the importance of driving microcultural narratives full speed into artistic spheres.\n\n\u201cMy work is usually set in a domestic space because my conversation is built around family and history,\u201d said Lek.\n\nThe now 30-year-old painter strides into \u201cMade in L.A.\u201d with confidence and feels proud to be in a show that puts her work in dialogue with the diverse lived experiences of Angelenos.\n\n\u201cRefuge,\u201d one of Lek\u2019s featured paintings, is composed from her father\u2019s memories of The Khmer Rouge. The painting depicts a younger generation of women looking through a mirror at an explosion in the landscape of Cambodia. This is Lek\u2019s way of bridging the narrative between older generations and the generations to follow.\n\nLos Angeles, Mexico City. Tidawhitney Lek, b. 1992. Refuge, 2023.

He left the exhibition moved by the storytelling abilities present in the figuration landscapes of painter Michael Alvarez.\n\n\u201cMichael [Alvarez\u2019s] work is just beautiful,\u201d Hargis said. \u201cHe really tells a story about his upbringing in Los Angeles and physically seeing the different materials he molds into his work gives it so much more complexity.

Having gone from attending art school at UCLA to now curating artwork for the Hammer feels like a full-circle moment, as Nawi said she now enjoys \u201ctalking about art rather than making [it].\u201d\n\nAlongside her co-curator Pablo Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez, Nawi conducted hundreds of artist interviews to curate this year\u2019s show. Ultimately, they selected work that would seamlessly blend into one another and prompt storytelling from various pockets of L.A..\n\nNawi knows that this exhibition alone cannot speak for every artist in L.A. However, she and Ram\u00edrez are optimistic that this exhibition will foster curiosity.\n\n\u201cOur hope is you could come see \u201cMade in L.A.\u201d and then go back out into L.A. and see a hundred other artists and have some context for what they are doing in their practice.\u201d\n\nWhile the primary focus of this particular \u201cMade in L.A.\u201d show is the art on display, the Hammer will also host a variety of public programs, including performances, artist talks and screenings. Events begin on Tuesday, Oct. 10. with a guided discussion on \u201cEastside Sound: Lowrider & Soul.\u201d The full list of events is posted on the Hammer Museum\u2019s website.\n```"}

We need to be clear that our fight is in our buildings, in the streets and in the neighborhoods. We will fight every eviction.\u201d\n\nProtesters march on a street in Boyle Heights.\n\nCarrying signs in both English and Spanish, the tenants organized in groups and assembled at Hollenbeck Park before marching to City Councilmember Kevin de Le\u00f3n\u2019s office. There, the LATU briefly clashed with the Los Angeles Police Department when the police attempted to arrest a member of the crowd.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, the rent in L.A. County has skyrocketed: The average rent for an apartment in L.A. jumped 17% from the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022, according to the Los Angeles Times. Although the minimum wage for L.A. increased from $15 per hour to $16.90 in September, the increase in salaries is nowhere close to the spike in the cost of living.\n\nA protester, whose nom de guerre is Valentine, stands at the intersection of Soto St. and Cesar Chavez Ave.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a growing contradiction between what the crisis looks like and what politicians are willing to do,\u201d said Anne Oichier, one of the protest organizers. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s this move to act like the pandemic is over, everything is back to normal. But we know that \u2018normal\u2019 for a lot of people was already a challenge.\u201d\n\nSince the start of 2023, rent growth in L.A. County has stagnated with less than half a percent decrease in median rent. However, the median rent in the county is 37% higher than the national average, and L.A. ranks 21st on the list of most expensive rent in largest cities in the U.S., according to Apartmentlist.com.\n\nA protester kneels with his signs staked in the ground at Hollenbeck Park.\n\nHowever, the origins of the rent crisis go back further than the pandemic. Boyle Heights has long been known as a diverse neighborhood, and the city was the result of politicians\u2019 efforts to segregate the L.A. population. Boyle Heights was the center of the Chicano Movement, which began in the 1960s. As of 2017, 93% of Boyle Heights residents are of Hispanic or Latine origin, but the city\u2019s residents have faced gentrification and rising prices for decades.\n\nThe inhabitants have protested the creation of the San Bernardino 10 Freeway, art galleries and most recently, the Weird Wave Coffee shop.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be pushed out of their neighborhood that they\u2019ve had as their little bastion for decades, and the whole reason they\u2019re in this little bastion is because of redlining,\u201d said Danny Estrada, a participant in the protest. \u201cIt would be a tragedy to lose this place through the same forces that brought them here in the first place.\u201d\n\nResidents from Boyle Heights hold a sign in front of Kevin de Le\u00f3n\u2019s office.\n\nAfter the protest, the Los Angeles Housing Department released a statement: \u201cThere has not been a 9% rent increase voted on by LAHD. The annual allowable rent increase is publicized annually by LAHD based on the formula established in the [rent stabilization ordinance]. The Los Angeles City Council has requested a report on formula results and costs, which will be conducted by an outside consultant and will be provided ... by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nUSC has made several expansions, the most recent being the demolishing of the non-affiliated University Village in 2014 to make room for USC Village. The university had to make concessions to the community and the United Neighbors In Defense Against Displacement (UNIDAD) to receive approval from the City Council for the construction of the USC Village. UNIDAD feared that the university\u2019s land additions would increase gentrification and displacement in the neighborhoods surrounding the University Park Campus.\n\nUSC also has a foothold in Boyle Heights with the university\u2019s Health Sciences Campus (HSC). In April 2022, USC President Carol Folt announced a notion to expand the size of HSC.\n\n\u201cThere used to be an entire neighborhood under that campus,\u201d said Estrada.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A photo of a protestor was removed from this article, after Annenberg Media received word that their safety was in danger.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)\n\nBy Heather Mimikos and Amanda Murphy\nOctober 05, 2023 at 12:55 pm PDT\n\nPeople gathered in Vatican City Wednesday, listening closely as Pope Francis expressed his determination for restructure and unity within the Catholic Church. The Vatican gathering, or Synod, is the first event in a process that will span over two years. It opened with a focus on tackling prevalent issues like acknowledging women\u2019s contributions to the church and welcoming LGBTQ+ and divorced members.\n\nPope Francis opened the meeting by stressing the importance that \u201ceveryone, everyone, everyone,\u201d or \u201ctutti, tutti, tutti,\u201d is welcome.\n\nUSC Caruso Catholic Center President, Jamie Cappetta, said he hopes that the result of an important meeting that started Wednesday in Vatican City will inspire the community to be \u201cloving and listening and open to other viewpoints than our own.\u201d\n\nReligious students and South Los Angeles community members alike agree, citing a new, reformed future in religion.\n\n\u201cThis conversation is amazing because it needs to be had, [and] it should have been out a long time ago,\u201d said senior and biomedical engineering major Hayes Waycaster, who grew up Roman Catholic in Mississippi. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to fix any of the religious trauma that they have already caused...[or] any of the religious turmoil that surrounds women\u2019s rights and gay rights around the world...but I think that it\u2019s a very necessary conversation to be had.\u201d\n\nCappetta said he believes young adults are not fully active or aware of what\u2019s happening within the Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cFor...Gen Z\u2019s, I think it\u2019s lower on the radar,\u201d Cappetta said. \u201cUSC students in general won\u2019t be that engaged with what\u2019s going on at the Vatican.\u201d\n\nStill, the conversations happening in the Vatican city might inspire some small changes within the community, Cappetta said.\n\n\u201c[If] these two different kinds of opinions about church teachings were to come together and listen, actually listen to one another, and reflect and pray and have opportunities for respectful disagreement back and forth,\u201d Cappetta said, \u201cthat could potentially be an opportunity for outsiders to be like, at least the church is willing to engage in dialogue and not always point the finger.\u201d\n\nThe Synod has drawn criticism from certain chief officials of the Catholic church and conservatives alike. Pope Francis has been criticized since the Synod\u2019s announcement, and some students find the discussion of LGBTQIA+, women and divorced members in Catholicism forced.\n\nSophomore Gracie Garrett, who grew up Catholic, is critical of the Church\u2019s statements: \u201cI do feel like it kind of seems artificial, considering they\u2019re only doing it now probably because of social, civil pressures,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re trying to stay with the times.\u201d\n\nWith the Church moving slowly, as Cappetta said, these conversations could bring hope to women and other members being highlighted in this meeting.\n\nOpportunities for women to be deacons \u2014 church officers who are not priests but would help with the shortage of priests as they could step in \u2014 would give women the recognition for the roles that they have already been fulfilling.\n\n\u201cThe Holy Spirit only works through honest dialogue as opposed to attacks,\u201d Cappetta said. \u201cSo I feel like if our USC community here can try to do what the Synod is doing on a global level, then that\u2019s a success.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as October 05, 2023 at 12:03 pm PDT\n\nAfter coming up short in the FIBA World Cup this past summer, Team USA is looking to bounce back for the 2024 Paris Olympics with some old familiar faces \u2014 possibly including one former Trojan. Previous USC basketball player and six-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan recently said in an interview with Mark Medina of SportsKeeda, \u201cI\u2019m always for it. I\u2019d love to be a part of it. I\u2019d love to be able to represent the country again. It\u2019s definitely an honor. If I\u2019m asked to be part of the pool that can compete for it, I\u2019m definitely in.\u201d\n\nDeRozan, 33, has spent his last two seasons with the Chicago Bulls where he was selected as an All-Star in back-to-back seasons. Last season, he averaged 24.5 points on an efficient 50.4% from the field, ranking as the second best percentage in his 14-year career. He also grabbed 4.5 rebounds and dished 5.1 assists per game.\n\nIn one year at USC, DeRozan was a Pac-12 All-Freshman and led the Trojans to their first ever Pac-12 Tournament title. His play as a freshman got him selected with the ninth overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe Los Angeles native was part of the gold-medal team in the 2016 Rio Olympics, coming off the bench as a scoring option for the second unit with his staple midrange jump shot. After the NBA\u2019s media day on Tuesday, DeRozan wasn\u2019t the only one to express interest in getting back on the court to represent the country. Golden State\u2019s Steph Curry, Lakers\u2019 Lebron James, and Suns\u2019 Kevin Durant were among the stars wanting to return to the global stage.\n\n\u201cI will play in the Olympics next year,\u201d Durant said on Sun\u2019s media day. Team USA has come away with the gold in the last four Olympics. For a lot of the older stars in the league like DeRozan, this could be a final chance to taste gold.

In the offseason, we saw Daniel Jones and Joe Burrow land massive contract extensions securing their place as the franchise quarterbacks for the next several seasons. Jones signed a four-year, $160 million dollar extension in March, paying him $40 million a year. And the Giants still have yet to score a touchdown in two home games at Metlife this season. I am starting to wonder where all of the Giant fans went after this offseason.\n\nIn the biggest mystery of the season so far, Joe Burrow has not played anywhere near the level that got him the richest contract in NFL history, paying him $275 million over five years. Two years removed from their Super Bowl appearance versus the Rams, the Bengals have struggled to see any success and especially very little from their core trio of Burrow-Chase-Higgins. Injuries plague the team early, but a 24-point loss to the Titans gives reason to sound the alarms sooner rather than later. At this point, we might need Scooby-Doo and his crew to solve this mystery.\n\nAll quarterbacks aren\u2019t made the same and there is certainly fair criticism for the stragglers. However, it\u2019s never the job of a sports journalist to push an answer upon an athlete. Former Patriots player and now co-host for Sunday Night Football postgame, Rodney Harrison, crossed that line. After the Chiefs\u2019 23-20 win on Sunday night, defensive lineman Chris Jones joined the SNF postgame show to discuss the win. Harrison referred to Jets quarterback Zach Wilson as \u201cgarbage,\u201d trying to get Jones to agree with him on his stance. Jones did a great job at not buying into this nonsense, and instead praising Wilson for his play. It\u2019s a horrible look on Harrison, but also the rest of the crew on the show that at no time tried to intervene with Harrisons\u2019 comments.\n\nLast week I returned to form with some better meals, going 2-1 on the week. Outside of the disaster of a dish from the Miami Dolphins, the Chargers and Lions had customers leaving tips. This week we got some spicy dishes lined up, so get some ice water and ice cream.\n\nFirst Course | Houston Texans (2-2) vs. Atlanta Falcons (2-2), 10:00 a.m. PDT, FOX\n\nA showdown of two top-ten picks from this year\u2019s draft, Houston\u2019s C.J. Stroud and Atlanta\u2019s Bijan Robinson. Both guys have shined early for their teams and contributed in big ways. Stroud has looked great in four games, showcasing his arm talent that made him a top-5 draft pick. He currently leads all rookies in passing yards (1,212), ranking fourth among all quarterbacks. Robinson is still doing what he did in college \u2014 making defenders look silly. In last week\u2019s game versus the Jaguars, Robinson did his best A.I. impression with a nasty  crossover resulting in the defender touching earth.  In four games, he has 318 yards on 53 carries, averaging an extraordinary six yards per carry as a rookie.\n\nThe Falcons and Texans are trending in two different directions at the moment. With a blowout win over the Steelers, the Texans recorded their first home win and back-to-back wins since late 2021. On the other hand, the Falcons have skidded after starting off 2-0. The Falcons struggled to get anything going against both the Lions and Jaguars, scoring a total of 13 points in their last two games.\n\nFries: Nico Collins, Texans wide receiver\n\nDuring the offseason, Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans believed the receiver corps would \u201csurprise a lot of people,\u201d which on paper, was full of unproven guys. Out of the pack, third-year Nico Collins has done his best to echo the sentiment from his head coach with his play this season. In four games, he has already found the end zone three times, matching his season total from last year.\n\nDessert: I\u2019m riding with C.J. Stroud and the Texans.  The past two weeks for the Texans have only been up, and the Atlanta Falcons coming off little rest following a tiring London game spells trouble. With a win the Texans can secure their first three-game winning streak since 2018.\n\nSecond Course | Philadelphia Eagles (4-0) vs. Los Angeles Rams (2-2), 1:05 p.m PDT, FOX\n\nIt\u2019s 2016, and the Rams and Eagles look to have drafted their franchise quarterbacks with the top two picks. Fast forward seven years and Jared Goff has found a new home in Detroit, while Carson Wentz is still looking for another chance in the league. The last time these two teams matched up in 2020, Goff and Wentz were still their quarterbacks. Now it is Jalen Hurts and Matthew Stafford, who both have led their teams to Super Bowls in the past few years, who will lead the Eagles and Rams out this Sunday.\n\nThe Rams have been one of the more shocking teams to start the season, considering the turnover from last season. The surprising start has come off the heels of Puka Nacua and Kyren Williams who have not just had fantasy owners in love, but every Rams fan. In every game this season, the Rams have been competitive and physical with their opponents. However, keeping Stafford up has been a problem, with nine sacks already on the year.\n\nOn the flip side, the Eagles remain one of two undefeated teams. The run game has carried over from last year\u2019s success \u2014 the team currently ranks second league-wide in rushing yards \u2014 but Hurts has struggled to find lots of rhythm in the passing game.\n\nMac and cheese: Puka Nacua, Rams wide receiver\n\nOutside of Taylor Swift, Puka might be NFL social media page\u2019s favorite person. The fifth-round pick from this year\u2019s draft has shone with every opportunity he has had. In fact, he already owns an NFL record for most receptions (39) through the first four games of a career. Whether Kupp is back or not this week, he has proved to be another viable option for Stafford in the Rams offense.\n\nDessert: FLY EAGLES FLY.  The plethora of weapons on the Eagles offense between Jalen Hurts, D\u2019andre Swift, AJ Brown, and Devonta Smith is going to have the Rams defense choosing their poison. Hurts and Swift should be utilized a lot in the ground game against a weaker Rams run defense.\n\nThird Course | Dallas Cowboys (3-1) vs. San Francisco 49ers (4-0), 5:20 p.m PDT, NBC\n\nThis date on my calendar has been circled since the NFL\u2019s initial schedule release this summer, a rematch of last year\u2019s divisional round playoff where the 49ers won a sloppy 19-12 game. Back for a third game in three seasons, there is vengeance on the Cowboys\u2019 minds.\n\nDallas\u2019 defense has been the MVP of the team so far, racking up 14 sacks, 12 turnovers and three defensive touchdowns. Leading the way is last year\u2019s runner-up DPOY Micah Parsons, who has seemingly gotten better every year. The defense will have to play a huge part in order to secure a big conference win on the road.\n\nThe 49ers currently have the most complete roster in the NFL. From talent on the field to the coaching staff, there are not many flaws to be found. Leading the charge is none other than Mr. Irrelevant quarterback Brock Purdy. In the 11 games he has started and finished, Purdy is a perfect 11-0. But there hasn\u2019t been much required of him with all of the supporting cast around \u2014 Deebo Samuel, Brandon Aiyuk, George Kittle and Christian McCaffery who all have special ways of dismantling defensive schemes.\n\nGarlic bread: Christian McCaffery, 49ers running back\n\nIt is still unbelievable that the 49ers were able to land the league\u2019s best running back for just a 3rd and 5th-round pick. His performance in last Sunday\u2019s game versus the Cardinals (over 100 yards and four total touchdowns) makes it even more of a head-scratcher.\n\nDessert: HOW BOUT THEM \u2018BOYS.  There is one thing that always travels in the NFL, and that is defense. Brock Purdy has had his way with teams that aren\u2019t on the same level as the 49ers, but for the first time this season, he\u2019ll face a dominant defensive unit. But we all know it comes down to Dak Prescott.\n\nLast week\u2019s record 2-1\n\nOverall record 4-5\n\nRecipe of the week\n\nAn air fryer is an essential part of any college student\u2019s kitchen appliances. As an owner of one myself, it quite literally makes anything you can imagine. For this week\u2019s game day recipe, I present an  air fryer chicken sandwich .\n\nIngredients\n\n2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 16 ounces\n1 cup 1% buttermilk\n1 cup pickle juice\n1 large egg, beaten\nKosher salt\n1/2 cup all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper\nolive oil spray\n4 tablespoons light mayo\n1 tablespoon sriracha\n12 dill pickle chips\n4 whole wheat potato rolls, such as Martins\n\nDirections\n\nPound out the thicker end of the chicken breast to make the thickness even on both ends, about 1/2-inch thick, this will ensure the chicken cooks even, then cut each breast in half to make 4 pieces. Whisk buttermilk and pickle juice in a bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat; cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 6 hours or overnight. Combine flour, garlic powder, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk egg in another bowl. Line the air fryer basket with an air fryer parchment liner (these are sold on Amazon, look for parchment with the holes). Working with one chicken breast at a time, dip chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess. Then into the egg and back into the flour, using the back of a fork to coat well so it adheres. Shake excess then transfer to the prepared air fryer basket and spray tops with oil. (For best results, let the chicken sit 15 minutes or refrigerate longer to help hold the breading on) Air fry in batches as needed 380F until golden and cooked through, about 15 to 18 minutes, turning halfway depending on the thickness, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 165\u00b0F. Combine sriracha and mayo in a small bowl. To assemble sandwiches, place the mayo on the top of the rolls, place the chicken on the bottom roll followed by the pickle chips and top rolls.\n```"}

Unsurprisingly, he was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week.\n\n\u201cI think, honestly, I\u2019ve just been better at being consistent,\u201d Williams said after practice on Wednesday. \u201cJust delivering the ball on time to people so they can go make plays and do their job.\u201d\n\nThe team put together a show-stopping first half in Boulder, notching 34 points before halftime and limiting Colorado to only 14. Williams spread the ball around well, completing touchdown passes to five different targets. Redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd also scored on an electrifying 27-yard run. Afterward, former Trojan star running back Reggie Bush gave Lloyd some props on social media.\n\n\u201cI had the goosebumps,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cEveryone keeps saying [the touchdown run] is something Reggie Bush would\u2019ve probably did.\u201d\n\nMonheim had more praise for the running backs on his team. \u201cWe know these backs, man,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just gotta give them a shot, and they\u2019ll make things happen.\u201d\n\nThe second half against Colorado was a completely different story for USC. The Trojans didn\u2019t score at all in the fourth quarter, and they seemed unable to stop Colorado star Shedeur Sanders. The quarterback gained 371 yards on USC\u2019s defense and threw for four touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWhen we get our shots, we have to execute,\u201d Williams noted. \u201cWe have to be consistent, and we have to go out there and dominate to kill. ... That\u2019s the mindset.\u201d\n\nUSC is still undefeated this season as it looks ahead to Pac-12 rival Arizona (3-2, 1-1). However, there\u2019s still plenty of competition brewing, especially within the conference. The Associated Press Top 25 rankings shook up this week following USC\u2019s narrow win. The Trojans dropped a spot to No. 9 in the nation and were replaced at No. 8 by Pac-12 rival Oregon (5-0, 2-0). Washington occupies the No. 7 spot (5-0, 2-0). USC plays both teams at the beginning of November.\n\nDespite the team\u2019s defensive woes and the instability of college football rankings, there are several bright spots looking forward. Redshirt senior tight end Jude Wolfe scored his first touchdown of his career on Saturday after dealing with injuries for most of his tenure at USC. Senior receiver Brenden Rice has scored seven touchdowns through the first five games, and Williams has been connecting with his receivers better than ever.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, as a brother, as a player, I try to learn all my guys and find what works best for them,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI encouraged [junior receiver Mario Williams]. I told him, \u2018Just make the next one easy. Don\u2019t try and think too much, don\u2019t try and do too much. ... Be Mario Williams and go out there and make plays,\u2019 and he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got teammates that believe in me no matter what the situation is,\u201d Mario Williams added.\n\nThe Trojans kick off against Arizona at the Coliseum Saturday at 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel October 04, 2023 at 9:03 pm PDT\n\nWe roll on. Not to make you sad, but we\u2019re already over 20% done with the NFL regular season. Cherish every moment of football we have. Before you know it, it\u2019ll be spring and you\u2019ll be salivating over the NFL Combine and Draft to temporarily cure your cravings. More importantly, we\u2019re even closer to the fantasy playoffs. Believe it or not, most leagues\u2019 postseasons start in only 10 weeks. That means you only have so much time to turn your season around or bolster your roster before it\u2019s too late.\n\nThis week I\u2019ve got some longer term advice. Some moves you could make really soon that you might be thanking yourself for down the line...\n\nBack in Business\n\nLet\u2019s get the ball rolling with a couple notable names who could return to the field this week. First up: The one and only Jonathan Taylor. It\u2019s been a tumultuous offseason for Taylor and the Colts. He was at the center of this summer\u2019s running back controversy and even requested a trade from Indianapolis (which the team denied). There still seems to be some bad blood between the two parties, and the Colts have no interest in giving Taylor a new contract that would be to his liking. He was placed on the PUP (Physically Unable to Perform) list with an apparent injury (though I\u2019m skeptical given the drama) prior to the season, meaning he had to miss at least the first four games. The No. 1 pick in last season\u2019s fantasy drafts is eligible to return this week. Head coach Shane Steichen said earlier this week that Taylor was excited to get back on the field and would be practicing today. There\u2019s a chance he could even suit up this weekend.\n\nWhether Taylor does end up playing on the Colts this year or gets the trade he wanted remains to be seen. Either way, I think Taylor is worth taking a stab at, especially if your team has performed well the first few weeks and has some depth it can afford to ship off. Trade for Taylor while the price is still at its lowest. Once he either takes the field or joins a new squad, his value will likely skyrocket.\n\nJameson Williams is also eligible to suit up this weekend. The Lions wide receiver was still recovering from an ACL tear suffered in his final college season when he got drafted in 2022. As a result, he only played in six games during his rookie season last year. In fact, he caught just one pass in six games played: a 41-yard touchdown. He missed the first four games this season with a gambling suspension, and it is still unclear when he\u2019ll take the field. However, his one catch reminded everyone what a gifted pass-catcher he is. Williams has elite speed and is the perfect deep threat to complement USC alum Amon-Ra St. Brown, who does the majority of his work over the middle on short and medium routes. Detroit\u2019s offense is legit, ranking eighth in the NFL in points per game through the first four weeks. When Williams gets involved, they will be one of the most dangerous units in the league. He\u2019s going to feast when he finally gets a sustained chance. He\u2019s currently only rostered in 16.3% of ESPN leagues and that number likely won\u2019t jump up until he plays. If you\u2019ve got the room, he\u2019s worth stashing.\n\nAre the Jets Taking Off? Maybe?\n\nIt\u2019s hard for Jets fans not to overreact when Zach Wilson literally just outdueled Patrick Mahomes in primetime. The Chiefs may have won this game, but it was about as good of a loss as the Jets could have imagined. Not only did they nearly complete a 17-point comeback against the reigning Super Bowl Champs, but their Wilson didn\u2019t wilt under pressure and looked like a real NFL quarterback. It was reported that this game would determine whether Wilson was the starter moving forward. I\u2019d say completing 28-of-39 for 245 yards and two touchdowns answers that question.\n\nSlow your roll. I\u2019m not telling you to pick up Wilson off the waivers, and I would strongly advise against it. However, this could be a serious sign of life for the Jets offense. Wilson has always had the physical talent. His poor play was instead always the result of confidence issues and mental errors. It didn\u2019t help that after he was thrust back into the starting role this year, Jets offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett called an offense to try to protect Wilson. He didn\u2019t allow him to take shots downfield and seemed to try to lean on the run game to carry the offense. This doomed Wilson worse because the opponents weren\u2019t afraid about giving up deep balls and instead loaded up for the run. On Sunday night, Hackett let his young quarterback air it out and it worked out quite well.\n\nIf New York continues to call a similar offense and let Wilson play more freely, it could pay dividends for the skill players surrounding him. Do I think Wilson is \u201cThe Guy\u201d now? Not even close. Did he show signs that the Jets offense might not be dead in fantasy this season? Maybe. Improved quarterback play obviously bodes well for every skill player on the roster. Breece Hall will have more space to work with when the defense can\u2019t just stack the box. Garrett Wilson might actually get the ball thrown his way when he\u2019s open (which is pretty much all the time). Even Allen Lazard showed his promise as a deep threat and red zone target.\n\nDon\u2019t overreact and buy stock in every Jets player you can find. Speaking from the fan base, this could go right back to a disaster next week. However, if you like what you saw, this could be a good opportunity to buy low on some of these guys. Conversely, it may be a sell high spot. I really think it\u2019s a judgment call.\n\nNew York plays the Broncos this weekend. After the feud Sean Payton started with Hackett earlier this summer, I have no doubt the Jets will empty the tank in Denver. They\u2019re going to pull out all the stops and will be playing with a chip on their shoulder, looking to exact revenge for their coach. This means one of two things. The first scenario: the Jets stay hot and score plenty of points on a defense that\u2019s given up 98 in its last two contests. Scenario number two: Payton puts Wilson in a torture chamber and erases any positive mojo he had from his game prior. The moral of the story is, make your fantasy moves with the Jets before Sunday, because you may not have a chance afterwards.\n```"}

All the details on the \u2018One Piece\u2019 live action adaptation\n\nThe adaptation pays homage to the source material with the original Japanese voice actors\u2013but Netflix translations miss the mark.\n\nThe highly anticipated live-action adaptation of \"One Piece\" is now on Netflix. (Photo courtesy of Casey Crafford/Netflix)\n\nBy Alexandra Tan October 04, 2023 at 8:08 pm PDT\n\nLoguetown, twenty years ago. The sun, beating down in the square, off of the hundreds\u2014no, thousands of people clamoring together, the clinking of chains... \u201cWealth. Fame. Power. I found everything this world has to offer. Free yourselves. Take to the seas! My treasure is yours to find,\u201d said Gol. D. Roger, King of the Pirates, before his execution in Loguetown.\n\nSo begins Netflix\u2019s new live-action adaptation of the beloved, nearly three decades old and running manga series, \u201cOne Piece,\u201d by Eiichiro Oda. Rich in character and world-building \u2014 whimsical and spirited, the series is a timeless staple. Thus, the release of the live-action, starring I\u00f1aki Godoy as boisterous young upstart Monkey D. Luffy, Emily Rudd as sharp navigator Nami, Jacob Romero Gibson as sharpshooter Usopp, Taz Skylar as suave cook Sanji, and Mackenyu as \u201cPirate Hunter\u201d Roronoa Zoro, was simultaneously anticipated and feared by old and new fans alike.\n\nWould it be able to capture the way Luffy laughs, the sprawling scenes of Oda\u2019s fantastical world, Zoro\u2019s fierce loyalty and Usopp\u2019s impeccable comedic timing? What about Sanji\u2019s tendency to flirt, and Nami\u2019s heartbreaking backstory? Above all, how would the original theme of the source material, messages of freedom and dreams, translate into an adaption?\n\nUnlike Westernized remakes of Japanese material such as \u201cDeath Note\u201d (2017) and \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d (2017), the \u201cOne Piece\u201d live-action (OPLA) surprisingly delivers in most aspects, prominently in the development of the theme of \u201cdreams.\u201d Indeed, the show has been received generally well by fans, some even calling it the one that will \u201cbreak the curse\u201d of horrible anime adaptations.\n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t to say that \u201cOne Piece\u201d is perfect. Unfortunately, the crucial role of translation falls short of the mark. OPLA is unique in that the Japanese dub for the show was done by the anime\u2019s original voice actors, providing an authentic alternative to the original English version. However, for non-Japanese speakers that may want to enjoy the show with the original voice of Luffy (Mayumi Tanaka), and the rest of the Straw Hats, the question of how English subtitles can alter the message being sent across languages is raised.\n\nNetflix is no stranger to having a spotty track record with issues in translation, a popular example being the Korean thriller series \u201cSquid Game\u201d (2021), where the translation of honorific terms and other phrases had viewers complaining about the inauthenticity.\n\nAlthough certain dialogue inconsistencies can be overlooked for the sake of mundaneness, due to differences in conventional Japanese and English grammar rules, other, more pivotal scenes are not as forgiving. As someone who studies and speaks both Japanese and English, I wanted to consult a native speaker on this issue.\n\nFirst year Business of Cinematic Arts student Aditya Mishra, born and raised in Tokyo and a fan of the original manga/anime, says that although the translations improve throughout the show, they remain slightly awkward\u2014perhaps due to the differing sentence structure between the languages. In the Japanese language, sentences follow a subject, object and verb pattern, whereas English follows a subject, verb and object blueprint.\n\nWatching the show in the Japanese dub with English subtitles felt disjointed at times, and as a result, some important scenes lost their nuance and impact. A major example is Zoro\u2019s words to Luffy after swearing to stand by his side in episode six, where he says (in the Japanese dub) \u300c\u4eca\u65e5\u304b\u3089\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u304c\u6d77\u8cca\u738b\u306b\u306a\u308b\u305d\u306e\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u3001\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u6700\u5f8c\u307e\u3067\u3002\u300d This is translated in the English subtitles as, \u201cFrom now until the end. Until we find the One Piece or die trying,\u201d which unfortunately does not convey the full meaning.\n\nThe Japanese line doesn\u2019t mention the famed treasure \u201cOne Piece\u201d at all\u2013rather, it falls more along the lines of \u201cFrom this point on, until you (Luffy) become the King of the Pirates, until the very, very, end\u2013 (I will stand by you).\u201d Aside from lacking the nuance of this intimate declaration between captain and first mate, this translation also shifts the focus of the narrative. As is implied in the source material, Luffy\u2019s goal is not to only find the famed treasure and become the pirate king, but to become freedom itself. Thus, the subtitles and Zoro\u2019s \u201c...until we find the One Piece\u201d insinuate to the audience that the focus of the show is on the material treasure only, rather than Luffy\u2019s bonds with his crew, or his dream.\n\nThe main point is that although disjointed grammar can be overlooked, specific circumstances lack a very intense nuance that drives the plot, develops Luffy further, and imbues the material with more meaning, but unfortunately locks that meaning behind a caveat: it is only accessible to those that can speak the language.\n\nWhat Hollywood does not struggle with, however, is developing the concept of a \u201cdream.\u201d \u201cOne Piece\u201d may be a story about pirates, but it\u2019s also about courage \u2014 about reaching for the stars. This topic is ever present in the source material, and it is echoed nicely in the live-action as well. This was demonstrated in an added interaction between Zeff (Craig Fairbrass), former pirate captain turned owner of the Baratie restaurant, and Garp (Vincent Regan), vice-admiral of the Navy. Both men from the previous generation use the food as an allegory for the upcoming generation\u2013aged goods like them are better left to usher in the new light.\n\nIndeed, this rising of the youth continues throughout the show, reflected spectacularly in Koby\u2019s (Morgan Davies) decision to knock out marine Axe-Hand Morgan (Langley Kirkwood) in episode one, regardless of his desire to protect the weak under the Navy. While Luffy and the Straw Hats may be bringing in a new era of piracy based on dreams and friendship rather than the traditional plundering and swashbuckling; Koby acts as a foil, striving to remain strict to his moral code, and shifting the Marines into an improved system of moral justice, sincerity, and heart.\n\nAs the franchise continues to increase in popularity and as Netflix continues to adapt foreign media, the world becomes more culturally interwoven. It is essential to be conscious of the messages sent through this media and how they might be altered through the vehicle of language.\n\nNevertheless, regardless of OPLA\u2019s translational flaws, it undoubtedly houses tear-jerking triumphs that have set a new precedent for animanga adaptations to come. All persons involved in the project, from the showrunners to actors to Oda himself, dreamed about bringing such a hugely beloved classic to life, and they achieved just that, no matter the hurdles.\n\nAnd that\u2014as Luffy would say\u2014 is what matters, isn\u2019t it? Netflix has announced that the show will be renewed for a second season.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Tanya E. Flores)\n\nBy Alexandra Athon Diamant\nOctober 04, 2023 at 6:47 pm PDT\n\nIn a historic vote on Tuesday, Kevin McCarthy was removed from his position as Speaker of The House. The one-hundred-eighteenth Congress, which has a slight Republican Majority, is now challenged with replacing McCarthy. The Speaker of the House serves as third in line to the Presidency and has the ability to select who will serve on committees, a key role for members of congress and their individual paths to re-election.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s path to the speakership was not easy as it took fifteen rounds of voting and many concessions by the Republican California Representative before being approved. Many of these concessions favored far right representatives of the Republican Party including Matt Gaetz of Florida. The vote to remove McCarthy came after Gaetz deemed the Speaker out of line with the agreements he had made in order to be approved for the position.\n\nWe spoke with Dan Schnur, professor at USC Annenberg and Marshall and the Communications Director for John McCain\u2019s 2000 presidential campaign about this party ousting:\n\nDan Schnur: Oh, in any two party system, you\u2019re going to have very large differences between members of the same party ... And so it actually has become somewhat frequent, particularly in the Republican Party in recent years for its most conservative members to become harshly critical of their more centrist leaders. This is the most egregious example of that kind of internal fighting. But the fight itself is not all that unusual.\n\nAnd as these differences within party lines may not be so unusual, Schnur does find Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry of North Carolina\u2019s timeline to elect a new Speaker of the House to be unrealistic.\n\nDan Schnur: The acting speaker, Representative McHenry, has said that he wants to host a debate next Tuesday night with the candidates for speaker and have a vote the following day. That\u2019s a very, very ambitious timeline. And while it\u2019s not impossible, it would be very, very surprising if the Republican caucus was able to come together behind a candidate in only seven days.\n\nTwo members of congress have already put their names into the race for the Speakership, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio. There has also been buzz of former President Trump and Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic Representative from New York being considered for the position as well.\n\nExecutive Director of USC Dornsife\u2019s Center for the Political Future, Kamy Akhavan, adds to the sentiment of how difficult it could be to elect a new Speaker of the House.\n\nKamy Akhavan: It will be very difficult for any candidate to be able to get enough votes to make all the concessions necessary to fight all the fights with the far right and to perhaps make bridges with the Democrats and earn some of their votes. So I don\u2019t know what that path is going to look like for Scalise, for Jordan, or even for somebody who is not a member of Congress like President Trump.\n\nAs for what we should expect in the coming days, Akhavan believes it will be a tough road.\n\nKamy Akhavan: I know it will be fraught. I know it won\u2019t be pretty. I know it will be a sad reflection of our social division and political division. And and that\u2019s unfortunate, but that\u2019s. That\u2019s where we are.\n\nNext Wednesday, we\u2019ll see if that debate for Speakership will lead our Representatives to a speedy resolution.\n```"}

But for many students, Family Weekend comes without a family. The undergraduate USC student body is made up of 26.6% international students, making it difficult for their loved ones to attend due to travel accommodations.\n\nAnnenberg Media interviewed students whose family will not be making the trip to see how they feel about the upcoming weekend. Yifei Wang, a freshman studying sociology, proposed the idea that the university subsidize travel costs. \u201cMy parents are not coming because they\u2019re all the way from China and the plane ticket would be very expensive. I suggest the school started paying for international families\u2019 plane tickets during Family Weekend. Then they\u2019ll be here,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Wang\u2019s family will not be able to fly down, her and other students are making this Family Weekend their own through other forms of bonding. Wang said that she plans to hang out with her friends\u2019 parents and get to know them. Many students may be in the same boat. Andrea Salazar Lopez, a sophomore studying law, history and culture aims to make the most of her situation. \u201cEven if I\u2019m not going with my family, I [am] going with a lot of friends and making that family.\u201d\n\nMadeline Scanlon, a senior theater major from New York said, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to just come out for a weekend.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d want them to come. . . because it gets so stressful with all the different people here, and I think it\u2019s hard to have a good time.\u201d she said.

The USC Chinese Student and Scholars Association (CSSA) hosted the event at McCarthy Quad, which featured live performances, traditional games, mooncake tasting and a final prize for participants in the event.\n\nThe Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the most important festivals for Chinese people across the world. It takes place in month eight, day 15, of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, a day that the moon is said to be the brightest and the roundest. The symbol of the full moon represents the reunion of the family and the fullness of one\u2019s happiness and luck.\n\nGary Yang, a freshman studying design, said he would \u201ccheer with friends and family, and eat mooncakes and dishes together\u201d for the festival at home. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really good way for the students to get to know each other and also to feel like you belong here,\u201d said Ye Zhang, the vice head of the event planning department at CSSA.\n\nFor the event, CSSA included many Chinese traditional games, such as riddles, ring tossing, darting and pitch-pot, a game where players toss arrows into a pot or a jar. Ti jianzi is another popular game in which players kick a shuttlecock continuously, keeping it in the air while counting the number of consecutive kicks. From the games, players received tickets that they could exchange for mooncakes, stickers, Legos and even air fryers. The prizes seemed attractive to a lot of attendees.\n\n\u201cWe want to get the air fryer,\u201d Yang said. Jason Liu, a freshman studying cinema and media studies, said he was looking forward to \u201cwinning a lot of prizes.\u201d\n\nLive performances of bands and singers attracted many people to the quad. Eastern Chamber, a Chinese traditional instrument band, performed \u201cMing Yue Tian Ya\u201d and \u201cLu Zhou Yue,\u201d songs about Yue, meaning moon in Chinese, tied to the theme of the festival.\n\n\u201cOur \u2018pipa\u2019 actually had the string broken, but it did not affect a lot,\u201d said the president and bamboo flute player of Eastern Chamber, Alex Liu. The pipa is a traditional Chinese plucking instrument with four strings.\n\nHead of the CSSA Event Planning Department Yuanqi Xiong, a junior studying communication, said CSSA has held this event for three years so far. \u201cWe want to continue this tradition,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to have a place where Chinese students can gather together to play some traditional Chinese games and also to spread out Chinese culture outside of the Chinese international student community.\u201d\n\nAt the festival, people took time to celebrate the holiday with their friends and family. There were also guests who were not Chinese. James Cobb, a graduate student at USC studying quantum information systems, came to celebrate this holiday with his wife who is part of the CSSA.\n\nAccording to Zhang, CSSA has been planning this event since May. Standing in the quad on Sunday, Zhang said his favorite moment of the event was \u201cthe moment right now, because I see all the people coming here and having fun.

Animal Shelter on Sept. 13. Photo by Angelina Hicks\n\nBy Angelina Hicks\nOctober 04, 2023 at 4:55 pm PDT\n\nL.A. animal shelters are critically overcrowded and understaffed. The problem has gotten so bad that a trip down to one of the city-run shelters reveals the severity with just a quick glance around. L.A. Animal Services General Manager Staycee Dains describes this issue at the L.A. City Council\u2019s Neighborhoods and Community Enrichment Committee meeting this morning.\n\nDains: Right now we are putting animals in every single available cage. We are purchasing cages. We are using donated cages and crates \u2014 popping them up in the hallways and in areas where animals are not safely housed.\n\nDains says there\u2019s about one staff member for every 100 animals at any given time in the city\u2019s six shelters. The industry standard is one staff member for every 30 animals.\n\nTo address these issues, the city is considering a pause for new breeding permits. The neighborhoods committee voted unanimously to introduce this ordinance, which will be brought back to the full council at a future meeting for a more formal vote.\n\nHernandez: And as a city, we gotta step up. L.A. Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez says the city needs to do better to help animals in the shelters.\n\nHernandez: We can\u2019t keep trying to do this with band-aids when we got arterial bleeds happening.\n\nDains was appointed to the general manager role in June. Since she started, she\u2019s been working to address these issues across the city. Pausing the breeding licenses is just one aspect of the goals she\u2019s discussed over the past few months.\n\nDains: The importance of a moratorium is to signal to the community clearly that our shelters are not in any position to take in one more animal. Organizations that are very pro-breeding are not organizations that do anything to help animals in animal shelters. They\u2019re simply creating animals for us to kill later on.\n\nSpeakers at the meeting were concerned at the state of breeders in the city and called for more to be done than just pausing licenses. L.A. resident Daniel Guss said the issue goes beyond licensed breeders.\n\nGuss: You have a problem for overcrowding for backyard breeders and abandonment. There is a tire business in my neighborhood that has a breeder permit. A tire business that breeds pitbulls. It\u2019s nice to stop the breeder permits, but that\u2019s not the problem.\n\nMore than 1,000 permits have already been issued so far this year. Dains says there isn\u2019t any kind of oversight after a permit is issued. After applicants pay the $250 fee, they\u2019re given the permit without any other regulation besides a yearly renewal.\n\nSasha Abelson, an L.A. resident who runs a rescue in the city, says the lack of oversight is overwhelming local rescues who can\u2019t keep up.\n\nAbelson: We are, as rescues, battling every single day to try and provide free and low-cost spay and neuter, and the city is working against us by issuing these permits, and I don\u2019t understand why.\n\nIf approved, the ordinance will pause breeding licenses immediately until the shelter system\u2019s capacity falls below 75% full. It would also be automatically reinstated if the capacity rises above 75% once again in the future.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Angelina Hicks.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/04/the-pandas-are-leaving-a-farewell-to-chinas-iconic-ambassadors/", "response": "```\nThe pandas are leaving. With the contract between the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. and Chinese authorities coming to an end, all giant pandas there will leave by the end of this year. The pandas in the National Zoo have been on loan for 21 years. The National Zoo is one of the last two zoos in the United States that have pandas, along with the Atlanta Zoo. \u201cAll three pandas, Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and Xiao Qi Ji, are leaving for China,\u201d a National Zoo spokesperson told Annenberg Media. \u201cAccording to the contract, they will return on Dec. 7, but the specific departure date has yet to be determined.\u201d At that time, the Atlanta Zoo will be the only one in the U.S. with giant pandas. However, by the end of 2024, Atlanta\u2019s pandas will also return to their homeland. Other U.S. zoos that had giant pandas, including San Diego and Memphis, sent them back in 2019 and earlier this year, respectively.\n\nThe giant panda, an adorably clumsy kind of bear, was once an ambassador for China to showcase its friendly image abroad. The pandas at the National Zoo are also witnesses to this development of the U.S. and China\u2019s relationship. The National Zoo\u2019s first pair of giant pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, were given as gifts by Mao Zedong during President Nixon\u2019s historic visit to China in 1972. These two pandas were captured in the wild in 1971 and were about three or four years old when they arrived in the US. During their time at the National Zoo, the pair had five cubs between 1983 and 1989, but none of them survived longer than a few days. Ling-Ling died of heart disease in 1992, while Hsing-Hsing died of kidney failure in 1999.\n\nIn 1982, China stopped capturing and gifting pandas from the wild. China stated that for conservation purposes, they instead began leasing pandas bred at the Conservation and Research Center to foreign zoos. Starting in 1994, the practice shifted from commercial leasing tours to collaborative scientific research and conservation. However, zoos were still required to pay fees. The National Zoo first partnered with the CWCA in December 2000 through a Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement, marking the arrival of giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian. This original 10-year agreement with the CWCA has been extended three times since 2010. As per the agreement\u2019s terms, the Zoo is obligated to pay China an annual fee of $500,000. Moreover, both the pandas and their offspring are considered the property of China. If any panda were to die unexpectedly, their remains would also belong to China.\n\nMei Xiang and Tian Tian have welcomed millions of visitors during their 21 years at the National Zoo. They have had a total of seven cubs, with four surviving. Tai Shan, Bao Bao, and Bei Bei have previously returned to China. Xiao Qi Ji, born in August 2020, will leave with his parents after the contract ends. The giant panda, as a friendly ambassador, has witnessed the ups and downs of U.S.-China relations over the past 50 years. However, in February of this year, just as relations faced challenges like trade disputes and the \u201cspy balloon\u201d incident, the unexpected death of the giant panda Le Le at the Memphis Zoo exacerbated tensions. A joint examination by Chinese and American experts concluded that Le Le died of heart disease. However, by this time, Chinese internet public opinion had already shifted its focus to another panda residing in the Memphis Zoo, named Ya Ya. Appearing to have dry, coarse fur and a thin physique, images prompted widespread suspicions that Ya Ya was being mistreated by the Memphis Zoo.\n\nOn the Chinese social media platform Weibo, the hashtag calling for bringing Ya Ya back to China has garnered over 2.1 billion views. The joint statement released by the Memphis Zoo and the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens indicates that the Memphis Zoo has no issues in the care of pandas. The skin disease of the panda originates from a mite infection. This disease also appeared on Ya Ya\u2019s mother, a panda that lived in Beijing Zoo during her lifetime. Nevertheless, voices questioning the Memphis Zoo remain the mainstream on Chinese social media. The incidents involving Le Le and Ya Ya significantly heightened the attention of Chinese audiences toward topics related to pandas. The entire process of Ya Ya\u2019s FedEx plane landing at Shanghai Pudong Airport was broadcast live. Previously, any uncivilized behavior by tourists feeding the pandas at the Chengdu Giant Panda Base was only posted on the base\u2019s bulletin board, but now it usually makes headlines in national media, attracting thousands of condemning comments.\n\nHowever, such intense focus has also led to challenges in conservation work. On April 29, the China Giant Panda Conservation Research Center released a statement saying, \u201cPanda breeding management is a scientifically rigorous and specialized task. Even professionals can\u2019t judge a panda\u2019s health based on \u2018online diagnoses\u2019. Over-anthropomorphizing and excessive empathy from the public can interfere with normal management.\u201d The statement also showcased numerous false rumors and images of the caregivers being harassed. After decades of conservation work, the International Union for Conservation of Nature announced in 2016 that the giant panda was downgraded from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cvulnerable\u201d on the global list of species at risk of extinction. Yet, the enthusiasm of the Chinese public for panda conservation remains high after the series of incidents. For pandas living in zoos abroad, the public demands even higher living standards. This, to some extent, has promoted better living conditions for pandas. However, as stated by the China Giant Panda Conservation Research Center, the vast amount of criticism based on non-professional knowledge can disrupt care routines and add uncertainty to the international exchange of Chinese pandas.\n\nAlthough the event named \u201cPanda Palooza: A Giant Farewell\u201d has ended, Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and Xiao Qi Ji will continue to engage with visitors for the next two months. If you can\u2019t make it to Washington in person, you can also say goodbye to them via webcam.```"}

The policy went into effect nearly three months after the decision was made in July by the Los Angeles Superior Court, arguing that cash bail is discriminatory towards minorities and low-income individuals.\n\nHowever, this new policy has shown to be extremely controversial, with Los Angeles communities Arcadia, Artesia, Covina, Downey, Glendora, City of Industry, Lakewood, La Verne, Palmdale, Santa Fe Springs, Vernon, and Whittier all teaming together to fight the new system.\n\nThe LA County jails are facing an overcrowding crisis, and the policy is aiming to fix this issue. Former Federal Public Defender in Los Angeles Chad Pennington shared how costly bail has a negative impact on LA prisons.\n\nPennington: It leads to over swelling of your prison population because most people can\u2019t make the bail. So, you have a growing prison population, which is fairly costly for the state and the county to engage in.\n\nCriminal suspects accused of non-violent or non-serious crimes will be cited and released when they previously would have been held in jail on bond. This includes most theft offenses, vehicle code violations, petty theft, vandalism, and other misdemeanors.\n\nHowever, there is a large category of offenses subject to magistrate review, where a judge will decide whether the offender will be held in jail on bail or released until trial. Offenses that fall under this category include offenses involving firearms, sexual battery, violence against children or elders, contact with a minor with intent to commit a sexual offense, and assault and battery.\n\nOffenses that are not eligible for bail or magistrate review include capital offenses such as murder.\n\nPennington explained the process used by the magistrate while deciding whether an offender should be released until their trial.\n\nPennington: There\u2019s just two primary considerations. Is the person likely to show up again for a future proceeding? And do they pose a community risk if they\u2019re released?\n\nThe communities are suing the county because they are concerned that those who committed a crime falling under this category of magistrate review may pose a threat to the community if they are not held in jail until trial.\n\nPennington shared his thoughts.\n\nPennington: I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s going to contribute to an increase in crime. I think what it is going to contribute to is a decrease in what was already an overwhelmed prison system.\n\nHowever, he had his concerns.\n\nPennington: Bail is an instrument to ensure that there\u2019s not community risk if that person remains free pending resolution of the case and they\u2019re not a flight risk.\n\nWith twelve communities fighting back against this policy, only time will tell what the future of the LA county jail system will hold.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Mia Russman.\n```"}

It\u2019s about getting more help for the patients.\n\nHealthcare workers on strike in front of the Sunset Blvd. hospital. (Photo by Garret Harcourt)\n\nBy Garret Harcourt\nOctober 04, 2023 at  4:15 pm PDT\n\nMore than 400 healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente, the nation\u2019s largest nonprofit healthcare provider, jammed a downtown Los Angeles sidewalk on Wednesday, protesting what they say are unfair working conditions after failed labor negotiations. The workers were among some 75,000 Kaiser employees nationally who went on strike. The strike will actively affect hospitals and medical offices in California, Colorado, Oregon, Virginia, the District of Columbia and Washington.\n\nUnions that represent Kaiser workers are demanding negotiations in good faith for a staffing shortage. The Union is also seeking better pay and benefits as talks between Kaiser executives and workers continue. On Sunset Blvd. strikers chanted, \u201cwe are the Union, the mighty mighty Union\u201d outside the hospital as they continued to march up and down the three city block stretch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just here to follow the agenda, which is to lead the workers to a safe and very powerful, impactful strike,\u201d said Daniel Alejandro Lopez, one of the strike leaders. Gathering a group of strikers in the main driveway, Lopez led the chants in front of the hospital. Lopez was one of the union representatives present inside the negotiation room with the executives.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just bargaining in bad faith,\u201d Lopez explained. They\u2019re not meeting us at the table. So that\u2019s pretty much what that leads down to.\u201d As a leader of the union, Lopez wants to settle on a deal that provides the best outcome for the workers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people that still have unions and organizers because this is what we are. We are organizers, and we make sure that workers are not being violated with their rights and make sure we get a fair contract at the end of the day, because we want to be at work,\u201d said Lopez of the Union\u2019s ultimate goal.\n\nThe battle between the frontline workers and Kaiser executives comes at a risk of putting millions without essential healthcare. \u201cWe need more workers to help us so we can take better care of our patients,\u201d said Ju\u2019anna Isaiah, a ward clerk transcriber at Kaiser. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to shuttle the patients around like cattle. We want to give them the treatment that they need. We already have workers leaving the workforce because of the bad staffing crisis that we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nKaiser workers are one of many Union groups that have been or are currently on strike due to unfair labor agreements or pay disputes. Hollywood writers have recently come to an agreement after weeks of striking, United Auto Workers have more than 20,000 workers currently on strike and the Union representing UPS workers came to an agreement for a pay raise within the last month.\n\n\u201cIt saddens me because you know, UPS can go in and give them that kind of increase for packages,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cDo you really value what health care workers do?\u201d\n\nLicensed vocational nurse Jessica Cruz said that refill orders for her patients have been put at the backend. Cruz said that one patient has an order from July that hasn\u2019t been fulfilled due to the lack of workers able to complete orders. Cruz has a simple request for the Kaiser executives: \u201cWe want Kaiser executives to address the Kaiser report staffing crisis \u2014 Kaiser executives to give patients the safe care they deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s conflicting because we don\u2019t want to be out in a strike line. We\u2019d rather be helping patients,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nAnother licensed vocational nurse, Gumecindo Rubio, spoke for a group of nurses he was standing with. Rubio mentioned that the problems have been ongoing for a while now, with the previous bargaining agreement being put on pause following COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe old problems were never fixed, and now with COVID, they really presented themselves. We couldn\u2019t reach out to [the executives] as quickly as we\u2019d like and all of that really grew or showed itself during the pandemic,\u201d said Rubio.\n\nEmotionally, Rubio felt differently than some of the other striking workers. \u201cEmotionally, I feel great. I feel supported by my co-workers of all different classifications. I feel like we can do this. We just need to persevere, stay strong and [be] determined.\u201d\n\nKaiser released a statement on their website stating that they are disappointed in the decision for some Unions to go on strike. They said that patients can expect longer wait times and that the patient\u2019s care is at their top priority.\n```"}

The FEMA test alert lit up phone screens across the nation. (Photo by Sullivan Maley)\n\nBy Alea Motwane and Nick Virnich\nOctober 04, 2023 at 4:05 pm PDT\n\nA pre-announced test from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that went out to cell phones in the U.S. on Wednesday came about two minutes earlier than scheduled, and the mass of beeping phones left some USC students \u201ccaught off guard.\u201d\n\nFEMA and FCC announced they would conduct a nationwide emergency alert test at 2:20 p.m. EDT on Oct. 4 to ensure that the national alert system is still an effective means of warning Americans about emergencies at the national level. The loud alarming sound that alerted all TVs, Radios and Cell Phones was attached to a note stating, \u201cTHIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. The purpose is to maintain and improve alert and warning capabilities at the federal, state, local, tribal and territorial levels and to evaluate the nation\u2019s public alert and warning capabilities. No action is required by the public.\u201d\n\nFaith Snyder, a sophomore studying international relations and global business, said, \u201cIt was just a jumpscare how everyone\u2019s phone went off at the same time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FEMA Fact Sheet, legislation passed in 2015 requires FEMA to test the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) every 3 years. The last test took place in 2021.\n\nSome were confused about why the nationwide test took place. Mahdiya Vasam, a freshman studying anthropology, said she had heard about it beforehand. \u201cActually my brother sent a text this morning, just so we would know. I didn\u2019t know why they were doing it, but I think they said it in the alert,\u201d she said.\n\nAll U.S. mobile phones within range of an active cell tower, and on a network where WEA is supported, received the nationwide test. Mobile phones received the test alert even if they were on silent or airplane mode. Recent models of mobile phones have included a setting to opt out of tests and alerts. However, none of those settings affected the 2023 nationwide test. The only way a mobile phone would not receive the test would be if the device was powered off.\n\nAny radio or TV that was tuned to a broadcast station, a satellite radio or TV service, or cable or wireless TV received the nationwide test from the Emergency Alert System as well. However, the nationwide test alert went off two minutes before it was scheduled to, alarming people with the unexpected loud noise.\n\n\u2018X\u2019 formerly known as \u2018Twitter\u2019, immediately filled with Twitter users talking about the test. Their tweets ranged from people making sure they weren\u2019t the only ones receiving the nationwide test two minutes early, to people joking about how the loud noise scared them.\n\nEveryone coming to twitter after getting the emergency alert system notification #EmergencyAlertSystem pic.twitter.com/uMNn8iQiVy \u2014 Angry Man (@mythical65) October 4, 2023\n\nAs the alarming sounds blazed through the already loud and buzzing campus of USC, students had mixed reactions and opinions about it. Sophia Joseph, a sophomore studying psychology, said, \u201cI was in class and everyone\u2019s phone went off at the same time, and I immediately assumed it was the fire alarm. I obviously quickly realized it wasn\u2019t but the emergency alert definitely took me by surprise.\u201d\n\nSome USC students were alarmed by the noise, despite knowing the alarming sound was going to take place. Lauren Grauer, a senior studying the music industry, said she was \u201cstartled at first\u201d \" but knew it was coming because of posts she saw on TikTok. Snyder said her first reaction was \u201cdefinitely fear\u201d until she remembered her friend had sent her an announcement about it prior to the nationwide test.\n\nThere were also certain theories and conspiracies about the government\u2019s intention behind the alert, said students. \u201cI saw some stuff online about the comparison of conspiracy theories surrounding it,\u201d said Michael Solomon, a senior studying history and international relations \u201cI thought it was funny. People think that the alert system is going to activate a virus in you or something like that and it will turn people into zombies.\u201d\n\nHoney Robinson, a sophomore theater major said \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of perspectives from people I know who have expressed distrust of this alert system, so I\u2019m still deciding how I feel about it.\u201d\n\nHowever, some students believe that nationwide tests are beneficial to the nation. Especially \u201cconsidering how many more climate disasters we\u2019re gonna be susceptible to in the coming decades,\u201d said Solomon. \u201cI have family in Hawaii where tsunami alert systems are really crucial to day-to-day life, and people\u2019s livelihoods are at stake in a lot of places. So having this kind of infrastructure is important.\u201d\n\nSynder said she thought the purpose behind this alert was \u201cdefinitely to regain some public trust after the disaster at Lahaina,\u201d and believed that the government wanted to \u201clet us know that alerts still work and that we\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\nJoshua Rosado, a sophomore studying business administration, said he believed they were beneficial to a \u201cmild extent.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not always up to date with the weather so the alerts help for when the weather is of concern,\u201d he said. \u201cApart from that, I don\u2019t think they are necessarily that beneficial in keeping the public informed.\u201d\n\nStudents believed that alerting people through their mobile devices would be an effective way to communicate a national emergency. Prithika Kulkarni, a sophomore studying economics, said \u201cEveryone owns a phone; they\u2019re probably the quickest way to get to the public during the time of an emergency\u201d Joseph added, \u201cFor many people, their phones are their lifelines, so it is smart to have the alert on everyone\u2019s phone.\u201d\n\nPriyanka Sonie, a graduate student from the science department, reflected on how the emergency alert benefited her on Aug. 20, for the earthquake in L.A. She said she and her flatmates were \u201cable to react because of the push alert.\u201d\n```"}

They work with USC Fire Safety and Disaster Preparedness to ensure the USC campus and community are ready for any and all circumstances. The Red Cross also hosts blood drives, which they are encouraging students to participate in amid a national blood shortage resulting from a lack of donations.\n\nKyle Brice, American Red Cross Account Manager, said that he is not truly sure what the biggest factor for the decrease in blood donors is, but all signs point to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cCurrently we are in a national blood shortage, down about 25% of our hospitals\u2019 demand,\u201d said Brice.\n\nJolie Numasaki, a junior majoring in psychology, is the Philanthropy Director of the ARC at USC and a repeat blood donor.

Her main goal for the club is to gain more members and have more service events in order to encourage students to participate in donating. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of fun, which is weird, but it\u2019s true,\u201d said Leong. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost me anything except for ten minutes of my time, I know that it can save up to three lives when you donate a pint of your blood, so I like to do it for other people.\u201d\n```"}

But beneath the surface, there is a powerful current of trailblazing women whose contributions to the genre have shaped it into the cultural behemoth it is today. \u201cLadies First: A Story of Women in Hip-Hop\u201d is a four-part docuseries that delves into the racism, sexism and misogyny, which run rampant in the male-dominated industry. Co-produced by producer Dream Hampton of \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d and production designer Hannah Beachler of \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d the Netflix series premiered on Aug. 9 to commemorate hip-hop\u2019s 50th anniversary.\n\nThe series pays tribute to significant musicians and moments in history, notably celebrating Queen Latifah and Monie Love\u2019s 1989 track \u201cLadies First.\u201d From the disco-infused \u201870s to the explosive subgenre of drill, \u201cLadies First\u201d unfolds episodically. Throughout four episodes, the docuseries explores the hardships women have overcome to get a seat at the table.\n\nThe series kicks off by introducing the trailblazers: Sha-Rock, Roxanne Shant\u00e9 and MC Lyte. Tracing its origin out of South Bronx and onto a global stage, viewers are confronted with the systemic sexism plaguing women in hip-hop. Episode two, \u201cWhat Are They Up Against?,\u201d exposes a raw and unfiltered look at the misogyny, colorism and relentless criticism plaguing artists like Remy Ma and Cardi B. Their stories are told through candid, and often emotional, interviews with managers and critics.\n\nIt is commendable for the cast to expose the harsh realities they were forced to confront, both within and outside the music world. The episode also explores the persistent sexism that has plagued women in rap, from objectification to impossible beauty standards. Women like Lil\u2019 Kim, Foxy Brown, Nicki Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion have all faced scrutiny for their lyrical and visual choices, whether it be for embracing their sexuality or attempting to subvert expectations.\n\nAugmented by insights and contextual depth provided by cultural critics and journalists, the series reaffirms the importance of female DJs, producers, agents and songwriters. What is most admirable about the series is the spotlight on iconic stylists such as Misa Hylton, who is the visionary fashion designer behind Lil\u2019 Kim\u2019s unforgettable purple one-sleeved jumpsuit and accompanying pasty at the \u201899 VMAs. \u201cI created a blueprint that people followed. That other artists reinterpreted. And fashion brands have also taken a piece,\u201d Hylton reflected in the docuseries.\n\nOne of the most powerful revelations comes from producer Drew Dixon, who shares the story of how Method Man\u2019s \u201cAll I Need\u201d evolved from a potential album interlude to a full-fledged single featuring the soulful vocals of Mary J. Blige. \u201cI was like, \u2018This has to be a record.\u2019 There is nothing in hip-hop articulating Black love and Black male vulnerability and mutual respect for a woman in a romantic context. And if it\u2019s an interlude, no one will hear it,\u201d he recalled in episode three.\n\nAs the series expands, it becomes evident that \u201cLadies First\u201d serves as both an homage to the past and a reflection of the present. It illuminates the lives and achievements of those like Sha-Rock, who broke ground on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d with the Funky Four Plus One, marking the first hip-hop group performance on broadcast television. It also credits \u201cThe Mother of Hip-Hop,\u201d Sylvia Robinson. Without her, the iconic \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d by the Sugarhill Gang might never have graced our ears as the first commercial rap single.\n\nThe political undercurrents within hip-hop are not left unexplored. While acts like Public Enemy were celebrated for their political messaging, female emcees like Sister Souljah and Queen Latifah previously faced pushback although they have used their platforms to address inequality and social issues affecting the Black community. Sister Souljah was used as a political scapegoat during the aftermath of the 1992 LA riots, demonstrating the challenges these artists navigated.\n\nNevertheless, the enduring sisterhood among women in hip-hop remains a powerful force. In today\u2019s landscape, artists increasingly take control of their narratives by addressing topics like sexuality, mental health and motherhood in their lyrics. As contemporary female rappers continue to uplift one another, it demonstrates that there is room for everyone in the limelight.\n\nIf you are looking for a docuseries that combines insightful journalism with powerful historical storytelling, \u201cLadies First\u201d is an absolute must-watch as it speaks to the cultural zeitgeist of our time. \u201cLadies First: A Story of Women in Hip-Hop\u201d is currently available to stream on Netflix.\n```"}

He vocalizes, and from hushed decibels, he builds and builds until he\u2019s screaming alongside \u201cdirty\u201d or overdriven/distorted guitar tones. The event\u2019s streaming camera cuts are frenetic, flashing from views of Fike, the band, the fog, the stage and above the crowd where clusters of \u201cRock On\u201d hand signs hang in the air. For those reliving the concert or watching for the first time, this experience is as quality as it can get\u2013 the live-stream production offers the best camera angles for the given moment, rivaling the front barricade standing room.\n\nThe live music industry today is inseparable and indistinguishable from the spaces of digital culture. These include streamed events, listening parties and both label and fan-made merchandise marketplaces\u2013all of which provide access to a degree of global audience engagement unheard of before social media. Fans and artists dwell and are created here. Gen-Z\u2019s self-aware chatter through social platforms and prevalent social injustice dialogues finds itself funneled through rock\u2019s characteristic decibel levels and lyrical grime. In other words, Gen-Z artists and fans alike have things to scream about.\n\nPreviously, a pop-centered artist, Gen-Zer Dominic Fike proved his worth in salt as a modern rockstar when landing his Coachella 2023 performances with a \u201cgritty and emotive voice while thrashing on his guitar,\u201d per Rolling Stone.\n\nFellow Gen-Zer Willow Smith also took the Coachella 2023 Mojave stage by electrifying storm, as she performed tracks from her album \u201c<COPINGMECHANISM>,\u201d a title callback to online discourse\u2019s regular use of therapy terminology. Her set design donned clusters of digital nostalgia like clunky landline phones, blank monitors with rounded frames of silverstone shades and a disembodied guitar neck tilted parallel with her own Flying V in hand.\n\nThe modern grasp of the ever-evolving rock genre can be found in recent critical acclaim of this year\u2019s live performances and most anticipated releases. Earlier this month, with her latest album release \u201cGUTS,\u201d Olivia Rodrigo is powered by a classic through-the-telephone voice distortion and distressed guitar fuzz while riding out the strife of social media sensitivities and situationship nuances\u2014a lyrical combination that is new, yet true to the rock melodic history. Her vocal scrapbook of breakup memories on the track \u201cget him back!\u201d can lead her listeners to discover a roster of rock song subjects like in Cage the Elephant\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t No Rest for the Wicked,\u201d or The Who\u2019s \u201cPinball Wizard.\u201d The motif here is a series of storytelling pre-chorus verses sung like a string of gossipy diary entries written in cursive without the pen ever lifting from the paper. Sonically, the scene is set with lurking guitar pulses that fabricate the feeling of an inevitable pop-rock chorus pounce.\n\nThe fans that make up rock music modernity by adjacency, experimentation or curiosity make clear that the celebrations of releases and performances alike often have no online-only equal. Particularly in the LA scene, hunting particular paraphernalia is a rewarding and worthwhile hobby to round out a listener\u2019s dedication to rock artistry. An attendee of the Smorgasburg Record Fair posed and gleamed with a vinyl he\u2019s pursued for ten years, a rock Latin album titled \u201cIt\u2019s Time For\u201d by Jonathan Richman & The Modern Lovers. A nearby recent university student remarked that she will never buy a vinyl online again after she received one damaged in the mail. So she and like-minded others are led here, on cracked backlot concrete, where thick plastic rustled with a flap as visitors flipped through the shrink-wrapped vinyl records at Smorgasburg\u2019s every third Sunday market located at the Row in Downtown L.A.\n\nAs is the case with every third Sunday, large tarps hung over long tables stacked with crates of vinyl records, separated by handwritten labels that denoted genre and artist. While there was barely a square inch of open table space in sight, the Record Fair offered a sense of stillness compared to the steps-away bustling lines merging toward free samples and handmade goods.\n\nRock & Sock\u2019s visual split of vivid socks and vintage music essentials represented this month\u2019s Smorgasburg goods market and the vinyl records hot spot. (Photo by Olivia Siu)\n\nSmorgasburg is promoted to welcome all ages, but here at Rock & Sock, attendees from Gen-Z and older were seen to mesh between the four-pack knee highs and \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d double LPs. The booth\u2019s owner boasts that his wife handles the socks and he does the rock. He shares that the age range and thus listening-habit diversity of his customers is rich, stating that there is now a common understanding of the complete history of music because everything vintage and modern-day is openly accessible. He also elaborated a caveat that, for the first time in history, artists are directly competing with each other regardless of the decade they belong to.\n\nArtists too, have reached out through the decades to find music\u2019s tangible vinyl counterparts that had never made it to any streaming platform. This is the motivation for Discotchari, an LA local band and host of one of the Smorgaburg vinyl record booths. Interestingly, they assert that today, the playlist title takes the place of genre as a classifier. In the bins of their table\u2019s frontmost corner\u2013arguably the most valuable real estate of a vinyl record collection display\u2013is a crate labeled \u201cEssentials & Exceptionals.\u201d If one were to flip through and skim the top margins of this collection, they would come across the album graphics of both household names and someone new.\n\nOf similar idiosyncratic nature for on-the-fly, yet hand-picked music discovery, is Spotify\u2019s Rap \u2018n\u2019 Roll playlist, hosting blends of grunge and ballad vocals complemented with sharp rap features and vice versa\u2014all standing as bold independent tracks collected in this digital niche. However, to put aside the shuffle button that skips according to a calculated crossfade, try a record fair like Smorgsburg\u2019s to browse through neatly filed, hand-curated bins of LPs and EPs from familiar favorites and the yet-to-be-discovered\n\nToday\u2019s live music scene helps determine how the rock genre moves and breathes today. In an age where music from any decade is accessible, discovery is spontaneous and celebrations are year-round.\n```"}

The camera is directed towards one corner of the room, showcasing a table and a wall adorned with an abundance of intricate props. This scene is bathed in a vivid yellow hue complemented by a vibrant color palette. The narrator speaks in a deep and calm voice, \u201cI\u2019ve been in this hut for 30 years now.\u201d These features are just too Andersonian. It is undeniably his movie, brimming with a style so unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nGood news for all Wes Anderson fans \u2014 the director is back, again, with another cinematic artistry \u201cThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,\u201d following the premiere of his film \u201cAsteroid City\u201d at the Cannes Film Festival earlier in May. The plot is adapted from Roald Dahl\u2019s short story compilation, where the original \u201cHenry Sugar\u201d story can be found. Intended to be for an older teen audience, it is a tale following the transformation of a wealthy man named Henry Sugar. After stumbling upon a book revealing the secrets of an Indian yogi who can see without his eyes, Henry becomes obsessed with acquiring this skill. After years of training and meditating, he eventually gains the mystical sight and exploits it at the casino, winning himself a vast fortune. However, with time, he begins to contemplate the moral implications and decides to use his powers for the greater good of society.\n\nThis story is meticulously condensed by Anderson into a compact 40-minute film. Moreover, it marks his debut on Netflix, making the film digitally available around the world. Delving into the visual template of this film right away might prove underwhelming. After all, \u201cWesthetic,\u201d the distinctive aesthetic signature of Anderson, has become somewhat of a well-worn clich\u00e9. In a 2007 interview with The Guardian, the filmmaker himself candidly acknowledged that \u201cI don\u2019t want to repeat myself, but of course I do repeat myself.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, amidst a whirlwind of creative inspiration, he certainly managed to introduce some refreshing innovations into his latest endeavor. This time, it is not just about his signature storytelling or the chemistry within his usual cast. Anderson pushes the boundary of cinematic artistry by having one actor take on multiple roles. Benedict Cumberbatch steps into this territory with finesse. Cumberbatch\u2019s flexibility as an actor matches perfectly with Anderson\u2019s idiosyncratic storytelling, allowing him to effortlessly shift from one character to another.\n\nAt the film\u2019s outset, he plays the role of Henry Sugar, dressed up in a suit and tie. However, as the narrative unfolds, he transforms into a make-up artist, deftly affixing fake eyebrows onto one of the actors. This inventive approach extends to other roles in the film. Coupled with the classical story-within-a-story narrative approach, the film unveils a new layer of artistic complexity and narrative innovation for Anderson.\n\nSpeaking of narrative technique, one of the most eye-catching features of \u201cHenry Sugar\u201d is its complete \u201cshow and tell\u201d approach, wherein characters directly narrate the story \u2014 even retaining descriptive elements like \u201che said\u201d and \u201che cries.\u201d Anderson arranged for the actors to recite Dahl\u2019s words directly to the audience, seamlessly weaving in and out like a stage play. This is a fresh perspective compared to his previous signature narratives. Interestingly enough, the actors deliver their lines at such a rapid pace as if the audience is in the midst of a listening exam. This brisk pacing allows the film to squeeze in a multitude of stories within its limited runtime. Actors simultaneously serve as narrators while also actively participating in each scene.\n\nBy employing the \u201cbreaking the fourth wall\u201d technique, performers acknowledge the presence of the camera by looking directly into the lens during moments when they narrate for themselves. This clever design effectively mitigates the potential monotony that could arise from the extensive narration, and enhances the sense of interaction with the audience, rendering the content more engaging.\n\nThe film is, unsurprisingly, a visual delight. What\u2019s remarkable is that Anderson accomplished this without relying on any special effects or technological gimmicks. Instead, he returns to the most fundamental theatrical effects and sounds. He wanted to present the stage in its raw authenticity, so that the audiences can actually see the curtains parting, background plates lifting, walls sliding away, one-dimensional sets moving in and rooms rotating. You can see the stagehands guiding actors on dolly tracks and hear the sound of a gear rail pushing the actor\u2019s chair sideways at the same time. The richness of the audio-visual experience is nothing short of the immersion one finds in watching a 3D movie. Anderson is bringing a living storybook to the screen. Audiobook, stage play, podcast... The genre? Feel free to give this film any genre definition. In today\u2019s high-tech and complex world of filmmaking, this production stands apart from the rest. Anderson infused it with novel elements, bringing the audience along with him on this journey of filmmaking and storytelling. His pursuit of innovation knows no bounds. Whether you are a fan or not, this charming little forty-minute piece, in which Anderson explores new horizons of storytelling is indeed, a wonderful story.\n```"}

The passion, the hatred and the intensity are what make them so great. Whether it\u2019s the Crosstown Showdown between USC and UCLA, the Red River Showdown where Texas and Oklahoma square off or The Game with Michigan and Ohio State, rivalries are a major part of what make college football so great.\n\nTeams from the West Coast are being thrown all around the country and tossed into new conferences. With college football changing like never before next year, will there be new clashes amongst conference foes?\n\nThe Pac-2\n\nAs of now, Oregon State and Washington State do not have a conference. While I believe they deserve to be in a power conference I have to play with the scenario that they will not be invited to a new conference. Washington State is ranked No. 13 in the most recent AP poll and Oregon State is ranked No. 15 after beating then-No. 10 Utah 21-7. The two Pacific Northwest schools squared off just weeks ago where the Cougars came out on top winning a thrilling 38-35 game despite the Beavers\u2019 valiant second half comeback effort.\n\nThese teams play a new exciting brand of football. If they stay in the Pac-12 \u2014 whether it merges with the Mountain West or not \u2014 I think these two will forge a symbolic rivalry and have a thrilling game each year.\n\nA new blue and yellow rival for USC?\n\nOver the past decade, the Big Ten has been dominated by three teams: Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State. These three colossal programs have been stampeding the competition for far too long. Adding in another big dog that can compete with those three will form new rivalries.\n\nBoth Michigan and USC are historic programs with countless wins and bowl victories. However it is the Granddaddy of them all that might spark a rivalry between these two titans of college football. The Trojans and Wolverines have met eight times in the Rose Bowl, with USC leading the series 6-2. USC has beaten Big Blue three straight times in Pasadena, and Michigan has not beaten the Trojans since 1989.\n\nUSC and Michigan have not played against each other since the 2007 Rose Bowl, where USC came out victorious 32-18. Since these two will now be playing each other annually or every other, it is fertile ground for some mutual hatred.\n\nThe Trojans are set to take on Michigan at home in 2024, unless the Big Ten upends its schedule next year with the new additions of Oregon and Washington, which will be a great matchup to watch at the Coliseum and I believe will tender the flames to a new rivalry.\n\nOregon vs OSU Pt. 2\n\nWhen I think about UO vs OSU, I think about Oregon vs Oregon State, Ducks and Beavers, the battle for the Beaver State(I know it\u2019s ironic), however Ohio State, another OSU, and Oregon have had an interesting history over the last decade. In 2014, these two met in the first ever College Football Playoff National Championship, where the Buckeyes soundly defeated the Ducks 42-20 (I cried after this game). Then in 2021, the two met in Columbus where then-Oregon running back CJ Verdell ran all over Ohio State and the Ducks came away with the win 35-28.\n\nWhile these two have rarely played, their brief history could create another rivalry at the top of the Big Ten similar to that of USC and Michigan. These two will clash at the top of the Big Ten, whether in the rainy and rowdy Autzen Stadium or in \u201cCircle City\u201d for the Big Ten Championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium . Ohio State will be eager to get back at the Ducks after Oregon beat them on their home turf and leaving a small Rubber Duck in the middlefield. The Ducks will want to prove that one game wasn\u2019t a fluke, as the Buckeyes are 9-1 all time against Oregon.\n\nSome other notable rivalries include Colorado and TCU, who played together this season in a thrilling game where the Buffaloes came out on top 45-42 where we first got a taste of Deion Sanders football. With Colorado joining the Big 12, we could see the Buffaloes and Horned Frogs match up every season.\n\nHow about Michigan State, who will be out for blood against Washington. The Huskies  have gotten the better of the Spartans two years in a row, including a beatdown in East Lansing where the Spartans lost 41-7. Or Perhaps Stanford and Duke. Though Stanford has struggled and Duke has exceeded all expectations this season, these two will be dueling for Academic Superiority across the ACC.\n\nDeath, Taxes and conference realignment are the only inevitable things in life we need to get a grasp on. While two of those options don\u2019t garner joy, conference realignment is sure to bring a load of entertaining rivalries that will make college football even greater.\n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was ousted as Speaker of the House of Representatives Tuesday afternoon in a 216-210 vote, with eight Republicans siding with Democrats to remove him from the position. The vote came after Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) took to the house floor Monday night to call for Rep. McCarthy\u2019s removal. Without the support of the full Republican caucus and no sign of Democrats supporting his return to the speakership, Rep. McCarthy announced Tuesday evening he would not seek the gavel again on X, formerly known as Twitter. His tenure lasted only 269 days, the third-shortest in the history of the United States and the shortest speakership since 1876, according to the U.S. House Archives. The house will be adjourned until next week when Republicans plan to elect a new speaker, per the Associated Press. For the time being, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) will preside as the interim speaker, whose responsibility is solely to facilitate the election of a duly elected speaker. Rep. McHenry will have his work cut out for him this week as he convinces both the right flank of his party and its more moderate members to select a new leader together. Once Republicans choose their nominee, the House will vote as many times as necessary for a candidate to receive the majority of the votes present. Rep. McCarthy was elected to the position in January after an unprecedented 15 rounds of voting.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/03/la-county-bails-on-traditional-cash-bail/", "response": "```\nL.A. County bails on traditional cash bail\n\nLos Angeles County\u2019s Zero Bail Policy went into effect this week, allowing for those arrested on most non-violent misdemeanors and felonies to be cited and released without posting cash bail. Twelve cities within L.A. County opposed the policy last Friday, with a previous lawsuit that occurred in May. Proponents of the policy believe L.A. County is headed in the right direction towards eradicating the cash bail system, while critics and county officials in opposition of the policy suggest that this will jeopardize public safety.\n\n\u201cIt makes it so that you are in jail because you don\u2019t have money,\u201d said Janet Asante, media coordinator of Justice L.A. \u201cIf implemented correctly and cautiously, the policy can help close that gap.\u201d The bail system, better known as bail schedule, is a system designed for pretrial detention that sets a price on a person\u2019s offense based on the crime of which they have been accused. Offices utilize this to determine how much a person\u2019s bail is before trial. The average bail for a person in California starts at $50,000, five times the national medium bail, according to Mr Nice Gail Bail Bonds.\n\nIn May, Judge Lawrence Riff issued a preliminary injunction across L.A. County police and sheriff departments, calling for an end to the traditional cash bail system. Illinois is the first state to completely abolish bail as of September 2022, while New Jersey introduced a risk assessment that measures a released defendant\u2019s probability of recidivism. As this policy is a controversial effort that affects all L.A. county residents, critics have posed concerns about its effects on Angelenos\u2019 general safety. Others believe that the cash bail system disproportionately affects Black and Brown communities.\n\nAs an interruption to the traditional cash bail system, the policy could be a step in the right direction for California. According to a Georgetown University report by the Mercatus Center, California is one of the most regulated states with nearly 400,000 regulatory restrictions in place, while the average state has only 135,000. Janet Asante is a criminal justice reform activist for Justice L.A. who attended the hearing in support of L.A. Civil Civil Rights Corps and Public Justice, a non-profit legal advocacy organization in L.A. This case was \u201ca historic preliminary injunction\u201d according to a Public Justice Press Release.\n\nAsante shared that representatives of the twelve cities in L.A. County were \u201cnot present and declined to provide comment\u201d during the hearing, as Judge Lawrence Riff offered defendants the space to push back against the Zero Bail policy. She feels that the cash bail system \u201cessentially criminalizes poverty.\u201d \u201cI was present in the courtroom during the civil case,\u201d said Asante. \u201cThere were several opportunities where the judge specifically asked for these law enforcement groups to come in and advocate for whatever their objections are \u2014 they declined at every step along the way. They don\u2019t actually care, but they have a vested interest in fear mongering and further backsliding us into more close races.\u201d\n\nAsante also urges critics to think about how the cash bail system affects working class communities. She also thinks that there are a lot of misconceptions about the policy, with critics lacking an understanding of the importance the policy holds for Black, Brown, low-income communities that typically cannot afford cash bail. Director of the criminal justice program at UCLA School Of Law, Alicia Virani, urged critics to examine studies that prove released defendants are not a threat to public safety with the Zero Bail Policy.\n\n\u201c[Studies] show no negative impact in terms of crime rates in those jurisdictions that have changed their pretrial laws, policies, or practices,\u201d she said. Virani also noted that while the policy is impactful to disproportionately affected communities, it is too early to tell how this policy will affect criminal justice reform. Atiana Duran, a manager and cash bail agent of Midnight Bail Bonds, is aware that the bail bonds industry \u201cis often labeled as being predatory.\u201d Duran is not solely concerned about how the policy will affect the bail bonds industry, she is also concerned for community safety.\n\n\u201cAs an Angelino and as a member of a lower-income neighborhood, I\u2019m fearful,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fearful of repeat offenders. Cases don\u2019t get filed for 30 days. So you could get cited and released today and then tomorrow get cited and released today for 30 days.\u201d Duran says that the L.A. County Board of Supervisors is \u201caiming to please a particular demographic\u201d by putting the policy into effect, and is in complete opposition. Duran encourages proponents of the policy to think about how it impacts L.A. County and the judicial system. She also feels that the policy is a disservice to victims of crimes that are considered to be minor.\n\nUSC Gould School of Law recent Juris Doctor, Aris Mangasarian, is a formerly incarcerated double trojan. He understands the role that this policy plays during critical times. During an era of social unrest, the mandate introduces pivotal points to an important matter. The policy \u201centers the scene at a time when societal attitudes towards authority and the justice system are in flux, influenced by recent protests and movements advocating for systemic reform,\u201d said Mangasarian.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/03/fafsa-will-no-longer-account-for-multiple-college-students-in-a-family-but-usc-will/", "response": "```\nThe FAFSA application won\u2019t open until December, and will use a new method to calculate need.\n\nThe FAFSA is changing the way it is calculating need.\n(Photo courtesy of The Bent Tree)\n\nBy Kaitlyn Kizy, Isaiah Alwin and Sethan Perez\nOctober 03, 2023 at 6:44 pm PDT\n\nThe Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) introduced changes that may have a big impact on students\u2019 financial aid packages. These changes, which will recalculate the way need is assessed, will be in full effect by the 2024-25 award year, according to Federal Student Aid. Due to these changes, the FAFSA application will not be open until December 2023, according to CNBC. The FAFSA typically opens on Oct. 1 every year.\n\nOne of the changes will be a transition from Expected Family Contribution (EFC) to the new Student Aid Index (SAI) when determining aid eligibility, according to the FSA. EFC and SAI are calculated in almost the same way. In both, a student\u2019s contributions to income and their assets are added together; if they are a dependent, their parents\u2019 contributions are added as well. In the previous EFC calculations, the parent contribution was divided by the number of children in college. Independent students divided their own contributions by the number of students dependent on them, if they also had children or siblings whose educations they were funding.\n\nHowever, in the new SAI, the same calculation is done, but with no division for the number of dependents. This means that households with multiple dependents in college may have to pay what had been their net EFC, but for each individual student. College Inside Track reports that the change in calculations could have a drastic effect, especially on middle income families with more than one child in college, since many lower income families already have a low EFC.\n\nThough the FAFSA will no longer include the number of students that a family has in college, the University of Southern California says that it will still consider it when looking at financial aid. \u201cWhile there are policy changes that will be in effect with the new FAFSA, such as the number of family members in college no longer being considered, USC will continue to take this information into account when determining eligibility for USC-based aid,\u201d said a representative from USC Financial Aid. In their statement, USC also encouraged families to alert them to any special circumstances in order to make appropriate adjustments to students\u2019 need-based aid.\n\nElenoa Taumohaapi, a sophomore majoring in human biology with a minor in stem cell research, said that she appreciated USC saying they will still consider the amount of family members in college when deciding aid, but still \u201cfelt terrible\u201d since her two younger siblings will be in college soon. \u201cUSC gave me a lot of money... but none of my siblings are applying to USC, and they\u2019re gonna be out of state too,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family does not have enough money to fund three full-time college students.\u201d\n\nFSA said that the SAI is also taking fewer items into account when determining a student or household\u2019s income and assets in order to lessen the need to self-report income. Now, most of the necessary information is in the U.S. income tax return form, which can be used to auto-fill sections of the FAFSA. Other changes include new expectations for exempting students from providing asset information, and the possibility for SAI to be a negative number.\n\nThe first phase of these changes started in the 2021-22 school year. In 2021, FSA removed the requirement for male students to register for Selective Service, which keeps track of citizens eligible to be drafted into the military, in order to receive federal aid. Questions about drug-related convictions have also been removed.\n\nAccording to FSA, all of these changes are due to the FAFSA Simplification Act, which was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which was amended in 2022. The changes made for the 2024-25 year will be the last amendments required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The full list of changes for 2024-25 can be viewed at FSA\u2019s website.\n```"}

The chamber has been left without a leader for the first time in U.S. history and McCarthy\u2019s term officially becomes the second shortest in Speaker of the house history with 269 days in office. His term had only started in January after a contentious vote. North Carolina Representative, Patrick McHenry, was named \u201cspeaker pro tempore\u201d until the next speaker election votes are cast. Matt Gaetz, a republican representative of Florida, guided the removal of McCarthy and introduced the motion late Monday after deep criticism of how he handled budget fights and spending. Eight far right republican representatives were behind the motion to remove McCarthy; this occurred as an escalation of tensions among conservatives and the former speaker. House Democrats plan to meet tomorrow morning and discuss Democratic nominees for Speaker of the House, as Hakeem Jeffries is the Democratic favorite to fill the vacant speaker seat. In a press conference minutes ago, McCarthy confirmed that he will not be running for speaker again and he does not regret any of his actions that led to his ouster.\n```"}

From there students and their families have the opportunity to participate in a variety of events throughout the weekend ranging from tours of various campus buildings, hearing from guest speakers, or enjoying live entertainment ranging from watching the famed Trojan marching band to even picking up the mic during the live standup comedy event.\n\nBeyond the scheduled programming many students are excited to show their parents around LA one of these being Freshman Business of Cinematic Arts major Alexa Googel. Alexa Googel: I might take them to Courage Bagels, because I really want to try the bagels and then I\u2019m going to show them around campus. They\u2019re coming to the game and then we might go on a hike.\n\nThe main attraction of the weekend though is definitely the football game and the accompanying tailgates. Roark Payne, a Senior Business Admin major, is one of the many students bringing their parents along for some of the pre-game fun. He will be joined by his mom who is in town for her first parents\u2019 weekend. Roark Payne: I\u2019m going to bring her to my fraternity and lambda Chi Alpha...

Mean Girls is on TikTok 19 years later and we are still obsessed\n\nIt\u2019s October 3 which means USC is watching Mean Girls. Expand (Photo courtesy of [Mean Girls Instagram])\n\nBy Erika Driscoll October 03, 2023 at  6:07 pm PDT\n\nOn October 3, you streamed the entire \u201cMean Girls\u201d movie on TikTok, after the official \u201cMean Girls\u201d account uploaded the full movie in 23 parts for free. Yep, today\u2019s national \u201cMean Girls\u201d day, so slip into your pink Juicy Couture jumpsuit and re-watch Cady Heron\u2019s tragic teenage life on the movie\u2019s verified  TikTok  account. But the iconic film has graced more than just movie screens and For You Pages. The \u201c Mean Girls\u201d North American tour on Broadway  debuted in 2018. The show is still popular, selling out almost all the seats at Miller Theatre in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cEven though the movie was created before I was even born, I think people were still referencing the funny jokes,\u201d Jih-Cook, the actor portraying Damian on the Broadway show, said. \u201cAnd on top of that, the movie is so quotable and so funny.The story is so relevant to today, and the things that the characters face are things that people still face today in high school.\u201d\n\nThis timeless teen comedy embraces the stereotypical highschool life filled with queen bees, cliques, crushes, awkward moments and all the drama. It\u2019s clear what was fetch in 2004 is still oh so fetch in 2023. From screen to Broadway musical, \u201cMean Girls\u201d still teaches every generation a few valuable life lessons.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesdays, we wear pink.\u201d The iconic quote, \u201cOn Wednesdays, we wear pink,\u201d makes picking out your weekly wardrobe simple. The directing and script writing of this move created pop culture references that are used so much they should be added to the dictionary. Scroll through social media and you will spot memes about \u201cthe Plastics\u201d or even trending movie sounds for your next TikTok.\n\n\u201cGet in, loser. We\u2019re going shopping.\u201d The fashion in \u201cMean Girls\u201d revolves around the 2000s style, which has been making a major resurgence in the past five years. It encourages people today to dress for themselves and how they want to feel or be perceived. The characters express this through all the different cliques and their fashion choices. Janis Ian chooses anxiety teen punk, Kevin Gnapoor goes for mathlete and Cady Heron gives classic new girl vibes.\n\n\u201cGod, Karen, you\u2019re so stupid.\u201d Raise your hand if you have been personally victimized by Regina George. Regardless if your nose is buried in the books or you\u2019re just trying to make it through your 9-to-5 job, there\u2019s always a mean girl around. The movie points out the fact that you have the choice to react or not to react. The Broadway musical continues to shed light on the importance of standing up for yourself.\n\n\u201cJanis sings about and confronts her two bullies that she faces and shows them she\u2019d rather be herself than be with those people again. It\u2019s a very touching song,\u201d Jih-Cook said.\n\n\u201cYou let it out, honey...put it in the book.\u201d Social media is the digital version of a Burn Book, a platform to start any dirty rumor. The early 2000s launched the first major social platforms like MySpace, Facebook and YouTube. Today, there are hundreds of platforms infiltrating teenagers\u2019 mindsets and confidence. With one click, a comment can go viral and negatively alter a life.\n\n\u201cThe burn book is only cool if you burn it after you make it. I think it\u2019s very wild to put hatred on paper and leave it there,\u201d mentioned Andres Valencia, a USC senior studying business administration and finance. As you may have been a victim yourself, these comments are worse than, \u201cAmber D\u2019Alessio made out with a hot dog.\u201d Social media leaves a burn greater than the Plastics\u2019 words as it\u2019s one of the  leading causes of depression and anxiety today .\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us.\u201d To not allow someone to sit with you at lunch is very high school. But not being friends with someone because of their race, sex, size, disability or status is discriminatory. This movie was really ahead of its time in promoting the importance of inclusivity and leaving bullying behind. Mikael Rada, an ensemble member in the national \u201cMean Girls\u201d Broadway tour, said the Broadway show continues to bring awareness to diversity in the casting.\n\n\u201cAs an Asian American performer, it sometimes is disappointing when you don\u2019t see shows where you see yourself,\u201d Rada said. \u201cThis show is so diverse and it allows us to express ourselves, not just because of what we look like, just because we\u2019re human. And the show just brings that heart to the forefront.\u201d\n\nFrom show to cast, Rada notes it\u2019s not about letting popularity contests divide us and instead about being open to new perspectives.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help that I\u2019m so popular.\u201d Popularity isn\u2019t an indicator of true friendship. Despite the Plastics giving off high school royalty vibes, they aren\u2019t the sweetest on the inside. Growing up we often want to be like the cool kids but Cady\u2019s experience gives us the inside scoop. One can find friendships in the least expected people.\n\n\u201cI transferred here, so I\u2019ve been at a different university, too,\u201d said Anna Jarczynska, a USC junior studying music industry. \u201cIt\u2019s so interesting to see how those stereotypes do kind of apply to real people in school, even though obviously there\u2019s no Regina George. But there still are the popular people that are kind of a little meaner and it\u2019s like, why? Why would anyone want to be friends with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs butter a carb?\u201d Despite an increase in body positivity and acceptance of all sizes since the movie\u2019s debut, there is still an underlying notion people are valued based on their physical appearance. Just like Regina trusted Cady that K\u00e4lteen Bars were the trick to lose weight, people trust fad diets circulating the internet and influencers\u2019 \u201cWhat I eat in a day\u201d content. Diet culture is more confusing than ever as it slyly pushes away from size but still encourages a particular image through the \u201chealth and wellness\u201d craze. Consequently, since the pandemic, there has been a  rise in eating disorders .\n\nAt least, hopefully, the move taught you that a crash protein bar diet is not the answer \u2014 and that butter is actually a fat.\n\n\u201cGretchen, I\u2019m sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea at Barnes & Noble.\u201d You know when you can\u2019t keep ghosting your bestie any longer? There is nothing worse than holding a grudge within your friend group. North Shore High School shows how it\u2019s normal for relationships to fluctuate and face to face communication is always better than talking behind one\u2019s back. The end of the movie helps viewers see forgiveness as a strength and reinforce reconciliation. It invites viewers to join Cady and friends in the trust fall.\n\n\u201cThe limit does not exist.\u201d There is no denying the overarching theme of the movie is to be yourself. In a time where people are constantly sharing the highlights of their life on various outlets, it can be easy to feel discouraged or like an outlier.\n\n\u201cTina Fey really made sure that Cady was a character that was not only accessible but incredibly relatable because we\u2019ve all felt like a fish out of water at some point,\u201d said Ella Grace Rodriguez, a USC senior majoring in film and tv production. \u201cMean Girls\u201d isn\u2019t like regular movies. It\u2019s a cool movie!\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/10/03/kaiser-workers-prepare-to-strike/", "response": "```\nThousands of Kaiser Permanente workers across the country, including Los Angeles and the majority of California, are planning to strike beginning on Wednesday due to understaffing and overworking.  The kaiser unions say that Kaiser needs better wages to attract workers and that it needs to hire enough people to make up for the exodus of staff during the pandemic.  The biggest union is The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions which represents 85,000 Kaiser healthcare workers in seven states and the District of Columbia.  In April, the Coalition began its national bargaining process ahead of the September 30th contract expiration. On Sept. 22, Coalition unions representing 75,000 Kaiser healthcare workers gave Kaiser executives 10-day notices for an unfair labor practice strike beginning Oct. 4.  The Coalition and Kaiser Permanente last negotiated a contract in 2019. That was before healthcare workers found themselves on the frontlines of the COVID pandemic that has worsened working conditions and exacerbated a healthcare staffing crisis. The frustrations of healthcare workers, who feel they are being forced to care for too many patients for too little pay, have been boiling over across the country. Many of the workers who remain feel burned out and are struggling to handle a higher volume of patients. The concern over inadequate staffing resulted in a nurses\u2019 strike in New York City in January, and there were more than a dozen similar strikes this year in California, Illinois, Michigan, and elsewhere. With workers striking, this creates delays in the care of patients. As the talks continue, the sides have yet to agree on a minimum hourly wage for workers and the rate of annual increases over the life of the four-year contract. The union wants a $25 hourly minimum wage and increases of 7 percent in the first two years and 6.25 percent in the two years afterward, according to its latest public proposal. Kaiser has countered with minimum hourly wages of between $21 and $23 next year, increasing by a dollar a year. Raises would vary among locations, with workers in some places, like Northern California, receiving annual increases of 4 percent for four years, while some others would receive an increase of 3.5 percent the first year, followed by 3 percent annual increases. Until a decision is made, the patients and workers at Kaiser will experience a very different healthcare environment than they are accustomed to. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Grayson Salomon\n```"}

There\u2019s always that one Cinderella story that comes about when you talk about the playoffs. But who will it be is anyone\u2019s guess this year.\n\nMichael Gonzales, a teacher from South El Monte High School, believes that the Brewers will surprise the league as their pitching and defense will carry them to victory.\n\nMichael Gonzales: Pitching usually wins all that stuff.

The new array of words come from all over such as social media, television, and modern-slang. In a press release the publication said \u201cthese new additions have demonstrated widespread use over time, and offer a window into the world today.\u201d \n\nIf your are a fan of the ground-breaking animated series \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d then you are no stranger to the word \u201ccromulent.\u201d Defined by Merriam-Webster as acceptable or satisfactory, the newly added adjective first appeared in the 1996 episode of the hit cartoon titled \u201cLisa the Iconoclast.\u201d This is the second word to be added from the episode after the publication inducted the verb \u201cembiggen,\u201d to their collection back in 2018.\n\nThe adjective \u201cbussin,\u201d is another new inclusion to the historical publication. The word means extremely good, especially delicious or tasty. The term originates from African-American English slang and is typically used when describing how a food tastes. For example: \u201cYo, that Doritos Locos Taco was bussin!\u201d\n\nAnother slang term that was added was the word \u201crizz.\u201d The noun means romantic appeal or charm. The word is a modern-day take on the old slang term \u201cgame.\u201d An example of when to use the word would be in regard to a person who exudes charisma not through verbal communication, but through confidence and body language. An individual who is very skilled at the craft and holds a king-size amount of rizz is considered a \u201crizzler.\u201d The word exploded in recent years on social media, especially Tik Tok, as influencers have started conducting \u201crizz tutorials\u201d and \u201crizz competitions.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cSimp\u201d is another new addition that grew in popularity through its impact in social media. The word could be used as either a noun or verb and is described as someone (especially a man) who shows excessive concern, attention, or deference towards a romantic partner or love interest. A simp usually does not know the meaning of \u201cpals before gals,\u201d and as a result loses all their friends. Although the slang term has garnered popularity recently, it is actually a lot older than some may think. The word has been around for decades, dating all the way to 1985 when it was being used in lyrics by rapper Too Short. It was not until a few years ago when a younger audience rediscovered it and began to incorporate it into their everyday speech. Gen Z even made the term go viral in early 2020 when they started a trend on Tik Tok known as \u201cSimp Nation.\u201d\n\nWith this addition from Merriam-Webster dictionary having nearly twice as many entries as the one from last September, one can only wonder, what new interesting words will be added come next fall?\n```"}

The month was formally established in 1995 to highlight LGBTQ+ achievements. It has since grown to become an acknowledgment of the ongoing challenges faced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual communities. It also coincides with days of celebration \u2014 including National Coming Out Day on Oct. 11 and International Pronouns Day on Oct. 18 \u2014 making it both a month of awareness and festivities.\n\nA driving force of USC\u2019s celebration lies within the LGBTQ+ Student Center, located on the fourth floor of the Student Union building. The center itself was recently expanded and acts as a safe space for queer and transgender students to connect with the community, attend programs and \u201cweekly spaces\u201d for discussions and gatherings.\n\n\u201cWe try and create a home-away-from-home environment,\u201d said Megan van der Toorn, who acts as the director of student equity and inclusion for intercultural services at the LGBTQ+ student center. Van der Toorn said students will be able to attend over a dozen events held by the center this month. These include partnering with Asian Pacific American Student Services for students to make friendship bracelets and working with Friends of Sappho, an LGBTQ+ apparel store to celebrate International Lesbian Day.\n\n\u201cAll of our programs as the LGBTQ+ student center are open to all students. So we invite folks to come connect with folks, learn more about other identities that maybe they don\u2019t hold,\u201d van der Toorn said. \u201cEvery program that we do... is an opportunity to make a big campus much smaller for folks to find their community of support.\u201d\n\nSome students may express confusion about the difference between Pride Month, which takes place in June, and LGBTQ+ History Month in October. Pride Month is a celebration of queer and transgender identities while LGBTQ+ History Month is an exploration of the community\u2019s history. Van der Toorn explained that while Pride Month is recognized and celebrated by USC in June, there are not many students on campus during that time.\n\n\u201cWe really do the heavy student programmatic lift and celebration in the month of October, which is filled with all these [individual identity] days,\u201d Van der Toorn said.\n\nAdditional details about the events taking place this month can be found here.

The three-day strike will be a demonstration to show that the unions will not stand for unfair labor practices and declare that Kaiser has been bargaining in bad faith.\n\n\u201cHealthcare workers are taking the work action to protect Kaiser executives\u2019 bad faith bargaining, which is getting in the way of finding solutions to solve the Kaiser short-staffing crisis by investing in its workforce,\u201d reads a press release sent to Annenberg Media from the union.\n\nThe coalition claims that Kaiser executives:\n\nCommit unfair labor practices\nFailed to respond to numerous dozens of proposals intended to address the growing staffing shortage\nCut the Performance Sharing Plan (PSP) bonus to half its current value\nEliminate protections against subcontracting and outsourcing\nRequire remote workers to permanently return to in-person with only a two-week notice\n\nThe strike will target hundreds of Kaiser locations across California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Virginia and Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cFrontline healthcare workers are ready to sit down with Kaiser executives whenever they\u2019re ready to bargain in good faith,\u201d said Caroline Lucas, executive director of the unions, in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cNo agreement can be made until Kaiser executives stop bargaining in bad faith and committing unfair labor practices.\u201d\n\nJobs affected by the strike will include licensed vocational nurses, emergency department technicians, behavioral health workers, surgical technicians and pharmacists, along with hundreds of other positions, according to the coalition.\n\nKaiser Permanente reported nearly 12.7 million patients and 4.9 million just in Southern California, many of which may need to reschedule non-emergency and elective services, Kaiser said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe take any threat to disrupt care for our members seriously and have plans in place to ensure we can continue to provide high-quality care should a strike actually occur this week,\u201d said a Kaiser Permanente.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep working together to get through this.\u201d\n\nKaiser said they are prepared to ensure the needs of patients continue if a strike ensues.\n\n\u201cI would like people and members to get involved more and look at the other side,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cLook at the workers, the staff, and I hope Kaiser will listen to us. I hope that they will invest more in their manpower because we are the front line.\u201d\n```"}

Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.\n\nBy Spartacus Smith Jr. and Monique Davis\nOctober 03, 2023 at 1:39 pm PDT\n\nOn Sunday night, the trailer dropped for Beyonc\u00e9's highest-grossing tour to date, The Renaissance World Tour. Dripping with behind-the-scenes lore and inspiration, the coming film is a predecessor to Netflix\u2019s \u201cHomecoming\u201d (2019) and Disney\u2019s \u201cBlack is King\u201d (2020). Both films were seen as pivotal moments in Beyonc\u00e9's career, changing the game and celebrating the beauty of Blackness at the highest level. But what\u2019s to come in December is nothing less than unique.\n\nHoning in on Beyonc\u00e9's intention, hard work and involvement in the production of the tour, the trailer teases with quotes from Beyonc\u00e9's creative mind. Only a glimpse is shown of how she seeks to further stamp her legacy and master her craft.\n\nJulia Alexander, a sophomore public relations major, is a two-time concertgoer to Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance world tour and is elated about the news. \u201cI was watching the live stream because I knew the last show was in Kansas City,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI wanted to see what the grand reveal was going to be.\u201d\n\nAfter a highly anticipated wait, Beyonc\u00e9's admired voice tells future moviegoers what the Renaissance Tour movie is all about. \u201cThe goal for this tour was to create a place where everyone is free and no one is judged,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said in the trailer. \u201cAt any point, they can close their eyes and be right back there and take it with them.\u201d\n\nStill recovering from her post-concert high, Alexandria Gee, a senior and communications major, is looking forward to the film\u2019s release. \u201cI just want more Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the Renaissance tour to end.\u201d\n\nThe scouting for tickets has already begun, and some students were surprised by the price. \u201cI heard the tickets are really expensive,\u201d said Emily Sales, a senior majoring in business administration. \u201cLike $28? That\u2019s more expensive than Taylor\u2019s movie [tickets].\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d movie is set to premiere in theaters on Oct. 13, with tickets priced at $19.89, a nod to the re-release of her \u201c1989\u2032\u2032 album. However, there are other students who think that Beyonc\u00e9's potential movie ticket price is worth it. \u201cIt seems really expensive,\u201d said Desta Sahle, a neuroscience and public relations major. \u201cBut I would pay all the money in the world to see Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d\n\nExcited to relive the eye-catching dramatics and performances on stage during Beyonc\u00e9's tour, some of the Beyhive at USC are interested in seeing behind the scenes. \u201cI want to see how [the tour] actually came together,\u201d Gee said. \u201cNot everyone got to experience the Renaissance tour.\u201d\n\nExpressing how resellers made it difficult for some people to get to see the tour, Gee, as well as others who enjoyed Act I, the album itself, believe that \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d is possibly Act II out of the rumored three acts. \u201cIt is Act II,\u201d said Maya Broomfield, a graduate student in specialized journalism. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to go to her concert, but I saw on Instagram that Beyonc\u00e9 kept saying, \u2018You are the visual,\u2019 and she was hinting at it the whole time, and we did not catch it.\u201d\n\nFinally getting \u201cthe visuals\u201d that many have been waiting for, Alexander believes that the upcoming movie will be similar in filming style to Beyonc\u00e9's \u201cHomecoming\u201d in 2019. Switching from rehearsals, family and intimate moments with Beyonc\u00e9 to intense, breathtaking live performances like her previous Netflix documentary, subtle transitions were shown in the trailer, demanding a replay that makes Alexander admit that Beyonc\u00e9 is \u2018full of surprises.\u2019\n\nMary Ikeocha, a senior majoring in psychology, hopes to see some familiar faces like Jay-Z pop up in behind-the-scenes clips. \u201cI hope to see him in the movie,\u201d said Ikeocha. \u201cI hope to see a little bit more explanation about their relationship now with their daughter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sure to be a star-studded movie, as audiences can expect appearances from Jay-Z, Blue Ivy, Tina Knowles, Kevin Aviance, Honey Balenciaga and more. Beyonc\u00e9 sees herself in the film as liberated \u2014 \u201ca new animal\u201d \u2014 as she quotes in the trailer. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go into theaters in our best outfits,\u201d Broomfield said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look good, and we\u2019re going to make Beyonc\u00e9 proud.\u201d\n\nFrom the stunning outfits her fans made for her latest tour to the impact she has already made on ballroom culture, there will be a renaissance in theaters on December 1 that you won\u2019t want to miss.\n```"}

The Olympics have countless sports. Some are so niche that some people have never even heard of them. Sports like these often require very specific training routines, and athletes need extreme precision and accuracy to compete. It may sound intense for sports that don\u2019t always receive a lot of attention, but Vikram Gedipudi wanted to embrace this in the form of archery.\n\nGedipudi, 19, is a sophomore studying economics and math. While Vikram chose USC because of academics, social life and the campus, he also chose USC because it has a club archery team, while his second choice, NYU, does not. Born and raised in San Jose, California, Gedipudi lived a normal life before college. He prioritized school and more mainstream sports like football and basketball. So, the question is, where does archery fit into this? How did he become an archer?\n\n\u201cI did Boy Scouts, so that was my first exposure to it, but I started watching it in the Olympics. I thought it was really cool and wanted to do it.\u201d Gedipudi said. \u201cI started practicing in late 2016, and when I went to my first few tournaments, I was doing pretty well at them.\u201d\n\nFrom the moment Gedipudi encountered Olympic archery, he was fascinated and wanted to expand his archery experience beyond just Boy Scouts. Not too long after, he went out and bought his first bow to start practicing on his own. His first challenge was figuring out where to train. Training for archery can be challenging, because it lacks the same easy access to training facilities that other high school or club teams have. Gedipudi had to search for places to train and eventually found a Junior Olympics Archery Development program, or JOAD for short.\n\nThis JOAD program is what helped Gedipudi begin his journey in archery. He trained and competed with them, which helped him grow as an archer. He learned more about how the sport operates and attended tournaments with JOAD. While he was affiliated with JOAD, all scoring and placements were done individually. JOAD also taught Gedipudi about the different distances at which people shoot. Olympians shoot at targets 70 meters away, but Gedipudi\u2019s division shoots at smaller targets just 55 meters away. The tournaments he attends typically involve shooting 30 arrows a day over the course of two to three days.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a cool concept being able to hit something so far away,\u201d Gedipudi said. \u201cI also like how peaceful it is. Typically I go to outdoor ranges and it\u2019s very peaceful. I get to drive out of the city and suburbs where I live.\u201d\n\nWhen Vikram first started shooting, he did it for fun. However, he soon realized that he had significant potential in the sport. He began taking it more seriously, challenging himself by competing in regional tournaments and even the state tournament. With each competition, he gained more experience and improved steadily. What truly marked a turning point was when he experienced a growth spurt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a podium placer a lot,\u201d Gedipudi said. \u201cIn either 2018 or 2019, I was 2nd in California and 13th in the nation in USA Archery Indoor Nationals.\u201d\n\nWhen Vikram achieved a national ranking, he wasn\u2019t sure how challenging it would be to maintain that position, but it was at this point that his determination and drive truly ignited. Everything appeared to be on the upswing for Vikram, with high hopes of representing Team USA, until tragedy struck, and he suffered a severe injury.\n\nIn addition to archery, Vikram was also a member of his high school football team. At the end of 2020, he tore his pectoral muscle, which rendered him unable to shoot for a significant period. He couldn\u2019t practice at all for six weeks, and when he eventually resumed practice, it took some time to regain his previous form. In the grand scheme of his injuries, the torn pectoral muscle was not the most severe, but what truly affected him was tearing his labrum a year later. This injury sidelined Gedipudi from competing for nearly two years.\n\nDuring this period, he had the option to continue competing but possibly make the injury worse. He faced a choice: risk further injury by shooting or take a break from archery to allow his muscle to fully heal. Gedipudi chose the latter, as he believed that by prioritizing his health, he could always return to archery in the future, whereas still competing could have had severe consequences.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Gedipudi maintained a positive outlook. \u201cThe most important thing is to always be open-minded and optimistic,\u201d Gedipudi said. \u201cIf you start thinking negatively, it is hard to get out of that state. I knew I could get back to where I was.\u201d\n\nNow that he is healthy and back to competing, Gedipudi is ready to get back to training to make Team USA. Regaining the muscle memory and repetition is going to be the key for his training, but the biggest challenge he faces is the mental aspect.\n\n\u201cYou have to be on point with every single shot with no lapses,\u201d Gedipudi said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the biggest thing \u2014 getting back into the mindset to do the same thing every time and doing it well.\u201d\n\nGedipudi has a long road ahead of him, but the former 13th-ranked junior archer in the country has full confidence that by the time he graduates, he will be shooting for Team USA. \u201cYes, I think I can make the team. I was close already for Junior Team USA and I had only been shooting one or two years at that point,\u201d Gedipudi said. \u201cAs long as I don\u2019t get catastrophically injured, then yes, I think I can make it.\u201d\n\nGedipudi is fully driven and prepared to go through lots of training, and with the help of USC Club Archery, he will be better than ever in no time. At this point it\u2019s only a matter of time until we see Gedipudi on Team USA.\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d runs every other Monday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Young Kwak)\n\nBy Will Camardella October 02, 2023 at 8:40 pm PDT\n\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. As the contenders in college football\u2019s toughest conference continue the early part of their schedules, two teams have stood out above the rest. Both Oregon and Washington got road conference wins last Saturday, with the Ducks blowing out Stanford and the Huskies winning in Tucson. Since USC\u2019s defense appears primed for a repeat performance of the end of the 2022 season, I see those two teams as by far the most serious contenders to give the Pac-12 its first College Football Playoff appearance since 2016. Picking the best team right now among those two options is a brutal task, but this is the last chance to speculate. The next game for these opponents will be against each other, after a Week 6 bye.\n\n1. Oregon Ducks (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nFor this week, the Ducks take the top spot after completely dismantling Stanford on the road. One of the biggest knocks of Bo Nix throughout his career is that he has trouble winning games on the road. I\u2019ll grant that Stanford Stadium is far from the most hostile atmosphere in the country, but Nix finished his afternoon with four touchdown passes and five incompletions against the Cardinal. Dan Lanning\u2019s defense has really stood out for Oregon since conference play began. The unit is allowing just six points per game in Pac-12 play, while the second-lowest scoring defense in the conference is at more than twice that number. It has been lethal at the line of scrimmage, ranking seventh in the country in sacks and recording 11 tackles for loss on Saturday. The Ducks have looked like a well-oiled machine on both sides of the ball for four of their five games this season. I\u2019d have a hard time betting against this group to win the conference right now.\n\n2. Washington Huskies (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nYes, I dropped Washington a spot after struggling more than it should have on the road last Saturday, only beating the unranked Arizona Wildcats 31-24. This is not because I am overly concerned about the team moving forward, but simply because the margin between my top two teams is razor thin. Arizona entered that game with one objective defensively: limit the explosive pass game of the Huskies. I thought the way Michael Penix Jr. responded to that game plan was extremely effective; he took what the defense gave him and led long, methodical drives that turned into points. Washington only had three full offensive drives in the first half but scored touchdowns on all of them. I suspect that we will see similar defensive approaches in some of the Huskies\u2019 bigger games down the road, and if so, they will need to do a much better job converting in the red zone. Two solid potential scoring drives in the second half stalled out, with one resulting in a field goal and the other ending on a lost fumble on first and goal. Such missed opportunities gave Arizona the opportunity to hang around and get within one score in the closing minutes of the game. Against more potent offenses, those failed scoring chances could come back to bite this team.\n\n3. USC Trojans (5-0, 3-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nUSC may not have moved in my rankings, but the gap between them and my top two teams has significantly widened. I am officially sounding the alarm on this defense. A game where Caleb Williams throws six touchdown passes and the Trojans accumulate nearly 500 yards of offense should never end in a one-score game. The Buffaloes entered this game with one of the worst rushing offenses in college football, but that didn\u2019t stop them from recording nearly 200 yards on the ground against the USC defense. Colorado scored touchdowns on four of its final five offensive drives, causing a game that was 34-7 to come down to an onside kick. The Trojan secondary has shown signs of weakness in all five games this season, but Colorado was able to expose it over, and over, and over again, even without Travis Hunter. The Buffaloes had five passing plays of over 20 yards as the USC defensive backs struggled to defend down the field and struggled to tackle. This defense has a much better pass rush than last season\u2019s, but every other aspect of the unit looks as bad, if not worse, than it was a year ago. The Trojans failed to make the College Football Playoff in 2022 because of the combined 89 points they allowed in their two losses to Utah. After surrendering 41 to a below-average team the week after allowing 28 to one of the worst teams in the conference, the likelihood that a similar outcome takes place is quite high.\n\n4. Washington State Cougars (4-0, 1-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nWashington State was idle this week, but their signature win over Oregon State a week ago looks even better after the Beavers took down Utah. Oregon State\u2019s defense returned to form in that game, making Cam Ward\u2019s monster day that much more impressive. The Cougars will have their first road conference test next week when they visit UCLA. If this team can show an ability to handle its business away from Pullman, they should absolutely be considered the dark horse to win this conference.\n\n5. Oregon State Beavers (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nOregon State\u2019s offensive output on Friday night won\u2019t light up any stat sheets, but it was enough to get the job done against one of the stingiest defenses in the country. Silas Bolden was the Beavers\u2019 everyman, with over 150 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns. The strength of this OSU team is its defense, so it was encouraging for that unit to get back on track last weekend. Of the 12 offensive drives Utah had in that game, it failed to eclipse 10 yards of offense on seven of them. The Beavers have a top five rushing defense in the nation, proving it again by holding the Utes to under two yards per carry on 32 attempts. I am still skeptical that DJ Uiagalelei can go toe-to-toe with the elites at the top of this conference, but this defense has proven good enough to keep Oregon State competitive when it plays its best game.\n\n6. Utah Utes (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nTo have a chance to three-peat as Pac-12 champions, Utah needed to survive its early slate without Cam Rising in the lineup. On Friday night, its extremely limited offense finally doomed the Utes. Nate Johnson\u2019s QBR this season is 45.7, good for 91st in the country. In his start against Oregon State, that number was a dismal 9.7 as he completed just over a third of his passing attempts. This Utah offense has been mediocre against weak competition, and unwatchable against some of the conference\u2019s best defenses. The Beavers knew the Utes could only run the ball, so they loaded the box and held them to less than two yards per carry as a team. You can expect very similar approaches moving forward for as long as Johnson or Bryson Barnes lead this offense. Utah\u2019s defense is still elite, so much so that they will be in the game with just about any opponent. However, until this team gets its starting quarterback back, defensive touchdowns may be the only way they can outscore any opponent worth its salt.\n\n7. Colorado Buffaloes (3-2, 0-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nI had this team dead and buried after getting its doors blown off in Eugene two weeks ago. Colorado\u2019s first half against USC did nothing to change my outlook on them, but, to give credit where credit is due, the team showed a lot of heart in that second-half comeback attempt. Shedeur Sanders has been as under siege as any quarterback in the sport since the season began, but it has yet to affect his play. His offense wound up out-gaining the highly vaunted Trojan unit, and Sanders got considerably better as the game progressed. I completely agree with Deion Sanders\u2019 sentiment after the game: if that contest was five minutes longer, the Buffs would have beaten a top-10 opponent. Timetables for Travis Hunter and Shilo Sanders are still unknown, but if those two playmakers on defense return, the Buffaloes could make some noise again as their schedule starts to get easier.\n\n8. UCLA Bruins (3-1, 0-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nThe Bruins were the other Pac-12 team not to play this weekend, but they will have a big test on Saturday when they welcome Washington State to the Rose Bowl. UCLA\u2019s defense has been great against the run this season, but the Cougars are the first great passing offense that it will face. If the Bruins fancy themselves a contender in this loaded conference in 2023, Dante Moore will need to show he can exchange scores with the more experienced quarterbacks in the Pac-12. The game environment will be much more favorable to him at home than at Rice-Eccles Stadium, where he lost to Utah 14-7, so this is his time to show that he and his team belong.\n\n9. Arizona Wildcats (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nCredit to the Wildcats, they were the first team this season to make Washington\u2019s offense look mortal. Right now, Arizona is allowing an average of 21 points per game. That is not a mind-blowing rate, but it shows the unit is competent enough to give a fight to the top-tier teams in the Pac-12. The Wildcats are showing good commitment to the run game and controlling the clock, a must-do when facing Caleb Williams next week. Noah Fifta has done a better job in his two appearances protecting the football than Jayden de Laura has, throwing just one pick compared to de Laura\u2019s conference-leading five. If the defense continues to limit the big play and stand up well in the red zone, the Wildcats may have an outside shot of pulling off a major upset down the road, as they did at the Rose Bowl in 2022 over UCLA.\n\n10. Cal Golden Bears (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nCal will be happy to have taken down Arizona State at home, given that wins will be hard to come by for most of this season. However, squeaking by a weak Sun Devil team won\u2019t be enough for me to raise the Golden Bears\u2019 stock. This passing offense has a lot of problems, as Sam Jackson V completed just 42% of his passes and had a QBR below 20. Cal needed to rely entirely on its rushing attack to win on Saturday, as it ran the ball over 40 times. Currently, the team is second in the conference in rushing yards per game, but is more towards the middle of the pack in yards per attempt. The Golden Bears have a consistent attack, but they are not explosive in any real way. That\u2019s an issue, since explosiveness may be the biggest key to being a competitive offense in the Pac-12 this year.\n\n11. Arizona State Sun Devils (1-4, 0-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 12\nAfter punching above their weight against USC two weeks ago, I anticipated Arizona State to regress back to the mean in games that would be harder to get motivated for. Instead, the Sun Devils competed for a second straight week, having the ball in the fourth quarter with a chance to win the game. It seems as if this team finally has some quarterback stability with Trenton Bourguet, who threw for nearly 400 yards in his first start of the season. Having a weapon like Cam Skattebo helps a lot in that area; he was quiet on the ground but was ASU\u2019s leading receiver with 98 yards. When the season appeared to be spiraling two weeks ago, Kenny Dillingham gave an impassioned speech about fighting and believing his team can win. The Sun Devils are not going to win very much, but credit to them for putting two straight respectable efforts together.\n\n12. Stanford Cardinal (1-4, 0-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\nMost teams in the bottom half of this conference have been able to put up a fight against superior competition when playing on their home turf. Stanford, on the other hand, allowed Oregon to come into its home stadium and wipe the floor with them. Justin Lamson threw 20 passes and had 22 rush attempts, but was poor at doing both. He only completed 55% of his passing attempts and averaged 1.5 yards per carry. The Cardinal offensive line has not been competitive against any serious competition, and the offense is completely stagnant. On the other side of the ball, Stanford allows a conference-leading 38 points per game on defense. Its two tough conference games thus far have been over by halftime, and the team can\u2019t even earn wins against the likes of Sacramento State. While Arizona State has begun to compete a lot harder, Stanford has regressed from their Week 1 win every week since. I don\u2019t see another win on the Cardinal\u2019s schedule.\n```"}

The event was guarded by Department of Public Safety and LAPD officers as dozens of Armenian demonstrators came to protest Mercan\u2019s appearance.\n\nThe protesters spoke out against the situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region by the Turkey-backed Azerbaijani military forces. Over 100,000 ethnic Armenian refugees have fled now dissolved Nagorno-Karabakh, which Armenia has called \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d ABC reported.\n\nThe tensions between Armenia, Turkey and Azerbaijan originated in the early 1900s due to the Armenian Genocide. From 1915-16, hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians living in the Ottoman Empire (present day Turkey) suffered through mass killings, ill treatment, exposure and starvation, per the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nThis year-long genocide was the root cause of the term \u2018genocide\u2019 and its codification in international law. Over 200,000 Armenians live in Los Angeles as of 2016, making up the largest population of Armenians outside of Armenia itself, per the BBC.\n\nThe university itself also has a sizable community; there are almost 1,000 Armenian students at USC at any given time, according to former USC Dornsife dean Steve Kay.\n\nThe USC Armenian community expressed frustration and hurt at the university\u2019s response to their concerns. Dr. Sushain Karapetian, director of the USC Dornsife Institute of Armenian Studies, said that the institute \u201creached out to Robert Banks, to Dean Bay, to President Folt, to President Folt\u2019s comms team \u2014 both to keep them in the loop about what\u2019s happening in Artsakh and also how insensitive the timing of this event is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I reached out the Friday before the event,\u201d Karapetian said. \u201cThe president\u2019s team got back to me Thursday. I don\u2019t think Robert Banks responded to me, nor Dean Bay. No one from this administration responded.\u201d\n\nBanks is the director of the Master\u2019s of Public Diplomacy Program and Willow Bay serves as the dean for the USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism. USC PR did not respond to Annenberg Media\u2019s request for comment.\n\nPrior to Friday\u2019s event, USC Annenberg said in a statement to the USC Armenian Students Association: \u201cWe recognize and understand that the USC Armenian Students\u2019 Association has objections to this event. The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism believes that the freedom to express one\u2019s views are at the foundation of what it means to be part of a research university.\u201d\n\nProtestors outside of Wallis Annenberg Hall. (Photo by Alan Mittelstaedt)\n\nBaghdasaryan said that the university\u2019s event and subsequent statement was \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also heartbreaking to know that the institution that you\u2019re working with that you trust and believe in ... is rejecting you, is rejecting your pain and is saying on the basis of \u2018academic freedom\u2019 and \u2018freedom of speech,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nTalia Wansikehian, the president of the USC Armenian Students Association, said that the events have taken a toll on Armenian students, as well.\n\n\u201cA lot of students are still frustrated. We\u2019re struggling,\u201d Wansikehian said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending all of our time organizing. You\u2019re obviously emotionally distraught. And there\u2019s just no tangible support coming from the community that\u2019s leaving everyone feeling very alone.\u201d\n\nWansikehian also spoke about how the Armenian community has come together through the shared experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our culture and it\u2019s our values. And especially when something like this happens, like no one really understands it,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one gets it as much as another fellow Armenian, and no one feels that hurt.\u201d\n\nArmenian students have not experienced solidarity from the entirety of the USC community. Increasing hate towards Armenian students following Friday\u2019s protest has been seen on Sidechat, an anonymous-posting platform for universities.\n\n\u201cPSA to the Armenians! Every Armenian I\u2019ve come across has been so judgemental and racist and just rude,\u201d one user posted. Another anonymous user said, \u201cReasons why USC dropped to 28 in the national rankings: Armenians.\u201d\n\nWansikehian said the posts are \u201ddisgustingly discriminatory against the Armenian students on campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cPosts that we are \u2018wanting to be oppressed\u2019 or making fun of the protesting efforts, leave our students hurt,\u201d Wansikehian continued. \u201cMocking us in the time of mourning and grief has shown yet again that USC and its students have not shown solidarity with the Armenian students.\u201d\n\nArmenian students and faculty are advocating for greater resources from the university to spread education on the situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Wansikehian hopes for some collaboration with other student organizations and the administration to ensure that it\u2019s \u201cnot just an Armenian issue, it\u2019s a humanitarian issue.\u201d\n\nKarapetian reflected a similar sentiment.\n\n\u201cI think we need all the resources and guidance on really dealing with the impact of both what happened in Artsakh and what happened here on this campus and the kind of tremendous consequences of that,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Armenian community remains dedicated to advocating for themselves and being heard by the university.\n\n\u201cI think we need a meaningful discussion,\u201d Karapetian said. \u201cWe need to figure out how to repair our relationships and reputation with our community.\u201d\n```"}

In the first-ever undisputed four-belt championship fight, judges\u2019 scorecards were 119-108 and 118-109 (twice). \u00c1lvarez made a statement in his 60th career win by outclassing a hesitant Charlo every second of the fight.\n\n\u00c1lvarez is known for having slow starts and taking time to figure out his opponents in the early rounds, but that was not the case for this fight. He set the tone early by walking down Charlo and cutting off the ring, never allowing him to get comfortable in the fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong man,\u201d Alvarez said in a post-fight interview. \u201cNobody can beat this Canelo.\u201d\n\nCharlo, who retains his four belts at the 154-pound weight class, had successful moments during the fight, especially doubling up on the jab to begin combinations. He caught \u00c1lvarez with some counterpunches to disrupt offensive advances. Nevertheless, Charlo failed to generate consistent offensive output against \u00c1lvarez, never posing a threat to the Mexican fighter.\n\n\u201cYou could feel the difference in weight because I came up 12 pounds,\u201d Charlo said. \u201cI was daring to be great today. I took the shots and just kept pushing.\u201d\n\nThe climax of the night came when \u00c1lvarez scored a delayed knockdown against Charlo with a straight right in the seventh round. \u00c1lvarez had been setting up the punch the whole fight by throwing a wide right hook to the outside of Charlo\u2019s guard. Canelo waited for his moment and when Charlo anticipated the wide right, Canelo slipped the punch within his guard. Charlo was defenseless, taking a knee soon after.\n\nAccording to \u00c1lvarez, this was his first outing in which he was able to fight at full strength, blaming the criticisms from his last three fights on a left wrist injury that impacted his training.\n\n\u201cWe trained for three months in the mountains without my family or anything because I just love boxing so f---ing much,\u2019\u2019 \u00c1lvarez said. \u201cBoxing is my life and boxing has made me the best in the game today.\u201d\n\nIn his post-fight interview, \u00c1lvarez was vocal about his satisfaction with a 12-round win as opposed to a knockout, and voiced his aspirations to get back into the ring as soon as possible. When asked about a potential matchup against the young knockout machine David Benavidez, \u00c1lvarez said; \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t f\u2013ing care.\u201d\n\nCharlo made it clear that he will be going back down to 154 division to fight and even called out the No. 1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world, Terrence Crawford.\n\nMy takeaways: \u00c1lvarez heard the noise. At the ripe age of 33, he is aging fine like a Napa Valley red and continues to display why he is the face of boxing. He has natural power that cannot be taught and has stood the test of time dating back to his debut at age 15. If you pair his strength with his ring intellect, he can continue at this level for another 3-4 years.\n\nAlvarez departed his longtime training location and residence in San Diego to relocate to Truckee, Calif. at an altitude of 5,817 feet above sea level. The endurance he gained from this training allowed him to not fatigue in this 12 round fight as opposed to previous fights. He did not load on his punches during this fight. He used the jab and punched other parts of the body: the shoulders, biceps, hips. All of these efforts combined slowly whittled Charlo down.\n\nA fight against Benavidez is likely next. We can pray for a superfight on Cinco De Mayo. This would be a huge treat for fans to watch, two great Mexican fighters in the ring \u2014 one an established legend whose longevity seems endless and another a young lion who dares to foil Canelo\u2019s crowning years.\n\nCharlo, you made the money man, now go back down to your middleweight division to get back in the win column. The reality is that when you fight at a lower weight for most of your career, then decide to move up, you will be affected. The body needs time to adjust to new weight, making the speed Charlo is known for a non-factor in this fight. The bold move up two weight classes was not executed efficiently. It was obvious that he was slower and lacked power, but his timidity within the ring was the most surprising. Granted, \u00c1lvarez is a stone-cold warrior that injects fear into most opponents. Charlo is known for being a hothead in and out the ring. I thought he would let loose, implementing his \u201cwild\u201d but calculated striking. \u00c1lvarez was never in danger throughout the fight and it made me question whether Charlo was there for the purse rather than actually winning. Calling out Terrence Crawford after a lackluster performance seemed like yet another calculated money grab. In the words of Lavar Ball, \u201cStay in yo lane.\u201d\n```"}

Gavin Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler, president of the political action committee EMILY\u2019s list, on Sunday to fill the late Dianne Feinstein\u2019s seat in the U.S. Senate. Butler will serve as California\u2019s first openly LGBTQ+ senator and the first Black lesbian in U.S. congressional history until Feinstein\u2019s term ends in 2024.\n\nButler posted her reaction on X, formerly Twitter, Monday: \"I'm honored to accept Gov. @GavinNewsom's nomination to be U.S. Senator for a state I have made my home and honored by his trust in me to serve the people of California and this great nation.\"\n\nIn her post, Butler paid tribute to Feinstein, who died Friday at 90, promising to continue her predecessor\u2019s work on progressive policies. \u201cNo one will ever measure up to the legacy of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, but I will do my best to honor her legacy and leadership by committing to work for women and girls, workers and unions, struggling parents, and all of California,\u201d Butler wrote.\n\nThe Mississippi native has never held a spot in elected office but has a wide range of political experience. As the current president of EMILY\u2019s List, Butler has worked towards getting more Democratic, pro-choice women elected to office nationwide. Gov. Newsom\u2019s office called EMILY\u2019s List, \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest organization dedicated to electing women,\u201d in a letter announcing Butler\u2019s appointment Sunday.\n\n\u201cAn advocate for women and girls, a second-generation fighter for working people, and a trusted adviser to Vice President [Kamala] Harris, Laphonza Butler represents the best of California, and she\u2019ll represent us proudly in the United States Senate,\u201d Newsom said in the letter.\n\nButler worked alongside Vice President Harris as an adviser on Harris\u2019 2020 presidential campaign. Now, she follows in Harris\u2019 footsteps as just the second Black woman to represent California in the U.S. Senate.\n\nPrior to her recent Senate appointment, Butler also spent time as a partner at the political consulting firm Bearstar Strategies. The firm is run by Ace Smith, Sean Clegg, and Juan Rodriguez, longtime strategists for Newsom. The firm\u2019s website notes that it \u201cserved as general and media consultant for Gavin Newsom\u2019s winning campaign for Governor.\u201d\n\nButler\u2019s appointment brings full circle a promise that Gov. Newsom made during a 2021 MSNBC interview to nominate a Black woman to replace Feinstein had she left office before her term officially ended. Newsom, after being asked by MSNBC host Joy Reid whether he\u2019d commit to naming a Black woman to the Senate if Feinstein stepped down, said, \u201cI have multiple names in mind. We have multiple names in mind... and the answer is yes.\u201d\n\nButler was not the only Black woman believed to be in contention to fill Feinstein\u2019s seat. Barbara Lee, a Democrat Rep. from California\u2019s 12th congressional district, has been campaigning for Feinstein\u2019s seat since the late Senator announced in February that she would not run for reelection in 2024. Lee, along with fellow Reps. Adam Schiff and Katie Porter, made up a trio of candidates considered the front runners for the position by publications like CNN and ABC.\n\nHowever, Newsom said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in September that he would not appoint anyone running in the Senate primary to fill the vacant seat. Newsom instead said that he planned on making an \u201cinterim appointment\u201d as he did not want to \u201ctip the balance\u201d of the Senate race.\n\nDespite this, Newsom\u2019s office has said that Butler will be able to run in 2024 should she want to. Butler lived in California between 2009 and 2021 but has lived and been registered to vote in Maryland since.\n\nKamy Akhavan, executive director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future, told Annenberg Media that while people have criticized Newsom\u2019s appointment of an out-of-state candidate, he believes the choice still makes sense despite Butler\u2019s location.\n\nAkhavan said that Butler\u2019s connections to and work with California politicians such as Newsom and Harris, as well as her ability to fundraise and uphold progressive policies were likely things that Newsom saw as an advantage.\n\nAkhavan wasn\u2019t sure how much of an advantage Butler will have if she chooses to run for the Senate seat in 2024, but he did say that she is in the rare position of being a senator without previously holding elected office, which may work in her favor.\n\nAkhavan said that Butler will likely employ some strategies to win over her constituents that rely on emphasizing her connections to the state. \u201cShe is going to play up her California credentials as much as you possibly can,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018I used to live in this place. I love Disneyland. Boy, isn\u2019t the beach great?\u2019 Expect to hear those kinds of statements from her to really connect with Californians and prove to us that she\u2019s one of us.\u201d\n\nAkhavan also said to expect Butler to continue aligning with California\u2019s \u201cdeep blue\u201d ideals by pushing progressive policies that she has already been working with.\n\nButler will be sworn in Tuesday by Vice President Harris at the U.S. Capitol.\n```"}

Academic Integrity Week will go through October 6. Students and instructors will learn how to detect and report academic dishonesty, examine student well-being and contribute to a culture of \u201cintegrity, excellence, and accountability,\u201d according to OAI.\n\nPer the Northern Illinois University Academic Integrity Tutorial, anxiety surrounding academic performance can sacrifice integrity. During Monday\u2019s kickoff event, Wills, who specializes in psychology and behavioral sciences, spoke to students and faculty about how stress relates to academic dishonesty. According to Wills, attending USC poses an expectation to succeed academically, financially and socially.\n\n\u201cStudents set high standards and put so much pressure on themselves that it doesn\u2019t seem feasible that \u201c[they] could fail,\u201d Wills said in her speech. She iterated that when students feel that it isn\u2019t feasible to go into a test without being the \u201cmost prepared,\u201d they could feel urged to take a shortcut.\n\n\u201cThe other thing about stress is that it can lead to rigidity, and so, rigidity is where we fail to see the full view around us, \" Wills continued. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at one sliver, and that one sliver is telling us that \u2018I need that A, I need to pass this class.\u201d\n\nSome graduate students shared their thoughts after attending the event regarding how it enabled them to realize they\u2019re not alone. \u201cI really like these kinds of sessions,\u201d said Sina Ilkhani, a graduate student studying chemistry. \u201cI can join with other people and also better myself in different aspects like pressure and how to connect with others.\u201d\n\nJia Khan, another graduate student studying chemistry, said, \u201cI just want to be more open on the ways to manage stress effectively, especially as graduate students where I know many students may suffer from the imposter syndrome, where they question their credibility and their skills.\u201d\n\nStudies conducted by the International Center for Academic Integrity reveal that more than 60% of university students admit to cheating in some form. Kelly Greco, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at USC, shared insight on how stress may contribute to the reliance on plagiarism to complete assignments.\n\nWhen students get stressed out, they begin to have \u201crigid thinking,\u201d according to Greco. Students hone in on their fear of failing and running out of time, and \u201cif the panic and anxiety and stress is high, then we risk making decisions that may not benefit us,\u201d she said.\n\nGreco offered pieces of advice on managing academic rigor and stress. She recommended creating a daily structure that includes appointments, classes and meetings, and other stress relieving activities. To combat worrying about unconsciously spending too much time on a break, Greco advised that students \u201cset a timer on your phone to go off to prompt you to go back to the task.\u201d\n\nAccording to Greco, students often compare themselves to other students who are able to sit down and study for long periods of time and as a result, they put themselves down, which exacerbates their stress. \u201cWe\u2019re our worst critic,\u201d said Greco. \u201cWe\u2019re very hard on ourselves. And that negative self-talk can really impact our performance and the decisions that we make.\u201d\n\nIn her kickoff speech, Wills expressed that by managing \u201cour inner critic,\u201d students may be able to end up in a place where they wouldn\u2019t have to seek out those \u201cshortcuts.\u201d According to Greco, by focusing more on \u201cour strengths, our choices, our options, our resources,\u201d students can feel more empowered to make decisions that benefit their wellbeing rather than act out of panic.\n\nSpecifically, she said that taking advantage of moments of peak energy and motivation can help students establish a personal schedule that allows them to properly prepare.\n\nAside from Monday\u2019s event, the OAI will host six more occasions around campus in accordance with Academic Integrity Week. More information can be found on the OAI\u2019s webpage.\n\nAcademic Integrity Events\n\nInformation Literacy Instruction Librarian Ariana Varela will teach attendees how to practice media literacy in the John McKay Center October 3 from 11 to 12 p.m.\n\nLibrarians Jennifer Silverman and Michaela Ullmann will define plagiarism and how to avoid it October 4 from 10 to 11 a.m. That same day, members of the Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity will give attendees tips on managing time and stress in the Social Sciences Building (SOS) from 2:30 to 3:30 p.m.\n\nOAI will host a thesis workshop for graduate students October 5 from 11 to 12 p.m in SOS.

He\u2019s from Las Vegas and was raised by a single father. He was homeschooled his entire life. He\u2019s Black and Hispanic and from a low-income background \u2014 but for the past two years, he\u2019s found his community at the University of Southern California.\n\nA cinema and media studies major, Adkins enjoys both the academic and social prestige that the university boasts. Those close to him describe him as a quiet yet social, soft-natured student, son, roommate and friend.\n\nBut Adkins carries a heavy burden on his shoulders that\u2019s been weighing on him since his freshman year. At the end of the 2022 spring semester, Adkins was suspended from USC after the LAPD wrongfully arrested him for a violent crime.\n\nAs he recounted, \u201c[It was] obviously just devastating, like, psychologically. I knew I was innocent but I was tricking myself into believing it was my fault because I put myself in that situation.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, once he was proven innocent and released from custody, USC eventually let him back on campus, but the path to reach his invitation back was fraught and left him feeling unsupported by his school.\n\nWhile USC won\u2019t comment on his specific situation due to student privacy, a university spokesperson said \u201cinterim action safety measures\u201d are often applied in situations like this one, and then \u201cmodified\u201d when new information comes to light.\n\nAccording to LAPD police reports, at roughly 9:30 p.m. on the night of April 29, 2022, an armed robbery took place in a parking lot off of Olive Street in Downtown L.A., roughly 2.5 miles northeast of USC\u2019s University Park campus. Two individuals held a couple at gunpoint as their car was ransacked.\n\nAfter the suspects drove off with the stolen items, LAPD officers were eventually able to locate a car matching the description given by the couple on West 35th Street, just across the street from USC.\n\nAt the time of the initial crime, Adkins was in attendance at the \u201cSC Choreographic Showcase\u201d at Bing Theatre near the center of USC\u2019s campus, evidenced by an electronic ticket receipt. He went with a small group to support a friend who was performing.\n\nAdkins\u2019 actions from that night were self-reported in a \u201cFalse Arrest Victim Complaint Letter,\u201d which was sent to Charles Zukowski, USC\u2019s provost at the time.\n\nAccording to this written timeline of events, after parting from the group he had attended the showcase with, Adkins met with friend Aivy Levan, a then-freshman majoring in biological sciences, and others at Birnkrant Residential College on the east side of campus at around 10 p.m.\n\nThe group took a Lyft to a party at 3414 Catalina Street, arriving at roughly 11 p.m. As written in Adkins\u2019 statement, he left the party sometime after 1 a.m., and screenshots from the student\u2019s phone log reviewed by Annenberg Media show a series of frantic calls and text messages to friends \u2014 including Levan \u2014 and family.\n\nA little after this time, Adkins explained that he noticed the growing sound of sirens and a helicopter. Officers eventually arrived at Adkins\u2019 location on Catalina Street, a couple streets over from where the suspects\u2019 vehicle was found.\n\n\u201cI tried explaining that I was a USC student simply walking home, but I had no human response from any of these officers,\u201d Adkins said.\n\nHe was arrested at 1:50 a.m. the morning of April 30 by three LAPD officers. No body camera footage was ever released to the public or to Adkins and his family.\n\nLAPD declined to comment directly on the situation, citing an internal investigation.\n\nAccording to his arrest record, Adkins was charged with two felonies: aggravated robbery and the use of a firearm during the crime. These charges were the complete antithesis to who Adkins was \u2014 a star student with no criminal record.\n\nThree minors were taken into custody as Adkins\u2019 codefendants even though he had no relation to the individuals.\n\nAccording to court records, one co-defendant recently took a plea deal and pleaded no contest to Penal Code 245(a)(4): Assault by Means Likely to Produce Great Bodily Injury.\n\nAdkins\u2019 co-defendants\u2019 statuses as minors makes the progress of their cases difficult to track.\n\nBooking records show that Adkins was detained at the LAPD Metropolitan Detention Center at 3:16 a.m.\n\nThe young student described how he was transferred to and from court, Los Angeles Men\u2019s County Jail, and Wayside Jail (also known as Pitchess Detention Center) until he was finally given a jail dorm at Wayside.\n\nHe explained that he was \u201ctreated like a dog,\u201d with phone calls and shoes withheld for four days and meals that were \u201cburnt to the point of being inedible while being in a cell designed to torture the claustrophobic 24/7.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs day by day went on, I started to get more and more depressed and ... suicidal,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou\u2019re literally in a stone room with bars, one toilet and 20 other guys.\u201d\n\nTo friends and family, Adkins had seemingly vanished.\n\nAfter four days, Adkins was allowed outside contact and called those close to him, including Tom\u00e1s Manea, a current junior studying quantitative biology.\n\nManea was a good friend, and had been a member of the group that Adkins had attended the SC Choreography Showcase with the night of his arrest.\n\nOnce permitted, Manea visited Adkins in jail.\n\nAfter understanding what had transpired, Manea called the then-dean of Student Affairs, as well as officials within the Department of Public Safety at USC in order to try and figure out what role the school could play in aiding Adkins \u2014 whether that be legal, financial or psychological.\n\nHis efforts seemingly fell on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cI called the dean and I was like, \u2018Hey, one of your students, who is my close friend, was arrested. What can you do? Are there resources? Can we go to Gould?\u2019 ... They didn\u2019t care,\u201d Manea explained.\n\n\u201cI got more advice from my law student friend than I did from the whole entire USC institute.\u201d\n\nAivy Levan, as one of the friends who had also been with Adkins the night of his arrest, described how she chose to become involved in the defense of her friend, \u201cI did go to ... the pre-trial, and said if necessary, I would fly down to L.A. and take a stand or act as a witness.\u201d\n\nLevan is from the Bay Area.\n\nAccording to court records, Adkins\u2019 bail was set to $150,000 after his arraignment on May 2, 2022.\n\nRecounting his primary reactions after this hearing, Adkins explained, \u201cI hear[d] the story against me and then it definitely got to the point where I was like, yeah, it\u2019s over. Everything that I worked for, that I\u2019ve done ... my life is over.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Judah\u2019s father, Eric Adkins, was notified by USC via email that his son had been indefinitely suspended from the university.\n\nAs his father and sole caretaker, Eric Adkins recounted the horror he experienced combatting the allegations against his only child, \u201c[When] you have a beautiful child and all of a sudden somebody comes and tells you something about your child [like that] ... my son would not take a shotgun and put it to someone\u2019s head ... It\u2019s just too inhumane. It\u2019s just not him.\u201d\n\nWith such a high bail and now academic suspension, Adkins, as well as his family, felt severe distress leading up to his preliminary hearing on May 16.\n\nFinancial burdens were mounting through travel and legal fees on top of the bail request.\n\nUnfortunately, Adkins would remain detained between Los Angeles County facilities for nearly two weeks.\n\nThe young student\u2019s eventual exoneration would come by a rigorous investigation of his cell phone, which Adkins was lucky to have had on him the night of his arrest.\n\nAccording to the DA\u2019s office and Adkins\u2019 defense attorney Rob Pfeiffer, investigators looked at the student\u2019s phone, examining applications like Life360 and other location trackers that showed that he was nowhere near the scene of the crime when it occurred.\n\nAfter two miserable, restless and stressful weeks, Adkins was released on his own recognizance on May 11.\n\nCourt-sanctioned \u201cpretrial supervision\u201d meant that the student had to wear an ankle monitor at all times, that he wasn\u2019t to leave the area specified by this supervision, and that he was to report back to his preliminary hearing five days later.\n\nDuring his preliminary hearing on May 16, court transcripts show Adkins\u2019 attorney objecting to the ankle monitor provision, explaining that it would prohibit Adkins from fulfilling summer plans he may have had such as internships and jobs as a college student.\n\nThose transcripts also show Judge Kevin S. Rosenberg acknowledging the difficulties that Adkins would face donning the device.\n\nStill, the provision was upheld as Adkins had been charged with a felony, and was therefore still considered a threat to society.\n\nThis hearing concluded that a formal court date was to be set for June 7, 2022.\n\nAt this point, however, the damage had already been done.\n\nBetween jail time and USC\u2019s suspension, Adkins had missed his last few weeks of freshman year, including all of his finals.\n\nHe describes how the university never offered any academic compensation for this lost time.\n\nIf it hadn\u2019t been for his individual professors that he had contacted about his case, it was likely that he would have had to retake the entire semester \u2014 a major financial burden.\n\nAdditionally, Adkins was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder at Silver State Health Services in Las Vegas soon after his release, with symptoms including sleep disturbances, hypervigilance, flashbacks and increased anxiety.\n\nUpon release from jail on May 11, Adkins was immediately directed by USC to remove his belongings from his dorm at Cale & Irani Residential College.\n\nEscorted by DPS officers and a residential advisor in the middle of the day, he described the embarrassment and shame he felt as he was instructed to hastily remove all of his belongings in front of his peers, friends and roommates, all while wearing that ankle monitor.\n\nHe described the situation as \u201ca total nightmare.\u201d\n\nAdkins was escorted out of his dorm by DPS officers and one of the residential advisors in his building.\n\nTom\u00e1s Manea, who stayed involved throughout the case, accused USC of a lack of support for Adkins during this time.\n\n\u201cA lot of [his friends] are not necessarily from the most resourced backgrounds, myself included,\u201d Manea said.\u201d So we had to find housing because we had to stay here... The school didn\u2019t help with that.\u201d\n\nManea offered to stay with Adkins until his dad was able to successfully petition to get his son back home, and the two resided at the Lorenzo, a non-USC affiliated off-campus apartment complex, with a friend for a short period.\n\nAfterwards, Adkins was finally able to return home to his dad, although the ankle monitor remained until prosecutors officially dropped the charges three weeks later.\n\nAdkins\u2019 father explained, \u201cHe was guilty until proven innocent. And to this day, he\u2019s still marginalized...I don\u2019t care what anyone says. I think he\u2019s totally affected.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Media asked USC a series of questions about Adkins\u2019 situation.\n\nThe university declined an interview request but sent the following statement:\n\n\u201cThe university is deeply committed to the well-being of every student and does all it can to apply its policies in a compassionate and thoughtful manner.\n\nWhile we cannot discuss the specifics of individual cases due to federal student privacy laws, we believe the university acted appropriately in this matter based on the information available at the time.\n\nInterim action safety measures may be applied while we gather more information, and they are often modified or released as additional information comes to light.\u201d\n\nUSC utilized Section 10.10(f)(i) of the student handbook in Adkins\u2019 suspension, which states, \u201cIn some cases, Interim Protective Measures [IPM] may be imposed when there is information that, if true, indicates the student poses a substantial threat: (i) to the safety or well-being of anyone in the university community...\u201d\n\nThe forward of Section 10.10(f) explains that alterations to these parameters cannot be made without an initial review.\n\nAn appeal was made by Adkins and his family on April 29, 2022.\n\nOn June 6, 2022, over a month after Adkins\u2019 arrest and more than two weeks after his initial release from jail, the student\u2019s suspension appeal was rejected following review.\n\nPart of his rejection reads, \u201cIn your appeal, you raised concerns that the alleged conduct currently under review by SJACS and outside law enforcement involves a case of mistaken identity, specifically that you were falsely arrested and placed under investigation.\n\nYou shared details of your activity the day in question, witnesses who could corroborate your activity and locations at the time of the alleged crime, and the significant negative effects the experience has had upon you.\n\nAs noted above, the sole basis for modifying an Interim Protective Measure during the appeal process is whether \u2018less protective measures could adequately reduce or mitigate the threat.\u2019\n\nIt is not the forum to explore the merits of the allegations made against you, nor is there any determination as to whether or not you engaged in prohibited conduct.\n\nBased on my review of your appeal and the information relied upon by the Committee, I have concluded that in deciding to impose the Interim Suspension, the Committee appropriately conducted the safety and risk assessment required by Section 10.10(f)(i).\n\nThe Committee specifically considered the factors set forth in that section and determined that Interim Suspension should be imposed to ensure the health and safety of the University community.\n\nBased on the foregoing, your appeal of the Interim Protective Measures is denied.\u201d\n\nPart of a letter sent on June 21, 2022 that finally allowed Adkins back onto USC\u2019s campus from Daren Mooko, the interim vice provost for community expectations at the time of the incident reads, \u201cI acknowledge this has been an incredibly difficult process for you to go through.\n\nWe are sorry you went through this, and as we discussed on the phone, our focus now is on how we can best support you and your return to campus.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be until weeks into the fall 2022 semester that USC would reach out to the students affected \u2014 including both Manea and Adkins.\n\nThere was, however, an effort from one faculty member \u2014 Assistant Vice Provost of Student Affairs Daren Mooko \u2014 who tried to help Adkins reintegrate into student life and aid in providing mental health resources.\n\nBut according to Adkins, it seems like he may have been the only one.\n\nEven when the university reached out to Adkins and his circle of friends involved in the arrest, for some, it was rather distasteful.\n\n\u201cIt was so, so late. And then on top of that, they were bombarding us. And mind you, this is a very sensitive topic. So for [them] to just willy nilly poke at it, it felt very disrespectful,\u201d Manea said.\n\nHe continued by explaining the exasperation and betrayal he felt from the university at the time, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need your resources because where were your resources when we really needed them?\u201d\n\nAdkins\u2019 father reiterated the lasting effect that the case had on the family, stating, \u201cHe had to come back and it was just a whole convoluted nightmare of just being excommunicated by every vestige that he had previously thought was a solid ground ... And that was his life ... USC got him out of there [with the] snap of a finger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I did talk to him over the summer ... He didn\u2019t want to go into tons of detail about it. It was more like what he would be willing to tell me,\u201d Dace Roberts, Adkins\u2019 close friend and sophomore-year roommate explained.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really bring it up himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that scared me the most about his time incarcerated is that ... it might have broken some of those natural qualities that he had,\u201d said Professor Oliver Mayer, the director of dramatic writing at the School of Cinematic Arts, and Adkins\u2019 playwriting professor during that fateful 2022 spring semester.\n\nAdkins himself explained that he\u2019s never been able to truly recover financially or psychologically from the events that transpired at the end of his freshman year.\n\nIt\u2019s a burden that he\u2019ll likely carry for the rest of his life.\n\nA GoFundMe is currently trying to monetarily compensate Adkins and his family for the months-long financial burden that they encountered a year ago.\n\nWorking over the summer in a fast food restaurant and now working at USC, Adkins is still trying to pay off the debts accumulated throughout the whole ordeal, including travel costs as well as mental health treatment and legal fees.\n\nHis tuition, even with financial aid, is still yet to be paid off.\n\nAs a final takeaway from the incident, Adkins states that his incarceration led him to think a lot about himself and his life.\n\nAlong with his family and friends, he is hopeful that his USC community will provide some much-needed compensation and relief, since his university didn\u2019t.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann)\n\nBy Veronica Towers, Emilia Garza and Nicki Berelson\nOctober 02, 2023 at 4:22 pm PDT\n\nThe pop culture news that has taken over the country in just a span of two weeks has merged two audiences that have never coexisted before: Swifties and NFL fans. Taylor Swift performed for three sold out stadium shows in New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium in May, and on Sunday, she attended the same stadium to cheer on a new flame who some fans know all too well.\n\nSwift was initially spotted at the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium on September 24, where she seemingly confirmed rumors that she and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce are officially dating\u2014 a development that spiked his jersey sales by 400% according to NFLshop.com representatives. To top that, the ticket sales for the Chiefs\u2019 game against the New York Jets on Sunday were boosted by 175% on StubHub, according to CBS.\n\nThis is Kelce\u2019s 11th season in the NFL and he has been regarded by some, like CBS Sports and Fox Sports, to be one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history. The Chiefs\u2019 tight end and Swift were first linked after Kelce shared his attempt to get Swift\u2019s attention during her Eras Tour stop in Kansas City on his podcast, \u201cNew Heights,\u201d that he hosts with his brother, NFL Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce.\n\nAccording to Travis Kelce, he intended to give Swift a friendship bracelet, a popular cultural phenomenon that takes place at Taylor Swift concerts, with his phone number on it. Despite this failed attempt, Kelce was successful in inviting Swift to a Chiefs game. \u201cI threw the ball in her [Swift\u2019s] court. I told her \u2018I\u2019ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead. You might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead,\u201d Kelce said on the Pat McAffee Show.\n\nAnd thus the Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce obsession began. \u201cLooking at it from an outsider\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s kind of one of those things where you feel like he\u2019s trying to date up, you know?\u201d said Baltej Miglni, a junior studying international relations and global economy. He would not describe himself as a Swifie, rather a regular follower of the NFL. He spoke about Kelce\u2019s previous partner, model and influencer Kayla Nicole, saying that he broke up with her after \u201cmaking it big\u201d in the NFL. Kelce dated Nicole on and off from 2017 to 2022, according to Sports News.\n\nNicholas Torre, a freshman and chemistry major, expressed his thoughts on the subject, saying \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious that people are making jokes about it.\u201d While he does not care for Swift\u2019s music and is more of an NFL fan, he said \u201cIt should be highlighted that Taylor Swift put Travis Kelce on the map. Let\u2019s be honest, football is an American sport, Taylor Swift is an internationally recognized celebrity.\u201d\n\nThe @Chiefs are now 2-0 with @TaylorSwift13 in attendance. @NextGenStats pic.twitter.com/5lrvwQjZ1n \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 2, 2023\n\nWhen it came to the NFL\u2019s increase in numbers due to Swifties, Torre said \u201cwhether or not Swifties is the prime demographic that they\u2019re trying to attract, probably not. But more butts in seats is always a good thing as far as the NFL is concerned.\u201d Some of the butts in seats included Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively and Hugh Jackman, just a few celebrities that attended the game with Swift on Sunday.\n\nNot everyone is \u201cenchanted\u201d by the songstress\u2019 presence at the games though. Ashley Wieland, a junior majoring in human biology and a big NFL fan, expressed her concerns over the Swift fascination. \u201cThe fact that the tickets have gone up due to her presence at the games kind of sucks because those fans that have wanted to be there for so long can\u2019t go if they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Wieland said.\n\nStill, some Taylor Swift fans are gushing over the blooming relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s cute how there are couples who can kind of bond over this\u2014if the boyfriend is watching football on Sunday and the girlfriend just didn\u2019t previously care. I\u2019ve seen on TikTok how a lot of people are like, \u2018Oh my gosh, now I want to watch football with my boyfriend,\u2019\u201d said Kayla Minei, a Sophomore who has been a Swift fan since the debut of her second album, \u201cFearless.\u201d Only time will tell if Kelce will be the 1.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/10/02/bleeding-blue-playoff-bound/", "response": "```\n\u201cBleeding Blue\u201d is a column by Diego Ynzunza about the Los Angeles Dodgers. It seems like just yesterday I was watching the Dodgers get bounced by the Padres from the NLDS last season. No matter how many times I\u2019ve endured the pain of a postseason loss, nine times in the past 1o years to be exact, it never gets easier. I feel engulfed by sadness and grief. It\u2019s hard for me to carry on with my everyday life. While the status quo eventually returns with the advent of Spring Training and a new season, the loss lingers heavily. Postseason losses are difficult. They become especially challenging for a team like the Dodgers who, over these past 11 years have had so much regular season success, yet can\u2019t seem to perform when it really matters, excluding the shortened 60-game season. The Dodgers are supposed to be a dynasty. They have rolled out so much star power over the past decade that it\u2019s not even funny. We\u2019re talking future Hall of Famers, MVP candidates and, not to mention, All-Stars. Despite their stacked lineup, so far the narrative has been that their sole World Series win in this window was only won because of the 60-game shortened schedule, and that their exceedingly high payroll just gets them wins in the regular season and not when it really matters most. With the conclusion of the regular season on Sunday, and the Dodgers securing 100 wins in a full season for the fourth consecutive time, you have to wonder whether this narrative is present in the minds of players in the Dodgers clubhouse. It sure is present in the minds of Dodger fans across Los Angeles, as well as MLB fandom at large. It\u2019s an amazing accomplishment to win the division, win 100 games and to get a bye in the first round of the playoffs. But, as Brad Pitt, portraying Billy Beane, famously said in the movie \u201cMoneyball,\u201d \u201cIf you lose the last game of the season, nobody gives a s***.\u201d So, I enter this postseason with the usual optimism, hope and excitement, but also a good amount of caution. I have every faith that, even though the Atlanta Braves are a juggernaut and the overwhelming favorites to win it all, our boys can pull through and bring home another trophy to Los Angeles. I always believe that the Dodgers will win. But, after all the postseason heartbreak this past decade, I have to start preparing myself for the reality that we may not win it all. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love postseason baseball. I kind of wish I didn\u2019t have so much stock placed in one team so I could just be a baseball fan and watch games without having the big blue monster lingering in the back of my mind. But, so goes the life of a sports fan. You ride with your team in the good and bad and never question your allegiance. This weekend, check back in for my preview of the NLDS. We won\u2019t find out who the Dodgers play until the conclusion of the three-game series between the Milwaukee Brewers and Arizona Diamondbacks, so I figured I would wait until then to give a proper preview and prediction. Until then, let\u2019s all get comfortable and turn on some great postseason matchups this week \u2013 while keeping fans of eliminated teams in our thoughts and prayers. Our boys in Dodger blue could meet that same fate very soon. \u201cBleeding Blue\u201d runs every week.\n```"}

This time, USC women\u2019s soccer wasted no time scoring, something they struggled with early against the Washington State Cougars on Thursday, en route to a 3-0 win over the Washington Huskies. A goal in the sixth minute by junior forward Izzy Kimberly got the Trojans on the board early.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s always going to be 100% with Izzy,\u201d head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cFull energy and effort at all times. Getting the goal was extremely special for Izzy. She isn\u2019t always our leading goal scorer but someone who puts in a lot of heart and hustle. To win the ball in the press and put us in good scenarios, it was nice today she kicked us off with the game winner.\u201d\n\nThe first half was dominated by the Trojans with their six shots, many close to the goal, along with their dominant time of possession. Washington\u2019s \u2018bend-don\u2019t-break defense,\u2019 combined with missed opportunities from the Trojans, had USC only leading by one heading into the half.\n\n\u201cMy words at halftime specifically, we need to close the game out,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cGet serious about being really aggressive about finishing shots. It\u2019s never fun to let a team stay in the game. Any team can always sneak back in.\u201d\n\nComing out of the half, USC\u2019s defense was put up to the test as Washington put the pressure on. The Huskies had many opportunities with corners and free kicks, a product of an aggressive halftime adjustment. Washington has had success this season capitalizing on these set play chances, yet the Trojans held them off the board.\n\n\u201cWe knew this weekend that set pieces were going to be extremely important,\u201d Alukonis said.\u201dWe worked a long time on them before we got here. We want to make sure to win the first ball but also the second. Our backline has been very good with that. We have a number of really strong headers.\u201d\n\nUSC broke through late in the game with a goal in the 74th minute by freshman midfielder Florianne Jourde, along with junior midfielder Helena Sampaio joining the scoring frenzy two minutes later. Jourde\u2019s goal marks the second of her Trojan career in just her fourth start. Sampaio dominated the midfield all afternoon along with Jourde and senior defender Zoe Burns, a fact later mentioned by Alukonis. Jourde has started to earn the trust of Alukonis and her teammates. The chemistry she has built with the team has helped expedite her development and lead her being a constant force in the lineup.\n\n\u201cFlo[rianne] is a player that played on Canada\u2019s U20s with Zoe, [junior defender] Brooklyn [Courtnall] and [junior midfielder] Simi [Awujo], and she has fit in right into the group probably because of those prior relationships and also from being a high level player,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWe are really happy with her development and it\u2019s super cool to see her get the goal today. It was a really important goal in getting us closer to securing the win\u201d\n\nUSC started the game with some key stars still working their way back from national play as well as injuries. This is the reason for a lot of the changing lineups as of late for Alukonis\u2019 squad. Junior forward Simone Jackson came off the bench for the second straight game after missing the previous three. Awujo missed one game, and has come off the bench for the prior three. Freshman forward Maribel Flores also missed one game at Utah, and too has been off the bench for the last two matches.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had many bad injuries, just one little snag,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWhether it is illness or soft tissue sprains, we have had a couple ankle rolls. In the case of Simone or like [Flores] and Simi coming back from camp, we have to be really careful about integrating them back within the team and also from a physical standpoint. That is a lot of the reason for so much change. Thursday [to] Sunday is a quick turnaround so also making sure that people don\u2019t put in too many miles so we can keep them from accumulating fatigue.\u201d\n\nThe depth of this team has been tested by the absence of some key players. This has opened opportunities for players like freshman defender Alyssa Gonzalez who played all 90 minutes today, and was part of the suffocating defense that shut out Washington. Jourde, Kimberly and spark plug graduate midfielder Keely Roy have also been performing admirably in spite of the recent absences.\n\nThe perfect 2-0 road trip to Washington comes to an end with USC holding a 7-2 record overall. The team now gets ready for a quick turnaround to play Oregon at McAlister Field on Thursday at 3:00 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Jeremiah Estrada)\n\nBy Jeremiah Estrada October 02, 2023 at 11:29 am PDT\n\nAs much as writing for hit TV shows can seem like the dream, Patty Lin shared why she decided to leave the industry in her book \u201cEnd Credits: How I Broke Up with Hollywood.\u201d Zibby Books held its bimonthly virtual book club on Wednesday, September 27, where they hosted Lin as part of the author\u2019s nationwide book tour.\n\nFollowing a group discussion on Lin\u2019s memoir, attendees had the chance to ask questions about the book. The book club\u2019s mediator started the conversation by asking Lin for the latest on the writers\u2019 strike. She mentioned how the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers came to a tentative agreement fulfilling the requests of the writers and that she was happy to hear about the recent victory after the studios held out for so long.\n\n\u201cThe studios were trying to starve the writers, but the writers were like, \u2018we\u2019re used to starving, so we can wait this out,\u2019\u201d Lin said.\n\nTo Lin, the television industry proves to have lots of inconsistency and uncertainty, but she said that she wasn\u2019t really planning for the long-term future in regard to her career. It became clear to her that screenwriting was not a stable job. There was always the chance for a show to get canceled or not picked up. Even Lin herself could be fired on a whim.\n\n\u201cI just was so determined to doing a creative job,\u201d Lin said. \u201cI just wanted to so badly use my creative talents in my job because having had a non-creative job where I was essentially doing accounting work at the Letterman Show, I just felt like I was dying a slow death in that job.\u201d\n\nLin said she is often asked what it was like being the only Asian woman, and sometimes the only Asian person in a writers\u2019 room. She didn\u2019t think about it all the time during her career because growing up around a lot of white people she was used to being an outlier. While trying to survive and make it in the business, she was also busy and didn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to think about her racial identity.\n\nWhen writing her book, she began to think about her identity more and started to read books written by Asian American authors and heard about their other experiences.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I kind of had this lightbulb moment because I would hear that it\u2019s actually very common for people of color who are in fields where they are not well represented to feel a sense of imposter syndrome,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really common experience and that\u2019s something I felt all throughout my career and I sort of chalked it up to \u2018oh, well, I\u2019m a drama writer working in comedy.\u2019 I realized how much being the only Asian person in the room probably contributed to that feeling of \u2018I have to work extra hard to prove that I deserve to be there.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince February, Lin has primarily been working on her book and promoting it. She explained that it\u2019s a lot more work than people can imagine. She appreciates getting to be very involved in the publishing process with Zibby Books.\n\nWriting this was a fun and transformative experience for her, so she would love to write more books in the future. She said that her experience as an author was vastly different from what she went through in TV in all the best ways.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote for TV, I had to write scripts really really fast,\u201d Lin said. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019d write a whole script in three or four days. I never liked that. I always found it incredibly uncomfortable to write that fast. I tried my best to, you know, make it good, but it always would have benefitted from more time.\u201d\n\nWhen writing her book, she was able to make up her own schedule. She did not like feeling pressured to finish her work by a deadline. Creativity is very hard to do on a schedule which was one of the big reasons why she left TV.\n\nThe final question for Lin before the book club concluded was what her current favorite TV show is. She said that from the last few months, her favorite right now is Netflix\u2019s \u201cBeef.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a show that has everything\u2014comedy, romance, drama,\u201d Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. It\u2019s funny. It\u2019s got plot twists and reversals. It\u2019s got action. It\u2019s so entertaining but also really really deep, like psychologically deep. I love that it tells a story that is both universal but also really specifically Asian.\u201d\n\nLin said she can\u2019t say enough good things about \u201cBeef\u201d with how it has so much packed into it. She has watched the miniseries twice and said she had been waiting for a show like that her whole life.\n\nAfter years of writing for TV, Lin now is the viewer. Following her \u201cbreak-up\u201d with Hollywood, she now takes the opportunity to pursue other interests with the luxury of time and creative freedom.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nExclusivity is a word familiar to former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the handling of presidential election events this election cycle. He decided to miss the first two republican debates. Instead, he chose to air a pre-recorded interview with Tucker Carlson during the first, and he held a rally in Michigan with auto workers during the second. Next, it seems he will miss the third debate in Miami, according to his campaign Senior Advisor Chris La Civita in an interview with NBC News.\n\nBeing a previous president with a strong fan-base gives Trump some latitude to miss these debates. If he hadn\u2019t been elected before, getting behind in debates this early might\u2019ve made his push for political office an uphill battle. Despite his absences, his polling numbers still give him a substantial lead over all the other Republican candidates, a fact highlighted in his keynote speech at the California GOP Fall Convention on Friday, as he questioned the integrity of mail-in ballots in California.\n\n\u201cWe are leading by a lot... Don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re going over polls, I only talk about polls when I am doing well, remember that please,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut when we win, we are going to come in here and you\u2019re going to straighten out your election because we need fair and free elections in this country and California doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\nAccording to a fact check by Reuters, based on information from experts, governors and state officials, elections have been reviewed to be both free and fair with no instances of widespread voter fraud. According to the California Elections Rumor Control information on cybersecurity and election reliability misconceptions, mail-in ballots give more security with voter verification happening at multiple steps in the process, both before the ballots are sent out and once ballots are received. Also, the California voting systems are secure, \u201cVendors and county officials follow strict physical security and chain of custody requirements for all voting technology software, firmware and hardware which meet or exceed federal guidance including that of the Justice Department, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Election Assistance Commission,\u201d the California Elections Rumor Control said.\n\nDuring the Republican primary debate in Simi Valley on Wednesday, Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called out Trump in a section of the debate loosely modeled after the popular CBS TV show Survivor, which had its new season premiering that night. He told the moderators and audience he would vote Trump off the island. \u201cEvery person on this stage has shown the respect for Republican voters to come here, to express their views honestly, candidly and directly,\u201d Christie said.\n\nLeading up to the convention, the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Library gave Christie an opportunity to call out the former president, referring to Trump\u2019s lack of attendance and inability to answer for law and order in Washington, D.C. \u201cYou are not here tonight because you are afraid of being on this stage and defending your record,\u201d Christie said. \u201cYou are ducking these things, and let me tell you what\u2019s going to happen. You keep doing that, no one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore, we are going to call you \u2018Donald Duck!\u2019\u201d\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis of Florida giving his speech to attendees of the dinner banquet. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nApparently on Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019 mind at the CAGOP convention was Disney \u2014 being in Anaheim so close to Disneyland. He started off his speech by making a joke in reference to his lawsuit with Walt Disney World. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all, great to be in Southern California, thanks so much... It\u2019s great to be here,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was even allowed, I\u2019m a little close to Disneyland.

Scott brought his own faith into the room, physically hopping into the crowd as a preacher would mill about their congregation. \u201cI\u2019m about to get off this stage, I\u2019m going to preach to y\u2019all, right here in the middle of the audience, let\u2019s have the conversation about the goodness of America!\u201d\n\nSenator Tim Scott in the middle of attendees after hopping off the stage to speak with them in a more informal way. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nScott wants Californians to know that \u201cthe truths of [his] life destroys the lies of the radical left,\u201d raising ideas that obstacles in upbringing are a force to overcome, rather than seeing things as unattainable in an opportunity-rich America, he said. This is a message he was told he wouldn\u2019t have access to coming from a single-parent, poverty-stricken household in the Deep South. \u201cMy mother believed that prayer was the key and faith unlocks the door, can I get an Amen!\u201d Scott said. \u201cMy mentor taught me that personal responsibility was necessary. You can\u2019t blame your dad because he\u2019s not around, don\u2019t blame your mom because she\u2019s working 16 hour days, look in the mirror and blame yourself!

Quarterback Justin Herbert completed 40 of 47 passes for 405 yards and three touchdowns, leading the Chargers to their first win of the season on Sunday. Keenan Allen tallied a franchise-record 18 receptions for 215 yards, while also throwing a 49-yard touchdown to Mike Williams on a double-pass play, the first completion of his career.\n\n\u201cYour best players play like that in a big game it gives you a chance and Keenan and Justin were fantastic,\u201d said head coach Brandon Staley after the 28-24 win. Herbert broke the NFL record for most completions by a quarterback in his first four seasons on Sunday, also breaking the Chargers record for consecutive completions without an interception with 195.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t rattled at all,\u201d Allen said of his quarterback. \u201cEvery time we came to the sideline we just had answers and more answers.\u201d L.A.\u2019s star wideout broke an NFL record of his own with the most 15+ catch games of any receiver in the league\u2019s history.\n\n\u201c[Allen is] as consistent as they come,\u201d said Herbert. \u201cSo talented, so smart, knows exactly how people are playing him, understands leverage so well, he\u2019s a quarterback\u2019s best friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for Keenan because it really capped off one of those maestro performances for him. A career game, a record-setting game,\u201d Staley said.\n\nDespite the historic performances on offense, it was the defense that sealed the win for L.A., finally answering the call in the clutch. After the Chargers failed to convert on a 4th and 1 from their own 24-yard line, history seemed to be repeating itself for L.A. But the Bolts defense stood tall.\n\nWith twelve seconds left in the game, linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr. intercepted Kirk Cousins in the end zone, sealing the Chargers\u2019 first win of the season.\n\n\u201cOur red zone defense was outstanding,\u201d Staley said. \u201cIt won us the game.\u201d The Vikings offense was held to just ten points on four red zone trips, and the L.A. defense made moving the ball difficult throughout.\n\n\u201cIt was a nailbiter and we\u2019ve played in three of them,\u201d said Staley. \u201cFor our guys to come alive in all three phases in the fourth quarter and finish the game was really important. It was a team win and I thought our guys really came through in the clutch.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s own Second-round draft pick, defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu, continued his strong start to the season. He registered his second sack against the Vikings, leaving him tied for the highest total among rookies this season.\n\nMany issues were solved from last week on offense. After only converting 2/14 third-down attempts last week, the L.A. offense moved the chains on 5/11 third downs against Minnesota. And after posting just a 40 percent red zone efficiency last week, the Chargers scored touchdowns on both of their trips to the red zone on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI think we had their number on every play,\u201d Allen said after the win.\n\nUnfortunately, wide receiver Mike Williams, who caught Allen\u2019s 49-yard pass for a touchdown, injured his knee on the following drive. Ian Rapoport confirmed on Monday that Williams tore his ACL and will miss the remainder of the season.\n\nThe Chargers now look ahead to their last game before the bye week, this Sunday in Las Vegas against the Raiders. They will likely still be without Austin Ekeler, who indicated on his podcast, \u201cEkeler\u2019s Edge\u201d that he should be healthy after the bye. Still, L.A. should have more than enough firepower to take care of business against a division rival.\n\nLas Vegas started the season with a win in Denver against the Broncos but has lost its last two, getting blown out by the Bills and then losing at home to the Steelers. Vegas has yet to break the 20-point mark on offense this season with quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo struggling to adapt to life in silver and black. Garoppolo has developed an early relationship with three-time All-Pro Davante Adams, who has had a stellar start to the season.\n\nStopping Adams will be virtually impossible, but slowing him will be key to a Chargers victory. Staley\u2019s defense was able to limit Justin Jefferson\u2019s production in Minnesota, with the star wideout\u2019s first reception not coming until the 2nd quarter. A similar approach with Adams could help L.A. keep L.V. under 20 points and help the Chargers get an unfamiliar comfortable win.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nBy Felipe Londo\u00f1o\nSeptember 30, 2023 at 10:09 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s only Week 3, yet after a 41-10 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs last weekend that saw the team fall to an 0-3 start, the Chicago Bears have hit rock bottom. In a year that was supposed to be the team\u2019s first competitive season in recent memory, the defense has failed to evolve into the dominant unit head coach Matt Eberflus was hired for, and the offense has regressed to below-NFL-level play. So, who is to blame? Quarterback Justin Fields? Matt Eberflus? The general manager? When examining the whole Bears process over the last two years, it becomes clear that there is blame to go around at every level of the organization. Let\u2019s take a deep look at the Bears\u2019 entire operation and examine why the team is where it is.\n\nRoster management\nAfter a largely unsuccessful era under former leadership, the Bears hired former Kansas City Chiefs director of player personnel Ryan Poles to be their new general manager in February 2022. Poles came with pedigree, having served in a variety of scouting and executive roles for a Chiefs team that cemented itself as the model NFL franchise in the late 2010s. Yet, his resum\u00e9 thus far in Chicago leaves more questions than reasons for excitement.\n\nPoles has spent a significant amount of resources to reshape the defense in head coach Matt Eberflus\u2019 image. During his first six months on the job, he let go of All-Pro defensive end Khalil Mack, All-Pro linebacker Roquan Smith and the team\u2019s previous sack leader in Robert Quinn, all believed to not fit the team\u2019s new zone-heavy, 4-3 scheme as the franchise entered a rebuild. He followed that by drafting two raw but dynamic defensive back prospects in Kyler Gordon and Jaquan Brisker with second-round picks in 2022 and breaking the bank to acquire middle linebacker Tremaine Edmunds in free agency this past offseason, a rangy weapon who the team believed could unlock Eberflus\u2019 system with his pterodactyl-like coverage skills.\n\nPoles reshaped the defense alright, but has it been for the better? Gordon and Brisker have shown promise, but are nowhere close to stars, and Edmunds has not played up to par, leading the unit to rank bottom ten in a plethora of defensive metrics. For the second year in a row, the Bears look to be fielding the worst defense in the league.\n\nOn the offensive side of the ball, Poles has worked to build around Justin Fields, refusing to take a quarterback this past draft with the number one overall pick, instead packaging it for future picks and Pro Bowl wide receiver D.J Moore to finally give Fields a true No. 1 option. The team also traded the 32nd overall pick for former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Chase Claypool, a vertical field stretcher who complements the aggressive downhill style Fields flashed at Ohio State.\n\nThrough three weeks so far, however, the offense has failed to take a leap, with Moore not playing like the difference maker the team thought they traded for and Claypool not looking like a player worth a first-round pick. Moreover, even with the addition of a first-round tackle in Tennessee product Darnell Wright, the offensive line looks discombobulated and heavily outmatched, leaving Fields very little time to operate.\n\nFields has not developed as a passer, with the tape showing amplification of all his issues from last year, occasionally interrupted by a few of the flashes that made every Bears fan get up from their seats. Even with the influx of new talent, Poles\u2019 gambles have not cashed out, and the Bears offense has regressed.\n\nPoles\u2019 process has been understandable. It\u2019s a fact that most (if not all) of his big moves have fallen short. He inherited a roster close to being the worst in the league, and while it\u2019s only been two and a half seasons since his hiring, too little has changed to consider his tenure a success to this point.\n\nCoaching\nMishap roster decisions may be a reason the Bears are fielding such a poor team. But that roster is receiving little help from a coaching staff that has done little to elevate its talent. Previously the defensive coordinator for a sound Indianapolis Colts defense, Matt Eberflus was hired as the Bears\u2019 head coach to reestablish the dominant defensive identity of previous Bears teams. To this point, he has not even come close, with the team ranking bottom three in total yards and points allowed through three weeks.\n\nFundamentally, this can be explained by Eberflus\u2019 unwavering commitment to the passive style of defense that brought him success in Indianapolis despite it not fitting his current personnel. Eberflus clearly wants to be conservative, play soft coverage, and allow the offense to make the first mistake \u2014 this season the Bears rank first in zone coverage rate and second to last in blitz percentage \u2014 yet he simply does not have the personnel to do it.\n\nFor a defense to be passive it needs stars up front who can stuff the run and pressure the passer with athletes on the back end who can hold up in coverage. The Bears just don\u2019t fit the mold. This year their front ranks bottom ten in rushing yards allowed per attempt and dead last in quarerback hits, and the secondary has allowed 857 yards through the air, third-highest in the league.\n\nPart of the disconnect between personnel and scheme falls on Ryan Poles for not allocating significant resources to the defensive front and missing on the additions to the secondary, yet Eberflus is also to blame for not adjusting to the personnel he currently has. He should be blitzing and relying on simulated pressures more to create chaos \u2014 think Brian Flores with the Miami Dolphins circa 2020 \u2014 yet his stubbornness to stick with a conservative style is what\u2019s allowed the Bears to concede over 100 points during their first three weeks.\n\nThe offensive unit, led by former Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, has not shown much growth either. The Bears rank bottom five in yards per game, second-to-last in passing yards per game and 17th in rushing yards per game, primarily due to offensive architecture and a misunderstanding of the team\u2019s personnel. The Bears are running a myriad of half-field passing concepts with poor route combinations that don\u2019t give Justin Fields many options to succeed.\n\nFurthermore, a lack of frequent play-action play calls and the elimination of the designed QB run game \u2014 Fields\u2019 greatest strength as a pro thus far \u2014 is forcing the quarterback to play the position on hard mode. Add to this frequent miscommunication along the offensive line and the current offensive environment is simply not up to NFL standards.\n\nJustin Fields\nThe offensive staff is clearly not fitting the offense to Justin Fields\u2019 strengths, yet the tape also shows he may just not have the ability to lead a team as its franchise quarterback. For all the problems placed on the coaching staff, Fields is showing deficiencies as a passer that do not correlate with starter-level play in the league, particularly in his mechanics, pocket presence and decision-making.\n\nStarting from the ground up, Fields\u2019 mechanics are currently all over the place. The tape shows sloppy footwork and an awkward throwing motion that yields wobbly spirals and creates major accuracy issues, especially in the intermediate level. His pocket presence is also shaky, with his feel for pressure seemingly deteriorating from last year, leading to more sacks and avoidable hits.\n\nThese two things could also be attributed to coaching and the offensive system. Fields showcased strong mechanics, was a tremendously accurate passer and displayed a better feel for pressure at Ohio State. Yet the most concerning deficiency he keeps showing is his processing and inability to read defenses. Even with the poor pass protection, shallow offensive design, and below-average weapons, Fields is seeing the game too slow. His internal clock is delayed to the point where he isn\u2019t showing the ability to get off his first read and execute a multi-progression play call, amplifying his pocket presence and mechanics issues.\n\nWith as much blame as we\u2019ve ascribed to the coaching staff for its simplistic offensive design, it could also be that Fields\u2019 inability to read defenses requires such a simple approach. Altogether, Fields\u2019 struggles could be justified by the terrible environment around him, though through three weeks he is showing red flags that do not bode well for his future as a starter.\n\nAs dynamic as he is as a runner, an NFL quarterback needs to be able to stand calm in the pocket, go through progressions, and deliver the ball with accuracy. Fields simply is not showing the ability to do that. Be it with a new coaching staff in the Windy City or on another team, Fields needs a fresh start where he can rediscover the confidence and ability he displayed at Ohio State.\n```"}

The win kept USC (5-0, 3-0 Pac-12) unbeaten against Colorado (3-2, 0-2 Pac-12) since the Buffaloes joined the Pac-12, extending the Trojans\u2019 overall record against them to 17-0.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d obviously love to finish it and separate it more, but you put yourself in those moments and you get used to the adversity a little bit because it\u2019s coming,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said, referencing USC\u2019s upcoming schedule against highly ranked opponents. \u201cThis is road football. ... We\u2019re a team that gets circled every single week.\u201d\n\nUSC may have entered the game favored by 22 points, but Colorado junior quarterback Shedeur Sanders bet otherwise, throwing for four touchdowns and 371 yards. He also ran for a team second-best 50 yards. Coming off of a 42-6 loss at Oregon, the Buffaloes needed to \u201clock in\u201d to not let last week\u2019s crushing defeat against a ranked opponent repeat itself, according to Sanders.\n\nDespite the loss, Colorado first-year head coach Deion Sanders praised his team for battling back in the second half. \u201cThey were resilient,\u201d Deion Sanders said. \u201cThey did not give up when they had multiple, multiple opportunities to give up.\u201d\n\nWith less than three minutes left in the first half, USC led 34-7, dominating on all sides of the ball while holding Colorado to 163 total yards before the Buffaloes\u2019 final drive of the half. In its final possession, Colorado quickly drove the ball 83 yards down the field, culminating in a 25-yard wide-open rush down the middle for Shedeur Sanders with 21 seconds left before halftime. Riley said that touchdown gave Colorado momentum leading into halftime, contributing to the games\u2019 final score being so close.\n\n\u201cWe were suffocating them,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThat gave them life.\u201d\n\nBefore then, the game was all USC, with Williams\u2019 finding different receivers for each of his four touchdown passes in the half. For USC\u2019s first passing touchdown, Williams connected with a wide-open Tahj Washington for a 71-yard score, the redshirt senior receiver\u2019s fifth of the season. The Trojans led 21-0 as Williams hit junior receiver Dorian Singer for an 8-yard touchdown following a blocked punt by USC junior linebacker Eric Gentry. Williams later connected with one of his favorite targets, senior receiver Brenden Rice, for a 26-yard score. Rice, who is in his second year at USC after transferring from Colorado, leads the Trojans with seven touchdowns. Rice admitted he \u201ckind of had butterflies\u201d prior to his homecoming, but he seemed to settle in just fine. He finished the game with 81 yards and two touchdowns, his second coming on a short pass from Williams in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cCaleb\u2019s gonna go ahead and spread the ball out to each and everybody, so you have to go ahead and make the most of those moments,\u201d Rice said.\n\nIn the second half, Colorado outscored USC 27-14, pulling the game within seven late following a touchdown pass by Sanders with 1:43 left to play. Colorado, however, was criticized in its final drive for taking extra time to switch plays prior to snapping the ball, allowing valuable seconds to tick away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather take our time rather than have a negative play,\u201d Shedeur Sanders said. \u201cThat goes on me for not controlling the offense and not controlling everybody knowing what to do in that specific play.\u201d\n\nRiley blamed USC\u2019s second-half lapse on his team\u2019s inability to keep up its first-half momentum. \u201cThey made plays, and we kind of didn\u2019t,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWhen you stop doing that, especially on the road against a good team that has some talent like they do, they\u2019re gonna make a run. And they did.\u201d\n\nRedshirt senior safety Bryson Shaw called the defense\u2019s second-half performance \u201cembarrassing,\u201d allowing plays that should have been short gains to go for 20 yards or more. \u201cCoach Grinch put us in the right spots,\u201d Shaw said of USC defensive coordinator Alex Grinch. \u201cI think we let him down at this point, but I have full faith in our defense.\u201d\n\nRiley agreed that he still has faith in Grinch, but the team still has much to work on and learn from. \u201cWe\u2019re going to own the mistakes; we\u2019re going to own the good,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to work and get ready to get back home to the Coli.\u201d\n```"}

Senior outside hitter Skylar Fields was effective throughout, but it was the rest of the Trojan attack that stepped up in the final two sets to propel the Trojans to victory.\n\nFields ended the game with 19 kills \u2014 Tyrah Ariail was second with nine \u2014 but the rest of the team only collected four and six kills in the two sets it lost compared to eight, nine and ten in the three it won.\n\n\u201cI feel like everything went wrong in the beginning,\u201d USC head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cBut I also thought Utah played really well.\u201d\n\nThe Utes put the Trojans on their heels early, getting multiple blockers up for almost every kill attempt, while USC struggled to challenge Utah\u2019s offense.\n\n\u201cI thought they were like three steps ahead of us for the first set. I thought we were able to get back and then they jumped on us again in the third set,\u201d Keller said.\n\nThe Trojans hit just .026 and .032 in the first and third sets. Fields was the only real source of offense early on, accounting for more than 40% of USC\u2019s kills through three sets.\n\nBut, with USC staring down a first home defeat of the season, a switch flipped for the Trojans. USC upped both its intensity and focus, according to Keller, getting more blockers up defensively and finding more space for its many outside hitters, not just Fields.\n\nJunior outside hitter Katelyn Smith came alive, notching all six of her kills in the final two sets, while Ariail earned four of her nine kills in the deciding set. Overall, the Trojans hit .344 in the fourth set and a whopping .750 in the fifth.\n\n\u201cWe trust everybody,\u201d Fields said of her teammates. \u201cWhen they [make big plays], we\u2019re expecting it, so it\u2019s super fun to have everybody step up and rise to the occasion.\u201d\n\nBack-to-back Pac-12 Freshman of the Week London Wijay was unavailable against Utah due to injury, leading to the first start of the season for sophomore outside hitter Dani Thomas-Nathan. The Burbank native had five kills but led the team with eight errors on the night. Her nine digs and two aces were indicative of the all-around type of player she is, according to Keller.\n\n\u201cI started her because of her ball control. I thought we needed the ball control to loosen up our other attackers. And I thought she did that,\u201d Keller said.\n\nThe Trojans will bring their eight-game winning streak and perfect home record into a matchup with Colorado on Sunday, Oct. 1 at 1 p.m. at Galen Center before embarking on a four-game road trip.\n\nKeller and Fields each mentioned the support from the Galen crowd being key to the Trojans\u2019 success.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got a lot of fans that really care about this team and these kids, and I think that\u2019s fantastic.

(Photo by Carly Rieger).\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nSeptember 30, 2023 at 11:03 am PDT\n\nIn a matchup between Hollywood and Prime Time, it is the No. 8 USC Trojans ahead at halftime over the Colorado Buffaloes 34-14. The Trojans got off to their usual hot start, scoring a touchdown on the first drive on a 27-yard rush from redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd. USC has scored on its opening offensive drive in all five games this season.\n\nAfter forcing a three-and-out on defense, the Trojans\u2019 second drive was not as pretty as the first. Junior quarterback Caleb Williams overthrew two receivers and a botched snap on third down forced USC to punt. But, again, the USC defense stepped up and forced a long field attempt by Colorado sophomore kicker Jace Feely, who knocked the 41-yarder wide left to keep the Trojans\u2019 lead stable at 7-0.\n\nThe USC offense then got into a rhythm as Williams found redshirt senior wide receiver Tahj Washington for a 71-yard touchdown. Washington temporarily tied senior wide receiver Brenden Rice for the team lead in touchdowns with five, and leads USC in receiving yards with 380.\n\nJust two plays into the next Colorado drive, USC pressured junior quarterback Shedeur Sanders, forcing an errant throw which redshirt senior cornerback Christian Roland-Wallace easily intercepted. Shortly into the second quarter, Williams hit junior wide receiver Dorian Singer in the end zone to put the Trojans up 21-0 before Colorado scored for the first time.\n\nSinger and Roland-Wallace were teammates at Arizona, but both of them transferred to USC this past offseason. Sanders, the son of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders, threw his only touchdown pass of the half to junior wide receiver Jimmy Horn Jr., the only Colorado receiver with more than 20 receiving yards in the first half.\n\nWilliams then threw his third and fourth touchdowns of the half, all to different receivers, as he connected with junior wide receiver Mario Williams and Rice to put the Trojans up 34-7. Rice regained the team lead for touchdown receptions with his sixth on the season.\n\nShedeur Sanders led the Buffaloes in the 2-minute drill toward the end of the first half and tightened up the score with a 25-yard quarterback keeper for a touchdown, to reduce the USC lead to 20 points. The Buffaloes are set to receive the second half kickoff.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/09/29/saturday-eve-week-5/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy Saturday eve, Week 5\n\nTOT editor Sullivan Maley previews the biggest games of this weekend\u2019s college football schedule.\n\nIt\u2019s finally that time again, folks. After a long week of school, work, or wherever it is you spend your days, rejoice in the fact that college football is back tomorrow. Welcome to another Saturday eve. With a somewhat quiet slate, this Saturday certainly won\u2019t live up to the hype of last week\u2019s electric series of games, but there\u2019s certainly good football to be enjoyed.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s recap the games selected for last week\u2019s column. First off, I want to thank the football gods that my upset prediction didn\u2019t come true...and for an absolutely riveting game from Death Valley. No. 5 FSU *squeaked* by Clemson in an overtime game that felt up in the air for all 60+ minutes. Quarterback Jordan Travis\u2019 289 yards and two touchdowns propelled the Noles to their first victory over Clemson in their last eight matchups. But more importantly...Keon Coleman is him. If you didn\u2019t see his game-winning, double-covered catch in the corner of the end zone to score in overtime,  you\u2019re missing out.\n\nWhile I may not have called an upset last week, my pick for most playoff-relevant contest pulled through with a tight but entertaining game in South Bend. Ohio State was rewarded for their 17-14 victory over Notre Dame with a two-rung climb to No. 4 in the AP Poll, unofficially slotting them as a playoff squad for the first time since the preseason. Meanwhile, Notre Dame falls from No. 9 to No. 11, likely scratching one more team off the still-crowded list of CFP contenders. But don\u2019t write off the Irish\u2019s entire season \u2014 even if they don\u2019t make the playoffs, they still hung with one of the best teams in the country for all four quarters, eventually giving up the game-winning score with 10 men on the field, a blunder which head coach Marcus Freeman made sure to place entirely on himself in post-game pressers. If Notre Dame can rally following their first loss, they\u2019ll be a threat to any teams remaining on their schedule, including when the Trojans travel to South Bend in just a few weeks.\n\nAdditionally, No. 23 Missouri proved my confidence warranted with a 34-27 victory over Memphis that left them ranked in the AP Poll for the first time this season. Junior quarterback Brady Cook continued to play efficiently and effectively, completing 18 of 25 for 341 yards and two touchdowns. Cook is averaging 72 percent completion on the year and currently boasts a clean TD:INT with seven touchdowns and no interceptions. The Tigers should continue to climb the ranks on the road this week against Vandy, but with four tough SEC matchups (No. 13 LSU, Kentucky, South Carolina and No. 1 Georgia) across the five weeks that follow, Mizzou may find the end of the road.\n\nEnough about last week, let\u2019s get to this week\u2019s slate. Happy Saturday eve.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK \u2014 No. 13 LSU (3-1) vs. No. 20 Ole Miss (3-1)\nOxford, Miss. 3:00 p.m. PDT on ESPN\n\nBoth teams come into this game with the same record \u2014 but the stories behind those records could not be more different. Let\u2019s look at how the Tigers and the Rebels got to 3-1. LSU started the season with a 45-24 home opener loss to No. 5 Florida State but hasn\u2019t looked back since, winning three straight including two SEC West contests with Mississippi State and Arkansas. They looked very strong in the former, a 41-14 road win which the Tigers led from the jump. But last week\u2019s win over Arkansas was a bit more shaky \u2014 LSU secured a 34-31 victory on the leg of sophomore kicker Damian Ramos in a game they trailed for nearly 22 minutes.\n\nOle Miss took a different path, starting the season 3-0 before a 24-10 road loss to No. 12 Alabama last weekend. The Rebels just didn\u2019t look like themselves in their first conference matchup of the season, with former Trojan quarterback Jaxson Dart failing to throw a single touchdown pass and standout sophomore running back Quinshon Judkins failing to find the end zone for the first time this season. Now, despite the Crimson Tide\u2019s rough start this season, it\u2019s important to remember that facing Alabama to open conference play is never easy. That being said, I\u2019ve seen more confident play against good programs from LSU so far this year, so my confidence lies with the Tigers in this one. Nevertheless, I expect a back-and-forth game with Ole Miss finding their offensive footing once more against an LSU squad that ranks 66th in team defense with 360 yards per game allowed this season.\n\nUPSET ALERT \u2014 No. 21 Tennessee (3-1) vs. South Carolina (2-2)\nKnoxville, Tenn. 4:30 p.m. PDT on SEC Network\n\nCall this one a stab at thin air, but something just doesn\u2019t sit right with me about ESPN giving the Vols a 70 percent favor in this contest. After plenty of offseason hype, senior quarterback Joe Milton III ranks 58th in Division 1 in efficiency and 76th in yards per completion with 11.56. The team\u2019s only convincing wins are over...Virginia and UTSA? I\u2019m not saying the Vols don\u2019t have it, but they haven\u2019t really shown it yet, and they\u2019re already 0-1 in conference play after losing to then-unranked No. 22 Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, South Carolina is hurting for a ranked SEC win after losing their first conference contest to defending national champs No. 1 Georgia and squeezing by unranked Mississippi State last week 37-30. The defense is just not there so far for the Gamecocks \u2014 the unit is currently ranked 121st out of 130 FBS teams in total defense and has allowed a whopping 434.5 yards per game, 317 of those coming through the air. But if they can pick things up against Tennessee and keep Milton on the level of play he\u2019s shown so far, quarterback Spencer Rattler and the Gamecocks\u2019 eighth-ranked passing offense could pull out some heroics in Knoxville.\n\nIt all comes down to defense in this one \u2014 Tennessee\u2019s has played very well against bad teams, and South Carolina\u2019s has played very badly against good teams. We\u2019ll find out Saturday if South Carolina\u2019s unit is actually that bad, and if they are, then the Vols will prove ESPN and the AP Poll right by steamrolling the Gamecocks. But if Tennessee plays like they did the last time they faced another SEC team, they could be waving goodbye to their spot in the rankings.\n\nON THE RISE\nNo. 25 Fresno State, 4-0 \u2014 vs. Nevada, 7:30 p.m. PDT on FS1\n\nFresno State has quietly put together a 13-game win streak that dates back to last season, and climbed into the AP Poll ranks this week for the first time after a 53-10 romp of Kent State. Sophomore quarterback Mikey Keene currently sits at 15th across FBS in passing yards with 1,205 and is tied for 5th in passing touchdowns with 12, on 67.5 percent completion and only two picks. He\u2019s surrounded by a diverse receiving core (three different receivers have 20+ catches and three or more touchdowns), and the defense is ranked 22nd in FBS. They face a Nevada team at home that hasn\u2019t won a game yet this year and have a remaining schedule that they could realistically win out. Look for the Bulldogs to keep climbing the poll ranks for the possibility of an eventual slot in a major bowl game.\n\nSOMETHING TO PROVE\nNo. 11 Notre Dame, 4-1 \u2014 @ No. 17 Duke, 4:30 p.m. PDT on ABC\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Notre Dame is coming off a close home loss to No. 4 Ohio State, making a win this week crucial for both rankings and team morale. Problem is, instead of a tune-up home game against a sub-.500 squad, the Irish are hitting the road to play undefeated No. 17 Duke. The Blue Devils will be hot for an upset in front of their home crowd after watching Notre Dame notch a loss last week and while I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to predict such an outcome, I also wouldn\u2019t call victory a sure thing for the Irish against a Duke defense that ranks fourth across FBS in pass defense \u2014 higher than even Ohio State. They\u2019ve held all but one of their opponents to just seven points, and are sure to give Notre Dame a challenge in a crucial bounce-back game.\n```"}

Photo courtesy of Box Azteca, Wikimedia Commons.\n\nBy Charles Hastings September 29, 2023 at 10:09 pm PDT\n\nSaul \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez will fight his 64th bout this Saturday in Las Vegas against fellow undisputed champion Jermell Charlo for the super middleweight crown. Charlo has moved up from his usual fighting weight of 154 pounds to Canelo\u2019s 168 to finally face the Mexican superstar. \u00c1lvarez is coming off of a win against John Ryder in September 2022. Yet, some analysts are still not satisfied with his performance, citing Canelo\u2019s May 2022 loss to Dmitry Bivol as the beginning of Canelo\u2019s slippage into what will eventually become mediocrity.\n\nIn an analysis of Canelo\u2019s last five fights by CBS Sports, \u00c1lvarez is reported to have fallen behind with his defense, getting hit with more clean shots by opponents who would not have been able to compete with the fighter in the same way just a few years ago. Furthermore, \u00c1lvarez has shown previously unseen signs of fatigue in later rounds and has displayed consistent failure to knock down opponents, even if he still manages to outbox them.\n\nThe analysis cited the Bivol loss as a prime example, with Canelo relying heavily on power punches to knock opponents down to save himself the fatigue of fighting through the later rounds. Bivol countered this by keeping the Mexican champ on the outside with his jab, eventually breaking his endurance and winning by unanimous decision.\n\nHowever, in 33-year-old Canelo\u2019s fight against Jermell Charlo (who is the same age), the bulk of both fighters\u2019 careers are behind them, yet there is an undeniably proven ability in both men to fight at the championship level. Canelo has beaten 18 world champions on two losses, while Charlo has swept the light middleweight division and is now moving up weight to \u201cmaximize his potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cI defy the science of boxing,\u201d Charlo said at the final pre-fight press conference. \u201cI\u2019m one of the guys from the younger era and I\u2019ve been fighting my whole life. What I\u2019ve been through in life, a lot of people can\u2019t compare to that. I deserve to be in my position and now I get to prove my worthiness.\u201d\n\nCharlo, despite his undeniable reputation, has the odds pitted against him in what will no doubt be the toughest fight of his career. Canelo holds -400 odds on the betting cards while the underdog Charlo is situated at +310. Charlo does, however, have an arsenal of boxing power at the ready to match Canelo\u2019s recent affinity for power punches.\n\n\u201cThat left hand is the moneymaker\u201d said Luke Thomas, a host of the Morning Kombat podcast. \u201c[Charlo] doesn\u2019t land the most punches, but he lands super effective punches.\u201d\n\nCharlo\u2019s left hook dropped American fighter Tony Harrison in 2019, allowing Charlo to win back his WBC super welterweight title to once again become undisputed champion. He also used it to drop the previously undefeated Brian Carlos Castano in a title fight. Charlo also has an affinity for heavy boxing early in the fight, a strategy that has proven itself in the past against the likes of Jeison Rosario in 2022.\n\nYet Canelo has proven time and time again that he still keeps the fundamentals close at hand and has managed to outbox and finish the likes of Caleb Plant, Billy Joe Saunders and Gennady \u201cGGG\u201d Golovkin in recent history. Despite the buzz about his decline, 2021 Ring Magazine Trainer of the Year Eddy Reynoso attested to the Mexican champ\u2019s ability to deliver after being with \u00c1lvarez since he was just 15 years old.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we trained like this, so intensely,\u201d said Reynoso, through a translator. \u201cNow we are 100 percent.\u201d\n\nCanelo agreed with his trainer and added a message for his future opponent at the final press conference before the fight.\n\n\u201cI feel great, I feel ready for this fight,\u201d said Canelo. \u201cI\u2019m ready to show everyone my skills, my real skills.\u201d```"}

His final message was that he wanted to spend the next year and a half bringing a message of hope, both to places in the \u201cdeep red\u201d and in the \u201cheart of San Francisco.\u201d He was quite clear in saying, \u201cI\u2019m not backing down.\u201d\n\n8:29 p.m. In the not too distant yonder\nDeSantis shared with the crowd a favorite flight path of his \u2014 a route into DC \u2014 which allowed him to see \u201csweeping, up-close views of the Lincoln Memorial.\u201d As the plane flew over the glistening water, he said that he could see, \u201cperched on the top of the hill, in the not too distant yonder, the beautiful Capitol Building.\u201d DeSantis\u2019 descriptive language stands in stark contrast with Trump\u2019s brief, broad and commandeering statements made earlier in the day. Tonight, DeSantis is in the business of storytelling. Summarizing his point, DeSantis said that a country may have the world\u2019s best Constitution, but \u201cthese things do not run on autopilot.\u201d Americans must still \u201cstand up and defend freedom,\u201d he said.\n\n8:21 p.m. In 10 years, DeSantis wants to look into the camera and say...\nThe Governor\u2019s crystal ball projects six future successes for the nation. \u201cOne, we want to say that we have restored the American dream in this country,\u201d he said. Next, he said he wants to reclaim sovereignty in America by restoring the Southern border. DeSantis said he will \u201cuse deadly force against the Mexican drug cartels.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time we leave them stone cold dead at the borders,\u201d he said. The Florida governor lauded his state\u2019s decline in overdose deaths. He stressed American defense against \u201ccommunist China.\u201d DeSantis expanded on the \u201cparental right\u201d debate that has become central to partisan politics. He pledged, as president, schools will \u201cno longer [be] indoctrinating our kids.\u201d He emphasized criminal accountability. \u201cFrom coast to coast, we are a country where criminals are held responsible for their conducts and the inmates are no longer running the asylum,\u201d he said. Lastly, the governor pledged to \u201crestore the original understanding of our constitution\u201d and return to a limited government. \u201cWe will have restored this government to its rightful owners: we the American people,\u201d he said. DeSantis expressed disdain for bureaucratic agencies like the Department of Justice, FBI and IRS. \u201cThey can\u2019t even tell you how cocaine got into the White House,\u201d he added.\n\n8:17 p.m. Social credit and cryptocurrency\nA social credit system is something that DeSantis strongly opposes; he told the crowd that as governor he has eliminated the use of social credit scores in financing. He also said that central banks want to eliminate cash and crypto, making \u201ccentral bank digital currency\u201d the only way to engage in the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a wolf showing up as a wolf,\u201d said DeSantis.\n\n8:14 p.m. Law and order\nDeSantis claimed that elected officials in California funded by George Soros \u201cdecide that they are progressive\u201d and \u201clet the inmates run the asylum,\u201d which he says puts communities at risk. He shared an anecdote of having met \u201csix or seven\u201d Californians who had been mugged. Soros funded officials in Florida, he said, conversely were removed from their posts by DeSantis. DeSantis also said that \u201cwhen BLM was ransacking cities,\u201d he \u201censured law and order.\u201d He credited government actions like this as contributing to Florida\u2019s 50-year crime low.\n\n8:10 p.m. Florida as a model for nationwide education\nDeSantis turned to his education policy. One thing was clear: Florida\u2019s education system today is DeSantis\u2019 national education system tomorrow. Highlighting key policy points for many conservatives such as school choice and curriculum transparency, DeSantis hammered home that many of these policies are already in place in the state of Florida. He cited several recent successes for the state, including that Florida was recently ranked #1 in the nation for education by the US News & World Report as the University of Florida moved up to #15 in national rankings by the WSJ. DeSantis also slammed the pushback on \u201cbook bans,\u201d which he refers to as a media and leftist phrase. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to jam things like pornographic materials in front of kids,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Florida, we put a stop to it.\u201d\n\n8:05 p.m. CA vs. FL\nDespite DeSantis\u2019 memories of the state, he stressed that his own state of Florida \u201crepresents a way to reverse the American decline.\u201d Just as \u201ccorporate media\u201d are quick to trash Florida, said DeSantis, they are putting \u201clipstick on a pig\u201d with regards to California, a state he called \u201cthe petri dish for American liberalism and American leftism.\u201d DeSantis also announced the upcoming debate between him and Gov. Newsom on Fox News Nov. 30, which he referred to as a \u201clittle tussle.\u201d\n\n8:00 p.m. DeSantis met with standing ovation\nAs GOP chairwoman Patterson introduced DeSantis, the ballroom erupted into applause. DeSantis launched into his speech reminiscing on fond memories of his time in California. He told the crowd about the sensation of \u201chaving the freshness of the Pacific Ocean there hitting you\u201d as he stepped off a C5 after returning from Iraq. \u201cI have very fond memories of California,\u201d DeSantis said. He said that ever since he became governor of Florida, however, there has been a sea of California license plates in the state. The governor attributes this trend to a migration away from \u201cfailed blue states.\u201d\n\n7:07 p.m. The delegate perspective\nWaiting for DeSantis\u2019 banquet to kick off, Annenberg Media spoke to Jim Bieber, a Californian delegate for more than 20 years. He said that today\u2019s CAGOP was unlike any he\u2019s seen before: \u201cThe luncheon was the most wild thing that has ever appeared before the convention.\u201d The key differentiator this year was who was sitting in Trump\u2019s audience, said Bieber. Rather than regular attendees, Bieber said the tables were filled by people who \u201ccoughed up 500 bucks to attend a lunch that turned into a rally.\u201d And, this year California would be seeing money come in from the convention rather than the other way around, said Bieber. He said that because the state is dominated by Democrats, usually candidates come to conventions and \u201csuck out money.\u201d But not this year.\n\n4:21 p.m. Off the stage; onto a plane\nAfter 20 minutes of air time, Scott leaves the stage in order to catch his flight on time. Trump\u2019s lateness cut into the majority of Scott\u2019s event. Before leaving, Scott leaves the room with some closing remarks: that \u201cturning off the craziness in the news is good for your soul,\u201d and that \u201cthe average person in this country will go the extra mile for someone who will go the extra mile for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\n4:17 p.m. A parent\u2019s bill of rights\nScott told Patterson that parents should have certain rights, listing five specifically: To know exactly what their kids are being exposed to in school To opt out of electives To know exactly what\u2019s being discussed with \u201cadults in the school system and their minor kids\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need CRT, we need ABC.\u201d Scott says the \u201cindoctrination\u201d of students should be stopped. Only 14% of kids understand the rich, provocative history of the US, said Scott. \u201cWe have to get back to the basics. We are failing our kids.\u201d\n\n4:13 p.m. Scott\u2019s Four Commandments\nScott listed four policy pillars: \u201cIf you are able-bodied in America, you work.\u201d \u201cIf you take out a loan, you pay it back.\u201d \u201cIf you commit a violent crime, you go to jail.\u201d \u201cIf god made you a man, you play sports against men,\u201d he said.\n\n4:08 p.m. Scott sits down by the \u201cFireside\u201d\nReturning on stage to his seat, Scott sits down to chat with Patterson, chairman of the California GOP. They began by discussing Wednesday\u2019s debate. Scott urges that the GOP rallies around \u201cfiring Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n4:02 p.m. Tim Scott arrives\nTim Scott arrives an hour after scheduled due to Trump\u2019s late appearance. As in the lunchtime session, his speech begins with the invocation and pledge of allegiance. A Fox Business clip from Wednesday\u2019s debate of Scott saying that America is not a racist country plays. Taking the stage, Scott\u2019s first talking point is this: \u201cProtecting America starts with backing the blue.\u201d He\u2019s off the stage as quickly as he stepped onto it: \u201cI\u2019m going to preach to y\u2019all,\u201d said Scott standing in the middle of the ballroom. \u201cWe should build the wall,\u201d he continues. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. Get it done.\u201d\n\n3:26 p.m. Staff prepares for Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s arrival\nTripods on tables are replaced with wine glasses as the Marriott\u2019s Grand Ballroom is converted for Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s \u201cFireside Chat.\u201d Two arm chairs sit upon the stage. The Mamas & the Papas \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u201d plays over the speakers.\n\n3:18 p.m. Trump departs the stage\nTrump plans to make four major amendments to election procedure, in lieu of the \u201cStop the steal\u201d movement that alleges voter fraud across the country. He pledged to instate paper ballots only, federal voter ID laws, same-day elections and stressed wanting constituents to visit a booth instead of voting by-mail. Trump closes his speech by urging Republican voters to turn out to Super Tuesday. Gesturing, Trump said that there are thousands of supporters outside who, despite knowing they can\u2019t get into the convention, \u201ccame anyways.\u201d His signature sign-off: \u201cWe will make America great again,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThank you California, god bless you all!\u201d\n\n3:06 p.m. Deepening the divide\nTrump vilified Democrats throughout his entire keynote, but stressed that \u201cthe radical left Democrats rigged the 2020 election\u201d and his party would not let that happen again. He said each indictment is a \u201cbig badge of honor.\u201d \u201cNever forget: our enemies want to stop us because we are the only ones who can stop them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.\u201d\n\n3:00 p.m. Polling: Trump vs. \u201cDeSanctimonious\u201d\nTrump analyzed recent polling on the Republican primary election, touting his success over DeSantis: \u201cThese polls are so incredible.\u201d He highlighted a recent poll in which Trump led the pack at 63%, while \u201cDeSanctimonious\u201d polled at 12%. He shared that fellow Republicans had urged Trump not to \u201chit\u201d another member of the party. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if he\u2019s a Republican, gotta hit him!,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI hit him hard, and he\u2019s crashing like a bird that\u2019s seriously wounded in flight.\u201d\n\n2:45 p.m. \u201cRetribution for theft and destruction\u201d\nTrump expressed concerns that people are pillaging department stores, saying that law enforcement is \u201cnot allowed to do anything. They\u2019re told to stand by, stand back. Don\u2019t touch.\u201d In an effort to make the nation \u201can entirely different place,\u201d he says, Trump proposed new standards for law enforcement in instances of pillaging and theft. \u201cWhen the police are allowed to do their job, and that means in some cases, shoot them, this will stop immediately,\u201d said Trump, saying that people who rob stores should \u201cfully expect to be shot\u201d as they are leaving.\n\n2:34 p.m. The \u201cparental rights\u201d debate\nTrump called California laws in support of transgender children \u201cdepraved\u201d and \u201cchild sexual mutilation.\u201d Across California, school board meetings have erupted into political debate over parental notification policies that require teachers to tell parents that their child identifies as transgender. Trump targeted transgender athletes. He said that he wants basketball legend Lebron James to transition so Trump can coach him. \u201cWe will be undefeated forever. We will make the legendary John Wooden into just a little asterisk,\u201d he said.\n\n2:32 p.m. Remarks on the United Auto Workers strike\nTrump said that the UAW has a leader (President Shawn Fain) who hates him \u201cbecause he is a Republican.\u201d Sharing that he feels the group\u2019s political tilt is a mistake, he said that hourly wages won\u2019t matter when jobs disappear in two years. \u201cTell your union that if they\u2019re smart, you should endorse me immediately,\u201d he said. He told the crowd that he believes the UAW workers are on his side, \u201c95%.\u201d\n\n2:20 p.m. Attacks on Biden and Newsom\n\u201cGavin has become crooked Joe Biden\u2019s top surrogate,\u201d said Trump of Newsom. His remark comes after Newsom made his rounds at the second Republican presidential debate in Simi Valley on Wednesday as a proxy for the Biden campaign.\n\n2:12 p.m. Tackling forest fires\nStaying on the theme of water, Trump outlined a plan to \u201cdampen\u201d forests as part of a forest fire prevention scheme for California. \u201cAll the currently dry canals will be used to irrigate,\u201d he said. He spoke about redistributing water from the northern part of the state: \u201cThere is so much water up north, I want the overflow areas to dampen your forests.\u201d More broadly, he hopes to improve California\u2019s \u201cpoor land management.\u201d\n\n2:05 p.m. Smelly California\nTrump turned to the issue of California\u2019s drought, saying that high tax rates in California should mean residents have free access to water in their homes. \u201cThat\u2019s why rich people from Beverly Hills, generally speaking, don\u2019t smell so good,\u201d he said. Referencing a federal plan his administration had worked on, Trump told the crowd he wants to force Newsom to provide Californians with water.\n\n1:42 p.m. First mention of Trump\u2019s border wall\nTrump vowed that, in the first 48 hours of his presidency, he would \u201csave the borders,\u201d likening his proposed border wall to one allegedly surrounding Pelosi\u2019s house. He called the 2024 election the single most important election in our nation\u2019s history: \u201cOur country is going to hell. Our country is being destroyed.\u201d So far, Trump has name-dropped House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Vice President Kamala Harris and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, criticizing both their ideologies and character.\n\n1:36 p.m. A warm \u2014 and cinematic \u2014 welcome\nThe crowd broke out in \u201coohs\u201d at every mention of Trump and \u201cboos\u201d at every mention of President Joe Biden. Jessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the California Republican Party, led an introduction for the lunch banquet. The short speech was followed by an introductory video \u2014 Hollywood style \u2014 before Trump took the stage. \u201cBoy, are they messing up California,\u201d he said. His first talking point was the blue state\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d elections, citing again mail-in ballots as a source of voter fraud.\n\n11:53 a.m. Conference attendees continue to file in ahead of Trump\u2019s keynote\n\u201cI\u2019m here to see Trump,\u201d said Roberta Cox, a 77-year-old conference attendee from San Diego. Today\u2019s lunch will be Cox\u2019s first time in a room with the former president. Decked out in Trump garb, her excitement is palpable. Cindy Josten is here for the same reason: \u201cI\u2019m so excited, this is my bucket list. I\u2019m here to support the man that I believe could save America,\u201d said the attendee from Santa Clarita. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be around like-minded people.\u201d\n\n10:31 a.m. Annenberg Media has arrived\nJust a couple blocks over from the \u201cHappiest place on Earth,\u201d groups of Trump supporters have packed street corners of Katella Avenue. Inside of the Anaheim Marriott Hotel, Secret Service agents are ushering conference attendees through security.\n```"}

(Photo by Nicole Shearin)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza\nSeptember 29, 2023 at 7:54 pm PDT\n\nFor the second year in a row, USC has started the season 4-0. In their fourth game last year at Oregon State, as well as last week when the Trojans defeated ASU, growing pains were evident in the Trojans\u2019 performance. This was highlighted by uncharacteristically poor communication, untimely penalties and seemingly lackluster cohesiveness from the Trojans as a whole.\n\nThe Trojans got the job done on the road in Corvallis last year and this year in Tempe. But to truly reach the lofty aspirations that this team has set for themselves, the holes need to be fixed as soon as this weekend when they travel to Boulder, Colorado, to take on Coach Prime and the Colorado Buffaloes.\n\nEspecially concerning delay of game penalties and clock mismanagement, head coach Lincoln Riley knows what needs to be done to be successful this weekend and in the future. \u201cA lot of it comes down to efficiency of our operation ... we wasted seconds we didn\u2019t need to waste,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of adjustments. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s one thing we point to and say if we fix this, then hopefully we won\u2019t have that. It\u2019s coaching, it\u2019s design, it\u2019s the players\u2019 operation, being efficient with subs. There\u2019s a lot that goes into it. You get challenged that way when you go on the road, and certainly, in the first half, we didn\u2019t respond very well. We know we have to be a lot better in another fun road atmosphere [this weekend].\u201d\n\nEven in a game where things seemed off, junior quarterback Caleb Williams still came away with five total touchdowns, highlighted by a fourth-quarter touchdown pass to junior receiver Brenden Rice. \u201cYou can\u2019t perfectly script and rehearse every scenario,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe teach concepts in scramble [drills], but they also have to learn to play off one another. That was a good example of our guys doing that. He did a good job seeing it and knowing he could execute the way he did.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 talent is undeniable, and paired with the likes of emerging redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd, the Trojans\u2019 offense is one of the best in the nation. On Lloyd, Riley thinks there\u2019s still room for improvement. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a high ceiling, but he can still get a whole lot better,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe carries the ball well and is starting to get our schemes. The other parts of his game \u2014 receiver and pass protector \u2014 are really coming along. We\u2019re working hard to develop the entire player. I think he can be a high-level back if he continues to grow.\u201d\n\nThe loftier aspirations that this team has are definitely in the cards. The talent is apparent, now more than ever. \u201cIf you just keep winning, everything will take care of itself,\u201d Riley said. \u201cEverybody can sit here right now and debate who the top teams are, but really it doesn\u2019t matter right now. All blue-blood, big-boy programs like this are all held to the same standard. The answer for us is keep getting better and keep winning, that takes care of everything.\u201d\n```"}

However, the competition is only open to PlayStation 5 gamers.\n\nThe campaign is divided into two distinct projects: FC Pro Open and FC Pro League. In FC Pro Open, players will have to build their \u00ab Ultimate Team \u00bb in the game and compete in an online regional open ladder. The best online players will earn their spot to compete in an 8-week real-life competition held in London to determine the 4 players that will reach the World Championships.\n\nStarting February 2024, EA Sports will aim locally with the start of their FC Pro League, a chain of esports tournaments held in partnership with football leagues around the world, like the MLS, LALIGA, Ligue 1 etc. This worldwide circuit will eventually allow the 28 strongest players to join the 4 qualified from FC Pro Open at the FC 24 World Championships, resulting in a world-class 32-player tournament.\n\nThe development of this new pro circuit marks another stepping stone in EA\u2019s ongoing rebranding towards e-competitions and e-entertainment.\n\nFC Pro x JSA+partners\nWhile EA has been working on developing its esports ecosystem, it is JSA+partners, a Public Relations agency founded by USC alumna Jennifer Stephens Acree, that is in charge of helping them with outreach.\n\nAs 2nd year PR Graduate student Arantxa Landa currently interning at the agency told me \u00abWe don\u2019t have as much involvement in [...] the structure of the competition, we mostly help them get to the media. \u00bb\n\nCasey Tamkin graduated from Annenberg in 2017 and is now in charge of the FC Pro campaign at JSA+partners. \u00ab The biggest message that we\u2019re trying to communicate with fans is: this is a new era of EA Sports football, and e-sports overall, \u00bb she said.\n\nIn order to execute the release of FC 24 and its Pro esports tournaments, the agency prepped a PR campaign aimed at getting fans excited about this new adventure via esports and traditional sports media outlets.\n\nSenior director and commissioner of EA football esports Sam Turkbas notably expressed himself in a GamesBeat article, stating: \u00ab FC Pro will redefine the way our millions of Ultimate Team players engage with EA Sports FC.\u00bb\n\nTamkin also highlighted the internationality and accessibility of the campaign, stating that football is such a beloved sport worldwide, which may serve as a great first step towards appealing to new audiences unfamiliar with esports.\n\n\u00ab I think what makes FC Pro so special is the fact that someone who might not understand the intricacies of another video game can easily jump in and watch, right? So even if I\u2019m not a huge gamer, [...] it\u2019s easy for me to watch it and enjoy it and understand what\u2019s happening, \u00bb said Tamkin.\n\nAn Eye-Opening Campaign\nIt seems that the reach of the FC Pro campaign may not only help fans but also future industry leaders better understand the wide grasp of the esports industry and the different jobs it involves.\n\nArantxa, who was not very familiar with the topic beforehand, shared her thoughts. \u00ab I knew there was a huge community and funds behind this industry, but I didn\u2019t know the many different ways of being involved in esports, \u00bb she said.\n\nEven for more experienced partners, esports\u2019 constantly evolving nature is a source of incredible experience. Casey said \u00ab Before the pandemic, I don\u2019t think anyone kind of knew what esports was. And then post-pandemic, esports and gaming touches all of our lives in so many ways, [...] it\u2019s kind of become this global phenomenon. It\u2019s just changing so much. And there\u2019s something new to learn every single day. There are new applications for it. There are new ways that people interact with esports. So I think I\u2019m always growing and learning. \u00bb\n\nIf any of our readers aim to get into Public Relations, Esports may be an interesting market, even if they do not feel qualified. Casey stated that, as a Journalism major, she would not have thought of esports PR as a career option. However, her ability to communicate stories of brands through different media, as well as her gaming experience while growing up, led her to become an esports PR professional who has now been working with EA Sports for 3 years.\n```"}

The panel, \u201cRole of Diplomacy in Turkish Foreign Policy\u201d was initially open to all students, but became a high-security affair after protesters were forcibly thrown out of Wallis Annenberg Hall and access to the event was restricted.\n\nSeveral dozen demonstrators held up signs with red handprints, chanting \u201cUSC supports terrorists,\u201d and \u201cgenocidal policy has no place in diplomacy,\u201d along with other phrases critical of the Turkish government. The protestors could be heard inside the conference room at the event, organized by students and held at the USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism.\n\nAnnenberg Dean Willow Bay said USC stands by its choice to hold the event due to their Policy on Free Speech at USC. \u201cWe have certainly received emails expressing concerns about this event and asking us to cancel this event,\u201d Bay said. \u201cOur hearts go out to all our Armenian students.\u201d\n\nA video taken by one of the student protestors shows DPS officers escorting students out of the conference room. Once outside, DPS officers clashed with students trying to regain entry to the conference.\n\nThe group of demonstrators was not limited to the USC Armenian Student Association, as members of the greater Los Angeles Armenian diaspora also joined the protest. The protestors said they are outraged by recent events in the Lachin corridor, the only road connecting the Armenian population in the Nagorno-Karabakh region with their homeland. The road has been blocked by Turkish-supported Azerbaijani military forces, leaving hundreds wounded and dozens dead due to a lack of food, medicine, and other essentials.\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh region, known by Armenians as the Republic of Artsakh, is in sovereign Azerbaijan. Over 93,000 ethnic Armenians have fled since Azerbaijan opened the Lachin corridor on September 24, after taking control of the region on September 20.\n\nLast month, Luis Moreno Ocampo, former prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, said in a report that the blockade can be considered an act of genocide under Article II of the Geneva Convention. These events are eerily similar to the Armenian genocide of 1915 when the Ottoman Empire murdered and deported Armenians resulting in up to 1 million Armenian deaths.\n\nMercan addressed the conflict, \u201cEveryone has [their] own narrative, I have my own narrative, the Armenians have [their] own narrative,\u201d he said to Annenberg Media during the Q&A session of the conference.\n\nMany people gathered outside of Wallis Annenberg to protest the conference which brought the U.S. Turkish Ambassador to USC. (Photo by Alan Mittelstaedt)\n\nUSC student Lilia Margaryan joined the protest outside Annenberg Hall. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to spread the message that Armenia needs to be recognized and understood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dissolving of Artsakh, which is also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, needs to get a lot more media coverage and it hasn\u2019t been.\u201d\n\nThe Armenian Youth Federation, in an Instagram post on September 26, said Mercan actively upholds the Turkish policy of Armenian genocide denial.\n\nWhen Marcan was asked how he would address the protestors, he said, \u201cOn this issue of so-called genocide... labeling something as genocide is a legal term and that requires a legal process. That requires research and analysis of the history of all the archives... Then progress is made.\u201d\n\nShant Kassabian, secretary of the Armenian Student Organization of USC, expressed that although he is unaware of the specifics of the legitimacy and legality of using the term, he and the Armenian community see history repeating itself from the 1915 genocide and thus label what is happening now as a genocide.\n\nMercan compared other historical events with the humanitarian crisis in Armenia. \u201cYou know Jews went through a terrible Holocaust. They handled it differently... Each culture has its own way of handling its sorrow. I understand it, but we cannot reverse the history back,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if we are able to move forwards, like many Armenians living in Turkey, I think we will be able to create this.\u201d\n\nIn response to Mercan\u2019s statement, Kassabian said, \u201cImagine if the American government dropped two nuclear bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and then turned around and denied doing so. That\u2019s our situation. Imagine Hitler going about committing atrocities throughout World War II and then the German government denying ever doing so.\u201d\n\nAfter the Armenian Student Association sent an email to the event organizer Robert D. Banks, director of the Master of Public Diplomacy Program, urging him to cancel the event, USC Annenberg responded with a statement saying, \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that our environment encourages and protects robust debate and inquiry.\u201d\n\nUSC Gould School of Law student, Elizabeth Petrosyan initially hoped to be a part of legally resolving the conflict one day using her judicial degree. Now, she sees a peaceful resolution with Turkey as improbable. \u201cThey preach hate. They instill hate into the new generations of their country,\u201d she said.\n\nPetrosyan also expressed disappointment with the university.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult studying at a school that accepts this \u2014 it hasn\u2019t even been a week,\u201d she said, referring to the mass casualties in Armenia\u2019s attempt to save Nagorno Karabakh earlier this week. \u201cThis is still going on. We have family members that we haven\u2019t heard from in five days. We don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re alive. We don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Hall was locked down most of the day, with students being turned away unless they had a class or an appointment in the Media Center. There was heavy police presence outside of the building, with the entrance still being blocked even after a TrojanAlert sent to students claimed the demonstration was concluded around 2 p.m.\n```"}

Viphurit toured internationally for his sophomore album \u201cThe Greng Jai Piece\u201d which was released on Jan. 31, 2023. After performing across Asia and Oceania, Viphurt spent the last leg of his tour in the U.S. In August, he performed in 21 cities starting in Dallas before ending it here in L.A. Other cities he traveled to across the country include Atlanta, Washington, New York, Toronto, Denver, San Diego and more. For the North America tour, he was joined by artists Mild Orange and Brandon.\n\nBefore one last performance, he spoke with Annenberg Media about the heart behind his album and this tour.\n\nHow does it feel being on the last show of your tour?\n\n\u201cFeels amazing. I thought I\u2019d be a bit more sad, but it\u2019s been a bit too long that I\u2019ve been away from home that I\u2019m kind of excited to go back home. I\u2019m grateful to be here, but I\u2019m really happy to be going back home and getting some sleep, like an actual amount of sleep. Mixed feelings but more on the happy side.\u201d [laughs]\n\nWhat is it like getting to represent your home and Asian people wherever you perform?\n\n\u201cHonestly, I hadn\u2019t realized this representational aspect of it until not too long ago when I started writing this latest album that I\u2019m touring. Yeah, before this, I was just like, \u2018I like doing music.\u2019 I didn\u2019t see myself as being someone from a particular, like different culture as something I do. But now, more so than ever with this latest album, I explored more of my own Thai-ness, my own third-culture kid, sort of limbo that I\u2019m in. So, I am very proud to be representing Thailand, New Zealand and places of my upbringing.\u201d\n\nCan you speak more on what you mentioned about exploring your identity in the songs you wrote for this album?\n\n\u201cThis album\u2019s called \u2018The Greng Jai Piece.\u2019 It refers to an episode of \u2018The Big Bang Theory\u2019 where there\u2019s a plate of food in the middle of the room and there\u2019s one piece of food left and Sheldon explains to his friends that it\u2019s called the kreng jai piece. It\u2019s reserved for the most valuable member of the table, like the eldest. For me, it was something I always grew up with, but to hear it explained to me from a very Americanized, entertainment way sparked this whole idea of exploring my own Thai-ness and my place and my take on things I agree with and things I disagree with.\u201d\n\nYeah, and it\u2019s a great album I have to say. [laughs]\n\n\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\n\nWhat is it like releasing your sophomore album and getting to perform it for all of your fans?\n\n\u201cIt feels great because I think a lot of musicians after the whole Covid thing were very much in doubt like could they sustain this career? Will the following be the same? Will they get the same opportunities? I\u2019m so grateful to be on this tour in the U.S. and Canada. Yeah, the reception\u2019s been lovely.\u201d\n\nWhat is it like getting to perform across Asia, Oceania and the U.S.?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all very different vibe-wise. I would say when you tour in Asia, the hospitality is significantly better. I think it\u2019s just an Eastern thing where they feed you very well and the hospitality is very gentle and polite. Not that people in the West are not as gentle and polite, but it\u2019s a lot more DIY and hands-on when you tour the Western states. I live for both aspects and these differences, it keeps me active and on my toes.\u201d\n\nHow does it feel going to all these places? Does it ever feel crazy looking back on it?\n\n\u201cIt did feel crazy the first few years that I started traveling: 2018, 2019, but now it feels like a routine, more like work. I do enjoy when I get days off. The excitement is not the same as when I was let\u2019s say like 22, 23 when I first started.\u201d\n\nWhat messages do you hope people get from your music?\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t want to impose any strong messaging or anything. I just wrote about what I feel and I hope it resonates with people and they form their own connections and meanings to it. Even though I\u2019m writing about my Thai-ness and my third-culture kid limbo thing going on, I hope they find their own thing with it. That\u2019s my greatest wish.\u201d\n\nThat is essentially the beauty of art to just find your own interpretation.\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t want to define it for them too much.\u201d\n\nWhat is your favorite memory from the tour?\n\n\u201cOn this trip, I really enjoyed... What were we doing? It\u2019s such a blur. I\u2019ll just summarize this tour or this year I guess. We played a show in Hong Kong, it was very memorable. We had some days off in Korea this year which was really nice. We had some time off in L.A., we went out to Joshua Tree to visit our friends up there and that was really nice. I enjoy the downtime more in today\u2019s age.\u201d\n\nDo you have a favorite city you performed in?\n\n\u201cThe ones that stood out to me have been New York, Vancouver, Toronto, Boston\u2019s really nice, Chicago. Yeah, all the West Coast cities are really lovely. The other cities are really lovely, but I just remember those cities more because I guess I wasn\u2019t too exhausted. Yeah, it was nice to go to.\u201d\n\nYeah, maybe tonight will be memorable too.\n\n\u201cI hope so too. It\u2019s our last one too, so we\u2019re going to give it everything.\u201d\n\nAfter Viphurit\u2019s two openers, he entered The Regent Theater stage to a frenzied crowd that welcomed his appearance. He and his band performed a colorful and vibrant show for many fans who reciprocated their energy. During the show and on behalf of his band, he said they waited 20 shows to be back in L.A. and can\u2019t wait to return.\n```"}

Feinstein, served over 50 years in public office. She was the oldest member of the Senate and also the longest serving female senator and the longest serving senator from California. Feinstein passed in her Washington D.C. home, the cause of the death was unconfirmed.\n\nIn February, Feinstein announced her intention to retire from congress at the end of next year amidst the increasing scrutiny around her fitness to serve. Earlier this year, she was hospitalized and returned to the Senate in May after a nearly three month absence raising concerns around her health. The five-term senator had said she would not run for reelection in 2024 hoping to accomplish as much for California as she could, till the end of her term.\n\nHaving first been elected to the Senate in 1992, Feinstein leaves the seat expected to be filled by Governor Gavin Newsom of California soon, with an interim appointment. Even before Feinstein\u2019s death, three high profile Democratic members of Congress had joined the race to succeed her: a member of the congressional committee Adam B. Schiff, representative Katie Porter and congress member Barbara Lee. Earlier this month, Newsom said in an interview with  NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d  that he would not appoint any of them to the seat.\n\nThe office of Governor released a  statement  today ordering state flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of Senator Feinstein.

The matchup against Washington State was USC\u2019s second conference game this season and its third game against a ranked opponent. Despite being shutout in the first half, USC managed to outshoot the Cougars 7-3. Washington State senior forward Margie Detrizio scored the game\u2019s first goal just before the 27th minute.\n\n\u201cWe always know coming here that it\u2019s a tough place to play,\u201d USC head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cAt halftime we came together, and it was a team-led discussion that said, \u2018we\u2019re not going to lose this game.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth teams struggled to score in the beginning of the second half, similar to what the first half looked like. However, USC knotted things up at 1-1 after freshman forward Maribel Flores sent the ball flying over junior goalkeeper Nadia Cooper for the score in the 62nd minute. The goal came off a blocked shot from the Cougars that led to an assist from junior forward Izzy Kimberly. Flores\u2019 game-tying goal was her fourth of the season.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the one who scored last time when we were down an early goal against Duke,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cShe\u2019s just someone who comes in at a clutch time and is a really great finisher.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans scored the go-ahead goal in the 78th minute after Cooper attempted to get the ball out of the box for Washington State. However, graduate forward Hannah Griffin got her head on the ball first to finish off the play with a score. The goal came after USC got a free kick from around 35 yards and gave Griffin her second goal of the season, despite being swarmed by multiple Cougars. Both of Griffin\u2019s goals this year have been game-winners.\n\nGriffin is trying to get back into rhythm after having to miss about three weeks of the season due to an illness and additional time due to a knee injury.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s now climbing back into the minutes,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cShe said she put it in with her shoulder so whatever it takes to get the job done. It was a really cool moment for us.\u201d\n\nIn total, USC had a 17-10 shot advantage for the game, an 8-4 shots on goal advantage and eight corner kicks compared to just one for Washington State. USC\u2019s win Thursday was another opportunity to experience winning a game after trailing. The Trojans have now won two games this year in which they fell behind at some point.\n\n\u201c[The coaching staff] told them afterwards that it was probably the proudest we\u2019d ever been of them,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cGoing down did displace the moral a little bit, but to be able to dig deep and come together is what\u2019s most important.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans face another test on the road Sunday at 1 p.m. as they head to Seattle for a matchup with another Pac-12 rival in the Washington Huskies. USC enters the matchup undefeated in conference play, winners of three games in a row and with an overall record of 6-2 on the season.\n\n\u201cHopefully everyone can bring a fresh performance with it being a close game tonight,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWe did get to make some subs tonight, but not a ton, so we just need to really rest up and get ready for the next one.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Michael Chow)\n\nBy AC Shick September 29, 2023 at 3:54 pm PDT\n\nThe five inaugural sustainability fellows began their two-year appointment on a myriad of environmental based topics. Anna Vinton attributes a large part of her love of nature to growing up on a Western Nebraska cattle ranch. Now, she\u2019s left the farmland for the lab. Vinton is part of the inaugural cohort of the Presidential Sustainability Solutions Fellowship. She is currently developing mathematical tools to research how coral reef species can survive environmental change.\n\nThe postdoctoral experience falls under USC\u2019s sustainable framework \u201cAssignment: Earth.\u2019\u2019 The intention of the fellowship is for early-career scholars to investigate sustainable challenges through interdisciplinary research. \u201cWith sustainability, no matter what discipline you\u2019re coming from, no matter what research background you have, I think it has ultimately the same amount of goals,\u201d said fellow David Ba\u00f1uelas.\n\nHe is investigating models to predict the sea level rise and the effect it will have on Southern California. His research explores ways to protect salt marshes because of their importance to the planet. In scientific disciplines, postdoctoral studies are becoming increasingly popular. From 1999 to 2019 there was a 49% increase in postdoctoral appointees in science broad fields, according to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.\n\nDespite this, the income of scholars does not show the same growth. Labor economist at the University of Kansas, Donna Ginther, compared biomedical Ph.D. recipients who pursued a postdoc to those who hadn\u2019t in 2017. She found that it took postdocs about 15 years to reach the income of their peers. Furthermore, research shows that in 2015, fellows in a variety of disciplines saw a salary range between $42,000 to $57,000. Adjusted for inflation, the range is approximately $54,000 to $74,000.\n\nThe annual salary for the USC sustainability fellows is $75,000 to $80,000 and they can receive up to $3,000 for relocation expenses. Fellow Matthew Coopilton said, \u201cI have to pinch myself. This is a dream in many ways,\u201d expressing that their childhood self would not believe this is their job. Coopilton studies and designs games to be used for educational purposes and allow users to create a sustainable world without systemic oppression.\n\nAfter 11 years as a high school teacher, Coopilton began to notice \u201ctheir imagination of the future was quite bleak.\u201d They saw the students \u201cwere hearing the news about climate change and were beginning to see its impacts.\u201d Coopilton\u2019s designs/games allows users to create a sustainable world without systemic oppression. In the past, they\u2019ve organized game jams, which allow people to prototype video and analog games.\n\nThroughout this fellowship, they aim to work with the School of Cinematic Arts and Rossier School of Education. The fellowship was created with cooperation as a key principle. The fellows must work with two USC faculty mentors that are in different departments. Additionally, they must devote 20% of their time to interdisciplinary collaboration and growth within the cohort, and the USC sustainability community.\n\n\u201cTheir work inspires me to think in more creative ways,\u201d said fellow Zhongzheng Niu about his fellow members. Niu studies what he calls a \u201chot topic.\u201d He\u2019s investigating the effects of heatwaves and air pollution on health, with an emphasis on how these factors impact pregnancy. Niu categorizes his work under the umbrella of health disparity.\n\nIn his past research he found that air pollution impacted pregnant women\u2019s health more when they have greater environmental burdens which is associated with lower socioeconomic status. Katherine Baker is also interested in socioeconomic status and environmental impact. \u201cWe can work to make sure groups that have been systemically and historically oppressed have opportunities to consume diets that are supportive of health and if they want to as well, the planet,\u201d said Baker.\n\nShe studies the intersection of nutrition and the climate emergency. Her work also features themes of environmental justice. Baker intends to find pathways for people to start eating more sustainably. Baker said she enjoys the weekly fellowship meetings and looks forward to collaborating with her peers.\n\nThere are limited postdoctoral opportunities that focus on sustainability. The Postdoctoral Fellowships for Sustainability Solutions gives those who want to make a positive environmental impact a chance to do so.\n```"}

Now it\u2019s the most sought-after drink in the country and is celebrated on several occasions a year. In the United States, September 29 marks National Coffee Day, while in the rest of the world celebrates October 1 as International Coffee Day. The popularity and coffee intake rises in the fall and winter, making this holiday a perfect time to commemorate the start of autumn with a nice cup of joe.\n\nMany USC students were not aware of Friday\u2019s significance \u2014 although they unintentionally celebrated with a cup of coffee. Business student Lauren Recasner said was surprised to learn about National Coffee Day. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that...I was not aware and had no idea,\u201d she said.\n\nThe history of coffee dates farther back than expected. Originating in Ethiopia, coffee made its appearance in Europe in the 17th century. When it was introduced to the Americas in the mid-1600s, it was not well-received for a long time, as people continued to stick with tea. It was only when the Boston Tea Party occurred and tea became considered unpatriotic to drink that people started to make the switch to coffee.\n\nAccording to the NCAUSA, \u201cBy the end of the 18th century, coffee had become one of the world\u2019s most profitable export crops. After crude oil, coffee is the most sought commodity in the world.\u201d The average American drinks almost three cups of coffee per day, and the country as a whole consumes 400 million cups per day, according to the National Day Archives.\n\nFine arts student Gillian Maltz said she drinks coffee regularly. \u201cI have one in the morning every morning and then in the afternoon I\u2019ll have another one,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Education Data, \u201cIf a college student bought a cup of coffee daily, they would spend $63 a month on average.\u201d Based on that estimate, students would spend about $750 on coffee alone on average.\n\nRecasner said coffee is becoming expensive in today\u2019s world. \u201cThe price of coffee these days is crazy, so I feel like they should advertise it and should have some type of deal,\u201d they said.\n\nMost coffee shops close to campus were not offering deals for this holiday. Many students said that they would love to get some form of discount. Sophomore health and human sciences student Wynnie Purchase commented that USC\u2019s coffee shops should not only have deals for the holiday but all year round. \u201cIf you buy five coffees in a week you could get two free,\u201d Purchase said. \u201cThe prices of coffee have only risen, and college students need to stay caffeinated. Any type of weekly deal would combat the high prices and incentivize students to buy more coffee.\u201d\n\nYet, who can\u2019t help but get a coffee in the morning, even if it\u2019s not National Coffee Day?\n```"}

We did photojournalism on the journalists. Documented the documenters. Storified the storytellers. We took you backstage of the Republican debate at the Reagan National Library in Simi Valley, CA. Seven candidates took the stage, vying for the presidential nomination. Ambassador Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Former Vice President Mike Pence, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie debated for two hours. The debate was hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision. The candidates spoke on topics such as how to increase militarization at the border; plans to force \u201claw and order\u201d in blue cities; abortion and forced birth policy. They extensively addressed \u201cparental rights,\u201d which has become a dog whistle for forcibly detransitioning queer children and outing them to their parents. Ramaswamy repeatedly noted that \u201ctransgenderism is a mental illness,\u201d and doubled down on this claim, in the spin room after. Collectively, the candidates made sweeping generalizations about \u201ccrime\u201d in America and falsely reported that the \u201cDefund the Police\u2019' movement was making the nation less safe. In fact, nationwide, police budgets are  overwhelmingly higher  than ever before. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a potential future Democratic presidential candidate, spent time speaking with the press at the library, on topics such as AI and the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes.

On Sunday, I was grabbing lunch when I checked my phone to see that the Miami Dolphins had dropped a 70-piece on the Denver Broncos. I had to refresh my phone to make sure there was not a glitch on my screen. In a record-breaking performance from the Fins, they became just the second team in NFL history to end a game with 300+ passing yards and 300+ rushing yards in the same game. To say the least, Colorado sports fans had a rough weekend of football.\n\nThe Denver Broncos might have lost some fans this week, but the Chiefs, and specifically Travis Kelce, gained a whole new fan club. High School Musical has finally come out with yet another movie. This time it\u2019s starring Travis Kelce, as the star athlete, and Taylor Swift, the famous pop star. The background characters being the Chicago Bears, because their actual play on Sunday in a 41-10 loss was no different than that of background \u201cathletes\u201d in movies. Of course I can\u2019t forget the ending with Kelce and Swift riding into the sunset. I am not afraid to admit, I have Taylor Swift\u2019s songs on my playlist. When music slaps, it doesn\u2019t matter who the artist is. The NFL social media page is going to have fun with this all season long.\n\nAs the opening weeks are behind us, teams are starting to take form. The Dolphins, 49ers, and Eagles have all separated themselves from the pack, while others might already be looking toward next year\u2019s draft. The rust is off from the offseason, and now we enter the first full month of NFL football.\n\nMy dishes from Week 2 were all spoiled, going a disappointing 0 of 3 on my picks. That brings my overall record to 2-4 on the season. This week\u2019s theme is revival, gaining back your trust with an excellent three-course meal for week four.\n\nFirst Course | Detroit Lions (2-1) vs Green Bay Packers (2-1), Sept. 28, 5:20 p.m PDT, Amazon Prime\n\nJared Goff has been that guy for the Lions this season, showcasing the talent that got him drafted number one overall in the 2016 NFL draft. Through three games, he has posted the fourth-best QBR at 70.8, while leading one of the better passing attacks in the league. But last week, it was the defense that pulled a lot of the weight, recording seven sacks. It certainly is not the same old Lions anymore.\n\nThe Packers could have easily been 1-2 entering this week, but quarterback Jordan Love and his team showed some great resilience. Being the second-youngest team in the NFL, most teams would shut down trailing 14 points in the fourth quarter. However, a late touchdown catch from wide receiver Romeo Doubs pushed the Packers atop the Saints, winning 18-17. Outside of that, the offense has been a mixed bag, struggling to establish a consistent ground attack. AJ Dillon has struggled to get anything going, and Aaron Jones has only seen one full game of action so far. A lot of what the Packers want to do on Thursday night will rely heavily on Jordan Love\u2019s shoulders.\n\nFries - Amon-Ra St Brown, Lions wide receiver - This side is a little special, representing the Trojan family in the NFL. Brown has great hands and route running ability, which has him ninth league wide in receiving yards right now with 275.\n\nDessert- I am riding with Detroit. Lambeau is certainly not an easy place to play for anybody, however, Jared Goff and the Lions have done nothing but surprise people this season. A win on Thursday can push the Lions atop the NFC North.\n\nSecond Course | Miami Dolphins (3-0) vs Buffalo Bills (2-1), 10 a.m. PDT, CBS\n\nIt is an absolute crime that this game sits on the morning window. A matchup between these two potent offenses will end up being the most entertaining game of the weekend. In the last two matchups, Buffalo has won both, with each game being a shootout. Josh Allen and the Bills\u2019 offense have returned to form after Week 1 woes, outscoring opponents 75-13 in their last two games. However, I think it boils down to the Bills\u2019 dominant defense versus the Dolphins\u2019 hot offense.\n\nIn a 70-point performance from the Dolphins offense, it looked like the varsity squad practicing with the freshmen in the Denver Broncos. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has certainly quieted critics with his play this season, leading the league in QBR (82.9) and ranking second in passing yards (1,024). On the other side, the Bills defense has looked reminiscent of their 90s units. In last week\u2019s game, the defense wreaked havoc on the Commanders, with nine sacks and five turnovers.\n\nMac and Cheese - Terrel Bernard, LB Bills - Entering the season with lots of questions about the linebacker position, second-year Terrel Bernard has not just fit but excelled. Against the Commanders last week, he became the first player since Brian Urlacher in 2007 to record two sacks, an interception and a fumble recovery. On top of that, he posted seven tackles and a pass deflection. Have a day!\n\nDessert - It\u2019s popping in Miami right now, and I am riding the wave with them. The Bills are going to struggle to stop this passing attack with Tyreek Hill and Jalen Waddle. And don\u2019t forget running back De\u2019Von Achane, who went off 233 total yards and four touchdowns last week. In a game where every possession is going to matter, I trust Dolphins Head Coach Mike McDaniel more.\n\nThird Course | Las Vegas Raiders (1-2) vs. Los Angeles Chargers (1-2), 1:05 p.m PDT, CBS\n\nYou could make a pretty easy case that both of these coaches should be spending their Sundays on the couch and not coaching a football team, let alone a professional one. Both Josh McDaniels and Brandon Staley have proven time and time again that just about anybody can be an NFL coach with their bad late-game decision-making.\n\nThe Chargers could easily be 0-3 heading into this matchup, if the Vikings didn\u2019t forget how to play football for the last two minutes of last week\u2019s game. Davante Adams is upset with the Raiders\u2019 outlook, but did he not see this coming? Transition from future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers to now Jimmy Garoppolo is a downgrade in every way. Garoppolo has a league-leading six interceptions in three games. If the trend continues, why not throw out rookie quarterback Aidan O\u2019Connell, who shined with his opportunities in the preseason.\n\nGarlic Bread- Keenan Allen, WR Chargers - After battling a hamstring injury throughout last season, Keenan Allen has come back rejuvenated. Through three games he has posted 402 receiving yards, the third-most in the league, and two touchdowns. The loss of star receiver Mike Williams to an ACL injury last week, has cemented Allen as the driving piece to success in the receiver room for the Chargers moving forward.\n\nDessert - It might feel like a home game for the Raiders at Sofi this Sunday, but I\u2019m riding with the Bolts. Justin Herbert has still been slinging it this season and barring any poor coaching decisions late-game from Brandon Staley (which I don\u2019t say very optimistically), the Chargers should handle the Raiders at home.\n\nLast Weeks\u2019 Record 0-3\nOverall Record 2-4\n\nRecipe of the week\n\nI am convinced that these game day recipes propel the Cowboys to success. Last week was the first week I missed the meals \u2014 and the Cowboys went on to lose to the winless Cardinals. For this week\u2019s game day recipe, I present Pulled Pork Nachos. All Sunday food is finger food, and this is the perfect meal for that.\n\nIngredients\n1 (9-oz.) bag tortilla chips (I prefer as Tostitos Cantina)\n2 (15-oz.) cans refried black beans, warmed\n8 ounces shredded smoked pork\n1 pound pepper Jack cheese, shredded (about 4 cups)\n1/4 cup sour cream\n2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 1 large lime)\n1 medium-sized ripe avocado, chopped\n3/4 cup chopped plum tomato (from 1 large tomato)\n1/2 cup fresh corn kernels (from 1 ear)\n1/4 cup sliced pickled jalape\u00f1o chile\n1/4 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves (from 1 bunch cilantro)\n\nDirections\nPreheat the oven to 500\u00b0F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange layers of chips, beans, pork, and cheese on a prepared baking sheet. Bake in a preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the chips are lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, stir together sour cream and lime juice in a small bowl. Set aside.\n\nRemove nachos from the oven; immediately sprinkle with avocado, tomato, corn, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro. Drizzle with sour cream mixture. Serve immediately.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/09/28/fantasy-football-start-em-sit-em-week-4/", "response": "```\nIt\u2019s only Week 4 of the NFL season and the script writers \u2014 err, I mean, officials \u2014 are already working overtime. Week 3 week featured some unique content with two scorigami\u2019s (a final score that has never happened before: this week it occurred in Miami and Tampa Bay with the final scores 70-20 and 25-11, respectively) to Taylor Swift making an appearance at Arrowhead with Travis Kelce\u2019s family. While the Travis Kelce-Taylor Swift saga is extremely interesting and taking the internet by storm, you\u2019re here for other reasons: to win your fantasy matchup this week.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at how I fared last week: The good: Unfortunately there wasn\u2019t much to be happy about from last week\u2019s picks aside from my quarterback predictions. Kirk Cousins and CJ Stroud balled out as predicted, both finishing in the top 10 for QBs last week. Joe Burrow continued his slow start to the season finishing with 8.16 fantasy points as the QB26. DeAndre Hopkins busted for the second week in a row, finishing as the WR61, and after making the list as a start last week, Michael Thomas underperformed against a tough Packers secondary, finishing as the WR40.\n\nThe bad: After sniping the tight end position in week 2, I airballed this past week. Hayden Hurst (who\u2019s value dropped substantially without Bryce Young) and Dalton Schultz alike had horrible showings, as both tight ends hauled in just one catch and finished outside the top 40 on the week. With tough matchups against the Cowboys and Titans, I thought that James Conner and Jerome Ford were destined to regress after big performances in Week 2, but they proved me wrong, both finishing as top 10 for RBs on the week. Finally, Drake London proved that he was a one-week-wonder against the Packers in Week 2 after scoring just 5.1 fantasy points against the Lions in Week 3. Zay Flowers and Elijah Moore \u2013 my other 2 starts at receiver \u2013 finished the week with pretty mid numbers, dropping 13 and 11.8 fantasy points, respectively.\n\nEnough dwelling on the past (well, if you still want to dwell, my full Week 3 results are posted at the bottom of the article). If you started 0-3 and need a bounce-back week (like me), that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. Even if you won last week, let\u2019s run hot and continue being victorious. After hours in the lab, here are my Week 4 Starts and Sits of the week, with a few snoozers who are primed for big weeks in case you need streaming options.\n\nQuarterback\nSTART: Joe Burrow (CIN) @ TEN\nAfter making this list as a sit and successfully hitting last week, Joe Burrow sees himself on the other end of the stick with a great matchup against the Titans this weekend, who gave up the fourth-most fantasy points per game (FPPG) to QBs last season and are bottom 10 again this year. With a favorable matchup this weekend, I expect Burrow to throw for multiple TDs and eclipse 16 fantasy points for the first time this season.\n\nSIT: Lamar Jackson (BAL) @ CLE\nThis Browns defense is legit. Through three games, the unit has allowed just one touchdown and has yet to defend from inside their own 10. That is pure domination, and I expect Lamar to struggle against a group that allowed the third-fewest FPPG to quarterbacks last season and the fewest this season. If you have another option at QB, I would strongly consider them over Lamar, who\u2019s struggled over his last three starts against the Browns, failing to reach a passer rating above 85.0 all three times.\n\nSnoozer: Matt Stafford (LAR) @ IND\nStafford has struggled in his last two outings, throwing two picks in both, yielding weak fantasy performances. But against a Colts defense that\u2019s allowed the fourth-most FPPG to quarterbacks this season and was bottom 12 last season, I anticipate Stafford and the Rams to bounce back after an ugly loss on Monday night to the Bengals. I expect Stafford to take better care of the ball in a fantasy-friendly matchup against the Colts, likely providing a top 15 finish for the veteran.\n\nRunning back\nSTART: Javonte Williams (DEN) @ CHI\nThis game is as ugly as it\u2019s going to get. Javonte Williams and the Broncos travel to Chicago after losing by 50 to face the Bears in a game fans are calling the Toilet Bowl. While it may seem silly to start the running back of a team that just lost by 50, Javonte Williams has the potential for a big game against the Bears \u2014 with a positive game script for the first time this year, I expect Williams to get fed, especially through the air where the Bears have allowed the second-most receiving yards per game to RBs this season.\n\nSIT: James Conner (ARI) vs SF\nAfter proving the doubters (me) wrong last week against Dallas with a top 10 running back performance, James Conner faces another extremely difficult rush attack against the 49ers on Sunday night, and I\u2019m willing to bet against him again this week. The Cardinals stunned the world by upsetting the undefeated Cowboys and after such a massive win, I expect regression against a 49ers team that makes very few mistakes behind Brock Purdy and mastermind HC Kyle Shanahan. The 49ers gave up the least FPPG to RBs last season and I expect that defense to shine against Conner and the Cardinals.\n\nSTART: Alexander Mattison (MIN) @ CAR\nAlexander Mattison fantasy owners must be relieved after he dropped more than 15 points for the first time all year last week and with a favorable matchup against the Panthers, I expect another big fantasy week from Mattison. While he has yet to reach the end zone on the ground this year, Mattison had four goal-line touches last game. He\u2019s getting the usage, so the touchdowns and volume will eventually come as well, and against the Panthers, who have given up the thirdmost FPPG to running backs this season, I anticipate Mattison reaching the end zone for a big fantasy performance, even with Cam Akers joining the squad.\n\nSIT: Rhamondre Stevenson (NE) @ DAL\nRhamondre Stevenson has been a very frustrating player in fantasy this season, splitting usage with Ezekiel Elliot, and against a very solid Dallas defense, Stevenson is destined for a dud. The Cowboys gave up the second fewest FPPG to opposing RB last season and are replicating that success this season, allowing the third fewest FPPG. Stevenson gets much of his success through the air, but he may have trouble with that this week as the Cowboys allow the fifth fewest receiving yards to running backs per game. Avoid the frustration and leave Stevenson on your bench this week.\n\nSnoozer: Matt Breida (NYG) vs SEA\nThis pick is contingent on Saquon Barkley\u2019s health, but if he is inactive for Monday night, feel confident slotting Breida in your lineup against a Seahawks team which gave up the fourth-most FPPG to running backs last season and are bottom 10 again this year. Breida played 82 percent of snaps in Week 3 and got three targets, proving he is the featured back while Saquon nurses his injury. With a positive matchup against the Seahawks, I\u2019d feel confident with Breida in my lineup if Saquon is hurt and you need a streamer option for the week.\n\nWide receiver\nSTART: Tutu Atwell (LAR) @ IND\nTutu Atwell has subtly dropped 15 points in every game this season, and with a great matchup against the Colts, I don\u2019t see anything changing this week. The Colts have allowed the seventh-most FPPG to opposing receivers this season and I anticipate a big bounce-back performance this week from the Rams offense, headlined by Atwell. The Bengals seemed to control Puka Nacua last week and I expect the Colts to try and do the same, yielding more targets for Atwell, who already gets eight targets a game as it is. The volume is there, and with a good game script against the Colts, expect a big game from Atwell.\n\nSIT: Marquise Brown (ARI) @ SF\nMarquise Brown has proved to be reliable in fantasy, dropping 17 points in each of the last two weeks, good enough to make him WR15 over that span. However, Brown is getting much of his production from the long ball, scoring two touchdowns over that span as well. The 49ers have yet to allow a receiver to reach the end zone this season and I don\u2019t anticipate Brown changing that on Sunday \u2013 and if Brown doesn\u2019t reach the endzone, his fantasy value decreases substantially. I foresee regression from both the Cardinals offense and Brown this game against a lethal 49ers defense.\n\nSTART: Jakobi Meyers (LV) @ LAC\nThe Raiders need to figure things out after losing last week\u2019s contest to the Steelers thanks in part to a coaching blunder from Josh McDaniels. Josh Jacobs looks like a shell of his former self, yet the Raiders offense still looks somewhat efficient behind Jimmy Garoppolo and Davante Adams. But one player is getting overshadowed in this offense, and that\u2019s Jakobi Meyers. Meyers has seen double-digit targets in both games he\u2019s played in this season, and with the Chargers defense likely draped over Adams the entire game, I expect a big day from Meyers against a team that has allowed the most FPPG to opposing receivers this season.\n\nSIT: Garrett Wilson (NYJ) vs. KC\nThis one is simple: I can\u2019t trust anyone on the Jets with Zach Wilson under center. Wilson has put together three decent fantasy weeks thus far, but he got carried the first two weeks behind receiving touchdowns. With the Chiefs defense giving up the sixthfewest FPPG to opposing receivers this season, I anticipate another dry day from the Jets offense and more frustration from Garrett Wilson on the sideline.\n\nSnoozer: Tank Dell (HOU) vs. PIT\nThe rookie from Houston University is turning heads these past two weeks and his potential is only increasing. Tank Dell has led the Texans in targets since Week 1 \u2013 cumulating more than 20 FPPG, enough to make him WR7 over that span, better than the likes of Ceedee Lamb, JaMarr Chase and Amon-Ra St. Brown. Houston has proven they trust CJ Stroud to throw the ball, and as that continues, Dell\u2019s fantasy ceiling is only going to rise. Facing the Steelers, who have allowed the fifth-most FPPG to opposing receivers this season, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Dell puts up another 20-piece.\n\nTight End\nSTART: Evan Engram (JAX) vs ATL\nThe Jaguars have looked underwhelming to start the season and will look to get back on track overseas in London against the Falcons. Inheriting London soil as home turf, the Jaguars host the Falcons who were bottom 10 in FPPG allowed to opposing tight ends last season and are fourth-worst to open this season. With Evan Engram already having success in London, scoring a touchdown with 55 yards last season, I anticipate another big game from the tight end as the Jaguars aim to get back to .500.\n\nSIT: David Njoku (CLE) vs BAL\nThe Ravens have silenced opposing tight ends so far this season, allowing just 4.2 FPPG. While this is only a three game sample, the Ravens were top 10 in fewest FPPG allowed to opposing tight ends last season as well, proving their success against the tight end position is no fluke. Njoku has only had 11 targets in three games this season and with a difficult matchup against the Ravens, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Njoku took a step back this week.\n\nSnoozer: Luke Musgrave (GB) vs DET\nThis might be my favorite pick of the week. In just his fourth week as a rookie, Musgrave is already second on the team in targets, running 86 percent of tight end routes. His upside is going to start coming, and against a Lions defense which allows 12 targets per game and the most FPPG to opposing tight ends this season, I anticipate this being the game that puts Luke Musgrave on the fantasy map.\n\nWeek 3 Results\nQB Start: Kirk Cousins (25.68, QB5)\nSit: Joe Burrow (8.16, QB26)\nSnoozer: CJ Stroud (20.6, QB10)\nRB Start: Isiah Pacheco (15.8, RB12)\nSit: James Conner (19.6, RB6)\nStart: Breece Hall (3.7, RB54)\nSit: Jerome Ford (19.1, RB7)\nSnoozer: Jaylen Warren (8.2, RB29)\nWR Start: Zay Flowers (13.0 WR35)\nSit: Michael Thomas (11.0, WR40)\nStart: Drake London (5.1, WR79)\nSit: DeAndre Hopkins (7.8, WR61)\nSnoozer: Elijah Moore (11.8, WR37)\nTE Start: Hayden Hurst (2.1, TE43)\nSit: Kyle Pitts (8.7, TE15)\nSnoozer: Dalton Schultz (1.9, TE49)\n```"}

The assignment? The second Republican Presidential Debate for 2024, where seven GOP candidates will battle it out for the chance to become Commander-in-chief of the United States of America.\n\nAt around 2:30, we arrived at media parking, where we pulled our cars into a field of wood chips in a local park. We picked up our credentials and took a shuttle to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library where the debate was scheduled to happen over rolling hills. Past the security check point, media was directed to a large tent, where more than a hundred journalists would sit to watch the debate live on screen. Aside from our one photographer, none of us really saw the stage up close.\n\nBecause passes into both the media tent and spin room were sparse for our abnormally large group, we took turns going in and out, passing lanyard cards, before we ventured off on our own. I had a notebook in my right breast pocket and a mask in my left. In my front suit pockets sat a pair of pens, sunglasses, and a portable charger. I held a recording device in one hand and a microphone in the other with headphones around my neck. Indeed, getting through those security checkpoints felt like pulling scarves out of a clown\u2019s sleeve.\n\nI headed to the front of the library where Ronald Reagan\u2019s face decorated massive banners that hung around the entrance. A line of attendees trailed through the audience, showcasing the wide range of viewers for the night\u2019s festivities. Some were advocates, like LIBRE Initiative CEO Jose Mallea. His organization was sponsoring Univision, one of the hosts of the night\u2019s debate, and looks to support Latino households struggling financially. He said that he was hopeful for all the candidates who took the stage that night.\n\nJose Mallea: We currently have an ad that\u2019s running that\u2019s talking about the economic crisis in this country and how it\u2019s adversely affecting the Latino community, the negative policies of the Biden administration, inflation and all these other things that are hitting Latino households. And we believe it is working to try to change that... We want to hear from them what their perspectives are on the economy, especially as it pertains to how they\u2019re going to try to help the Latino community get through these difficult times.\n\nThere were even students attending the debate. Christopher G. is a student at the College of the Canyons. To him the event was an opportunity to see democracy in action.\n\nChristopher G.: I\u2019m just really excited to see what future leader we could have in this country. You know just to see it live. I think it\u2019s a better experience. And you get to take it all in and it\u2019s a lot. I went to the one in Wisconsin actually last month. So, it\u2019s just the energy and just hearing everybody, it\u2019s a lot cooler and I think a better experience than watching it on TV.\n\nAt 5:15, I waited for a call into our studio, ready for a live radio report from the scene. As I was scrolling through Twitter, I saw a tweet that Governor Gavin Newsom was down in the spin room as a proxy for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign. With a minute before show, I knew I couldn\u2019t make it myself, so I sent a note to our team so that someone was there to get the story.\n\nFollowing a successful live report, it was time for the debate, at least with a few minutes to spare. A pair of young high school journalists were covering the debate and approached me, asking if I can do an interview to speak on my experience as a student journalist. With the many professional journalists at the debate excited to speak to students, I was not expecting to be treated as one myself.\n\nAt 6:00, the debate kicked off, and we were once again introduced to the \u201ccharacters\u201d of tonight\u2019s television. The underdog outsider Ramaswamy, the charismatic showman DeSantis, the seasoned veteran Pence. Our team went to work. I recorded key moments and caught quotes as our politics editor updated our live feed. Moments like Haley\u2019s roast to Ramaswamy drew laughter from journalists in the tent. The debate was \u201cgood television\u201d as some would describe. It was theatrical and featured seven candidates who fit unique TV archetypes. There was even a \u201cSurvivor\u201d reference, on the same day as the premiere of the reality show\u2019s 45th season.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s absence was pointed out immediately, with Chris Christie once again taking aim at the former president. They talked border control, the fentanyl crisis, education and the U.S.\u2019s relationship with China, but the chance to get up close to the candidates and their campaign came after the show.\n\nIn the spin room, journalists clamored to get as close to the divider as possible for a potential interview with candidates. Annenberg Media spoke to Ken Cuccinelli, who represented the DeSantis campaign in the spin room, and we questioned DeSantis\u2019 approach, including the issues of student loans.\n\nKen Cuccinelli: He doesn\u2019t plan on getting it by bribing them like Joe Biden attempted going into the midterms... He has done what some conservatives didn\u2019t think was possible in reining in higher education, and that is something that as long as the Department of Education exists at the federal level, he can do there too, and he\u2019s committed to doing that. So, for both to clean out the indoctrination and turn it back to education and also to stop putting money into loans, subsidizing do-nothing degrees.\n\nMany of the candidates themselves made appearances to spin the media. This included Vivek Ramaswamy who believes his unique background is what can lead a new generation of Americans.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: One of my focuses tonight is if we want to reunite this country, we have to reunite the Republican Party first... Young people, I think, will care more about this country if we all have more skin in the game. And I think it\u2019s my responsibility, frankly, as the youngest person ever to be president, if and when I\u2019m elected, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be is to reach the next generation.\n\nAs radio journalists, we get the chance to talk with people we might not normally meet, and even in a sea of people, we can find a voice. But beyond the chaos of the spin room, attendees were trickling out of the event. We caught Tudy Trgovac as she was walking out, and although she came in support of Ramaswamy, the debate completely changed her perspective.\n\nTudy Trgovac: I\u2019m undecided now. Came to support Vivek Ramaswamy, but I\u2019m not sure now... Ron DeSantis and Haley. But I like Doug, and I don\u2019t think they gave him enough time to talk... But as far as Pence goes, he was a yawn. I just felt like he was old establishment... I like the candidate who answered the question, first of all. And second of all, that they got to the meat of that of the problem and didn\u2019t skirt it.\n\nWith the debate\u2019s dramatics, it seems to have made an impact on the people looking for a new presidential leader. If you missed this debate, whether it be on TV or in person, the next one will be on November 8 in Miami.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Ethan Huang.\n```"}

You know, we have the jerseys. We we have a cheesehead. My roommate\u2019s a big Green Bay fan, so. Yeah. So it\u2019s all in the heart.\n\nKaleb Manske has the team in his heart, and wallet. He\u2019s a videographer for the USC football team. Manske studies film and television production and will be with the team on their early morning flight. And his pregame will be very different from other students. Kaleb Manske: I mean, considering the game is at nine in the morning, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be drinking before that. Plus, I probably shouldn\u2019t go to work while I\u2019m drunk. Yeah, you don\u2019t want to fall asleep on the job. It\u2019s hard enough to wake up before nine for the game.\n\nCourtney Woloson: I don\u2019t even wake up that early for class. So this is going to be a marathon for sure. That\u2019s Courtney Woloson. She is a senior studying Philosophy, Politics, and Law. Despite still not having a ticket to the actual game, she\u2019ll fly to Boulder tomorrow morning and Woloson is determined to make it to all of the pre-game festivities. Courtney Woloson: I\u2019m not even sure what to expect. I don\u2019t know what time we\u2019ll be rolling out of the house and going to tailgates, but I could imagine that it\u2019s around, you know, seven or eight in the morning, which is aggressive.\n\nAggression is what we want to see from the Trojans on the field. Let\u2019s hope the football players can also be awake at 9 am. For Annenberg Media, I am Sana Mahmud.\n```"}

USC hosting PrideFest in October allows a larger-scale celebration of the LGBTQ+ community and history amongst students.\n\nIn 1994, Missouri high school teacher Rodney Wilson founded LGBTQ+ History Month, formerly known as Lesbian and Gay History Month. October was formally recognized as a month dedicated to LGBTQ+ history in 1955.\n\nMel Persell, a senior majoring in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, is the assistant director of the USC Queer and Ally Student Assembly (QuASA). Persell has been organizing this year\u2019s PrideFest celebration since July.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s really significant that we\u2019re even able to have this kind of event,\u201d they said. \u201cI think that these events are important, because it allows queer people to build community, and it just shows, \u2018Hey, no one is ashamed of being gay at this event.\u2019\u201d\n\nSophomore Joshua Moray Grossmam, whose artist name is Moray, will be performing at PrideFest. Grossman has never attended USC\u2019s PrideFest and said he is looking forward to it this year.\n\n\u201cI think the university provides some really wonderful resources for the LGBT community, and I\u2019m very grateful that they\u2019re putting on PrideFest in collaboration with QuASA and that we\u2019re able to have a day celebrating pride,\u201d he said.\n\nJunior design major Saneel Sharma, also known as Rae Oblivion, performed at last year\u2019s PrideFest. She said the event provided \u201canother opportunity for me to have my space on the stage and really allow my drag and my heart to show through.\u201d\n\nThis year, Sharma will be the host rather than a performer. Sharma said she was looking forward to her role as master of ceremonies, since it will allow her to have an even bigger impact on the atmosphere of PrideFest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of being the personality on stage and being almost in charge of the entire vibe of PrideFest,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the person people will hear the most on the mic.

Some of the performers include Will Domke, Will Yeaman, and Ella Mayo. Student vendors include Charlie Ravesloot, selling crochet designs, Diana Lucifera, a tarot card reader, and Manasa Sundaram, selling prints.\n\n\u201cI would hope to see more outside careers organizations being part of the process,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cJust to allow and have PrideFest to be a true festival-type setting where we have other organizations that are willing to help and provide information and look out for students.\u201d\n```"}

Nestled within Mercado la Paloma, on the other side of the 110 Freeway from USC, this James Beard nominated and Michelin Guide rated restaurant offers affordable Mexican seafood within the Fryft zone. But despite its many accolades, including being named the 2023 restaurant of the year by the Los Angeles Times, it remains relatively unknown to students.\n\n\u201cHolbox? Sounds familiar, but I don\u2019t think I have been,\u201d said Ryan Liddy, a freshman vocal arts major. \u201cIs it around here?\u201d\n\nNear the front of the mercado, Chef Gilberto Cetina opened Holbox in 2017 and has dedicated himself to recreating the flavors of coastal Mexican cuisine with classic Southern California ingredients. \u201cWe only use seasonal ingredients, and we try to use local stuff,\u201d manager Conrad Riviera said. \u201cWe also bring stuff from Mexico to keep it interesting.\u201d\n\nCetina received all his culinary training at Mercado la Paloma working at his parents\u2019 Yucatec\u00e1n restaurant, Chichen Itza, where he experimented with seafood dishes and became inspired to start his own restaurant. \u201cWhen we first started, six or seven years ago, it was a family-run business,\u201d Riviera said. \u201cThere were only four of us, and it wasn\u2019t our ambition to become the thing that it is today, but it makes us proud, makes us work even harder. It\u2019s a good place to work at.\u201d\n\nHolbox offers up unique menu items ranging from blood clams with smokey morita sauce to crispy battered rockfish tacos. Senior Elise Murguia, a health promotion and disease prevention major, said she thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant, recommending the yellowtail tostada and sparkling lemonade. \u201cThe staff was really friendly and recognized us the second time we came in,\u201d she said. \u201cHolbox is pretty affordable and a close drive. It\u2019s such an easy, convenient place to go, and you get amazing, beautifully presented food.\u201d\n\nDrew Limp, a freshman business major, said he was eager to try out the restaurant. \u201cI haven\u2019t had real Mexican seafood out here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard they\u2019ve got some very interesting types of seafood tacos like a sea urchin taco.

He, too, agrees that the sea urchin is an entirely different animal. \u201cWe bring them in from Santa Barbara,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a live urchin. We crack it open into two halves, and then we stuff it with scallop ceviche. On top of the ceviche we put the uni that\u2019s inside of the urchin.

The Cinematic and Box Office Achievement Award is similar to the Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film award that was introduced \u2014 and quickly withdrawn \u2014 from the Oscars in 2018, due to complaints from Academy members and the media.\n\nBillboard reported that many believed the award \u201cappeared to be a transparent attempt to pander to mainstream audiences in an effort to boost the ratings of the annual telecast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new Cinematic and Box Office Achievement award is more than just rewarding the year\u2019s top-earning and most viewed motion pictures,\u201d said Tim Gray, Golden Globes Executive Vice President, in a statement. \u201cThese films have typically not been recognized among industry awards, but they should be.\u201d\n\nThere will be a total of eight nominees for the Cinematic and Box Office Achievement Award. Eligibility requires motion pictures to have a total gross of at least $150 million, with $100 million of that coming from the U.S. domestic box office.\n\nThe Best Stand-up Comedian category \u201cgives standups a dedicated award for an individual performance or as part of a comedy group/ensemble,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Golden Globes has a rich history of supporting and celebrating the work of comedians, and we\u2019re thrilled to honor their brilliance alongside outstanding motion picture and television performances of the year,\u201d Golden Globes President Helen Hoehn said in a statement.\n\nThe stand-up comedy category will have six nominees. In order to be eligible, a performer or performers must have released a traditional stand-up comedy performance that is at least 30 minutes long and first aired in the U.S. by broadcast, basic or premium cable, streaming or pay-per-view cable during the nomination period. The specials must be separate from a television series role and must be released on a recognized media platform that does not include social media accounts, according to the Golden Globe Awards.\n\n\u201cGiving a chance for stand-up comedians to have more of an audience is what we need nowadays,\u201d said Sophie Wells, president of the Shenanigans Comedy Club at UCLA. \u201cI hope that by this category inclusion, it will hopefully gain traction again.\u201d\n\nJunior Josh Morton, a theater major with an emphasis in comedy performance, said the Golden Globes took a good step in introducing comedy to a broader audience, though he wasn\u2019t sure adding the new stand-up category was the best option.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to them, I don\u2019t know if stand-up comedy is the most accessible form of comedy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that, at times, stand-up can be a bit off-putting if done poorly. I think if you want for me, you know, to encourage people to do comedy, stand-up is not the avenue for that.\u201d\n\nThe inaugural winners of the new categories will be revealed live at the 81st Golden Globe Awards scheduled for Jan. 7, 2024.\n```"}

(Photo by Luis Barrio)\n\nBy Patrick O'Leary September 28, 2023 at 4:14 pm PDT\n\nAfter last week\u2019s road game against Arizona State, undefeated USC now turns its attention to Deion Sanders and the electric 3-1 Colorado Buffaloes. USC enters the matchup brimming with confidence, favored by a staggering 21.5 points. The burning question is whether the Buffaloes can stay in the game and keep pace with USC\u2019s high-powered offense. The answer to this question lies within the red zone, where both teams\u2019 fortunes could be decided.\n\nColorado\u2019s defense has had its fair share of struggles, with opponents putting up 30 or more points in three of its last four matchups. However, the Buffaloes boast a defense that ranks in the top 20 in the FBS in red zone scoring percentage.\n\nWhen asked after practice on Wednesday about the keys to the Trojans converting their red zone trips to points this week, star junior quarterback Caleb Williams preached physicality and consistency. Additionally, he emphasized the importance of the Trojans playing as a cohesive unit near the goal line.\n\nWhen asked about Colorado\u2019s secondary, senior wide receiver Brenden Rice praised the technical soundness of the group. He said that to secure a victory, the Trojans would have to match Colorado\u2019s meticulous attention to detail.\n\nThis emphasis on effective red zone execution is evident through USC\u2019s play, as it has scored touchdowns on all but three of their trips inside the 20 to boast an impressive 84% touchdown conversion rate on red zone trips. Additionally, USC has averaged almost 30 points a game in the red zone, an impressive feat. To put the stat into perspective, if you were to categorize the Trojans\u2019 red zone offense as a separate FBS school, they would still be ranked in the top 50 for scoring average this season.\n\nOn the flip side, Heisman hopeful Shedeur Sanders and Colorado\u2019s offense hope to continue their elite play against the Trojans this week. Their offense \u2014 which averages over 30 points per game \u2014 is lethal on every portion of the field, but their greatest strength lies in the red zone. Over the past four weeks, the Buffalo\u2019s offense has put points on the board to conclude every one of their red zone trips.\n\nConversely, USC\u2019s defense has struggled in the red zone, allowing opponents to score in all but one trip. However, the Trojans\u2019 defense has managed to keep opposing teams out of the red zone, allowing just over two trips a game inside the 20 for their opponents. This has allowed the Trojan offense to more than double their opponents\u2019 red zone production.\n\nWhen asked after practice on Wednesday about how USC can combat Colorado\u2019s efficiency, especially in the red zone, junior safety Calen Bullock emphasized the need for USC to stick to their defensive game plan. He stressed that for the defense to excel on Saturday, everyone must execute their assignments and trust their teammates to do the same.\n\nThe Trojans should feel confident as they travel to Boulder. There is a reason they are three-touchdown favorites. However, USC must remain vigilant of Colorado\u2019s red zone prowess. Colorado\u2019s path to competitiveness lies within the 20, and if USC can limit the Buffaloes\u2019 efficiency in those crucial areas, the Trojans will more than likely cover the spread. Conversely, if USC falters within the red zone, this game could become a captivating contest.\n\nThis matchup will serve as the first significant test for the Trojans, as they face a team with multiple wins for the first time this year. However, USC is more than capable of rising to the challenge. The question is will they? Tune in on Saturday at 9 a.m. PST to find out.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Yang)\n\nBy nikki thomas September 26, 2023 at 11:32 am PDT\n\nIt\u2019s been just over six months since the USC men\u2019s basketball team was in the NCAA Tournament, when it snatched a 10-seed in the East Region before ultimately falling 72-62 to 7-seed Michigan State in the first round. The three returning starters from that team are setting the pace as the Trojans returned to official practice for the upcoming season on Monday. Fifth-year senior guard Boogie Ellis, junior guard Kobe Johnson and redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan all played in that tournament, and they understand the high expectations that accompany the season to come.\n\n\u201cI think the college basketball world is gonna expect a lot from us,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe definitely have a big chip on our shoulders.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 2022-2023 (22-11, 14-6 Pac-12) season was their third straight season making an NCAA Tournament run under the tutelage of head coach Andy Enfield. Enfield has held the position since 2013 and has had an exceptional offseason recruiting new players for USC. His 2023 freshman class includes guard Isaiah Collier, forward Brandon Gardner, guard Bronny James and forward Arrinten Page. Collier was 2023\u2032s No. 1 recruit in the nation while James was ranked No. 19, according to ESPN.\n\nThis off-season, the Trojans also recruited graduate forward DJ Rodman, who played at Washington State during his undergraduate years.\n\n\u201cI was tired of losing,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cI wanted to spend my last year here and win.\u201d\n\nThe veteran Trojans are happy for the help from new recruits; they tied for second in the Pac-12 last season and are looking to make waves in this last season before moving to the Big Ten. Given USC\u2019s electric freshman class, upperclassmen will likely play an important leadership role for the team this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great when you see Boogie Ellis and Isaiah Collier working out every morning at 6 or 7 a.m. together, and Arrinten Page working out with Kobe Johnson,\u201d Enfield commented on the team\u2019s mentorship dynamics. \u201cTo have great leadership and mentorship, you need strong upperclassmen, which we have with Josh Morgan and Kobe Johnson and DJ Rodman ... Boogie Ellis was first-team All-Conference last year, and his leadership skills have increased tremendously.\u201d\n\nEllis and other experienced vets will be a key component of USC\u2019s success, and they\u2019re not backing down from the challenge. This summer, the squad took home the sweep in a 3-game exhibition tour to Greece and Croatia; Ellis was an important part of the USC victories there, and he looks forward to becoming an even better mentor this season.\n\n\u201cThis year I can do a great job of leading the young guys and just being that guy who never panics,\u201d Ellis remarked. \u201cThey can count on me.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have made some changes since they last played in March, but they appear poised and ready for the year ahead. Building on a unique blend of youth and experience, USC may be the hottest ticket in college basketball this season. Pac-12 play won\u2019t start until later in the season, but there are plenty of opportunities to catch the Trojans in action at the Galen Center this fall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re catching our footing, and off the court we\u2019re becoming more of a team,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot farther than I thought we would be at this point.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 season kicks off with the 2023 Hall of Fame Series on November 6 at 7 p.m, when they take on Kansas State at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n```"}

With the Dodgers clinching the NL West division, pitching becomes the topic of discussion heading into the postseason. The Dodgers currently have 11 pitchers listed on the injured list (IL), starting with right-hand pitcher Walker Buehler who is still rehabbing after his second procedure towards reconstructing his ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow in August 2022. Right-hand pitcher Dustin May was put on the IL on July 19 and underwent right flexor tendon and UCL reconstruction surgery that ruled him out for the year. Right-hand pitcher Tony Gonsolin hurt his elbow and was put on the IL on Aug. 23 then received Tommy John surgery. And right-hander Blake Trinen is currently on a rehab assignment for his shoulder with Triple-A Oklahoma City.\n\nEven with all of the injuries and new additions, the Dodgers still have veteran pitching and returners in the bullpen. After dealing with a left shoulder injury earlier in the season, Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw started in 22 games, pitching 121.1 innings and recording a 2.52 ERA. Along with Kershaw, the Dodgers still utilize veteran bullpen pitchers Caleb Ferguson, Alex Vesia, Brusdar Graterol and closer Evan Phillips.\n\nBack on July 28, 2023, the Dodgers acquired veteran pitchers Lance Lynn and Joe Kelly before the trade deadline. Lynn has become one of the Dodgers starting pitchers, with a 6-2 record through 58 innings pitched. With eight starting appearances, Lynn recorded a 4.50 ERA with 43 strikeouts. Lynn currently sits as the Dodgers\u2019 day-two starter. Kelly was activated from the 15-day IL last Wednesday after dealing with right forearm inflammation. Kelly recorded a 2.16 ERA with 16 strikeouts on a 1-0 record through 8.1 innings pitched.\n\nAfter three seasons in the Dodgers Minor League organization, right-hand pitcher Bobby Miller has stepped into the Dodgers starting rotation. In his 2023 campaign, Miller has pitched 113.1 innings and currently has a 3.97 ERA. Miller has a 10-4 record, starting 20 games and striking out 106 batters. Miller has a five-pitch arsenal consisting of a four-seam fastball, sinker, slider, changeup and curveball. His fastball has an average velocity of 99.1 MPH, which ranks eighth amongst all pitchers across the league for the highest average four-seam fastball velocity. Miller currently sits as the Dodgers day-three starter.\n\nThe Dodgers day four starter, Ryan Pepiot, has been up and down for the organization, pitching 36 innings for the Dodgers in 2022 and then getting optioned to Triple-A during the 2023 season. After getting called back up on Aug. 30, the righty has 33 innings pitched with a 1.91 ERA. Pepiot has appeared in six games for the Dodgers, three being starts, and has struck out 26 opposing batters. Pepiot holds a three-pitch arsenal consisting of a four-seam fastball, a changeup and a slider.\n\nThe Dodgers look to right-hand pitcher Gavin Stone to be the club\u2019s potential day-five starter. Stone was optioned down to Triple-A back on May 30 before receiving the call back up to the Dodgers on July 3. Stone has appeared in eight games for the Dodgers, starting four. Stone has a 1-1 record pitching in 31 innings, striking out 22 opposing batters. Stone has a 9.00 ERA but still manages to maneuver through opponents with his six-pitch repertoire. With an average fastball velocity of 94 MPH, he caters to his fastball by resorting to his go-to pitch, the changeup.\n\nAnother potential option for the Dodger\u2019s fifth starting pitcher spot would be Emmett Sheehan. Sheehan was called up from Double-A Tulsa on June 16 to make his Dodger debut. After eight games, with seven of those games being starts, the Dodgers sent Sheehan down to Triple-A on Aug. 3. On Sep. 1, the Dodgers called Sheehan back up from Triple-A. After being called up, Sheehan appeared in four more games, adding three more starts. Sheehan has accumulated 54.1 innings pitched over the 2023 season. With an ERA of 5.13, Sheehan has a 3-1 record with 54 strikeouts. Sheehan\u2019s arsenal consists of a four-seam fastball, slider, changeup and sweeper.\n\nIn the bullpen, the Dodgers acquired right-hand pitcher Ryan Brasier from the Boston Red Sox. After appearing in 20 games for the Red Sox and being released, Brasier signed a contract with the Dodgers on June 4 that would send him to the Dodgers Triple-A team in Oklahoma City. After two appearances, the Dodgers called up Brasier on June 20. In 37 appearances and 36.2 innings pitched, Brasier has a 2-0 record with a 0.74 ERA. Along with the recent transactions, the Dodgers have also utilized relief pitchers Ryan Yarbrough and Shelby Miller. Yarbrough was acquired by the Dodgers from the Kansas City Royals on Aug. 1. With 10 appearances and 34.2 innings pitched, Yarbrough has a 4-1 record with a 3.12 ERA. Miller has appeared in 35 games for the Dodgers. Through 40 innings pitched, he has a 3-0 record with a 1.80 ERA. The Dodgers\u2019 most recent call-up, former Trojan Kyle Hurt, has one appearance in the season during last week\u2019s San Diego Padres series. Hurt pitched two innings, striking out three batters and giving up no hits.\n```"}

Week 4 was an important milestone in the Pac-12 season, as each team has now had at least one opportunity to showcase themselves against another conference opponent. Considering that five of the six Pac-12 matchups this week featured at least one ranked team, and half of those six were ranked vs. ranked games, this week of games were elevated in importance for most of these teams compared to the non-conference bouts. Non-conference r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are often difficult to compare, and this week gave a great deal of clarity of the teams that proved to be elite and those that are just pretenders.\n\n1. Washington Huskies (4-0, 1-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nFour weeks into the season, Washington is the only team in this conference to win all of its games in blowout fashion. With Michael Penix Jr. under center, this is already one of the toughest offenses to slow down in the country. The task of beating the Huskies is made only tougher when they build a 14-0 lead before their first offensive snap, which is what happened on Saturday night against Cal. Washington allowed over 30 points to Cal, which may not look great on paper, but this was a 52-12 game in the third quarter before head coach Kalen DeBoer pulled his starting quarterback and called off the dogs. The Huskies\u2019 defense recorded three interceptions and is currently tied with Colorado for the most picks in the conference with seven. With Rome Odunze, Ja\u2019Lynn Polk and Jalen McMilan, three of the top five receivers in the Pac-12 in yards per game are on the same roster with one of the sport\u2019s elite quarterbacks. The Huskies are 4-0, averaging almost 50 points per game and winning by an average of more than 32 points. If that r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn\u2019t make you the top dog in your conference, I don\u2019t know what does.\n\n2. Oregon Ducks (4-0, 1-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nOregon had one goal in welcoming Colorado to Eugene on Saturday: flex the strength of its program to an enormous television audience. After a domination of the Buffaloes on all three sides of the ball, that mission was accomplished. Offensively, the Ducks continue to show great balance, both throwing and running for well over 200 yards. Bo Nix threw three touchdown passes and just four incompletions in a continuation of the best season of his collegiate career. Defensively, they held former Heisman dark horse Shadeaur Sanders to a 28.2 QBR, allowed less than two yards per carry and recorded seven sacks. Dan Lanning is only in his second season ever as a head coach, but I have to commend him for the job he did motivating his team over the course of the week. He had Oregon playing like they were the underdogs with everything to prove. In a sport that rewards perception above all else, the Ducks will benefit greatly from their 42-6 statement win.\n\n3. USC Trojans (4-0, 2-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nBetween the 12 games that my top three teams have played this season, USC\u2019s 42-28 win over Arizona State is the most concerning. The Trojans lost nearly 100 yards in penalties on Saturday night and seemed shell shocked by a sold-out crowd in Tempe. Colorado, Notre Dame and Oregon will all be even tougher atmospheres than Mountain America Stadium, so Lincoln Riley will need to spend serious time fixing his team\u2019s procedural issues. Caleb Williams recorded five total touchdowns but did not look like himself for much of this game. He had a tougher time creating plays outside of the pocket than usual, and USC\u2019s offense really struggled to score in the red zone. Defensively, the Trojans may have given fans flashbacks to the Pac-12 Championship Game last year with some very poor tackling that led to big plays and touchdowns for the Sun Devils. Despite all the issues USC had on both sides of the ball, its immense amount of talent covered up a lot of them. That is why the offense still scored over 40 points and the defense recorded eight sacks and two turnovers. USC has the personnel to be ranked above either of my top two teams, but Washington and Oregon are playing sharper football at the moment.\n\n4. Utah Utes (4-0, 1-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nKyle Whittingham and Utah\u2019s defense deserve all the credit in the world for what they\u2019ve done considering their quarterback situation. Nate Johnson completed just nine passes on Saturday afternoon and the Utes scored one offensive touchdown; they still took down a ranked UCLA team. Utah has the sixth-best scoring defense in the country and is the only team in the conference allowing less than 10 points per game. The team completely flustered true freshman Dante Moore while holding the Bruins vaunted rushing attack to nine total yards. As elite as this defense has been so far, I still do not believe it is good enough to take down any of my top three teams on its own. There will continue to be a sizable gap between three and four in these rankings for as long as Nate Johnson plays, but \u2014 if it is still undefeated when Cam Rising comes back \u2014 Utah will have a great chance to win this conference.\n\n5. Washington State Cougars (4-0, 1-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nCaleb Williams, Bo Nix and Michael Penix rightfully get a lot of attention, but no conversation about the Pac-12\u2032s wealth of elite quarterback play would be complete without junior Cam Ward. Saturday\u2019s game may have been Ward\u2019s signature game in a Washington State uniform; he threw for over 400 yards and four touchdowns in a huge home win over Oregon State. The Cougars continue to be somewhat overlooked by some of the teams above them, but they have now taken down two ranked opponents this season, the most of any team in the Pac-12. If I had to nitpick this team, I would say that they are not as balanced offensively between the run game and the passing game as many of the teams above them, which is part of the reason the Beavers got back into the game late. They also are 10th in the conference in red zone scoring percentage. Those two factors could really come back to hurt WSU in matchups against the top tier of this conference.\n\n6. Oregon State Beavers (3-1, 0-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nSaturday\u2019s matchup against Washington State was the first one where Oregon State\u2019s opponent had a clear quarterback edge, and it showed. While Ward lit the scoreboard up every time he touched the ball, DJ Uiagalelei only completed half his passes and failed to eclipse 200 yards. The defense performed serviceably against the run but only recorded one sack, which is a significant underperformance. The Beavers will also need to do a much better job defending explosive plays after allowing five passes of over 20 yards to the Cougars. Opponents like Oregon and Washington will have even more offensive firepower than Oregon State saw in its last game, so it will either need to create more chunk plays of its own behind Uiagalelei, or stop giving them up on defense.\n\n7. UCLA Bruins (3-1, 0-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nAfter three non-conference home games against non-Power Five opponents, a road game at Rice-Eccles Stadium was Dante Moore\u2019s first acid test as a college quarterback. Moore completed less than half his pass attempts and threw a pick six on the first play from scrimmage that Utah couldn\u2019t have won the game without. The Bruins have leaned on their running game in the past to make up for their inexperience at signal-caller, but mustered less than half a yard per carry in this contest. The formula to take down UCLA is clear: tee off on its rushing attack and wait for its true freshman quarterback to make a true freshman mistake. Moore did not become a five-star recruit without talent, and, over time, he will learn to handle difficult road environments. However, until that day comes, the Bruins will be hard-pressed to win many games in this conference.\n\n8. Colorado Buffaloes (3-1, 0-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nThe first three games of the season were a magic carpet ride for Deion Sanders, but after a 42-6 drubbing in Eugene, the Buffaloes have officially come back down to earth. Against a top-10 opponent, all the weaknesses Colorado has shown thus far were exploited over, and over, and over again. Colorado had shown weakness on the offensive line, and Shedeur Sanders was sacked seven times. It had struggled to run the ball effectively, as the Buffaloes only mustered 40 yards on the ground. The defense had been allowing too many yards with Travis Hunter in the lineup and the Ducks put up 35 points in the first half without him. This performance was not a one-off either, as USC has the talent at wide receiver and defensive line to do exactly what Oregon did next week. The Buffaloes have been a great story, and tripling their 2022 win total in one month is impressive, regardless of opponent. However, this team has too many weaknesses in year one of their rebuild to compete with the top half of this conference.\n\n9. Arizona Wildcats (3-1, 1-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nSo far this year, turnovers have been Arizona\u2019s biggest problem, so playing a zero-turnover game against Stanford is a major positive. A negative is that their starting quarterback went down to injury in the second half of this game. I will give credit to backup Noah Fifita, who did not throw an incompletion in relief of Jayden de Laura and led a game winning touchdown drive in the fourth quarter. The Wildcats run the ball effectively, ranking fourth in the conference in yards per carry. Saturday was also an encouraging day for Jedd Fisch\u2019s defense, which recorded five sacks after getting just one in its first three games. If Arizona wants to compete against the class of the Pac-12 moving forward, affecting the elite quarterbacks they are going to face will be an important step.\n\n10. Cal Golden Bears (2-2, 0-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nCal had a decent showing in its non-conference portion of the season, but its conference opener on Saturday night in Seattle was a buzzsaw for this program. It was abundantly clear that this team\u2019s secondary is not nearly ready enough to compete with the elite pass-catching units across the Pac-12. The Golden Bears only made matters worse for themselves with costly mistakes on offense and special teams, allowing a pick six and a punt return touchdown before their defense even took the field. The offense showed some good fight with some solid possessions in garbage time, but those mistakes need to be corrected if they do not want to continue to be embarrassed moving forward.\n\n11. Stanford Cardinal (1-3, 0-2 Pac-12) \nGive Stanford credit where it is due for not packing in the season after a home loss to Sacramento State. Arizona is not an elite team, but there was real concern that Troy Taylor\u2019s group would fail to keep it close against any opponent. Only losing by a point is a step in a better direction for the Cardinal. At the same time, Stanford should have been able to turn Jayden de Laura over at least once in this game, and it only forced three tackles for loss. Additionally, Benjamin Yurosek is the best offensive weapon for the Cardinal, and he needs to finish a game with more than two catches. The Cardinal showed some good heart on Saturday, but that doesn\u2019t change their ultimate season outlook as a bottom-tier team in this conference.\n\n12. Arizona State Sun Devils (1-3, 0-1 Pac-12) \nOne might have expected me to elevate Arizona State in these rankings after keeping a game against a top-five opponent within one score in the fourth quarter. This is an instance where I will refuse to overreact to one game. Sure, USC\u2019s previously unstoppable offense looked much more mortal in Tempe, but I attribute that more to the crowd noise than anything the Sun Devil defense did. On a night where the Trojans\u2019 passing attack looked so out of sync, they should have been able to keep the score under 40 points. Kenny Dillingham coached this game in a very gimmicky way, running fake punts, trying surprise onside kicks and going 3-for-4 on fourth-down conversion attempts. Arizona State cannot play in a bowl game this season, so they treated this game like the Super Bowl. In weeks to come, their home stadium will not be nearly as packed, and Dillingham will likely not take nearly as many chances as he did in this one. If I had to pick out a Week 4 performance that is utterly unsustainable, it would be ASU\u2019s.\n```"}

Travis Viera-Liden: I think at least with the coverage that I\u2019ve been I\u2019ve been following, you know, like they were trying to extend it, meaning the studios and other folks were trying to extend it. And it really was detrimental to the artists. So I\u2019m glad that there\u2019s some kind of terms happening because I know a lot of folks have been out of work for a long time.\n\nHowever, Benjamin Nestor, a SCA graduate student in Film & TV Production program, feels as though this is just the beginning and that a tentative agreement still has a long way to go before being finalized. Benjamin Nestor: I think tentative agreements means that there\u2019s still more work to be done, so hopefully they\u2019ll get closer to a good compromise. But I\u2019m really excited to be able to work with, try to get an internship for jobs in the industry and actually be working on content.

Maddi Moran: I\u2019m really excited for writers to eventually be able to start working again because I have a lot of friends that graduated between the last one or two years and they were just starting to get their footing in the industry and had some incredible opportunities and then they had to leave that because of the strike. And I very much so am in support of the strike because I believe it\u2019s super important to modify and update the different policies and try to make it equitable and a fair wage and everything else for writers. But I\u2019m excited to hopefully, hopefully the agreement will be something that will not only help writers like in the future with what they\u2019re doing, but also get back to work.\n\nMembers of WGA were also encouraged to continue picketing with their SAG-AFTRA counterparts as AMPTP now turns its attention to the actors of Hollywood.

We asked USC students for their opinions on this new law.\n\nBy Zifei Zhang and Daniel Park\nSeptember 25, 2023 at 6:18 pm PDT\n\nA bill was passed that requires California public schools serving first through 12th grades to provide at least one gender-neutral bathroom for students by 2026. Junior Michael Kim sees this new law as a victory for self-expression.\n\nMichael Kim: I think it\u2019s pretty cool that people are able to express their own gender identity and whatnot. It allows more freedom and less harsh restrictions on nonbinary related genders. And it kind of sets forth like a precedent where, you know, you can express who you are and be more free with that. So I think it\u2019s pretty cool.\n\nAccording to a recent study conducted by the Human Rights Campaign, an astounding 43% of transgender and non-binary students were never able to use a bathroom or locker room facility that matched their gender identity. 38% of which said that their school didn\u2019t have an option for them or didn\u2019t have enough facilities to support their needs.\n\nMandar Vaingankar, a Master\u2019s student in Electrical Engineering, believes it\u2019s important for all students, regardless of gender identity, to have equal access to resources.\n\nMandar Vaingankar: Personally, I think it\u2019s a good thing because irrespective of what gender you are. You should still have the opportunity to get the access to the resources, which is fair for everyone. So I think it\u2019s a great move. I think everyone has the right to express themselves and it\u2019s a free country. You can be whatever you want as long as you respect others, and so you can ask for respect from others.\n\nThis law was signed among many others that create more support systems for LGBTQ+ youth in California. The bill\u2019s passing is a result of a 2021 policy from Chino Valley Unified School District. That action required schools to inform parents when their children changed their pronouns or use a bathroom different from the gender listed on their official paperwork. It also follows Gov. Newsom\u2019s veto of a bill that would have required judges to consider a parent\u2019s acceptance of their child\u2019s gender identity when making custody and visitation decisions.\n\nThis staunch tug-of-war between LGBTQ+ progress and bigoted legislation is a national problem. Across the United States, LGBTQ+ people have been under attack through actions such as Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill. John Broadway is disappointed in the backlash towards trans rights, acceptance and inclusion.\n\nJohn Broadway: If I could speak generally about the U.S., particularly states like like Florida was like, \u2018Don\u2019t Say Gay\u2019 bills, we\u2019re doing pretty trash. I think there\u2019s a huge sentiment that like the LGBT community and trans community has this agenda. I\u2019m not really sure like what they think this agenda is, but you know, I think if people understood the only quote unquote, agenda they have is living in a world where they can be accepted and safe. Hopefully, that understanding would allow for better laws and policies to be made for them.\n\nThe bills passed on Saturday by Gov. Newsom is one small step towards gender equity in a persistent war against queer rights.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Zifei Zhang.\n```"}

On Monday, USC Hazing Prevention and Leadership coordinator Ashley Westbrooks hosted a workshop in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center (TCC) on how to recognize and report hazing.\n\n\u201cI think the most common misconception is that hazing only happens in fraternities and sororities,\u201d Westbrooks said. \u201cAnd so through the events that we have throughout the year, as well as here in Hazing Prevention Week, it\u2019s just to let students know that it happens in all settings.\u201d\n\nWestbrooks also encouraged students to sign the Anti-Hazing Pledge, a commitment to not engage in hazing activity.\n\nAside from Monday\u2019s event, USC will host more events relating to National Hazing Prevention Week in TCC this week. On Tuesday, the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services (RSVP) office will host a workshop on Bystander Intervention. On Wednesday, Hazing Prevention at USC will teach attendees about the different resources to report hazing on campus. There will also be a session on how to build a healthy culture in clubs.\n\nAdditionally, there will be two tabling events at Hahn Plaza \u2014 one on Tuesday from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. and another on Friday from 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. The occasions will feature anti-hazing education and resources from Campus Activities.\n\nThe Hazing Prevention Network, an international nonprofit organization, established National Hazing Prevention Week in 2007 as a way to raise awareness for an issue that has resulted in at least 50 documented student deaths since 2000. USC has one confirmed death from hazing \u2014 a 1959 incident in which a 21-year-old student choked to death during a Kappa Sigma initiation ritual.\n\nUSC\u2019s Greek life organizations have dealt with hazing allegations in recent years, as well. In 2018, People Magazine reported that Kathleen Russell sued the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi for negligence, claiming that Alasdair Russell, her 19-year-old son, died by suicide after being hazed.\n\nSince 2014, eight fraternities and one sorority have lost their recognition by the university for hazing violations, according to USC & Fraternity & Sorority Leadership Development. The USC Student Handbook identifies activities such as forced strenuous physical activity, sleep or meal deprivation, forced creation of digital content and acts of psychological harm as hazing.\n\nThe university provides education modules for hazing prevention through Prevent Zone by Alive Tek. The modules are a mandatory requirement for students planning to join a fraternity or sorority, as well as for officers of recognized student organizations, but are not required for every enrolled student as mandatory Safety & Wellness online courses.\n\nStudents who have taken the Prevent Zone modules have had varying experiences with them.\n\n\u201cEven being in Marshall, I think I\u2019ve had to take some modules,\u201d said Ethan Hoffman, a junior studying business administration. \u201cI think they did a really good job of representing where USC is at as far as their stance on it.

But if you have, it didn\u2019t really offer anything insightful. And I have no recollection of what I\u2019m supposed to do if I get hazed in that situation, which is, I think, the whole point of the modules.\u201d\n\nIf you witness or experience hazing, call the emergency line of the Department of Public Safety (213) 740-4321 (University Park Campus) or (323) 442-1000 (Health Science Campus).

The study defines food insecurity as \u201ca lack of access to enough food to live an active, healthy life because of limited money or other resources.\u201d According to the study, the current food insecurity statistics are similar to the numbers recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. At the time, the 42% household food insecurity percentage in 2020 was the highest ever. After a 14% drop in 2021, rates have increased each year since, with 2023\u2032s 44% rate representing a new all-time high.\n\nThe study also points to an increase in the use of food pantries as CalFresh benefits decrease. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal program that provides benefits to low-income families in order to supplement their food budget. The CalFresh Program is the in-state version of SNAP and they issue benefits that can be used to purchase \u201cmost foods\u201d in supermarkets across California. Government assistance for both these programs was increased during the pandemic. In March, some of these pandemic-related benefits were cut, as outlined in the US Census. Some believe that the decrease in benefits would result in an increase in hunger across California, according to CalMatters.\n\n\u201cThat was probably the big impact when we talk about [the increase in people utilizing services]. We do attribute probably most of that to the reduction in California\u2019s benefits,\u201d said David May, the communications director for Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.\n\nA student at USC wrote to Annenberg Media about using SNAP benefits to purchase groceries. \u201cDue to my major and also working during the year, I think it is difficult to find time to cook meals so I always try to buy frozen foods or ingredients to make simple dishes,\u201d wrote Natalie Williams, a junior studying biochemistry. \u201cThe amount that I am provided despite the extra COVID relief money is plenty, so I did not mind when it was taken away,\u201d Williams continued.\n\nThe study points to four factors that affect a person\u2019s ability to gain access to food. According to the study, individuals between the ages of 18 to 40, females, Hispanic and Latinx people and people with low-income jobs are most likely to become food insecure. May says the cost of living in California is the biggest reason why people may not have access to affordable meal options. He added that while those costs are seen as unavoidable, food isn\u2019t. \u201cPeople will say, well, \u2018I have to pay my water bill, I have to pay my electric bill, I have to pay my rent, but maybe I can get by on just one or two meals a day\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nSome solutions recommended by the study include lowering food prices, increasing enrollment in government food assistance programs, extra support for food banks and pantries and offsetting barriers to food access. Tracie Kirkland, a Clinical Associate Professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, believes that food security is a fundamental right and need.

Are they shutting down like right now?\u201d\nChuck White: \u201cIt\u2019s like a possibility that\u2019s happening this week. Like a likely.\u201d\nSyd Iino: \u201cWhat is shutting down government mean? Like, just everything is going to end.\u201d\n\nThat was freshman Syd Iino, and she voiced the feelings of many students in regard to a US government shutdown--confusion and fear. A government shutdown grows more likely each day as lawmakers fail to reach a deal that extends funding past a critical deadline at the end of the month. Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle hope to pass a short-term funding extension to avert a shutdown on Saturday. It\u2019s not clear if the plan will succeed amid disagreements over spending and policy divisions over international affairs such as aid to Ukraine.\n\nCameron Kanauf: \u201cWhat I do know about it is like the government is like doesn\u2019t have enough funding to keep running and like some functions of the government may be like shut down for a certain period of time. As for what functions? I\u2019m not sure. And I, I don\u2019t entirely know what that means for the entirety of the United States.\u201d\n\nCameron Kanauf is a freshman, and to answer his question, government funding expires at the end of the day on Saturday, September 30 at midnight, though the full effects of a shutdown wouldn\u2019t be felt until the start of the work week on Monday. In the event of a shutdown, government operations would come to a halt, but some services deemed essential would continue. Such services include those necessary to protect public safety and national security like border protection, federal law enforcement and air traffic control. However it\u2019s important to note, these workers would be furloughed without pay.\n\nFederal employees wouldn\u2019t be the only ones affected during the shutdown. National Park Service sites across the country felt major affects during 2019\u2032s pause. Some remained open but severely understaffed for weeks without park service-provided visitor services such as restrooms, trash collection, facilities or road maintenance.\n\nFor USC students, the shutdown could impact some study abroad folks who happen to be overseas if congress fails to pass proper legislation. US embassies around the world would remain open but delays could occur if there aren\u2019t sufficient fees to cover operations.\n\nWe asked students if they knew anything about the looming threat of a shutdown in the near future. Most of the students we talked to had no idea.\n\nJoan Ruic: \u201cWait? When did the government shut down? I just remember the storming of the Capitol, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really shutting down.\u201d\nSara Leong: \u201cI did not know about the government shutdown. But also, we\u2019ve been in this position before. The government has, quote shut down before.\u201d\nSarah Pirone: \u201cI haven\u2019t really heard anything about it.

(Photo courtesy of Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP)\n\nBy Delaney Polocheck, Faith Curry, Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as, and David Herrera II\nSeptember 25, 2023 at 5:38 pm PDT\n\nThe fates of 120,000 ethnic Armenians living in the region known as Nagorno-Karabakh became uncertain after the Azerbaijani military took control following a 24-hour blitz on September 20. The conflict ended after the de facto government surrendered to Azerbaijan, giving them full control.\n\nArmenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh are now fleeing for fear of ethnic cleansing, according to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. \u201cArmenians have been in this region for 4,000 years. I mean, this is one of the oldest inhabited areas in Armenia and areas in the world,\u201d said Scout Tufankjian, an Armenian-American photographer. \u201cBut at the end of the day, for me, this is where people live. These are people\u2019s homes. This is where they were born. This is where their grandparents were born. They should be able to live in their homes.\u201d\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is an enclave that occupies 20% of present-day Azerbaijan but is home to a 120,000 ethnic Armenian majority. The region has a long history of territorial conflict, the latest stemming from the nine-month-long Azerbaijan blockade of the Lachin Corridor, the only road that connects Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. The obstruction triggered a humanitarian crisis in the region, leaving all 120,000 Armenians without food, water or health resources as Azerbaijan tried to starve out civilians and military personnel.\n\nThe armed conflict beginning last week was declared to be part of an \u201canti-terror\u201d operation by Azerbaijan and has been responsible for the deaths of at least 200 Armenians and many more injuries, according to CNN. Over 6,500 Armenians from 16 villages have since evacuated back to Armenia, and those still left in the region have been completely disarmed as per the terms of the ceasefire.\n\nThe declaration of the ceasefire occurred just before the date of the Independence Day of Armenia, which marked their proclamation of sovereignty from the Soviet Union on September 21, 1991. \u201cWe\u2019re not celebrating this year,\u201d said Mane Berikyan, vice president of the USC Armenian Student Association and the executive chair of the All-Armenian Student Association. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the darkest chapters of modern Armenian history for us, and so we can\u2019t in good conscience celebrate the loss of something that\u2019s been so integral to our understanding of the Armenian nation for centuries. It was a day of mourning mostly for the Armenian community.\u201d\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh region has been the source of decades of tension leading up to this week\u2019s conflict. After the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in the late 1980s, the regional parliament voted to become part of Armenia, triggering a war with Azerbaijan that concluded with Armenia in shaky control of the region due to a periodically broken ceasefire. \u201cI am pessimistic of the current ceasefire, given our history with these nations,\u201d said Nicole Antounian, an Armenian USC alumnus. \u201cThey have repeatedly violated the ceasefire treaty and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, clashes broke out again with heavy casualties sustained through November, when Russia brokered another ceasefire between the two countries. In the agreement, a small strip of land \u2013 the Lachin Corridor \u2013 was established. Russian peacekeepers were to monitor this transit route that connected Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. However, Azerbaijan blocked this route in December 2022 after accusing the Armenians of using it to bring in military supplies, resulting in the past nine months of unease for the Armenians that culminated in the recent armed conflict.\n\n\u201cI feel helpless and heartbroken,\u201d Antounian said. \u201cI feel like the world is being completely complacent to the atrocities being committed against my people. I never thought I would witness another Armenian genocide.\u201d\n\nBerikyan, who is a junior studying International Relations, says that USC Armenian students \u201cfeel invisible\u201d on campus due to the lack of recognition from the university and the public in general. \u201cThere\u2019s almost 1,000 Armenians on campus. We feel alone, and it is very hurtful to feel invisible in this community, but I guess it\u2019s something we\u2019ve come to terms with and we\u2019ve decided to fill those gaps ourselves,\u201d Berikyan said. \u201cFor us to do anything but pour all of our resources and outcry towards this would be for us to be complicit in the genocide ongoing in the region.\u201d\n\nHowever, sending help to the Armenians is difficult due to the circumstances and lack of resources to contact them. Armenian student groups at colleges and universities across the nation are forced to wait it out while the conflict continues. \u201cThe sad reality is that we haven\u2019t been able to fundraise [since] nothing goes into the region. Funds and money aren\u2019t the problem,\u201d said Berikyan, who is trying to organize fundraising efforts with partners at UCLA. \u201cThe main problem is that there is no way to get food, medicine or basic supplies into Nagorno-Karabakh to help out the trapped Armenians.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Berikyan says that spreading awareness of the issue is a big step in helping the Armenian people. \u201cAll I hope is that people pay attention, read the news, spread awareness, even if it\u2019s an Instagram story repost. Every small thing helps,\u201d she said. Visit the USC Armenian Student Association\u2019s social media for more information.\n```"}

However, writers have already started to celebrate. This long-awaited agreement is a testament to the \u201cwillingness of this membership to exercise its power, to demonstrate its solidarity, to endure the pain and uncertainty of the past 146 days,\u201d as written by WGA\u2019s negotiating committee to its members.\n\nScreenwriter Caroline Renard expressed her relief in a tweet, saying \u201cWe got a deal. That was the hardest I\u2019ve worked in forever. Captain signing off!\u201d\n\nWriters are still on strike until further notice, but picketing has been suspended, according to the WGA.\n\n\u201cI know that our negotiating committee fought for what we wanted and what we rightfully deserved,\u201d said Chiara D\u2019Ambrosio, a sophomore screenwriting major. After being involved with the writer\u2019s strikes, D\u2019Ambrosio says she believes that \u201cwe will get a deal and will get an agreement that we all feel very good with.\u201d\n\nWriters and actors are now shifting their focus towards the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). The union has supported WGA in seeking justice for writers and now strives to reach a similar agreement.\n\nOn September 21, a writer\u2019s demonstration was held in Culver City at Amazon Studios, where SAG-AFTRA members walked alongside WGA.\n\n\u201cThat was actually one of the last strikes before the Writers Guild came to an agreement,\u201d said Julia Conoscenti, a progressive degree student in PR and advertising and a member of SAG-AFTRA.\n\nOne of the concerns actors are voicing during this strike is the \u201clooming threat\u201d of AI, Conoscenti said. \u201cSAG-AFTRA is on strike because they are petitioning for more pay,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in place or on paper kind of putting any restrictions on artificial intelligence. And so, they\u2019re originally fighting for that, saying that if they were to use our image in AI and anything after they filmed, they had to get their permission, they had to pay them for it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Conoscenti, studios are paying actors for half a day\u2019s work while gaining the rights to their image forever. Moreover, actors haven\u2019t seen an increase in pay, despite the influence streaming platforms have over how much actors can receive from box office and theater attendance.\n\nAfter bearing witness to the effects of strikes and collective action, both students mentioned that SAG-AFTRA members won\u2019t stop speaking out until they reach solutions.\n\nThe deal struck with the WGA has left Conoscenti feeling hopeful for the potential success of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s strike.\n\n\u201cI know that the CEOs of Netflix and Amazon and all these big streaming platforms were in the meetings for the WGA,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m hoping that the CEOs will also make themselves present for those SAG-AFTRA meetings.\u201d\n\nAs a writer and actor, D\u2019Ambrosio has participated in WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike efforts. After the WGA\u2019s strides to seek justice for writers, D\u2019Ambrosio says she is \u201cstill on strike as an actor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that the AMPTP can come back to the negotiation table and see what we deserve. We were able to do that with the WGA, and next is SAG,\u201d she said.\n\nConoscenti mentioned that ultimately, actors seek to receive proper compensation for their work in an effort to reclaim their art.\n\n\u201cThere just needs to be a rule in place that if we are going to use your image and your voice to create AI, you get \u2018x\u2019 amount of money from that,\u201d said Conoscenti. \u201cHalf a day\u2019s pay and then having the rights to your image forever is just not going to cut it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe fought for the creativity of this business, and we will continue to long after this strike is over,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep going and we\u2019re going to keep creating things that mean things to people.\u201d\n```"}

Welcome back to Bleeding Blue. Last weekend, our boys took care of business in Seattle, sweeping the Mariners in dominant fashion. They locked up their 10th NL West division title in 11 years, an accomplishment that should not be swept under the rug. This is a Dodgers team that most experts predicted to regress in \u201823. The Padres were popular preseason picks to win the division, with some love even being given to the D-Backs and Giants. The Dodgers proved this season that they are still the preeminent franchise in the NL West and one of the top two teams in the National League. Their player development, coaching staff and overall culture are unmatched. Despite dealing with a wide swath of injuries to their pitching staff they are still on track to win 100 games. What they\u2019ve done this year is impressive, and the guys have every right to celebrate the way they did. Of course, there are still loftier goals to take care of, but for now, the NL West title is an incredible achievement.\n\nOur boys also performed well against the Tigers and Giants, winning the series against both teams. There were some impressive starting pitching performances, most notably from Emmet Sheehan and Lance Lynn. Sheehan went only 4 2\u20443 on Thursday, and gave up four walks and a run, but struck out nine. If Sheehan were to make the postseason roster, this performance gives a slight vote of confidence in his direction. The walks are obviously an issue, but the guys are going to need help keeping runs off the board in any way possible. This leads to Lynn, who didn\u2019t exactly dominate on Sunday, as he gave up two runs on five hits and three walks. The two runs came on a long ball from Giants outfielder Lamonte Wade Jr, nothing new for Lynn in his homer-prone \u201823 campaign. However, this wasn\u2019t a typical five-run outing from Lynn. He kept runs off the board, and let the offense do what they do best. If Lynn can give six innings and limit the opposing team\u2019s damage to three runs or less, that should be considered a win. As always, the Dodgers will take all the help they can get on the pitching side.\n\nSpeaking of pitching, I want to spend a bit of time diving into the career resurgence of Ryan Brasier. Brasier has been perhaps the most dominant relief pitcher for the team over the past couple of months. He started the year with the Red Sox but was released in late May after he posted a 7.29 ERA in 21 innings. He signed a minor-league contract with the Dodgers a couple of weeks later and has quietly been dominating opposing teams in late innings. He\u2019s posted a 0.74 ERA in 36.2 innings and has limited opposing teams to a .139 batting average. It\u2019s frankly nothing new for a Dodgers team that prides itself on its ability to pick up relievers off the scrap heap for almost nothing and turn them into studs. He hasn\u2019t even allowed an earned run in the month of September. Credit to Lance Brozdowski, a pitching guru on YouTube, for noticing this trend first. Since coming to the Dodgers, Brasier is throwing his fastball 15% less and his slider about 6% less. The Dodgers made a tweak by adding a cutter that he now throws 21% of the time. He primarily throws the cutter to lefties, who would kill his fastball when he was with the Sox. He\u2019s become one of the most reliable guys at the back of the bullpen, along with Evan Phillips and Brusdar Graterol. As I\u2019ve watched these three guys pitch throughout the past couple of months, I fully trust their ability to get guys out in October. I would\u2019ve definitely not had the same confidence in Brasier when he was with the Sox back in May. So, I give every credit to the Dodgers player development staff for making the necessary changes in his arsenal to be effective.\n\nThe guys end the year on the road against the pitiful Colorado Rockies and then head up to the Bay to finish off the regular season against San Francisco. One hundred wins is within their grasp once more, and let\u2019s hope they\u2019re able to ride some momentum into October. \u201cBleeding Blue\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

The Trojan faithful welcomed USC women\u2019s volleyball back home at the Galen Center on Sunday, following the team\u2019s five-set triumph over crosstown rival UCLA on Wednesday. In the conference home opener, the Trojans delivered a second consecutive Pac-12 victory, this time over Oregon State in three sets. The win over the Beavers improved USC\u2019s overall record to 8-4 and preserved the Trojans\u2019 undefeated conference standing. Sunday\u2019s win also brought USC\u2019s winning streak to seven games \u2014 completely flipping the narrative of a team that started the year 1-4.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to get more people in the stands,\u201d USC head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cPart of that is winning and I think also you see the personalities. We\u2019ve got some really powerful, fun and electric personalities on this team.\u201d\n\nOne personality on full display Sunday was that of senior outside hitter Skylar Fields. USC\u2019s prized pin hitter got her team on the board in the first set with an emphatic kill from the left side, en route to five more in the set and a game-high 18 kills on the day. It was clear from the start that USC was going to get Fields her opportunities on the strong side, and the senior delivered with 31 swings and not a single error. In the first set alone, USC outpaced the Beavers 20-6 on kills with an absurd .679 hitting percentage as a team, emblematic of the Trojans offensive dominance in the match.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even scratched the surface yet,\u201d Fields said. \u201cI think getting that confidence and knowing that we can play clean volleyball throughout the entire match is really going to help us focus longer and just play clean.\u201d\n\nUSC closed out the first set with an authoritative 25-11 win, but lost some momentum in the early stages of set two. Oregon State took its biggest lead of the game at 15-10 after a service ace from OSU graduate setter Elizabeth Schuster, which prompted Keller to take a timeout on behalf of USC. It was after that timeout when USC took off and never looked back, going on a 7-1 scoring run to regain the lead, 17-16. Graduate opposite hitter Kalyah Williams hammered four kills in that stretch and freshman outside hitter London Wijay accounted for two of her own. On set point, junior setter Mia Tuaniga faked an overhead set and scored a creative behind-the-back tip-shot on the left side of the Beavers\u2019 defense for a 25-19 USC win in set two.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know which hand I wanted to [pass] with and then I was like \u2018okay, I\u2019m going to do this,\u2019\u201d Tuaniga said. \u201cWith setting, you make decisions in like 0.02 seconds, so I guess it was a good pass.\u201d\n\nTuaniga also collected a game-high 42 assists on Sunday, her fourth match this season with 40 or more in that category. In the third set, Fields added eight kills to her tally, including four consecutive scores that put the Trojans ahead 15-10. USC maintained separation the entire set, leading up to a match-clinching service ace from graduate libero Ellie Snook to seal the score at 25-16.\n\nStarting off their first conference homestand with a win, the Trojans will anticipate University of Utah (6-6, 1-1) on Friday before closing out with University of Colorado (9-4, 1-1) at the Galen Center on October 1. With 18 consecutive Pac-12 matchups upcoming, there is no better time for the Trojans to get hot other than right now.\n\n\u201cI think we are just getting better and better,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to play cleaner volleyball in general. You\u2019re going to win if your three pins are hitting on all cylinders like [today]. I think we are starting to see the athleticism come through combined with the ability to play the game the right way.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Scot Tucker)\n\nBy Jensen Tan September 25, 2023 at 1:35 pm PDT\n\nWhile the Los Angeles Rams beat the San Francisco 49ers during the 2021 NFC Championship Game, the Rams have lost to the 49ers continuously throughout the regular season since 2018. Los Angeles lost yet again to their division rivals last Sunday, falling short to the 49ers 30-23. As a Los Angeles Rams fan, I can\u2019t help but expect the 49ers to beat the Rams whenever a game comes up between the two. The game last Sunday was slightly hopeful as the score was tied 17-17 at halftime. Matthew Stafford looked sharp as he completed 5 of 6 attempts for 43 yards in the first half, and Puka Nacua scored 147 yards throughout the game. The Los Angeles Rams had a lot of defensive stops, but the Rams were unprotected on all levels of the field. The long gains from the 49ers truly got the Rams at the end of the game. The Rams\u2019 defense showed good signs despite improvements being made.\n\nOur confidence against the 49ers has gradually decreased for Rams fans such as myself. Since the 2018 season, the Rams have lost nine straight games in the regular season against the 49ers, excluding in the NFC Championship Game in 2022. The 49ers seem to have a handle on the Rams\u2019 defense and can use Deebo Samuel\u2019s speed for slants and jet sweeps. In addition, the 49ers have star Christian McCaffery, who has the speed and agility that shredded the Rams\u2019 defense. Even beforehand, during the regular season, the Rams have continually failed against the 49ers defense. The 49ers keep having the upper hand, and Kyle Shanahan consistently outsmarts Sean McVay with his playcalling. The 49ers\u2019 defense with Nick Bosa at the front can neutralize Stafford constantly, and the Rams don\u2019t seem to have a handle on how to stop the 49ers\u2019 defense when they usually play.\n\nThe only exception where the Rams could show they could get past the 49ers\u2019 defense was with the prowess of Cooper Kupp, when the Rams went to the Super Bowl in 2021. However, since then, the Rams have struggled against the 49ers and cannot seem to win against them. After a poor last season, the Rams look much better than they were projected to score. There is the promise that the Rams will continue to improve, and their next matchup is on January 7, 2024, with the potential return of Cooper Kupp lined up alongside Puka Nacua. He could shred San Francisco\u2019s defense, but playing at Levi Stadium is more of a threat to the Rams and takes away their home advantage. The 49ers improve to 3-0 against the Giants and continue to prove to be Super Bowl contenders. If the Rams continue to improve on all aspects of their game, such as the offense, and reduce exposure, then the Rams could make the battle at Levi\u2019s Stadium enjoyable. Only time will tell if the Rams are worthy contenders against the 49ers and if they have what it takes to end the historic losing streak against them.\n```"}

Following her unexpectedly beloved NYU short film and expanded upon, \u201cShiva Baby\u201d (2020), Emma Seligman reteams up with Rachel Sennott (\u201cBodies Bodies Bodies\u201d) and together they wrote this big-hitter teen comedy for the girls and the gays.\n\nThe new film \u201cBottoms\u2019' follows two lesbian high schoolers, Sennott and \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Ayo Edibiri, at the bottom of the social sphere, using the titular term cleverly as it is also a double entendre in the LGTBQ+ vernacular when they decide to create a female fight club to try to get girls.\n\nTonally, Seligman and Sennott strike a precise balance to their comedy. The film is camp (a la \u201cDrop Dead Gorgeous\u201d \u201cBring It On\u201d and \u201cHot Fuzz\u201d) where the writers invite the audience to suspend their disbelief and lean into this new absurd alternate universe. Still, it is played with absolute sincerity which makes for an effectively moving second half.\n\nWhen asked how she could intuit that the actors hired for this film would understand the film\u2019s tone, Seligman said that she trusted her casting director for most of the hiring, but also that she looked for actors who played their characters straight. They deliver the preposterous lines with complete seriousness, a necessary approach for the type of humor.\n\nAt one point, the school\u2019s dean comes on the speaker and requests \u201cthe ugly and untalented gays to come to the principal\u2019s office.\u201d While speaking at a screening at USC, she also said it was important for all the actors to bring a singularity and uniqueness to their characters, releasing them from what would otherwise feel like a stock role.\n\nFormer football player Marshawn \u201cBeast Mode\u201d Lynch turns his role as a bored teacher into one of the most memorable characters in the film, due to his heavily improvised one-liners. The writers also leaned into the raunchy jokes, despite costing them some support from studios and locations.\n\nFilming in the more affordable New Orleans, they were up against the conservatism that pervades the South, and in the aforementioned Q&A Seligman spoke about the obstacles she faced in securing their top locations for the project. They resorted to a college gymnasium, an abandoned elementary school and a less popular recreation center: the only spots willing to work with them.\n\nIt was a shrewd decision to stick to their guns here, though, because the writing delivered, as evidenced by a giggling auditorium of college students at the screening I attended.\n\nDirector Emma Seligman (middle) on set with leading actors Ayo Edebiri (left) and Rachel Sennott (right). (Photo courtesy of Orion Pictures)\n\nSeligman is only 28 years old, but she fears trying too hard to write for a younger generation. So, she and Sennott opted to do away with modern technology and give the time and place some ambiguity, which managed to make it feel eternally relevant. We clock a razor flip phone but also understand that in the early to mid-2000s when that phone was peaking, American cinema did not treat the LGBTQ+ community with the same nonchalance as they are in this film.\n\nIt is a fantasy to some extent, specifically for the LGBTQ+ community who grew up loving a handful of films that they never got the opportunity to see themselves in. Seligman and Sennott are righting the wrongs and filling the gap on that missed opportunity without trying too hard to be earnest.\n\nShe resisted putting too much depth into the script. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just be horny and weird and funny? Why do we have to care?\u201d Seligman said. But she does make us care. Audiences will care about the outcomes of our leads and their new circle of friends. The film makes us care about their friendship. And it makes us care about their school.\n\nIt is a romp and goes to very unexpected and extremely violent places. But it is the perfect comedy for today. And it is all the more reason that women need to produce more big-budget films.\n\nYou might not have seen this dynamic writing duo coming, but one thing is for sure: Rachel Sennott and Emma Seligman have a lot more up their sleeves and I don\u2019t think it will be anything we can expect.\n\n\u201cBottoms\u201d is in theatres now screening across the U.S.\n```"}

(Photo by Aidan Williams)\n\nBy Aidan Williams, Marco Alvarez and Yana Savitsky\nSeptember 25, 2023 at 1:19 pm PDT\n\nThe fall solstice has passed and autumn has officially fallen upon the USC campus. The weather is cooling down, the leaves are changing color and pumpkin spice lattes are back. Companies have spiced up their product lineups in preparation for the autumn season. Within walking vicinity of campus, Starbucks, Trader Joes and Dunkin Donuts have added themed drinks and menu items to their roster to get you in the autumn mood.\n\nThis year, Trader Joe\u2019s announced 146 fall items on its website. From classics like their famous Apple Cider Donuts to new releases like the Mini Maple-Flavored Marshmallows, there\u2019s something for everyone. Priscilla Rico has worked at the USC Trader Joe\u2019s location for six years. She recommends the Vanilla Pumpkin Scented Candle, Apple Cider Donuts and brand new Apple and Pumpkin Hand Pies. Rico added that the Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese is also quite popular amongst the students.\n\nFor the sweet tooths out there, Sophomore global business major Zafina Virani swears by the Pumpkin Spice Baton Cookies. She says having one makes her feel \u201cnice and cozy,\u201d and like it\u2019s finally fall. Virani also recommends investing in a pumpkin room fragrance, which she sprays in her room to \u201cfully embrace the season.\u201d\n\nAt the Village Starbucks, USC students are fall-ing in love with new and returning fall seasonal menu items. The Pumpkin Spice Latte and Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew are back, complemented by the new Iced Apple Crisp Oat Milk Shaken Espresso and the Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte. Starbucks is also offering autumn food options, including the Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin and the Baked Apple Croissant.\n\nJunior business major Kirsten Kim has only ordered one seasonal beverage so far, but says she highly recommends the drink she did give a chance, Starbucks Apple Crisp Oatmeal Shaken Espresso. \u201cI just thought the flavor was good. It gives warm, fall vibes,\u201d said Kim.\n\nWhether customers like it or not, the strong smell of pumpkin coffee now fills Dunkin Donuts locations as the organization jumps on the autumn bandwagon with the reintroduction of its Pumpkin Spice Signature Latte and Pumpkin Munchkin Donuts. The rolling out of the Ice Spice Munchkin Drink, a collaboration between Dunkin and rapper Ice Spice, is the key ticket item this fall season. This new frozen drink uniquely contains blended pumpkin munchkin donuts.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to get into the fall mood or simply support your favorite rapper, there\u2019s certainly a seasonal item for everyone near campus.\n```"}
