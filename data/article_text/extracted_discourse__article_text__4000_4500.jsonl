To begin the game, Stanford scored the first goal, and the Trojans responded with two goals scored by redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt and senior driver Marcus Longton.\n\nWhen USC found themselves down 6-3, the Trojans marched back after senior driver Ashworth Molthen and Longton scored one goal each and junior 2-meter Tony Nardelli earned a penalty shot. Graduate driver Massimo Di Martire made the shot to knot the match up at 6-6.\n\nBefore the half, the Trojans and Cardinal traded goals back and forth as the score at halftime ended up being 8-8.\n\n\u201cIn the first half we allowed way too many goals,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cThe team played much better defense in the second half with most of the 50-50 balls and with some key blocks.\u201d\n\nTo begin the second half, Stanford scored first again, but the Trojans were able to respond and tie the match at 10-10. From there, USC\u2019s offense started to pick up entering the fourth quarter as two more goals were scored by Ehrhardt, and junior driver Carson Kranz scored a goal off an assist from sophomore 2-meter Luka Brnetic to make the score 13-10.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Ehrhardt scored two more goals to give him a career high for goals scored in a game with five. Di Martire and Molthen also each scored a goal to bring their totals to four for the game.\n\nTo end the game, freshman utility Andrej Grgurevic scored a goal, and redshirt junior 2-meter Grayden Reynolds also scored a goal.\n\n\u201cIn previous games where we have been close in the fourth quarter we kind of stepped off the gas and worried about running the clock out,\u201d Ehrhardt said. \u201cIn this game, we changed that mentality as a whole and just kept on attacking them.\n\nUSC\u2019s defense contributed to pulling away from Stanford as graduate goalie Kyle McKenney had eight saves in 31 minutes, and redshirt junior goalie Garrett Allen also had a save in the final minute of the match.\n\n\u201cWe gotta take everything we did from this game and try to emulate it against UCLA,\u201d Ehrhardt said. \u201cAt the end of the day we just have to realize which good things happened today and try to repeat those things.\u201d\n\nEhrhardt led the Trojans in scoring with five goals. Di Martire and Molthen were tied for second with four goals. Longton had two goals and redshirt junior driver Chris Agliozzo, along with Kranz, Grgurevic and Reynolds, each had one goal.\n\n\u201cYou always play to win, and Stanford is a worthy opponent,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very tough and physical team that is well coached.\u201d\n\nAfter the upcoming alumni game on November 5, the Trojans will be back on the road against UCLA on Friday, November 11.\n```"}

For LAFC this scenario is not foreign as they lived the same exact moment three years ago: winning the Supporters Shield which granted them a bye week, beating LA Galaxy at home in conference semifinals and hosting the conference finals at home. Then, the result did not turn out to be the best; but soccer is a sport of revindication. That opportunity came on Sunday. A victory against \u201cLos Verdes\u201d would allow LAFC to reach their first-ever MLS Cup final. Nonetheless, both times these two teams faced each other during the regular season Austin came down with the victory.\n\nAccording to midfielder Ilie S\u00e1nchez, LAFC never lost focus before the game, as they looked to overturn the losing record against Austin. \u201cWe were so focused on performing and playing the game that we wanted to play, that I personally forgot that this was a final during the 90 minutes,\u201d he said.\n\nLAFC midfielder Ilie S\u00e1nchez during the game against Nashville SC.

The Colombian striker, and LAFC\u2019s top goalscorer this season, headed the ball to the back of the net. In a very similar play during the 62\u2032 minute, the Black and Gold increased their lead by two goals. Carlos Vela, once again, put a corner into play.

We have our volunteer climbing stewards that respond to climbing emergencies 24/7,\u201d said David Smith, the superintendent for the National Park Service in Joshua Tree National Park. \u201cWe could not have cleaned up this place without volunteers organizing and coming to this event.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Joshua Tree National Park broke its historical visitation record with 3.1 million visitors in spite of the coronavirus pandemic. According to Smith, the number of visitors has increased by 130% in the past 10 years while the number of climbers has doubled. This has led to an increase in trash and graffiti, he said.\n\n\u201cThe park was built for solitude and not necessarily for three million visitors,\u201d said Bernadette Regan, a climbing ranger for the National Park Service. \u201cOne of the biggest problems is the massive increase in vehicular traffic. When people cannot find parking or get frustrated with the one-lane road, they sometimes go off-road and damage a lot of plants and animal habitats.\u201d\n\nIn response to the increase in human footprint, the Yosemite Climbing Association brought their signature Facelift event to Joshua Tree National Park, inviting volunteers for a day of stewardship through picking up trash and removing graffiti from rocks.\n\nOrganizers from the Friends of Joshua Tree, National Parks Service and Yosemite Climbing Association gathered at the Mojave Desert Land Trust at 7 a.m. on October 22.\n\nSabra Purdy, the owner of Cliffhanger Guides, a climbing guide service at Joshua Tree National Park, directs volunteers to their respective teams. Eighty volunteers were spread across Hidden Valley, Yucca Valley and Twentynine Palms to clean up trash and graffiti.\n\nAlex Renteria, an archaeologist from the National Park Service, showcased artifacts such as obsidian tribal spearheads and a miner\u2019s matchbox. He shares why not all trash should be picked up. \u201cCertain objects that look aged should be left in their place and be handled by the service. This way, archaeologists can learn about the park\u2019s geohistorical background,\u201d Renteria explains.\n\nRina, a volunteer from the Pure Project, picks up burlap sacks, safety vests and tools for cleaning up trash.\n\nFort Diaz, a local volunteer who lives three miles outside of the national park, picks up an empty bottle. He shares that he comes to Joshua Tree and the national park every two weeks to pick up trash in order to keep his community clean. \u201cIt\u2019s like keeping your own home clean,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cThis trash affects the local community so I see it as my responsibility to clean it up.\u201d\n\nNolan Graham, a volunteer climbing steward with Friends of Joshua Tree, puts on protective gear as he prepares to clean graffiti.\n\nJohn-Thomas \u201cJT\u201d Faust, a volunteer climbing steward with Friends of Joshua Tree, applies \u201cElephant Snot,\u201d a caustic chemical designed to remove paint, onto the graffiti.\n\nKaley Mudd, a climber from San Diego and volunteer with Joshua Tree Facelift, scrapes at glitter glue stuck to the wall after the \u201cElephant Snot\u201d failed to get it off. \u201cI was going to climb at Joshua Tree National Park and thought Facelift was a good way to give back to the space I use,\u201d Mudd said.\n\nDavid Fosman, a climber from San Diego and a volunteer at Joshua Tree Facelift, shows off the patch of glitter glue successfully peeled off by Mudd.\n\nAfter 3 hours of cleaning, the rock face appears largely clean save for a few specks of paint.\n\nKarl Miraz, a Park Ranger in Joshua Tree National Park, loads a bag of trash onto a pickup truck.

(Photo by Colin Huang)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino\nOctober 31, 2022 at 10:28 am PDT\n\nThe No. 18 Trojans continued their dominant conference play against the Cougars, winning 3-2. Even with senior midfielder Croix Bethune out with an ACL injury and sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo sidelined, USC put on an offensive display.\n\nHead coach Jane Alukonis recognized the challenge of Bethune being out. \u201cNot having her, her creativity, her leadership, her buzzing around the pitch everywhere is obviously a huge loss,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWe knew each player had to give 110 percent to make up for any player\u2019s loss.\u201d\n\nWith two of their top midfielders out, the Trojans needed to rely more on their forwards. And that\u2019s exactly what happened, with two out of the three goals being scored by forwards.\n\nUSC started out the game hot with sophomore forward Simone Jackson immediately breaking away and almost scoring. That led to junior defender Zoe Burns scoring with a high, left-corner goal in the fourth minute.\n\nThe Trojans started out with intensity with lots of passing and finding ways to keep the ball away from the Cougars. Sophomore forward Kayla Colbert was able to use her speed to break away from WSU multiple times in the game, and sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer was always able to find the ball in difficult spots.\n\nThe tides soon changed, though, in the 23rd minute. Washington State senior forward Grayson Lynch sent a corner kick into a crowded goal area where junior forward Margie Detrizio tapped it into the net.\n\nThe rest of the half was mostly contested on the Trojans\u2019 side of the field; the defense and graduate goalkeeper Anna Smith were able to prevent any more goals in the first half.\n\nBut the real story of the game was told in the second half as the Trojans and Alukonis knew they had to start the second half strong. Alukonis\u2019 halftime speech to her team was focused. \u201c[WSU\u2019s] game plan is fairly simple and try to negate that,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cTry to stop the long balls and score as quickly as we can.\u201d\n\nUSC started out quickly, taking more shots and crossing the ball over with fluid passes. However, that still wasn\u2019t enough to stop Detrizio from scoring another goal against the Trojans. In the 49th minute, Detrizio broke away with the ball and attempted a shot that was saved by Smith, but then Detrizio recovered the rebound to put the ball in the back of the net.\n\nThat put the Cougars ahead 2-1 over the Trojans. USC, not wanting to taste defeat, responded quickly with a free kick after a handball. Sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio sent the free kick flying around the WSU defense where it was eventually blocked by sophomore goalkeeper Nadia Cooper.\n\nAfter the block, the ball was left in the perfect spot for junior forward Angeles Escobar to place the ball in the bottom of the net in the 53rd minute.\n\nIn the 64th minute, the Trojans were showing they were motivated to make this second half different from the first half. They exhibited dominance when Jackson broke away from a Cougar defender and blasted the ball past Cooper to make the score 3-2 in favor of the Trojans.\n\nUSC played all the way through the second half, gaining most of the possession and preventing another goal from being scored by the Cougars.\n\nWith the 3-2 win over WSU, the Trojan\u2019s record improved to 11-2-3 and to 7-1-2 in conference play. The Trojans now look to topple crosstown rival No. 1 UCLA on Friday.\n\n\u201cThey [UCLA] are a super consistent team, and we would love to get on the board early,\u201d Alukonis said. Alukonis says the game plan is \u201cto compete as hard as we possibly can, keeping the ball as much as we can, and doing our thing, playing our game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are a completely different opponent and style of play than WSU,\u201d Burns said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different approach mindset wise. But I\u2019m really excited because I think UCLA matches more how we play.\u201d\n\nThe No. 18 Trojans now have a big week of preparation ahead of them. USC hopes to make the upset against the Bruins at 2 p.m. this Friday at McAlister Field.\n```"}

Lines snaked around The Regent Theater downtown at 7 p.m., as fans craned their necks waiting for doors to open. Boys Like Girls has been around for more than a decade, having released their explosive debut self-titled album in late 2006. This concert, part of the \u201cSweet Sixteen World Tour,\u201d celebrates the 16-year anniversary of their debut album. It\u2019s the band\u2019s first tour in six years, and they sold out shows in Australia and the Philippines earlier this month. On Sunday, the band played at the pop-punk When We Were Young Festival in Las Vegas.\n\nThere were clearly fans in attendance that caught the band at the festival, as well \u2013 many were proudly dressed in (all-black) festival gear and reminisced fond memories of the band while waiting in line. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to them since middle school, and I\u2019m nearly in my thirties now. They were the first band I put on my iPod,\u201d a woman gushed to her friend in line. Though much of the crowd were no longer the teenagers they were when they first discovered the band, they were looking forward to tonight where they could relive that experience again.\n\nOpener Blake Rose, a singer-songwriter from Perth, Australia kicked off the show at 8 p.m.. Rose displayed his flair for performance on stage, switching between his keyboard, guitar, bass and even a drum mid-song, all the while maintaining a strong vocal presence. Although the crowd seemed mostly unfamiliar with his alternative pop tracks, his energy got the room buzzing and excited for the main act.\n\nAt 9:15 p.m., after several sound checks, a thin veil of fog billowed onto the stage. Strains of an all-too-familiar guitar riff emanated out of the speakers. Claps, cheers and screams erupted from the crowd as the band kicked off the show with \u201cLove Drunk,\u201d the title track from the band\u2019s 2009 album. Given that The Regent is a smaller concert venue, the music was loud \u2013 perfect for heart-thumping, head-banging pop-rock. The sound of the bass drums and electric guitar riffs reverberated out of the speakers as the crowd of nearly 300 people sang along with jubilance.\n\nThe band mainly played from their first two albums, much to the delight of nostalgia-hungry fans. Familiar singles like \u201cHeart Heart Heartbreak\u201d from \u201cLove Drunk\u201d and \u201cHero/Heroine\u201d from their self-titled album were laced with the band\u2019s signature heart-on-your-sleeve lyrics and incredibly catchy hooks. They paused playing a few times just to hear the crowd sing the lyrics. \u201cNo, you never get a second chance at the first time / We will never be eighteen again,\u201d sang Martin Johnson, the band\u2019s lead singer, on \u201cThe First Time.\u201d\n\nJohnson clearly knew how to rock a crowd. Between tossing guitar picks into the waiting audience, grabbing phones for selfies and urging the crowd to jump and dance, Johnson was an unstoppable force of energy in top form. The band seamlessly transitioned from song to song, only letting the energy drop for a tender ballad section in the middle of the concert. Switching over to an acoustic guitar, Johnson started off with the romantic jam \u201cBe Your Everything\u201d followed by a smooth segue into \u201cTwo Is Better Than One,\u201d the wildly popular love song featuring Taylor Swift.\n\nAt the bridge of the song, Johnson sang a medley of choruses from other sentimental tracks, including \u201cOn Top Of The World\u201d and \u201cGo\u201d before launching back into the final chorus of \u201cTwo Is Better Than One\u201d. The band members performed with incredible chemistry. Bassist Gregory James, drummer John Keefe and lead guitarist Paul DiGiovanni often walked to each other to jam out during guitar riffs. Johnson would keep up the energy with banter amongst the band and with the audience.\n\n\u201cI always feel different playing a Boys Like Girls show \u2013 it\u2019s just so awesome to be playing music with your best friends,\u201d Johnson said to rousing cheers. Their spirit was visible, with the band having contagious smiles despite having a sheen of sweat from jumping around.\n\nDuring the show, Johnson also teased that the band was working on new music. \u201cYes, we haven\u2019t released anything in a while, but we\u2019re not like those other bands that break up and get back together just to rile the fans up. We\u2019ve always done things our way, and I like that.\u201d They performed a new song, \u201cThe Outside,\u201d which will be part of their upcoming album releasing next year.\n\nFor their final song, the band played \u201cThe Great Escape.\u201d With over 160 million streams on Spotify, it is arguably one of their biggest hits that many fans were looking forward to the whole evening. Guitars crescendoed to the first chorus, and then the band stopped. Johnson stepped to the microphone and got the crowd to listen. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve played one chorus. You guys got that on video, Facetime, TikToks, yeah? Now let\u2019s put those things away and go back to the old days.\u201d\n\nOf course, back in 2006 when the song came out, when all we had were camcorders and flip phones if we even had them at all. \u201cIt\u2019s just us and the music. Let\u2019s be here together.\u201d And just like that, for three minutes and twenty six seconds, Boys Like Girls was able to transport the theater back to the summers of black skinny jeans, hazy first loves and feeling like the world was ours to conquer.\n\nThe \u201cSweet Sixteen World Tour\u201d continues through October 31 in the United States.\n```"}

The applause that followed was significantly louder.\n\nThe day-long programming at \u201cA New Climate\u201d featured a marathon of industry leaders who spoke about their role in addressing the climate crisis. The speakers dove into a variety of topics, from how startups would revolutionize transportation through EVs, how to feed ourselves\u2013\u2013perhaps through lab-grown meats and regenerative agriculture\u2013\u2013to becoming carbon negative through carbon sequestration. It delved into how big business players approached these issues with Microsoft, the Bezos Earth Fund, and major venture capital firms.\n\nIn between sessions, the program smartly peppered in live quintet performances and discussions on mental health, art, and youth activism\u2014acknowledging the deeply human aspect of addressing such an overwhelming problem. There was lots of energy and optimism channeled towards the technological innovations in the pipeline, but it was laced with an undertone of desperation: we were moving fast, but not fast enough.\n\nModerator David Gelles and Brad Smith during the Wielding Power panel at A New Climate. Credit: The New York Times.\n\nThe role of big tech in the climate crisis\n\nThe \u201cWielding Powers: Leaders on Their Role in Addressing the Crisis\u201d specifically focused on Microsoft\u2019s stance in climate advocacy. Recently, Microsoft has positioned itself as a leader regarding climate response and advocating for greener policy, pledging to be carbon negative by 2030. By 2050, they promised to remove all the carbon they\u2019ve emitted since their founding in 1975.\n\nDespite Microsoft\u2019s recent ambitious gains in climate technology, which includes a plan to retrofit coal plants into clean nuclear generators, Smith believes that we still need government policy to further corporate incentives. \u201cWe are proponents of what I would call an activist policy agenda in those spaces,\u201d he said.\n\nThe unique role of philanthropy in climate\n\nThe next panel, called \u201cMoney and the Problem\u201d focused on big philanthropy. It featured two panelists: John Doerr, the chairman of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, who also donated $1.1 billion to Stanford University to build the new Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability; and Andrew Steer, the president of the Bezos Earth Fund and former president of the World Resources Institute.\n\nBoth spoke with a bright sense of optimism about climate change, given the sharp rise in interest from large corporate interests and billionaires in addressing this problem. \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting, isn\u2019t it? That people with wealth are turning to this important issue. This is the defining challenge of our generation. And it\u2019s a time when real leaders say this is when we want to lead,\u201d said Steer.\n\nThe Bezos Earth Fund has allotted $10 billion to address a variety of issues within the climate crisis, from conservation to carbon sequestration. They view their role as a sort of partnership-creator, funding initiatives and rallying the relevant stakeholders together. Steer used their initiative at Congo Basin as an example, explaining that the goal was to assemble a team of institutions and have them work together.\n\n\u201cInstead of [just identifying] the best institution and financing that, we got the 10 best institutions together. Then we talk to head of state levels, we talk to the big European donors, the American government, and we can actually then start putting together a coalition whereby we might reduce the loss we have,\u201d Steer said.\n\nModerator David Gelles chats with John Doerr and Andrew Steer during the \u201cMoney and the Problem\u201d panel. Credit: The New York Times.\n\nWhen asked about his choice to donate $1.1 billion to founding a sustainability school at Stanford, Doerr said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe the world will solve the climate crisis unless it marshals the great universities and colleges and community colleges around the world to bring a full force of their power their innovation, their ability to mobilize workers against this awesome challenge.\u201d\n\nRegarding the school\u2019s acceptance of fossil fuel donations, Doerr clarified that it was primarily the faculty who accepted funding from fossil fuel companies. He said that they had the \u201cfreedom to get funding from whatever resource they want.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have several institutes whose purpose is to reach out to industry to engage industry in innovation and agendas. Some of that work is funded by fossil fuel companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are fossil fuel companies committed to driving to net zero by 2050. Not many yet but more and more. And I dare say we need to get them there to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nNot all oil corporations associated with Stanford have made net-zero pledges, according to their list of industry affiliate programs. This includes Matador Resources Company, a Dallas-based oil company that funds a Stanford project that explores deepwater ocean seafloor oil reservoirs.\n\nIn response to Doerr, Gelles said, \u201cThat obviously raises an enormous set of questions about even if the school or institute or the university doesn\u2019t want to work with these companies, why certain professors may still accept funding for it.\u201d He added, \u201cA topic for another panel, I am afraid.\u201d\n\nThe role of fossil fuel companies\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to end our use of fossil fuels as rapidly as we possibly can,\u201d said John Doerr in an exclusive interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be an easy transition,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be winners and losers as we re-engineer a whole new clean economy.\u201d\n\nRegarding the purpose of the petroleum engineering program and its relationship with the transition to renewable energy, he said, \u201cI\u2019m standing with the students and saying we want to find a way to get that done without funding from fossil fuel resources.\u201d He acknowledged that the petroleum industry has the scale, scope, and potential to help with the technological advancement necessary in solving the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t want to write them out of trying to solve the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need all the world\u2019s greatest entrepreneurs, companies, financiers, universities, and petrochemical companies working to get us to this critical goal net zero by 2050.\u201d\n\nTechnology solutions vs. infrastructural changes\n\nDirect air carbon capture is an incredibly nascent yet quickly growing field and was heavily discussed at the event. Shaun Meehan, co-founder of carbon sequestration startup Charm Industrial, said that by 2050, we need to be pulling five to 10 billion tons of carbon out of the air every year, but as of 2022, we were only removing carbon in the magnitude of ten thousand tons.\n\nMeehan pointed to the main piece of art in the foyer: a sculpture of black carbon blocks stacked on top of one another, representing the amount of carbon an average adult in America produced in a year. He mentioned that he and his co-founder at Charm Industrial enjoyed creating sculptures, and this was one of their pieces. His intention was to help people visualize the amount of carbon they were producing individually every year, because the phrase \u201ctons of greenhouse gas\u201d is not really easy to grasp in a tangible sense.\n\nBut the most shocking thing he said was that even if people made the most eco-friendly decisions\u2013\u2013such as becoming vegan, biking everywhere, etc.\u2013\u2013the height of the carbon tower would only reduce by about 30%. This is because 60-70% emissions are produced by the infrastructure our society is built on.\n\nCorporations have an Adam Smith-like optimism that market forces will naturally give way to a sustainable future. Fossil fuel companies continue to fund research to find new reservoirs and continue extraction, and yet partner with leading sustainability institutions. But Microsoft acknowledges that policy is key, and Doerr was worried that as a society, we weren\u2019t moving fast enough.\n\nThe reality is that our ability to solve the climate crisis depends upon whether we can act as a collective to change policy and big businesses, instead of being a mass of disconnected yet deeply concerned individuals.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Drake Lee\nOctober 29, 2022 at 9:34 pm PDT\n\nCaleb Williams heaves a pass high in the air. The last time the star sophomore quarterback tossed the ball in a pressure situation, it was two weeks ago, in an act of desperation, praying that a man in cardinal red would catch the ball to save USC\u2019s undefeated streak against Utah. This time, it was an act of triumph with a leaping Brenden Rice on the receiving end to decisively put the Trojans ahead for the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cAwesome, gutsy win,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cWe were scoring pretty quick offensively. So many guys stepped up. It would be hard to name them all right now.\u201d\n\nWilliams and the Trojans spoiled Arizona\u2019s Homecoming Game by passing for 411 yards even with key offensive pieces Mario Willams and Jordan Addison out with injuries. USC moved to 7-1 overall and 5-1 in PAC-12 play.\n\n\u201cA lot of guys stepped up,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI put the ball where I thought was best, and the guys made some great plays.\u201d\n\nRedshirt junior wide receivers Tahj Washington and Kyle Ford rose to the occasion, recording 118 and 114 receiving yards respectively in a 45-37 victory.\n\n\u201c[Williams and I] always connect very well in practice,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAnd I definitely think that paid off today. I know I can perform like this, it wasn\u2019t really a surprise to me.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans had to settle for a field goal for their first drive of the game after the Wildcats swarmed Williams for a sack on the Arizona 28. Redshirt freshman field goal kicker Denis Lynch scored the first points for either side by kicking from 45 yards.\n\nSophomore quarterback Jayson de Laura answered right back, heaving a bullet that found the diving hand of sophomore wide receiver Dorian Singer for the Wildcats\u2019 first touchdown with 7:01 to go in the first quarter.\n\nOn the second drive, Williams found an open redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyron Hudson for 21 yards on the USC 48, setting up Williams for a slingshot pass to freshman running back Raleek Brown on the left side on 3rd and 6. The Trojans converted 11 of 16 third downs in total.\n\nBrown side-stepped the lone defensive end in his area to score the first USC touchdown in two weeks at 2:57 in the first quarter.\n\nDe Laura struck again, passing to freshman wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan on 3rd and long to put the Wildcats in field goal range. Sophomore kicker Tyler Loop tied it at 10 with a 42-yard field goal.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 offense answered by heaving a 46-yard pass to Washington before firing a strike to Rice to bring up first and goal. Williams evaded the defensive tackles and fired a running pass to a leaping Rice up the middle for another touchdown, putting USC ahead for the rest of the game.\n\nLynch tacked on another point with a booming kick.\n\nOn 2nd and 10 on the USC 4, redshirt junior defensive tackle De\u2019jon Benton threw down junior running back Michael Wiley by the mask, resulting in a 15-yard penalty. The error set the Wildcats up for a touchdown.\n\nHowever, the Trojan defense imposed three key stops to force Arizona to kick. Redshirt junior safety Max Williams capped off the defensive effort by tackling Wiley for a loss of seven yards.\n\nLoop delivered the 25-yard strike to cut the deficit down to four.\n\nOn the very next drive, USC looked to have their third touchdown of the game with a pass on the right side to redshirt senior wide receiver Terrell Bynum, but a holding penalty on redshirt freshman right tackle Mason Murphy called the touchdown back.\n\nRiley asked Lynch to kick from 56 yards, but the field goal missed well to the right, keeping the score at 17-14.\n\nUSC attempted an eleventh-hour scoring drive. But with four seconds left at the Arizona 44, the clock ran down even before the referees spotted the ball, eliminating the chance for the Trojans to score.\n\nRiley was outraged, shouting in the referees\u2019 faces as the players headed to the locker rooms.\n\n\u201c[The referees] admitted that they messed it up,\u201d Riley said. \u201cMy question is if you messed up, why wasn\u2019t it reviewed?\u201d\n\nComing out of the half, the Wildcats were trapped on their own side of the field. But de Laura heaved a long ball to Singer for 73 yards, the longest play by either side.\n\nThe Trojans responded by putting up another three crucial stops to force the Wildcats to accept yet another field goal, bringing the game to within a single point.\n\nThe momentum carried into the offensive side of the ball as Williams tossed a pass to Ford, who sprinted all the way to the Arizona 5.\n\nWashington added to his impressive game, diving to receive a pass from Williams to put the Trojans up 23-16.\n\nLynch made it 24-16.\n\nArizona stuck with USC for the rest of the game, bringing the score to 31-29 at one point. But de Laura\u2019s two-point attempt after a touchdown sailed over the head of everyone.\n\nArizona could not keep up for the rest of the game.\n\nThe Trojans will return to the Coliseum for their Homecoming game against California next Saturday.

The top two candidates, Lula da Silva and Jair Bolsonaro, advanced to the runoff election on Oct. 30 after they failed to receive more than 50% of the vote in the first round. Lula led the round with 48.4% of the votes, while Bolsonaro received 43.4%. \n\nThe political violence in Brazil is nothing new. According to a recent survey by Brazilian polling firm  Datafolha , it is estimated that more than 67% of the population says they fear becoming a victim of violence because of their political beliefs. \n\nNicolle Camara, 29, a Brazilian citizen and cashier at Supermercado in Culver City, is adamant about supporting anyone whose name is not Jair Bolsonaro. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just supporting Lula not because I like him, but because he has the best chances against him [Bolsonaro],\u201d Camara said. \n\nLula da Silva is running for his third term as president of Brazil. He served as president from 2003 to 2011 and is considered to be one of the more popular political figures in the country\u2019s history after lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty due to an economic boom. But in 2017, Lula was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison for corruption and money laundering, which was later increased to 12 years. He only served 580 days in prison before his release in 2019 after the Supreme Federal Court deemed defendants are allowed to exert all their appeals. To this day, Lula denies committing any crimes or wrongdoings. \n\nHis opponent, incumbent Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has had his share of controversy. He downplayed COVID-19 calling it a \u201clittle flu,\u201d contributed to the deforestation of the Amazon and degraded women and the LGBTQ community. \n\nThough Bolsonaro\u2019s brash personality triggers many, Brazilian citizen and University of Nebraska-Lincoln student Thiago Pereira, 23, is not fazed by it. \u201cHis behavior doesn\u2019t really bother me,\u201d Pereira said. Pereira has been an avid supporter of Bolsonaro, stating that his economic policies drive his desire to vote for the outspoken president. \u201cHis policies are more aligned to the ones that I believe to be the most beneficial for my country. It will provide more freedom to enterprise and also a more free market approach to the Brazilian economy,\u201d Pereira said. \n\nBryan Pitts, assistant director of UCLA\u2019s Latin American Institute, gave some insight into what would happen if each candidate won. \u201cIf he [Bolsonaro] is reelected, we can see more of the same with the continuing accelerated deforestation of the Amazon, and continuing accelerated levels of police violence,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cIf Lula wins, it could be much more difficult for him to implement his domestic agenda in terms of expanding, instead of reducing inequality and expanding opportunity, because he\u2019s going to have a Congress that can be much more resistant to him.\u201d \n\nPitts, who has a Ph.D. in Latin American history with a focus on Brazilian politics, believes people outside Brazil should care about this election because of the impact it could have on the environment. \u201cCertainly in global terms, this is the really stark thing, which is that the very survival of our planet could hinge upon who wins this election,\u201d Pitts said. \n\nBrazilians all over the world will be grinding their teeth on Oct. 30th.\n```"}

It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s nothing to aspire to. You want to aspire to do good work. You want to aspire to make your living as a performer. Fame is nothing to chase. You don\u2019t want people following you around and in your trashcan. You want to do good work, and you want to go home. So don\u2019t chase that because the thing is, when you chase fame, you end up compromising because there\u2019s always one more thing you can do to give a little bit more fame, to get a few more likes. And usually, that\u2019s over the line you set for yourself. So don\u2019t chase fame, be professional and kind.

We\u2019re constantly taking in the news from it, or are ourselves addicted to it. So when you\u2019re writing or coming up with stories, you\u2019re hearing with the world all the time, and it\u2019s constant and instant scroll, and it\u2019s also the way that we know what\u2019s going on and what are the trends and how I make sure that I adapt to the stories to not just my own small perspective. Emerging technologies and artificial intelligence and all that kind of stuff is a very juicy thing to write about because it has so many benefits, and with those benefits come so many social disadvantages, too.

The adverse effect is that a certain aesthetic that Instagram or social media that develops. And it\u2019s hard when you see that aesthetic on social media. And then we also see that in our TV shows, and then people don\u2019t feel seen then.

And I think for a long time, we were all trying to kind of be different to fit in. And I think now we\u2019re finally in a place where everyone is embracing our differences. Keep your authentic self alive and nurture that. We are setting out to show these stories and these characters in our communities and to see other people embrace it and then also realize that these are universal stories. These characters [from \u201cReservation Dogs\u201d] help viewers just open up their minds about the Indigenous community, living on a reservation and living in these communities. When we have diversity in media, you know, it changes the way people see people, the way people vote. It opens up this part of your mind because you feel empathy towards characters and you feel connected to them, in a way, because you're sharing experiences. It's been really amazing to see this show have such a reach and such an impact and that our stories are written by Indigenous writers and directed by Indigenous directors, and acted by Indigenous people. Like, it's just crazy. It's historic. So I think that that's the most important thing, is just that we're finally able to thrive and show our talents, and people love it.

Their parent wraps mitten-swathed hands around a mug with the words \u201chey pumpkin, happy fall!\u201d scripted on the outside. The air, that chilly fall air that brims with Halloween spookiness and Thanksgiving gratitude, makes that child believe they can pick up a bright orange vegetable they can barely wrap their arms around. The parent grins at the child and the trophy whose slimy veins they will blend into a puree and carved-out carcass they will place on their front porch for all their neighbors to see.\n\nThe pumpkin\u2019s allure lies in its whimsical and multifaceted history. It is not an idle symbol of changing seasons; it is a dynamic canvas on which Americans may project their vision of comfort and reflect on the feeling of transformation that comes with the waning summer warmth. For centuries in the United States, we have cooked it, carved it, traded it, told tales about it and migrated with it: the pumpkin\u2019s physical form is a vital vertebra in the backbone of American popular culture.\n\nOther crops have illustrious histories, such as the apple, potato or banana, but what sets the pumpkin apart is that it has lost almost all of its functional use. We eat it because it\u2019s a fun way to repurpose its remains after we chuck out its guts and carve out chunks of its meat to make eyeballs and crooked smiles. The pumpkin looms large in the fall but is otherwise no longer a foundation of everyday American life.\n\nSo what are the roots of this seasonal celebrity? Pumpkins can trace their origins in North America back to as early as 3500 B.C., making them one of the oldest crops of the western hemisphere. Native Americans roasted pumpkin meat on the fire for sustenance and are said to have even woven pumpkin skin into mats. Once colonialism struck the Americas around the 15th century, it is said that colonizers relied heavily on the pumpkin as a food source. They prepared them by slicing off their tops, removing the seeds (sound familiar?), and filling the inside with milk and spices to create the earliest traces of our modern pumpkin pie.\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering how this functional vegetable became the basis of the peculiar Halloween jack-o\u2019-lanterns we love. Well, this history says as much about our perception of wild nature as it does human nature. The story starts in Ireland where people carved faces into small turnips to ward off spirits. With immigration into the Americas came the assimilation of this tradition into western culture: white colonizers swapped turnips for pumpkins and the jack-o\u2019-lantern tradition stuck.\n\nOld Irish custom of carving faces into turnips (Photo courtesy of opacity via Flickr).\n\nHaving both ornamental and culinary value, the pumpkin took hold of American life early, and our obsession swelled so intensely that American writers wrote effusive poetry and prose about it. These writings lifted the pumpkin up as a symbol of early, small-town, agrarian life in America.\n\nBut let\u2019s just say not everyone buys into this idyllic vision. For many African Americans, fall means stuffing the oven with a decadent sweet potato pie (or warming up a pre-made Patti LaBelle pie from the store if cooking happens not to be the individual\u2019s forte). The running joke that \u201cBlack people don\u2019t eat pumpkin pie\u201d traces back to the Antebellum South. Southern culinary customs more often turned to sweet potatoes than pumpkins for their spice-filled pies simply because they were easier to grow in their agricultural environment. This task was usually delegated to enslaved African Americans working in the plantation house kitchen.\n\nThis is not exactly where the tradition stakes its roots, however. It all began in the slave quarters, which is where enslaved people could establish their own sense of domesticity and claim space within the context of home. The first African American sweet potato dessert was a sweet potato roasted on a fire, and the glossy finish on the outside sparked the evolution of the \u201ccandied\u201d dessert. After Emancipation, Black people held on to their perfected recipes and carried them across the country far and wide.\n\nSweet potato pie and pumpkin pie may be rivals for the crown of the most fall-ish fall dessert, puffing out their chests in competition, but in the end, all of these traditions represent how we, as Americans, cling to what we believe is our history, our national identity.

The show is the brainchild of Jonathan Williams, a graduate student in specialized journalism, who desired to found a community where \u201cgraduates and undergraduates can work together to collaborate and to create something that will be long here after we\u2019ve gone and graduated.\u201d\n\nDuring the radio program\u2019s conception, Williams chose a roundtable format that mirrored the Fox Sports and ESPN LA 710 radio broadcasts that he grew up listening to. \u201cI think there\u2019s something about radio that it\u2019s almost like sensory deprivation in a way,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no visual [imagery], I think it\u2019s more intimate, and I think it\u2019s more human.\u201d\n\nWilliams developed the show in partnership with Eric Lambkins II, a graduate student studying specialized journalism. When the duo launched the project anchored in their mutual passion for professional sports and social commentary, Lambkins wanted \u201cthe team to be like water, meaning that it could take whatever shape or form that it needs to, and it could just flow in the event that there\u2019s an obstacle or barrier or impediment.\u201d\n\nThe live, multicamera program features a panel of co-hosts who spend the 90-minute runtime on discussions that range from esoteric debates on sports to anecdotes about their academics and reflections on popular culture. Though the segments generally remain separated, they sometimes converge into an NFL-style draft pick of fast-food restaurants or diverge into tangents about the hosts\u2019 first times cursing in front of their parents.\n\nOn the style of the show, Williams said, \u201cI think the future of sports media [is] a roundtable where people discuss sports and topics. I think that\u2019s where the industry is going and we may be at the forefront of that.\u201d\n\nDespite the ability of the show\u2019s live element to derail the broadcast at any moment, conversation flows naturally from the commentators, whose core group includes specialized journalism graduate students Williams, Jeremy Kole, Chas Messman, Ian Roddy and Austin Stanovich, as well as Nikki Thomas, a Ph.D. candidate in communications.\n\n\u201cThe Talk of Troy\u201d initially started airing on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. but has since added another air day on Thursdays to accommodate its popularity. Williams and Lambkins\u2019 fervent support for uplifting the voices and opinions of budding female professionals in the industry has also increased the team\u2019s size from five to eight members on-camera and from one to three behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I am very proactive with recruiting women is because I feel that they have a unique take on sports,\u201d Lambkins, the executive producer, said. \u201cI just believe guys have blind spots that we\u2019re unaware of and women truly make us better\u2013and it\u2019s not just women. I want to attract people who are non-binary or have a proliferation of just different mindsets and ideas and perspectives.\u201d\n\nAlthough the show first aired with five male commentators, it now features two additional female hosts, including J\u2019nai Knox, a junior majoring in journalism. \u201cI feel very welcomed to be on there,\u201d Knox said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a welcoming environment to have, feeling that I have the space to take, not that I have to make my own space.\u201d\n\nLambkins oversees the show\u2019s streaming and direction in the production booth while manning the soundboard and communicating updates to the hosts. In addition, he coordinates all training behind the scenes in hopes of leaving behind a space for future students interested in broadcast journalism, he said.\n\nIf you ask Williams or Lambkins who the real mastermind is behind \u201cThe Talk of Troy,\u201d both will humbly respond with the other\u2019s name. Despite their self-effacing demeanors, one thing is crystal clear: By capitalizing on the universal rise of podcast streaming, this sports-loving duo has inaugurated a new chapter of live radio broadcast and sports journalism at Annenberg Media.\n\n\u201cThe Talk of Troy\u201d airs Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. on Twitch and YouTube.\n```"}

No, you\u2019re not.\n\nHarry Styles at the Kia Forum on Oct. 21, the first night of his L.A. residency (Photo by Eda Katgi).\n\nBy Eda Katgi and Thuanh Su\nOctober 28, 2022 at 5:55 pm PDT\n\nTickets to Harry Styles\u2019 concerts are in high demand. Fans all over the world are eager to get their hands on tickets for one of his sold-out shows in their city. With Styles\u2019 15-night residency in Los Angeles, the ticket buying process is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nStyles announced the second leg of the \u201cLove on Tour\u201d residency in May 2022 and shortly after, fans started signing up for the verified fan presale, general presale, and general sale on the popular ticketing site Ticketmaster. Many fans were unsuccessful when it came to purchasing tickets because of Styles\u2019 popularity, which led them to go through other platforms and try alternative methods to purchase their tickets.\n\nHere are three routes to go about the ticket-buying process to snag coveted tickets for Styles\u2019 future L.A. shows \u2014 or any other big shows in L.A.\n\nTicketmaster\nTicketmaster is the primary place to find and purchase tickets for Styles\u2019 concerts. Signing up to receive pre-sale codes is the best option, as you can receive an early access code to the tickets before they are released to the general public. Ticketmaster also has exclusive releases for American Express cardholders for select shows, making the process of purchasing tickets easier.\n\nSecondary and Third Party Resellers\nSometimes, fans may not find luck with Ticketmaster. Luckily, there are secondary and third-party resellers who are looking to get their tickets off their hands. Secondary resellers sell their tickets to fans on social platforms like Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. With secondary reselling, fans have to do their own due diligence to ensure they are buying real tickets from real people.\n\nThe issue with selling fan-to-fan on social media platforms is that there is a possibility that the \u201cfan\u201d selling the ticket is actually a scammer. To combat the fear of scammers, some fans created fan ticket assistance accounts on Twitter and Instagram. These accounts are run by fans themselves and they help other fans buy and/or sell verified tickets.\n\nWith this process, there is an extra step added where potential sellers must provide the account owners with their ticket information, including proof of purchase, so they can verify that these tickets are indeed real. After the account owner verifies the information of the seller and their ticket, they will then post the ticket for sale on their accounts with prices and contact information so interested fans can purchase them.\n\nMany of these accounts have their own rules and regulations to ward off scammers. For fans who choose this route to buy their tickets, these accounts help them do so in a safe way.\n\nThird-party resellers sell tickets to others through websites like Vivid Seats, SeatGeek and Stubhub. Many fans have turned to these third-party websites to find their tickets, but oftentimes, these sites will charge higher prices and include high fees. With the added fees, the total ticket price ends up being well beyond the face value of the original ticket.\n\nSome fans who use these third-party resellers have experienced some issues with delivery methods. Tickets are often not transferred to buyers until the last minute or even not at all, forcing fans to contact customer support very close to showtime.\n\nLast-Minute Ticket Releases\nOpting to scout out last-minute ticket releases is a great idea if you run out of other options once the show date rolls around or if you simply want to be spontaneous. Ticketmaster will oftentimes release tickets that are still up for grabs close to the show date. To score tickets this way, continuously refresh the Ticketmaster page and app to see available tickets.\n\nAnother way to grab last-minute tickets is to go straight to the box office at the venue. On the day of shows, venues are eager to get rid of any remaining tickets to not have empty seats in the house.\n\nNabbing tickets can be difficult, but these methods can make it a little easier to get your own invite to Harry\u2019s House.\n```"}

Bernie Sanders appeared at a rally Thursday night supporting Congresswoman Karen Bass\u2019 campaign for mayor of Los Angeles. Sanders endorsed Bass in early October, calling her \u201cthe clear choice\u201d for mayor. With Rick Caruso  closing the gap  in recent polls, Sanders took to the stage of Playa Vista\u2019s Central Park Bandshell to encourage Angelenos to vote for his Democratic colleague.\n\n\u201cThe challenges we face today are more difficult than at any time in our lifetimes,\u201d Sanders said. \u201c[Bass] has been a leader in Congress on all of the economic, environmental, racial and social issues that we face.\u201d Sanders used most of his stage time to discuss the upcoming midterm elections and various national political issues, saying he was unsure \u201cwhether or not this great country remains a democracy.\u201d He touched on issues such as abortion rights and climate change, denoting them as pivotal in this year\u2019s elections, but lent most of his focus to the rapid growth of the U.S. wealth gap.\n\n\u201c60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhile working families struggle...we have never had a moment where the richest people are doing as well as they are today.\u201d Sanders used this rhetoric for a few jabs at Bass\u2019 opponent, developer Rick Caruso, calling for an end to the \u201ccorrupt political system that allows billionaires to buy elections.\u201d A number of the event speakers criticized Caruso\u2019s campaign spending, many of whom referred to his $90 million advertising budget as a method of \u201cbuying\u201d the election.\n\n\u201c[Caruso] has spent 90 million dollars on ads that are lying about his record,\u201d said Sydney Brown, president of Trojan Democrats, as she took the stage to open up the event. \u201cIt\u2019s time to elect a leader with policies that accurately reflect our values as a city.\u201d An assortment of other special guests made appearances at the event, including representatives from activist groups, elected officials and two musical acts. For her speech, Bass was joined by members of the Youth for Bass movement, calling them the \u201cnext generation\u201d of problem solvers for Los Angeles and the U.S.\n\nComedian Adam Conover, host of the hit show \u201cAdam Ruins Everything,\u201d made an appearance to support Bass through a number of jokes about her opponent. He decried that Caruso \u201crefuses to release his tax return and has a suspiciously even tan,\u201d making a thinly-veiled reference to Caruso\u2019s billionaire developer counterpart, Donald Trump. \u201cLast time I checked, I didn\u2019t think the problem in L.A. was that wealthy real estate developers didn\u2019t have enough power,\u201d Conover said.\n\nA number of speakers seemed to hold the belief that Caruso\u2019s background makes him incapable of relating to the average citizen, and that Bass\u2019 upbringing as a born-and-raised Angeleno makes her a more suitable pick for the city\u2019s top office. \u201cWe need to elect someone who understands that L.A. does well when everyone does well,\u201d Rep. Jimmy Gomez (CA-34) said. \u201cNot just the top tenth of the top one percent.\u201d\n\nThe event drew a large crowd of attendees, some camping out on the bandshell lawn with blankets and folding chairs. A large student population was present, most noticeably from UCLA, but the event certainly drew from a wide demographic, with a number of families in attendance. Some attendees seemed drawn to the event out of support for Sen. Sanders, as the crowd was peppered with campaign shirts and hats that served as relics of Sanders\u2019 two presidential campaigns. Others, however, seemed inspired by Bass and her vision for L.A.\n\nMonique Nicole Hernandez, Vice President of  SEIU 121RN , a California nurses union, said she and her colleagues were present because they \u201cbelieved in Bass\u2019 fight.\u201d \u201cShe backed us when there was...an investigation that went into capping travel nurse pay,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cShe sat down with us, she listened to us, and she recanted her support for that letter.\u201d A number of other union groups came out to support the congresswoman, including Carpenters for Bass.\n\nSen. Sanders was vocally supportive of these unions, praising revolutionaries at companies like Starbucks for working toward unionization. \u201cThis campaign must be our fight for a vision to create a nation and a government that works for all and not just a few,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn America, if you work 40 hours a week, you should not be in poverty.\u201d Bass touched on a number of issues in her speech, but seemed to focus her attention on abortion rights and homelessness, calling herself a \u201clifelong pro-choice Democrat who has always been on your side.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, if we don\u2019t win this election,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will return to the day of failed solutions, shelters and warehouses locking people up, criminalizing poverty.\u201d Bass also took plenty of digs at her opponent, whom she referred to as \u201cthe other guy.\u201d She stated that she didn\u2019t need to get on a campaign bus to explore L.A. and criticized Caruso for his relationships with prominent Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, as well as the customary remarks about the expense of his campaign.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using his riches to lie about his anti-choice Republican history,\u201d said Bass, \u201cand to lie about me.\u201d While initial polls showed Bass holding a commanding lead over Caruso, new data reflects a closer race, with Caruso no longer trailing by double digits. With 12 days left until election day, Bass and her guests encouraged attendees to volunteer with opportunities such as phone banks and canvassing programs. Election day is Nov. 8.\n```"}

For this exhibit\u2019s creator, it\u2019s an uncomfortable, yet necessary conversation to have.\n\nCreated by Breaking Silence, a media organization that hosts spaces for open dialogues around interpersonal violence, USC Hillel\u2019s Bradley Sonnenberg Wellness Initiative and A Path 2 Courage, another organization that aims to assist sexual assault survivors, this exhibit is being held at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center (TCC) from October 27 to 31.\n\nA Path 2 Courage founder Sophie Pollack is a junior majoring in sociology at USC. As a survivor of sexual assault and domestic violence, Pollack wanted to take her own experience and make it more personal for others, she said.\n\n\u201cThe main goal [with the exhibit] is to educate the broader community about sexual assault awareness,\u201d Pollack said.\n\nThe exhibit consists of a total of nine rooms, along with a space for reflection. Attendees are given a set of headphones and an iPod that plays audio recordings of first-hand testimonies from both survivors and, uniquely, abusers. Visitors are also offered \u201chealing stones\u201d to carry and squeeze for comfort as they walk through the exhibit.\n\nEach room is decorated to match the setting of the story being told, following the sequence of the narrator\u2019s story. The disarray of each room helps set the scene for visitors to immerse themselves in the experience of assault from beginning to end.\n\nIn the first three rooms, participants hear the story of a domestic abuse survivor. There are scattered books and kids toys in the first room mimicking a living room. The next room features a nicely set-up dining table with a black knife placed in the center. The last room showcases six chairs in a circle formation.\n\nThe second set of rooms illustrates the rapist\u2019s perspective. The exhibit begins with a trunk filled with clothes and empty beer cans. The other room looks like a prison, and the last one is of a table with hand-written thank you letters.\n\nThe last three rooms represent a rape survivor\u2019s story. It showcases a messy bedroom, a dining hall and ends with a wall of comments from victims about their triggers and how they\u2019re healing.\n\nAlli Meyerhardt, the founder of Breaking Silence, said, \u201c[w]e just want to create a more empathetic, more aware student population [and] faculty administration. If one person is willing to leave this exhibit and continue the conversation...that feels like a huge win.\u201d\n\nEnid Elizalde, a junior studying health and human sciences and Spanish, visited the exhibit and said, \u201c[a]s opposed to [hearing] from someone reporting about what\u2019s going on, you\u2019re actually listening to [the victim\u2019s stories]. It invokes more feelings and a need to take action.\u201d\n\nAlexis Gosling, a senior studying communications said, \u201c[the exhibit] gives a first hand lens to the experience of sexual assault and violence, which is rarely heard in the numbers and statistics colleges give out.\u201d\n\nMeyerhardt started this project when she was first hired to help mitigate sexual assault on Colorado State University\u2019s campus. To leave more of an impact on students, she wanted to create something more immersive. She was a history major and always loved how exhibits have the power to draw individuals into other\u2019s stories and experiences. It inspired her to create her own immersive environment so that survivors themselves did not have the burden of educating the people in their lives.\n\nThe Breaking Silence exhibit can be found in TCC in the The Franklin Suites (Room #350), and admission is free. The exhibit will run from October 27 to 31 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and October 31 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n```"}

It can also be hard to determine what costume will give the right impression. Cultural appropriation has a long history in this country, and Halloween isn\u2019t an excuse to do it. People have been called out for stepping out in costumes that paint specific groups of people in a negative light or reinforce stereotypes. Appropriation can be accidental, but it\u2019s still hurtful. It\u2019s always a good idea to check if your costume could rub anyone the wrong way.\n\nSo, how can you find a fun, low-effort costume and still be respectful of different cultures? Annenberg Media has your back. We created some do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for Halloween weekend 2022.\n\nDon\u2019t: Native American/Indigenous People\nDressing up as a tribal chief or Pocahontas is problematic. Historically, the media has created a spectacle image surrounding indigenous people and their culture, ranging from their traditional clothing to their practices. On top of the history of assimilation, forced relocation and genocide, dawning a headdress is not the right way to celebrate Halloweekend.\n\nDon\u2019t: Jeffrey Dahmer\nThe hit Netflix show \u201cDahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\u201d racked up 4.37 billion streaming minutes from October 20 to October 27, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Due to the increasing popularity of the Netflix series, people have decided to buy his signature glasses and imitate the serial killer for Halloween. However, that is the problem: Jeffrey Dahmer was a convicted serial killer who specifically targeted men of color. Glorifying him and his actions is not the right approach to Halloween. This sentiment is spreading online, as eBay banned the selling of Dahmer costumes, citing violations of their guidelines.\n\nDon\u2019t: Gang member\nOne of the biggest examples of cultural appropriation stems from embodying the \u201cthug\u201d persona in a Halloween costume. The fascination around gang life is especially prominent in Los Angeles because of the city\u2019s stereotypes surrounding South Central. Of course, this is still not an excuse to use stereotyped gang apparel as a costume, just ask former Bon Appetit Magazine chief editor Adam Rapoport. Most of this comes from unnecessary accessories like exaggerated jewelry, fake grills and tattoos that often include a teardrop. Attempting to be a gangster with a costume will garner looks but not the good kind.\n\nDo: The Disney Princess\nDisney Princesses are staples of Halloween and popular culture as a whole. With new additions in the last 15 years, the princess lineup is as diverse as ever and appeals to wider audiences. From Belle to Tiana, their costumes can vary in effort and turn out great regardless!\n\nDo: Fictional Characters\nYour Halloween costume should be a reflection of what you like, so picking your favorite character from your go-to binge show or movie is always a good choice. Because these characters are fictional, you can also add your own creative touch to their outfits, whether they\u2019re the \u201cgood\u201d guys or \u201cbad\u201d guys. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a villain for Halloween, but there is a difference when picking a fictional one.\n\nDo: The Classics\nVampires. Ghosts. Witches. Frankenstein. You can\u2019t go wrong with the Halloween costumes tried and tested for years. As broad categories, each costume leaves the door open for adding your own creative twist! Whether you\u2019re Count Dracula or Edward from \u201cTwilight,\u201d these cult classics never go out of style.\n\nHalloween is meant to be a time celebrating everyone\u2019s creativity and interests shared through each other\u2019s costumes. You do not want to be that person who sours the mood with your costume, especially if it\u2019s accidental. If you need to second guess your costume, you probably shouldn\u2019t wear it.\n```"}

As students stash up for the holiday weekend, they\u2019ll notice that their favorite candies taste a little more expensive. For parents, the cost of supplying trick-or-treaters is on the rise.\n\nAccording to the Grocery Price Index, candy prices have skyrocketed by 13% since 2021. Noteworthy surges include Skittles which has risen 42% and Starburst at 35%. On the flip side, Butterfinger and Crunch bar lovers will be less affected by the booming candy inflation, with the lowest price jumps, Crunch by only 6% and Butterfinger by 7%.\n\nHalloween candy prices are higher compared to last year due to the inflation of costs of ingredients like sugar, flour and milk. To put the rise in perspective, a bag of fun-size Snickers that sold for $5 in October 2021 is selling this Halloween season for $12, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCustomers are shocked by the prices seen in stores when shopping for trick-or-treat candy. Ashley Whalen, a junior majoring in communication, says she \u201cstill harbors that childlike need for candy,\u201d and she\u2019s been shocked by the prices this year. She \u201cbought a bag of Kit-Kats for four dollars, and it ruined [her] day.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says the \u201caverage household is expected to spend about $100 on candy, costumes and decorations.\u201d In 2015, the average was $74 per household. According to the National Retail Federation, customers are predicted to spend upwards of $3 billion on Halloween candy this year.\n\nAndrea Jackson, a junior environmental studies and public relations double major, acknowledges \u201cit\u2019s the really sugary stuff that\u2019s so overpriced.\u201d Skittles saw the most significant price jump from $3.13 to $4.43, a 42% increase. She \u201cwent to go get candy to hand out in [her] neighborhood this Monday and spent almost $90 on candy.\u201d\n\nSome students worry about the effects of candy inflation on future generations of trick-or-treaters. Junior communications major Alexa Grenley expresses that \u201c[her] biggest concern is children losing their childhoods to overpriced candy.\u201d\n\nTo encourage the candy craze, some of America\u2019s largest candy corporations made efforts to stabilize the affordability of Halloween treats this year. The Hershey Company has not followed the trend of increasing the prices of some of its products, as the cost of its candy has not risen since June 2022. In addition to its classic chocolate bar, the Pennsylvanian candy hub also produces Kit-Kat, Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups and additional goods.\n\nThe manufacturer Mars Inc., which produces M&M\u2019s, and the evermore expensive Skittles and Starburst, acknowledged last week that the cooperation diverted additional candy costs where possible, understanding this season was a difficult time for candy buyers.\n```"}

After 33 years since Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d Ariel\u2019s voice will serenade audiences once again. It\u2019s definitely been a long time since we have been part of her world. Unfortunately, there is one difference that is getting certain expectant audiences riled up: Ariel is not white. The announcement of the live-action remake exposed a toxic attachment to the culture of nostalgia; viewers appear to weaponize this sentiment to justify their stance against the new Ariel. \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d is rooted in fiction, yet the mermaid appears to be confined to a very particular aesthetic in order to satisfy the nostalgia factor. Nonetheless, whether audiences want to believe it or not, Disney has moved away from the white, blue-eyed mermaid and has introduced another Ariel\u2013the only difference is that she\u2019s Black.\n\nFor children who haven\u2019t grown up with the original \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d they are now growing up in an era where they can see anyone on screen, and that is how it should be. Adapting an animation into live-action offers creative liberation. There is no need to abide by animated aesthetics when there are actual actors involved. Casting should be dependent on skillset and heart, and director Rob Marshall found that in Halle Bailey. When her casting was announced in 2019,  #NotMyAriel  erupted on social media in direct protest of the Black protagonist. Racism was hidden underneath a veil of preserving nostalgia and core childhood memories. Twitter users complained about infidelity to the original character and that \u201cDisney had  tainted loyal fans\u2019 childhood memories .\u201d The film\u2019s official trailer, which was released in September, also received an overwhelming flood of hate, to the point where the dislikes were  disabled on Youtube . Contempt for the adaptation goes beyond logical film criticism. Much of the negativity is directly or indirectly about race.\n\nThere appears to be a lack of consideration for the children of today and the media they are growing up with. Whenever I scroll through TikTok, I come across another child\u2019s reaction to the new Ariel. Their eyes light up, and their pure excitement to see a magical character who looks like them reveals a much deeper importance that is widely overlooked: children are finally able to actually see themselves in Disney, and not just through animation. For a film that caters largely to young audiences, the emotional impact outweighs the backlash against the casting choice.\n\nIt\u2019s both heartwarming and concerning to see Black girls so happy and astonished when they realize the mermaid looks like them. While it\u2019s amazing to see today\u2019s youth growing up with more representative characters, this is also a testament to the continued lack of BIPOC representation. Out of all the 12 Disney princesses, seven are white, and Tiana is the only other Black protagonist (and she spent most of her time in the film in a frog\u2019s body). Halle Bailey will be the first Black Disney princess seen in live action. Black characters are still noticeably underrepresented in Disney animations. Despite the masses of children who grew up looking to these characters as role models, there are still those who don\u2019t see themselves on the big screens. The fairy tales and \u201chappily ever after\u201d are separate from them. They can look into the story from an outsider\u2019s perspective, but they can\u2019t be in it.\n\nFor all the Black girls who can finally see themselves in another Disney tale, this change is powerful. It is one thing to create a completely new story that involves Black characters, which is just as essential, but it\u2019s another to readapt a classic to break down our expectations of who the main character can look like. Some of the backlash about the new adaptation is about the idea of \u201c forced diversity .\u201d Rather than developing an authentic story that surrounds a Black protagonist, the retelling of \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d could be an easy way out for Disney to appear inclusive. To some, any alterations to the original is just a tactic to cater to a more progressive audience. Maybe Disney\u2019s diversity is performative, but even a facade of inclusivity is better than nothing, because now this story is accessible and relatable to a bigger audience.\n\nWhen discussing children\u2019s literature, author Rudine Sims Bishop\u2019s idea of \u201c Mirrors, Windows, and Sliding Glass Doors \u201d acknowledges how essential it is for children to see themselves reflected in the books they read. Those who already see themselves reflected should also see someone else be the hero. This directly applies to film, and especially to Disney movies. Maybe it is ultimately beneficial for a Black Ariel to jar non-Black audiences. They can be exposed to a heroine who does not look like them and expand their definitions of the Disney Princess \u201clook.\u201d The princess aesthetic is still one that needs reshaping; even through a lens of fantasy, protagonists should still feel relatable and human.\n\nIt is essential for children to see themselves on screen. Fiction is resonant. At a young age, viewers begin gauging a sense of the qualities that make up a princess, who has access to magic, and who deserves their own story. These films could really help them garner an invaluable sense of belonging\u2013if children can\u2019t even find themselves in fictional movies, then they are being set up to accept exclusion as normal. The classic \u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d will always exist for anyone who needs an adventure down memory lane. There is no breaking of tradition. Rather, there is an appreciation of it. Ariel\u2019s identity is not being compromised when there are more possibilities to what her identity is. She is a character created from imagination; she is not reserved for white audiences or confined to a particular aesthetic. No matter what, the heart and soul of \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d is staying with audiences\u2013the songs, the characters, and the story are not going anywhere.\n```"}

The United States beat France 2-1. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nBy Chris Nigro\nOctober 28, 2022 at 4:07 pm PDT\n\nFall is in full swing, but that doesn\u2019t mean beach volleyball stops. The Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour is never-ending \u2013 well until January, but I digress. The main tournaments going on right now are the Dubai UAE Challenge events. And yes, I said events plural because there are two back-to-back tournaments. Side note, Challenge level tournaments of the Beach Pro Tour (the international tour) is a feeder to the Elite 16 level events. Elite 16 is the highest level, and there is also a level below Challenge called Future which is typically for less established players.\n\nThe first Dubai event already concluded as it took place from October 22 to October 25. The next Elite 16 event will begin on November 2 in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nAmerican men showed out at the first Dubai event. Miles Partain and Trojan alum Andy Benesh became the first U.S. men to win gold at a Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour event. At only 20 years old, Partain also became one of the youngest players to win a Challenge event. Partain and Benesh dominated throughout the entire tournament. They only dropped a single set which came in the round of 16 against the Swedish pair Yves Haussener and Quentin M\u00e9tral. Even in that match, the third set was a blowout 15-7. Even the gold medal match wasn\u2019t particularly close as the Americans cruised to a 21-15, 21-17 win against Ukraine\u2019s Sergiy Popov and Eduard Reznik.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of our federation for doing a great job supporting us. We, the men, have been lacking a little bit and we are trying to find our way back on the map,\u201d Benesh said in an interview with Volleyball World.\n\nThere were three other American men\u2019s pairs at the event who performed well. Logan Webber and Evan Cory came from qualifying to finish fourth. On the way to their fourth-place finish, they beat fellow Americans Taylor Crabb and Paul Lotman in a tight three-set match. The last American team of Chase Budinger and Troy Field did not make it out of pool play.\n\nOn the women\u2019s side, there were more Americans there, but an American team didn\u2019t end up at the top of the podium. However, Katie Horton and USC alumna Julia Scoles did end up on the podium but just in third. This was Scoles\u2019 and Horton\u2019s first international event as a pair. Scoles and Horton came from qualifying and battled their way to the semi-finals. They ended up falling to the eventual champions from the Czech Republic, Barbora Hermannova and Marie-Sara Stochlova.\n\nTwo other American teams also made it all the way to the quarterfinals. Savannah Simo and Jessica Gaffney also lost to Hermannova and Stochlova. Simo and Gaffney won the second set in overtime, but then the Czechs dominated the third set winning 15-8. Xolani Hodel and USC alum Hailey Harward had their run come to an end at the hands of China\u2019s Xia Xinyi and Lin MeiMei in a two-set match where the American pair racked up 17 errors. Xia and Lin went on to place second.\n\nAll in all, it was a solid outing for the Americans on both sides of the tournament. Americans \u2014 particularly Trojan Americans \u2014 will look to continue their success into the second Dubai event going on right now which will conclude on October 30. I would look out for Harward and Hodel to make a run. They\u2019ve looked incredible at times but haven\u2019t played consistently enough to end up on the podium. If they can cut back on their errors, they can be a dangerous team. On the men\u2019s side, Crabb and Lotman are still trying to find their chemistry together, but if they can they can beat anyone. All the teams in Dubai are extremely talented, and it should be another exciting tournament.\n\nThe play of the \u201cweek\u201d is a jumpset executed to perfection by Americans Webber and Cory: JUMP SET to lose the block. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude33 \ud83d\udcfa Full match replays on VBTV. \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddea  #BeachProTourDubai   #BeachVolleyball \ud83d\udd1c Next Up: The 2nd Challenge event in Dubai \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddea Oct 27-30  pic.twitter.com/gMsIug6DYF \u2014 Beach Volleyball World (@BeachVBWorld)  October 26, 2022\n```"}

But, for the second time in school history, a Hispanic student is paving the field front and center as the drum major of the platinum-winning collegiate band. Jacobo Herrera is the person carrying the iconic and notable armor leading the  Trojan Marching Band , also known as \u201cThe Spirit of Troy.\u201d  Herrera is not only leading the band during football games, practices and performances; he is also a first-generation college student pioneering his way through USC.\n\nOriginally from San Bernardino, California, Herrera is a third-year student at the  Thornton School of Music,  majoring in music industry with a minor in classical studies. Having picked up his first instrument in elementary school, Herrera instantly fell in love with playing music. The trumpet and guitar are two of his main instruments.\n\nHerrera says his journey to USC was the result of fate, although he \u201calmost didn\u2019t apply [because] of the price of tuition and [because] of the demographics of the school.\u201d Once Herrera was accepted to USC, he thought, \u201cThere was no way you can say no to this school.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Herrera was voted by the marching band faculty and his peers to be the drum major for the 2022-2023 school year. \u201cI\u2019m the second Hispanic drum major and honestly, there is nothing like it,\u201d said Herrera. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m really the face for little kids like me that didn\u2019t really think something like this was possible.\u201d\n\nWhile the band allows Herrera to showcase representation, especially within the Hispanic community, the band also allows him to see the country while doing what he already loves: playing music. The band travels with the football team to away games and participates in parades to hype up the die-hard USC fans.\n\nBeing the drum major also comes with some major responsibility for Herrera. \u201cSetting the example as a leader is a bit tough when you have 300 members watching you all the time, but you really just have to keep your head down and do the hard work,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI really believe in servitude leadership and doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nDuring practice, Herrera serves as a teaching assistant, corrects music and is a problem solver on the field. Dr. Vogel, the director of the marching band, says Herrera illuminates what it means to be a \u201cleader of peers.\u201d \u201cHe has been growing the position. He is blazing a trail and setting a new standard for what future drum majors will be. He is just that great and is bringing the position up to him,\u201d said Vogel.\n\nIn front of almost 80,000 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Herrera uses a ten-pound sword to stab the field before the start of every home football game. Every time he drives the sword into the ground, the crowd bursts into a frenzy of cheers. USC is the only university in the nation that equips the drum major with a sword. And yes, the sword is real.\n\nAs the drum major, Herrera is the \u201cfield commander\u201d and is usually positioned at the head of the band. While holding a sword, Herrera conducts the band, keeping them in tempo.\n\nWhen Herrera is not practicing field commands or field stabs with his sword, you can find him playing mariachi on campus with Los Troyanos de USC. Herrera has been part of the mariachi band since his sophomore year. \u201cI enjoy playing with the mariachi here at USC because it\u2019s my outlet at the end of the day while doing something with my people and for my people,\u201d Herrera said.\n\nHe is thankful that the university has made him feel embraced as a Latino on campus. \u201cThere is no other university that has this sort of program for Hispanics,\u201d said Herrera. \u201cI feel really comfortable at USC knowing that I can walk into  La Casa  and speak to someone in Spanish and that I can play with the mariachi and I\u2019m playing something familiar...something I grew up with.\u201d\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Herrera is thankful for being part of the  USC Latino Alumni Association (LAA)  as a scholar. The association is one of the nation\u2019s leading Latino alumni associations devoted to the advancement of Latinx students at USC. Herrera says the association has provided him with invaluable opportunities that aid his personal and professional development and overall well-being.\n\nWhile being in the limelight as a drum major, balancing his academics and everything else that comes with being a first-generation student, Herrera\u2019s fuel is what he signifies for many others. \u201cI feel honored and humbled [that I am the drum major]. It means so much to me, to my family, to my people, to anyone who grew up in an urban area, and to people who grew up not even speaking English. It means so much to the little kids like me who didn\u2019t even know what college was until their freshman year of high school; it\u2019s a lot of honor,\u201d Herrera said.\n\nWhat moves Herrera forward is his family. Herrera\u2019s mother, Sofia Herrera-Mata, tears up watching every one of her son\u2019s performances. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t disappoint,\u201d Herrera-Mata said. \u201cBeing the second Hispanic Drum Major at USC is an honor to be a part of even as his mom. I\u2019m at the games. I\u2019m in the crowd. We are seeing our little Jacobito out there doing major things for more than just his family, but for the Hispanic and Spanish-speaking community. He\u2019s representing to other Latinos out there that if you dream it and put in the work for it, you can do it. \u00a1Si se puede!\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Herrera had a full schedule \u2013 he played in the school band, led the jazz band, was the student-body president and valedictorian while working a full-time job. Herrera\u2019s success does not surprise his mother. \u201cBeing in his position now as a drum major wasn\u2019t even a surprise for me. It felt like a given. He told me that when he got into USC, he was going to be in the greatest marching band \u2013 here we are now three years later,\u201d Herrera-Mata said.\n\nShe added, \u201cAs his mother, I\u2019m here to be his rock and his pillar to keep going and make the next generation of us go higher than our ancestors that laid the path before us. His win is our win.\u201d\n\nWhen Herrera returns home, he is always excited to see his two little sisters and his parents. \u201cKnowing that my mom is proud of me and that my dad is too means the world to me. On and off the field, they will be there no matter what, even if I wasn\u2019t the drum major,\u201d Herrera said.\n\nHerrera wants to showcase how barriers can be broken when you work diligently and chase your passions.\n```"}

(Photo by Tomoki Chien)\n\nBy Terence Holton October 28, 2022 at 2:58 pm PDT\n\nAfter a heartbreaking loss in Salt Lake City, the Trojans took advantage of a much needed bye week before heading to Arizona to play the Wildcats. The week before the bye, against Utah, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams and the entire Trojan offense put on an offensive spectacle where Williams put up 438 total yards and five touchdowns. Alas, injuries, an inability to stop Utah\u2019s offense and questionable officiating allowed the Utes to pull out the win in a tight game, 43-42.\n\nThis road trip should be a bit easier than the last but in no way should be written off as an easy win. This game is what you would call a trap game. That means, on paper, the Trojans should dominate, but this game could very easily turn into a loss if USC isn\u2019t prepared.\n\nThe Wildcats are a very different team than they have been the past few years. Arizona is led by sophomore quarterback Jayden de Laura. de Laura is second in passing yards and tied with Williams for second in passing touchdowns in the Pac-12. The Wildcats run an air raid offense, meaning they throw a whole lot. de Laura throws, on average, 39.3 times per game, and has 45 more pass attempts on the season than Williams.\n\nThe Arizona wide receivers are a three-headed monster. The Wildcats have two of the top five leaders in receiving yards in the Pac-12 in junior Jacob Cowing and sophomore Dorian Singer. Cowing is also tied for the most receiving touchdowns in the Pac-12 with seven. Arizona also has arguably the best freshman receiver in the country, Tetairoa McMillan, who is 12th in receiving yards and fourth in receiving touchdowns in the Pac-12.\n\nArizona\u2019s talented receivers may have a field day against the Trojans as the USC defense may be without two defensive leaders: sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry and senior linebacker Shane Lee. Gentry is considered \u201cday-to-day\u201d according to head coach Lincoln Riley and has not been ruled out yet. It\u2019s unclear if Lee will be able to suit up in Tucson.\n\nIf the Trojans want to win this game, they will need to shut down de Laura and Arizona\u2019s talented receiving corps. Utah junior quarterback Cameron Rising shredded the Trojans\u2019 secondary for 415 yards and two touchdowns. De Laura should not come remotely close to that state line, but it puts into perspective what the Trojan defense needs to work on.\n\nStopping de Laura and the Wildcats\u2019 wide receivers will bring the Arizona offense to a halt and should be priority No. 1 for the USC defense. This USC defense has been prone to giving up big plays to opponents\u2019 running backs. Though the Wildcats are not particularly great at running the ball, the Trojans still need to patch those holes on defense if they want to lock down their opponents.\n\nUSC\u2019s linebackers aren\u2019t the only key players dealing with injuries: the offense also took a hit against Utah. Junior wide receiver Jordan Addison sustained a leg injury during the game and it is still uncertain whether he will play against Arizona. If Addison is out, this will force younger receivers to fill his absence, such as sophomore Michael Jackson III who stepped up in the Utah game.\n\nThis being said, the offense should still roll on the Wildcats, who allow 454 yards per game. That\u2019s the second worst in the Pac-12. The Trojans should look to pound the ball on the run behind redshirt senior Travis Dye who was only allowed 11 rush attempts against Utah, compared to 28 against Washington State. Arizona allows 207.4 rushing yards per game, which is 121st in the country.\n\nIf the Trojans are able to run the ball effectively on a poor Arizona run defense, it should take some pressure off the passing game.\n\nCatch the Trojans taking on the Wildcats this Saturday at 4 p.m. on the Pac-12 Network.\n```"}

The program, known as the Middle Class Tax Refund, has sent out debit cards containing amounts of $200 to $1,050 that are set to arrive in mailboxes by November 5.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom originally proposed the $18.1 billion relief package in May, citing increasing inflation and financial struggles that have arisen since the pandemic as a reason that Californians need help.\n\n\u201cMany folks are still struggling, especially with high costs due to inflation, so we\u2019re leveraging this historic surplus to get money back into the pockets of Californians,\u201d Newsom said in a written statement. \u201cThis inflation relief package will help offset the higher costs that Californians are facing right now and provide support to those still recovering from the pandemic.\u201d\n\nTo be eligible for the refunds, residents must have filed their 2020 tax return by October 15, 2021, meet the state\u2019s adjusted gross income limits and must not have been claimed as a dependent. Citizens also need to have lived in California for at least six months and be local residents once the check is issued, according to the Franchise Tax Board\u2019s website.\n\nDebit cards will be mailed first to those whose last names start with A through E and then to last names starting with F through Z. Once the cards are received, they\u2019ll need to be activated online.\n\nThe Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, whose mission is to mobilize resources to fight hunger in the community, has seen the impact of families suffering from food insecurity and inflation as a cause of the pandemic.\n\nVictoria Lasavath, the marketing and communications manager for the food bank, said that \u201cbefore the pandemic, the food bank and our partner agency network of over 600 other organizations in L.A. County were seeing about 300,000 families in one month.\u201d\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, that all changed, Lasavath said. \u201cWhat stood out was that summer of 2020, even the summer of 2021, those numbers were reaching 900,000 to a million. And now, ... it\u2019s about 800,000. So it\u2019s come down, however, it\u2019s still relatively high,\u201d Lasavath said.\n\nFinancial experts are looking toward the inflation refund to potentially avoid a global financial crisis. Juan Andres Espinosa Torres, a doctoral student studying economics at USC, hopes the tax refund can help to avoid a recession.\n\n\u201cGiven that this aggregate trend of price increases is being stomped by the federal government itself, California can benefit by just bumping up demand a little bit,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWhat we might experience if we don\u2019t go into a recession is that we might end up close to our potential long-term sustainability.\u201d\n\nSome students hurt by the pandemic are especially looking forward to receiving the relief payments.\n\n\u201cMy partner was let go during the pandemic and I\u2019m definitely experiencing a lot of the negative consequences of the pandemic,\u201d said Hailee Chu, a graduate student studying film and television production and a California resident. \u201cHaving a little extra cash would help for sure.\u201d\n\nThe state expects most debit cards to go out by the end of the year.

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Adam Jasper October 27, 2022 at 7:42 pm PDT\n\nAt the end of the first half, the statsheet was lopsided. The Trojans outshot the Huskies 14 to three. They had eight corners to Washington\u2019s zero. They dominated possession and looked confident in moving the ball up the pitch. The score at the break? 1-1.\n\nAfter a first half of frustration, the Trojans needed a spark. Junior midfielder Croix Bethune was just that. She found herself on the end of a cross from sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio, daftly chipping the ball past the Washington keeper to regain the lead in the 47th minute.\n\nNo. 18 USC buckled down from there, winning its third-to-last Pac-12 matchup 2-1 against Washington at McAlister Field Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe just knew it was going to be an absolute fight,\u201d head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201c[At half], I just said we have to outwork the other team and go as hard as we possibly can. It felt like we did that.\u201d\n\nTwo USC starters suffered injuries over the course of the match. Bethune got tangled up with the Washington goalkeeper after scoring her second-half goal. She was carried off the field by her teammates and didn\u2019t return. Sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo suffered a leg injury and had to be helped off the field in the first half. There is no timetable for either of the injuries as of yet.\n\nThe Huskies sat back and absorbed the Trojans\u2019 pressure for much of the first half, relying on long balls forward to spur counter attacks. USC kept forcing the issue and broke through in the 11th minute. On their fifth corner of the match, Bethune\u2019s cross was flicked on by an Awujo header into the path of Sampaio, who found the back of the net for her first goal of the season.\n\nIt was all Trojans for the majority of the first half, but time and time again, the Huskies came up with big stops. Bethune had a pair of shots cleared off the line by a defender, and Washington graduate student keeper Olivia Sekany made five saves.\n\nAgainst the run of play, Washington freshman midfielder Kelsey Branson found a lane in behind the USC defense. Her initial shot was saved by graduate student goalkeeper Anna Smith, but Branson collected her own rebound and turned it in for the equalizer in the 42nd minute.\n\nUSC\u2019s center back duo of redshirt senior Kaylin Martin and sophomore Brooklyn Courtnall held down the Huskies attack down the stretch. They both played the entire 90 minutes.\n\n\u201cOur center backs have been fantastic all year, and they have a really good partnership,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cTwo totally different personalities and players, but they work really well together.\u201d\n\nSenior forward Hannah White made an impact in 32 minutes off the bench for the USC attack, registering a game-high six shots.\n\n\u201cShe created a bunch of chances and gave something to threaten [Washington],\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to pin the other team more than they can pin you.\u201d\n\nWashington wasn\u2019t afraid to get stuck in throughout the match. One member of the crowd affectionately dubbed the Huskies the \u201cDirty Dogs\u201d. Alukonis didn\u2019t make too much of the physical play, noting \u201cit was a tough game of soccer.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans now await results from Stanford and UCLA to see what lies ahead for the regular season title race. Regardless of the scores today, USC will be in contention with two games to go.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in a good spot right now,\u201d sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer said. \u201cIf we play like we did today against Washington State and UCLA, we\u2019ll get the outcome we want.\u201d\n\nUSC will host Washington State in its penultimate Pac-12 regular season game 12 p.m. Sunday Oct. 30 at McAlister Field.\n```"}

I hope the Iowa State product returns better than ever in 2023, but fantasy football waits for no one. Neither does Jets General Manager Joe Douglas. Douglas heralded high praise from the green and white faithful since taking over the wheel for the franchise during the 2019 offseason. He showed why he deserves it when he wasted no time on Monday, the same day Hall\u2019s timeline was confirmed. He nabbed running back James Robinson from the Jaguars in exchange for a conditional 5th round draft pick.\n\nRobinson is a tough runner who took the football world by storm as an undrafted rookie in 2020. He rushed for over 1000 yards and just squeaked into the NFL Top 11 Players list at the end of the season, being voted into the final spot by his peers. While he doesn\u2019t possess Hall\u2019s stature or speed, he is a talented back who allows the Jets to continue to lean on a talented tandem of runners between Robinson and the second-year man Michael Carter.\n\nThis injury and subsequent trade has plenty of fantasy implications. First, obviously if Breece Lightning was carrying your team, you\u2019re going to need a substitute. The first logical thought was that Michael Carter would be receiving the bulk of the work in New York\u2019s backfield going forward. Those who were ecstatic to have Carter stashed on their bench quickly flipped their attitude when the trade was announced, thinking that Carter was no longer a viable option. Is that fully true? Absolutely not. Of course Carter will not be getting a high majority workload like we expected, but James Robinson will also not garner the same volume of touches as Hall. Carter will still get his fair share of opportunities. Plus, we\u2019ve already seen that head coach Robert Salah and company are comfortable going to him in the red zone. He only had one less red zone rushing attempt than Hall on the season, who had morphed into the lead back as the year progressed. Not to mention Carter\u2019s touches should be inflated this Sunday as Robinson will be entering the game on a short week of practice with his new squad, first suiting up at the Jets practice facility this Wednesday. I do expect him to be utilized against New England this weekend, but he will not be up to speed on a season\u2019s worth of practice.\n\nThe flip side of this trade is that Travis Etienne fantasy owners should be ecstatic. The second-year rusher is effectively making his debut this season due to injuries he incurred last year. He\u2019s now clearly the leader of Jacksonville\u2019s backfield.\n\nGo Get Gus\n\nGus Edwards returned to the field with a statement this weekend, operating as a workhorse in his first game of the 2022 season. Gus Edwards was activated off the PUP list in response to another JK Dobbins knee injury heading into Sunday\u2019s divisional matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns. Edwards saw no shortage of work, rushing for 66 yards and two touchdowns on 16 attempts. With Dobbins out for the foreseeable future, he is a legit RB2 in most fantasy leagues. He may not have the receiving upside of some other backs in today\u2019s NFL, but he does have the volume and red zone touches needed to put up numbers. Edwards is currently available in over 50% of ESPN leagues.\n\nThose were the highlights from my absence that I felt warranted a mention this week. Breece Hall and the fallout that transpired definitely had the largest impact on fantasy lineups so far this season, but with the trade deadline fast approaching, that\u2019s subject to change. You can bet if a trade rocks the fantasy football world in the coming weeks, I\u2019ll be talking about it. \u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

The tweet assures them that the platform will not become a \u201cfree-for-all hellscape,\u201d a concern expressed by Twitter users and advertising firms alike\u2014especially after Musk said that he would allow former President Donald Trump back on Twitter after he was banned following the insurrection on January 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cHe may be sounding this conciliatory note for the short term to keep everyone from fleeing the ship,\u201d said Professor Freddy Nager, lecturer of communication at USC Annenberg. \u201cBut again, we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d\n\nAfter Musk, the owner of Tesla, attempted to back out of the deal, legal pressure from Twitter forced him back in line. He then threatened to layoff three-quarters of Twitter employees, which some observers took to be a new strategy to avoid buying the company for $44 billion.\n\nWhen visiting Twitter headquarters in San Francisco, Musk carried a sink in with him and then posted a video of it with the caption, \u201clet that sink in!\u201d While he may have come to terms with the deal, advertisers are not necessarily as enthusiastic.\n\nAs reported by the Wall Street Journal, \u201cadvertisers are concerned about the billionaire\u2019s plans to soften content moderation and what they say are potential conflicts of interest in auto advertising.\u201d\n\nDavid Craig, a clinical professor of communication at USC Annenberg elaborated on content moderation concerns. \u201cContent moderation across all platforms is perhaps one of the most complicated and difficult issues of our day... because speech and money have now been intertwined in a way that we\u2019ve never really had before,\u201d Craig said. \u201cSo we\u2019re dealing with First Amendment issues in the context of a commercial public space, but privately held platforms.\u201d\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s Twitter message, Musk justified his decision to buy Twitter. \u201cThe reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital square,\u201d Musk wrote. He has previously referred to himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist,\u201d and said that people should be able to say \u201cpretty outrageous things\u201d on Twitter, adding that the platform \u201cempowers citizen journalism...without an establishment bias.\u201d\n\nHe is expected to address Twitter\u2019s employees on Friday, the day the deal is supposed to go through. \u201cIt\u2019s already sent shockwaves throughout the Twitter corporation,\u201d Nager said. \u201cEmployees are baffled. They\u2019re scared. You know, him coming out saying that he would want to layoff 75% of the employees does not do a whole lot for morale.\u201d\n\nThe implications of Musk\u2019s Twitter buy are still left to be seen with his coming decisions. \u201cI believe the right position is to wait and see what happens,\u201d Craig said. \u201cBut [we should] treat whatever happens with a high level of skepticism,\u201d adding that as time goes on, we will get a clearer picture of Musk\u2019s intentions.\n\nGordon Stables, the director of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, mentioned similar thoughts about Musk\u2019s impact. \u201cThe consequences could be very wide ranging depending on some of the changes that he might make in terms of changes to content moderation policy, changes to advertising policy and/or the ability to share across his different business models,\u201d Stables said.\n\nSome are more concerned with issues relating to free speech. \u201cI think [advertisers\u2019] concerns are relevant to them, but in the bigger scheme of things, freedom of speech is more important in my mind,\u201d Sean Hall, a sophomore majoring in physics, said. \u201cAnd if the advertisers have an issue with it, or they feel like it\u2019s not safe to post there, there are millions of other sites to post their advertisements on.\u201d\n\nThis big-money deal is backed by a multitude of investors, including over $1 billion from Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia. With this investment and the $1 billion from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Musk and other new Twitter investors have numerous business interests that, critics say, could lead to conflicts of interest.\n\nAlthough there are many concerns over the changes in Twitter, Craig believes that the impact is being blown out of proportion. \u201cThis idea that Twitter is singularly capable of destroying or negatively influencing the way that the world thinks is not well founded by the reach and scale of the platform.\u201d```"}

Olivia Nazari: \u201cIt just depends on how he goes about it because it\u2019s also stupid to say that, like, he\u2019s never going to get back in, like he\u2019s going to get canceled because he\u2019s kind of been canceled before.\u201d\n\nThis once again brings up the constant debate of if you can separate the art from the artist.

Um, if listening to his music is something that you like to do, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you like him as a person. I just think that they\u2019re that they can be defined as two different things.\u201d\n\nYe is no stranger to controversy, infamously saying that \u201cslavery was a choice\u201d on TMZ in 2018, and more recently wearing a White Lives Matter shirt during a Paris fashion show. Sophomore Ethan Kaiser is unsure if he will be granted an opportunity to make up for what he\u2019s done. Ethan Kaiser: \u201dI\u2019d say there\u2019s a lot of unknown. I think any decent person should be able to apologize or should be able to come clean about it. So I would say, yes, he should have that opportunity, too. Will he be forgiven necessarily? I\u2019m not sure. But he should at least try and make an effort to come back from this.\u201d\n\nToday Ye doubled down on his statements in an Instagram post insisting that what he says is \u201clove speech\u201d and regardless of the monetary loss will continue to say what he\u2019s been saying.\n```"}

The EU\u2019s new legislation aims to standardize cables. Mahlon Howard, a network administrator at Lucas Horsfall Public Accountants, explains.\n\nMahlon Howard: \u201cSo that let\u2019s say if somebody were to have one or two cables that had USB-C in the house, that would be able to universally charge most, if not all of their electronic devices. That includes laptops, smartphones now. And of course, like anything else, like gaming consoles or appliances.\u201d\n\nThe USB-C, nicknamed the \u201dcommon port\u201d, will be able to charge androids, iPhones, laptops and other devices. Some are upset about having to buy yet another Apple product in the form of a charger, while others are excited about the standardization of products.\n\nWhile this switch was not the personal choice of Apple, Mahlon explained that this switch is very effective in the long run. Mahlon Howard: \u201cIt is a huge win because like I said before, this would allow universal use of the USB-C. So then you don\u2019t have to one, you don\u2019t have to purchase extra cabling. And two, you can use it for other people other than yourself, you know, in comparison to the currently used thunderbolt from Apple.\u201d\n\nDespite both of us being iPhone users, Mahlon was very adamant about how this benefits us and how it puts Apple, the unchecked Giant, at one of their first ever disadvantages. Mahlon Howard: \u201cSo now that they\u2019ve been challenged and they can\u2019t just milk the money of the average consumer, hopefully this pushes governments to regulate that kind of monopoly on electronics. So I think this is a huge win for the average consumer.\u201d\n\nThis legislation comes as a response to years of Apple monopolizing the tech market. This change will be implemented over the next year as a step towards heavier regulation on Silicon Valley.\n```"}

(Photo Courtesy of Evan Agostini/ AP Photo)\n\nBy Colton Lucas October 27, 2022 at 3:44 pm PDT\n\nIn the aftermath of Kanye West's antisemitic statements via Twitter and various public platforms, there's growing concern among Jewish communities that antisemitism will now be on the rise. Despite the suspension of his Twitter account on October 9 over a tweet calling for the endangerment of Jewish people, West, who has since changed his name to Ye, continued to make dangerous comments about Jewish people on podcasts and television segments.\n\nFollowing Ye's disparaging statements, Los Angeles saw several prominent antisemitic incidents, including a gathering of an antisemitic hate group on the 405 freeway and the distribution of antisemitic fliers in Beverly Hills. Antisemitic incidents in the United States were at an all-time high in 2021, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Physical assaults shot up by 167%, while harassment increased by 43% since 2020.\n\nRabbi Dov Wagner, director of USC's Chabad Jewish Student Center, said the type of dangerous rhetoric used by Ye isn't new, with antisemitism harming Jewish people for thousands of years. \"[Ye] doesn't deserve this kind of attention,\" Wagner said. \"Even as an antisemite, he's nothing new or out of the ordinary... The only difference is the amount of people paying attention right now. Antisemitism has existed throughout history and it's been very commonly bandied about.\"\n\nWagner said it's somewhat \"disconcerting\" to see people starting to only care about antisemitism now after Ye's comments when that support is long overdue. Wagner said educating people on antisemitism is a key part of the solution, especially for non-Jewish folks. Part of that includes people educating themselves on the cultural and religious practices of Judaism.\n\nYe previously appeared on NewsNation and claimed he didn't believe in the term \"antisemitic\" or that he could be an antisemite because he self-identified as Jewish, a tactic Joshua Holo dismissed as \"aggressively antisemitic.\" Holo, dean of L.A.'s Hebrew Union College, said it's illogical to single out Jewish people as a cause of evil while simultaneously denying the existence of antisemitism.\n\nHolo said Ye's attempt to define the Jewish experience and dismiss the hatred Jewish people face should be called out and debunked. \"What could be more virulent an attack than to say to someone 'your experience doesn't even matter,' \u2014 it's dehumanizing, it's erasure,\" Holo said.\n\nYe has more than 31.5 million Twitter followers, meanwhile the Jewish population is estimated at just over 15.2 million, according to the Jewish Agency for Israel. With Ye attracting more Twitter followers than the estimated number of Jewish people around the world, the repercussions of granting antisemitism such a large platform are inescapable for Jewish communities, he said.\n\nThe language people use cannot be taken back nor can its impact, Holo explains. In the wake of Ye's antisemitic behavior, several companies ended contracts with the rapper, including Balenciaga, Gap, Creative Artists Agency and most recently Adidas. Beverly Hills-based film and TV studio MRC announced it would not be distributing an already finished documentary centered on Ye.\n\nSeeing companies take agency and reprimand Ye for his actions is important, but it's only one step on the path forward, Holo said. Senior Rabbi Steve Leder of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple hopes Ye's dangerous words enlighten people who are unaware of how blatant and common antisemitism is in the world.\n\nWhat's crucial now is continuing to dismantle antisemitic influence, Leder said. \"I would hope people now accept as fact what many suspected before and stop giving voice and attention to anyone filled with so much ignorant hatred,\" Leder said. \"I don't think the motivation matters, poison is poison.\"\n\nLeder said antisemitism tends to operate on a pendulum; throughout history it's held various levels of influence over societies. It doesn't matter where that pendulum lands now or how much influence Ye truly wields because \"a little bit [of hatred] once ignored becomes metastatic.\"\n\nWhether they know it or not, people have power to stop the spread of antisemitism, Leder said. Everyone exerts influence and power in their own social circles, and fighting back could be as simple as calling out those around us when they engage in antisemitic behavior.\n\nIt's important the Jewish community in L.A. continues to also fight back against the negative stereotypes and tropes often used against them, Leder said. Now is the time for the community to \"be loud, and be proud.\"\n\nAs the L.A. community grapples with the aftermath of recent antisemitism, Leder said everybody, Jewish or not, needs to come together to start rebuilding connections for the next time a crisis emerges. \"The worst time to try to build a bridge is in a crisis,\" Leder said. \"Let's use this time we have now to build bridges so that when we need each other, we can easily reach out and connect and support each other.\"\n\nLogan Barth, a student member of USC Hillel, said it's disheartening to see how prevalent antisemitism continues to be in world where Jewish people have been persecuted for thousands of years. Barth said his family was lucky to escape the atrocities committed during the Holocaust in the 20th century, but the way Jewish people are treated now harkens back to the beginning of Nazi Germany.\n\nWhat began as just words led to the persecution and murder of millions of Jewish people, Barth said. Now, more than 100 years after the formation of the German Nazi party, Barth said neo-Nazis are embolded to spread the same hatred for Jews in cities like L.A.\n\nFighting antisemitism isn't just a cause, Barth said. It's simply humanity. \"We've already seen an increase in antisemitism, but I think we can stop it before it gets bad,\" Barth said. \"Obviously the Jewish community is standing up to it, but we do need non-Jewish people to stand up to it as well. And that's how we can move away from a rise in antisemitism.\"\n\nA couple of years ago, Wagner was at a gas station on the corner of Adams and Figueroa, a mile from USC. When a person experiencing homelessness approached him for money, Wagner took him inside the gas station and offered to buy him food and a drink. The station attendant looked at the rabbi and said people like Wagner simply don't do stuff like that, and later remarked he must be rich if he's willing to help someone who is homeless.\n\nWagner said within 20 seconds, this stranger expressed two negative stereotypes about Jewish people. Looking back, Wagner doesn't believe the attendant knew how offensive his words were, but it shows how deeply ingrained antisemitism is in people's minds.\n\nDespite the growing prevalence of antisemitism, Wagner said \"a little bit of light dispels a lot of darkness.\" \"Many have remarked on the miracle of Jewish survival \u2014 we are still here and thriving,\" Wagner said. \"This is actually a moment of tremendous light...As people, we need to be strong and proud of who we are.\"\n```"}

The sound of gritos from my instructor and fellow dancers, the crowd in an uproar. I feel larger than life. Ironically, it\u2019s in the moments that follow that performance, like when my friend\u2019s sweet mother congratulates me in Spanish, that I\u2019m brought back down into that small corner where I, and other \u201cno sabo\u201d kids, reside.\n\nI\u2019m proud of my Mexican heritage. It has defined my childhood, my taste pallet, and it keeps me grounded to this day, and yet, it feels like something I\u2019m not qualified enough to claim. Simply because I\u2019m missing the most important qualification: speaking Spanish. When my mother immigrated to the U.S. at age 12, she spent years struggling with learning English, an existence she swore she would never let her kids endure. And she kept that promise too well, only teaching me English, with some scattered Spanglish.\n\nIt\u2019s a reality I\u2019ve begrudgingly coexisted in for as long as I can remember. However, looking past all the teasing, I still found a sense of community at home, in my neighborhood, at school, and at all spaces that were predominantly Latinx. That all changed when I entered college, 1,546 miles away from my home in Houston, to a predominantly white institution in sunny Los Angeles.\n\nNavigating university was already a challenge for a first-generation student like me. Here I was, clinging to my heritage for comfort and desperate for the connections I had back home. Then I saw it, in the fall of my freshman year: a familiar, bright colored dress, draped on the side of an involvement booth. \u201cGrupo Folkl\u00f3rico de USC,\u201d the sign read.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, baile folkl\u00f3rico is a Mexican traditional dance that varies by region. Each state in Mexico has its own vestuario (dressware), footwork, faldeo (skirt work), and music that\u2019s reflective of the region\u2019s culture. What they all have in common, though, is that each dance tells a story.\n\nI danced folkl\u00f3rico in kindergarten, for a very brief period of time, but had always wanted to dance it again growing up. There was also a subconscious desire to \u201cfeel\u201d more qualified of my heritage. I stopped by to say hello, and before I knew it, dozens of practices, four performances, my election as president, and four showcases later, I\u2019m a senior preparing for my last D\u00eda de los Muertos showcase ever.\n\nFor our 2022 spring showcase, my dance partner, Adrian Becerra, and I, are performing a song from the region of Veracruz. \u201cIt\u2019s just a unique thing to be a part of, it\u2019s something that most people, not even Mexican American people really know about it,\u201d said Adrian Becerra, my dance partner.\n\nThis year, Becerra and I will be dancing \u201cLa Peque\u00f1ita\u201d for our upcoming showcase, a partner dance from the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Chihuahua has been a region I\u2019ve only admired from a distance, simply because the style of dancing was too difficult for me to attempt. Now, with almost four years of skills under my belt, I couldn\u2019t turn away the opportunity to give it a shot. Not to mention, Becerra and I are both seniors graduating next semester, so it was now or never.\n\nBecerra grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood, 30 minutes outside of Sacramento, so avenues to his heritage were hard to come by outside folkl\u00f3rico. He has danced folkl\u00f3rico for 16 years. It was a hobby his parents initially got him into that turned into something he genuinely enjoyed, so much so he intentionally sought out a group in college.\n\n\u201cAside from the little bit of Spanish that we spoke in the house growing up, I never really had anything that made me feel all that Mexican,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was cool to have this that really helped me feel connected to where my parents came from.\u201d\n\nBeyond its connection to community and Mexican heritage, dancing folkl\u00f3rico is also a way to rekindle part of a culture that has been lost to generations of assimilation to this country. Looking back at our group\u2019s origins, dating back to the 1970s, Grupo Folkl\u00f3rico de USC\u2019s establishment was an exclamation to our institution, and the ones surrounding it, that we\u2019ve always been here, and we will still be here.\n\nSince its re-establishment in 2017 by an alum who still dances with the group to this day, our instructor Dahlia Monroy has been with the group since 2018. As a USC graduate student at the time, it so happened she planned on attending the first practice as a member. That was up until she was asked to fill in for the instructor, two hours before practice. She\u2019s been teaching the group ever since.\n\n\u201cI always say, learn it now so that it doesn\u2019t die with me or it doesn\u2019t die with whoever you\u2019re learning it from, you keep on passing down that tradition,\u201d Monroy said. \u201cI think one of the most powerful things about folkl\u00f3rico is that it\u2019s something you have to learn between each other.\u201d\n\nFor over 10 years, dancing folkl\u00f3rico has helped Monroy learn more about herself, and how she wants to support people like her, especially younger folks. She\u2019s a fourth grade bilingual teacher at Pico Union, and has recently started her own folkl\u00f3rico group with the kids at her school.\n\nEvery Monday and Wednesday, fall and spring in the USC Village, and simply every time we put on our shoes, it\u2019s a commitment to keeping the tradition, our culture alive, and most of all, it\u2019s a celebration. For me, it\u2019s also an exploration of my identity as Mexican American, and the pride that comes from being my mother\u2019s daughter.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m able to see folks connect with their families, connect with their culture, connect with themselves really, and at a time that is so pivotal to their development as adults, I\u2019ve done my job,\u201d Monroy said.\n\nLooking back at 18-year-old me, I realized my misguided search for \u201cqualification\u201d came from a place of insecurity, and dancing folkl\u00f3rico led me to discover that heritage was never a competition. Rather, it\u2019s meant to be indulged in, shared with one another in spaces like the one folkl\u00f3rico creates, and celebrated together with folks who love the art and our culture.\n\nI danced a song from the region of Jalisco for our 2022 spring showcase, Sones de mi Tierra, at the USC Village.\n\nFolkl\u00f3rico has given me the confidence to stand firm in my identity, acknowledge my Spanish shortcomings, and show off a little zapateado de tres here or there.

As my last D\u00eda de los Muertos performance, I\u2019ll be giving it my all, so that the community may enjoy everything folkl\u00f3rico has given me.

Rodman wakes up early, meditates, makes an espresso and goes hunting for a superyacht. The ship Rodman is looking for is valued at $100 million and spans over 215 feet. It also belongs to Los Angeles mayoral candidate and former USC Board of Trustees Chair Rick Caruso.\n\nRodman is the artistic director of Sundance Screenwriting Labs and governor of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He is a former union organizer. Rodman said he first became aware of the yacht, named the Invictus, during the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal. Olivia Jade, who was one of the most prominent beneficiaries and the daughter of actress Lori Loughlin, was on the Invictus when the news broke. She was with Caruso\u2019s daughter Gianna, a former USC student.\n\nAfter learning of the Invictus during the announcement of Loughlin\u2019s indictment, Rodman launched a self-described \u201cconceptual art project\u201d to tweet its location every morning. Most days, Rodman doesn\u2019t receive many likes. But for him, engagement isn\u2019t the purpose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of daily devotional activity for me. Most days I get two likes, four likes. I think the most I\u2019ve ever gotten was like eight or nine. So it\u2019s clearly not getting massive engagement and it\u2019s been very much below the radar,\u201d Rodman said.\n\nHow does one find a superyacht? \u201c[I]t\u2019s really easy,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cYou go to any number of websites. If you Google \u201cmaritime tracking,\u201d you\u2019ll find one or two of them and you just enter \u201cInvictus\u201d and it\u2019ll tell you where it is, as you can with almost any named ship.\u201d Because the information is public, Rodman\u2019s ship-hunting is legally above board.\n\nRodman\u2019s daily tracking takes him to different parts of the world. One day it\u2019s Cannes in the French Riviera, then Sanremo, Italy and then onto Boston, where it recently stayed for 23 days. There is no information about who is actually using the yacht, just its whereabouts.\n\nFitting that Rick Caruso, the soi-disant \"Latin\" candidate for Mayor of LA, gave his one-hundred-million-dollar 215-foot superyacht a Latin name: Invictus. Which means undefeated. We shall see.\n\nSo when Caruso threw his hat in the ring for mayor, Rodman looked to the high seas. Rodman said he tweets the location of the superyacht to beg the question: \u201cDoes [Caruso] really understand what it is [like] for the wild majority of us to live in L.A.?\u201d\n\nCaruso\u2019s wealth extends well beyond the ship, which sleeps nine and staffs 12. Forbes lists his net worth at $5.3 billion. Caruso built his wealth by developing shopping centers. Some of his properties, owned through his privately held real estate company Caruso, include The Grove, The Americana and The Commons in Calabasas.\n\nBoth Caruso\u2019s campaign and the campaign of Rep. Karen Bass, his opponent in the mayoral race, declined to comment. Caruso is no stranger to USC. A 1980 Marshall alum, he was chair of the Board of Trustees from 2018 to 2022 and donated over $25 million to the Keck School of Medicine to endow the USC Tina and Rick Caruso Department of Otolaryngology. The USC Catholic Center also has his name, after his family donated the lead gift to build the center and Our Savior Parish Church.\n\nLongtime Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, a USC political science professor and head of the Center for Political Future who worked on eight presidential campaigns, emphasized that a politician\u2019s wealth does not determine their success. \u201cBeing very wealthy is not disqualifying for political candidates,\u201d Shrum said.\n\nShrum noted that both Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy both came from wealthy families and enjoyed both political success and massive popularity. \u201cVoters thought [FDR and the Kennedys] cared about them and they understood their problems, and that they would deal with those problems,\u201d Shrum said.\n\nFor the Caruso-Bass race, Shrum believes policies on homelessness and crime will ultimately swing voters, not personal wealth. \u201cThey\u2019re at the top of the agenda and [voters] will make a judgment about that,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite his commitment to the Invictus hunt, Rodman said he doesn\u2019t expect it to change any votes and he\u2019s \u201cnot under any illusion that this will affect the outcome of the mayoral race.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not saying anything about Rick Caruso\u2019s character,\u201d said Rodman, who according to Open Secrets, has donated to progressive candidates. \u201cI am not saying anything about him personally. Really what I\u2019m saying, and no more, no less, is that there\u2019s a guy running for mayor of Los Angeles who has a $100 million, 215 foot yacht. Period.\u201d\n\nElection Day is November 8.\n```"}

(Photo by Sarah Ko)\n\nBy Terence Holton October 26, 2022 at 9:44 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s that time of the year again. College basketball is back. With the release of the first AP men\u2019s basketball poll of the season, it\u2019s time to take a look at how the Pac-12 is shaping up.\n\nUCLA (2021-22 Record: 27-8)\nThe primordial Darth Vader of the Pac-12 returns for another year. The Bruins come into the season ranked No. 8 in the AP poll. UCLA returns long-term leaders senior guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. and redshirt senior guard Tyger Campbell. Coupled with freshman phenoms guard Amari Bailey and forward Adem Bona, the team\u2019s experience and young talent are what drive the Bruins\u2019 case for being considered a top-10 team and give them a strong argument for preseason No. 1 in the Pac-12.\n\nArizona (2021-22 Record: 33-4)\nEven after losing three of its best players to the NBA draft, the Wildcats are ready to repeat as Pac-12 champions. Ranked No. 17 in the preseason AP poll, Arizona is led by juniors forward Azuolas Tubelis and guard Kerr Kriisa. Tommy Lloyd\u2019s team will look to keep up its high-scoring regime after climbing to No. 3 in the nation in points per game last year.\n\nOregon (2021-22 Record: 20-15)\nAfter falling short of high preseason expectations last year, the Ducks once again reloaded in the transfer portal, nabbing two Power 5 guards: junior Keeshawn Barthelemy and redshirt senior Jermaine Couisnard. The No. 21 Ducks will be led by fifth year guard Will Richardson and have one of the strongest front courts in the nation, with senior center N\u2019Faly Dante, sophomore center Nate Bittle and freshman center Kel\u2019el Ware locking down the paint.\n\nUSC (2021-22 Record: 26-8)\nWith a mix of talented freshmen and veteran leadership, the Trojans will look to take back the throne of the Pac-12. Fifth year guard Drew Peterson and senior guard Boogie Ellis are the anchors of this team and headline an extremely talented guard group this year. Watch out for a small ball, guard-heavy lineup this year from the Trojans, despite immense young talent at power forward and center.\n\nStanford (2021-22 Record: 16-16)\nStanford may be the biggest dark horse to win the Pac-12 this year. Returning its two highest scorers from last year, sophomore forward Harrison Ingram and senior forward Spencer Jones, the Cardinal are seriously underrated coming into the season. Stanford added more scoring with graduate transfer guard Michael Jones, who averaged 11.8 points last season at Davidson. Don\u2019t sleep on the Cardinal this year.\n\nColorado (2021-22 Record: 21-12)\nEven though the Buffaloes lost their top three scorers from last season, they will still look to contend in the Pac-12. Sophomore guard KJ Simpson will be handed the reins to the team after showing much promise his freshman year. A pair of Ivy League transfers will hope to make up for the team\u2019s potential lack of scoring, as well as junior forward Tristan da Silva who will provide defense down low.\n\nArizona State (2021-22 Record: 14-17)\nBobby Hurley went out and scored big in the transfer portal, landing four solid transfers in sophomore guard Frankie Collins, senior forward Warren Washington and brothers senior guard Devan Cambridge and fifth year guard Desmond Cambridge Jr. Returning much of their team from last year including exciting players such as junior guard DJ Horne and sophomore forward Marcus Bagley, the Sun Devils have nowhere to go but up.\n\nWashington State (2021-22 Record: 22-15)\nYet another team that could shock fans in the 2022-23 basketball season is Washington State. Though the Cougars lost leading scorer guard Michael Flowers, sophomore forward Mouhamed Gueye is primed for a breakout year. Additionally, junior guard TJ Bamba and freshman center Adrame Diongue look to surprise a lot of teams.\n\nWashington (2021-22 Record: 17-15)\nThe Huskies lost their only two double-digit scorers, but landed a top-tier recruiting class in the transfer portal. Highlighted by Kentucky transfer senior forward Keion Brooks, Washington looks to change what has been an extremely disappointing last few years. The Huskies also nabbed two big centers, junior Franck Kepnang from Oregon and junior Braxton Meah from Fresno State, giving them great depth at center.\n\nUtah (2021-22 Record: 11-20)\nUtah will need their transfers to step up in a big way if they are to be any different from last year. The Utes do return their leading scorer, senior center Branden Carlson, but will need players such as sophomore guard Lazar Stefanovic and Cincinnati transfer junior guard Mike Saunders Jr. to be leaders if they want to have any success this year.\n\nCal (2021-22 Record: 12-20)\nThe Golden Bears can be looked at with some upside as they return three big front court options \u2014 senior forward Lars Thiemann, senior forward Kuany Kuany and sophomore forward Sam Alajiki \u2014 while also adding freshmen forwards ND Okafor and Grant Newell to the roster. Cal also snagged former four-star recruit junior guard Devin Askew from the transfer portal. However, they lost arguably their three best players and three highest scorers. With no real competition at point guard, Cal fans can hope Askew will finally live up to his high school ranking.\n\nOregon State (2021-22 Record: 3-28)\nLower your expectations, Beaver fans. After what can only be described as a horrific performance last season, Oregon State may be in for another rocky season. Oregon State lost its five highest scorers, including the team\u2019s only true bright spot from last season, guard Jarod Lucas. The Beavers have nine freshmen and only secured one transfer, sophomore guard Christian Wright from Georgia who will likely miss most of the season with a torn meniscus. Like I said, lower your expectations.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nOctober 26, 2022 at 9:28 pm PDT\n\nSophomore quarterback Caleb Williams ran out of the tunnel and onto Howard Jones Field like a man on a mission for Wednesday\u2019s practice. As Williams and the No. 10 Trojans (6-1, 4-1 in conference play) prepare for their matchup against the Arizona Wildcats (3-4, 1-3 in conference play) this Saturday, they are practicing with the same intensity they would against a ranked opponent. This intensity has been there ever since USC\u2019s last game against Utah.\n\n\u201cThere was a certain confidence, a certain swagger as we like to call it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe just get to work on being consistent.\u201d\n\nThis energy was not just limited to Williams and the offense during practice, but the entire team as well. Even though the defense gave up 43 points in its last appearance against Utah on Oct. 15, sophomore linebacker Raesjon Davis says the whole team is practicing with that same swagger.\n\n\u201cWe came out here, got it cracking on Tuesday and Wednesday,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been really focused. I feel like we\u2019re ready to go compete.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have tried to use this focused energy to find consistency on both sides of the ball. Defensive coordinator Alex Grinch likes how the defense played in the first six games, but wants the defense to get back to forcing turnovers and getting sacks in the next couple games.\n\n\u201cWe expect guys to be in the backfield,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we need more of. There\u2019s been moments where I feel we\u2019ve done that, and there have been other moments where I\u2019m not sure that we have.\u201d\n\nToughness, however, has been consistent for the Trojans throughout the whole season. Earlier in the year, redshirt junior linebacker Tuasivi Nomura broke his finger during a game, but he did not tell anyone and kept playing.\n\n\u201cThe fact he played through it, it shows the type of guy he is,\u201d Davis said.\n\nPlaying through injuries has become common on the team.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a couple guys playing with clubs, but nobody cares,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cThey signed up for football, and they play on defense. That\u2019s not extra.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans also exhibited mental toughness after their first loss of the season at Utah and hope to never lose like that again this season.\n\n\u201cRight after the game, there was a certain energy about the team when we were in the locker room,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThese past two weeks, we realized we lost, we accepted it, but we can\u2019t do anything about it except learn from it.\u201d\n\nEven though the Wildcats have four losses through seven games, the Trojans know they still have to play well to win. The Trojans were ranked higher than Utah when they played each other, but USC still lost on the road. Arizona, despite its record, boasts a potent offense headlined by wide receiver transfer Jacob Cowing.\n\nThe Trojans know they will have to fix some of their mistakes from the Utah game to beat Arizona, particularly with defending the Wildcats\u2019 tight ends.\n\n\u201cWe have been working a lot on getting out of breaks better. That\u2019s been a big emphasis with coach Odom,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019re really ready for [Arizona]. We\u2019re not taking them lightly.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans suffered their first setback in a promising first season under head coach Lincoln Riley. But they do not want that loss to stop them from making a run.\n\n\u201cWe got punched in the face and we\u2019re gonna get back up and go punch somebody else in the face,\u201d Williams said.\n```"}

Styles\u2019 voice, charm, charisma, and even his good looks have propped him up on a pedestal, setting him apart from his former One Direction bandmates. Because of these traits, Styles was crowned the new \u201cking of pop\u201d in the Rolling Stones U.K. October/November issue of this year, which was published in August. This new title brought a lot of scrutiny to Styles\u2019 name.\n\nCausing controversy isn\u2019t something Styles is shy of \u2013 he has been on many magazine covers like Rolling Stone, GQ, and the highly controversial cover of Vogue, which featured him wearing a dress. This fashion choice caused a huge uproar from people all over the world, with arguments that American society needed to bring \u201cmanly\u201d men back.\n\nComparison to Michael Jackson, who was famously dubbed the real \u201cking of pop,\u201d is probably one of the most controversial things an artist can face nowadays. Michael Jackson is seen as untouchable, so a comparison is a big deal, and it\u2019s not commonly agreed upon. Michael Jackson broke down so many barriers within the music industry and was able to accomplish so much in the short time that he lived.\n\nHarry Styles has been around for a while now, but he just started his solo career five years ago. How can such a short-lived career grant him this title that took Michael Jackson decades to claim? Many Michael Jackson fans jumped to Jackson\u2019s defense, claiming there can never be another \u201cking of pop\u201d.\n\nAfter auditioning for the X-Factor in 2010, Styles alongside Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson formed one of the biggest boy bands in the world. The band only lasted five years but had an everlasting impact on the music industry and future boy bands to come.\n\nStyles came back into the spotlight after releasing his self-titled debut album, which won international awards and acclaim. But his career skyrocketed after the success of his second studio album, \u201cFine Line,\u201d which not only received many awards, but also opened the doors for him to perform at festivals, like Coachella, and for him to actively pursue his acting career.\n\nWith the continuous accolades Styles received from his success, Rolling Stone only thought it was right to crown him the new \u201cking of pop\u201d. This title caused a lot of uproar from Michael Jackson fans, and even pushback from fans of Styles.\n\nMichael Jackson\u2019s nephew, Taj Jackson also said, \u201cThere is no new king of pop. You didn\u2019t earn it, my uncle did. Decades of dedication and sacrifice. The title has been retired. No disrespect to @Harry_Styles, he\u2019s mega-talented. Give him his own title.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment was shared by thousands of Twitter users online who jumped to defend Jackson\u2019s long-standing title. Twitter user @MissNicole_d_, said \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Harry Styles, who I actually think is talented. It\u2019s about the Rolling Stone magazine & their constant disrespect towards Micheal. You can keep trying... but there is only one king of pop & his name is Mr. Michael Joseph Jackson.\u201d\n\nMichael Jackson was first called the \u201cking of pop\u201d in 1989 by Elizabeth Taylor when she presented him with the Heritage award for career achievement at the Soul Train Music Awards. This was 25 years after the start of his career, and the term stuck to his name. It has only been associated with him until the Rolling Stones cover anointed Harry Styles as the new king.\n\nStyles has only been in the music industry for 12 years, it\u2019s not fair to give him a title that took Jackson a quarter of his career to acclaim without acknowledging the privilege Styles has as a white artist. Giving Styles this title in such a short amount of time almost diminishes the hard work and struggles Jackson had to endure to get any type of recognition in the music industry, especially during the 80s.\n\nAs a Black man, acquiring this title and being the biggest entertainer of all time meant something special to the Black community. Styles hasn\u2019t experienced half of the discrimination and racism that Jackson faced, these two artists are very different and have followed different paths to reach the success they have received, so examining them through the same lens will never make a sufficient comparison.\n\n\u201cKing of pop\u201d is more than just a title; it upholds the idea that Black people can succeed in an industry that is always against them and where they have to work 10 times harder to reach the same level.\n```"}

(Photo by Lauren Nash)\n\nBy Salome Nebiyu and Shane Dimapanat\nOctober 26, 2022 at 6:06 pm PDT\n\nSome USC students may think that urban planning is boring. Sam Ellman and Natalie Ikhrata disagree. In fact, they named their new podcast, \u201cUrban Planning is Not Boring.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasic urban planning, it\u2019s so hard to define. Because, as a planner, you can do so many things like transportation planning, you could do food systems planning, mall planning, whatever. But I think it\u2019s just influencing the built environment,\u201d said Sam Ellman, one of the creators of the podcast and a second-year USC student pursuing her masters in urban planning.\n\nThe podcast connects the history of planning to the issues we face now, from racist policies and questionable zoning procedures, to discussing \u201c15-minute\u201d cities, an accessible community concept keeping necessities with a 15 minute commute, and America\u2019s daunting suburban sprawl.\n\nEllman said the podcast seeks to empower people to change urban planning policies that impact their communities.\n\n\u201cAnd policy is, [at] the most basic, just being able to have the power to decide, this route is going to be like 20 feet wide. And it\u2019s going to have an eight foot bike lane and whatever, you have so much power to decide those things,\u201d Ellman continued.\n\nEllman recommended attending public meetings to get involved in urban planning policy to take power of their local community infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe planning commission, any developer, they have to hold public meetings for most projects that are undergoing environmental review, or they have to get some sort of entitlement,\u201d Ellman said. \u201cAnd so if you go, or you write, or you call and you leave a public comment, they have to consider that legally.\u201d\n\nWhen considering the role of urban planners, Sam asks: \u201cHow are we going to help this community in a way that\u2019s meaningful to them?\u201d\n\nIn the context of the South Los Angeles region, this means catering urban planning policy to the Black and Latinx population.\n\nUSC students can see an example of urban planning in their own turf. The USC Village was a longtime staple to the South Los Angeles community, with affordable grocery stores, a movie theater, and other vendors. Today, the Village serves the students of USC with student housing and restaurants, but neglects the needs and history of the surrounding community.\n\nJonathan Antonio, a senior majoring in public policy, grew up in South Central Los Angeles, and has seen many changes in the area. Antonio has interacted with USC from a young age. In both middle school and high school, he participated in the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, taking courses at USC during the week and weekend. Due to the proximity of the Village to the USC campus, he would visit the vendors.\n\n\u201c[The original USC Village] had a Subway, and they had a movie theater and sometimes I\u2019d go with my friends because it was pretty cheap, like $5 or $6. Everything was pretty accessible. It seemed like it was affordable for college students and it was also affordable for the people that lived in the area,\u201d said Antonio.\n\nThose are all gone now, with the newly built USC Village remaining instead, a staple of the campus.\n\nThe podcast brings up important questions, not only to planners, but to everyone who lives in a city. It makes urban planning accessible.\n\nWilla Seidenberg, a professor at USC specializing in audio journalism and interim director of the Specialized Journalism Graduate Program, said, \u201cI love the title of this podcast, \u2018Urban Planning Is Not Boring\u2019, because the thing about it is, there\u2019s all these things like urban planning that affect our daily lives, and hopefully, they\u2019re gonna do something that really makes people understand why isn\u2019t it boring? Or well, how does it affect me?\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cIf they make it interesting and make it relevant to people, that\u2019s doing a big service to all of us.\u201d\n\nAnd impacts can be tangible. Seidenberg, talking about her own podcast \u201cSave As: NextGen Heritage Conservation\u201d, recounted a story about a commissioner from L.A.\u2019s department of cultural affairs who listened to her podcast.\n\n\u201cI [met] her because my podcast won some awards...and she said, \u2018You know, I was listening to your podcast that you did about Leimert Park. And I heard about this architect and this place that I didn\u2019t know about, and I brought it to the commission. And we\u2019re in the process of landmarking it. I wouldn\u2019t have known about it if I hadn\u2019t heard your podcast,\u2019\u201d Seidenberg said.\n\n\u201cAnd so that\u2019s an example of somebody [who] was engaged with the content, and something happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cUrban Planning is Not Boring\u201d is available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and Castos. Their Instagram has more information.\n```"}

(Photo by Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Amanda Coscarelli\nOctober 26, 2022 at 5:53 pm PDT\n\nSinger Harry Styles is ditching New York for a Los Angeles joyride of 15 shows, including his usually East Coast exclusive Halloween concert, \u201cHarryween.\u201d Styles kicked off his run over the weekend and will play sold out shows at the Kia Forum through November 15. While fans want to take advantage of his extended stay by attending multiple shows, ticket prices are steep.\n\nFans set up tents around the Forum Sunday night in the hopes of being first in line to stand in the pit for Harry Styles\u2019 show Monday. They had bags filled with meticulously selected outfits in case the singer noticed them in the crowd: a white skirt and matching tank top adorned with red hearts, a pink feather boa and pink cowgirl hat, long flared pants in a deep fuschia satin. The air outside was \u201cfreezing,\u201d as one fan put it, but the tents were warm inside with adrenaline and anticipation. From just outside the venue, they could hear bits and pieces of that night\u2019s show.\n\nDonielle Taylor left her tent early Monday to ensure a spot in line so that she could get a wristband that would allow her entry into the pit. She had been there since 3 p.m. the day before, so she was one of the first to get one, but some fans had been camping since Thursday, she explained. The Forum doesn\u2019t allow anyone to camp on the premises at night, so dedicated fans staked a spot on the Inglewood sidewalks, some with just an air mattress and a blanket.\n\n\u201cCamping was fun, but it was stressful,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nBut as West Coasters pack their bags for their first Harryween, some East Coast fans are disappointed in the change of location. Jose Ortega, an L.A. native but current student at Brown University, looked forward to attending the event this year since he spends half the year in Rhode Island, just a train ride away from its typical location.\n\n\u201cI really did want to [go],\u201d said Ortega. \u201cSince it\u2019s in L.A., it\u2019s far and would be even more expensive.\u201d\n\nThe iconic Harryween event is sold out but many fans are still trying to get tickets. Some who previously bought tickets and cannot attend the event are reselling tickets at face value, but even that price seems steep for his younger audience. Floor tickets listed at \u201cface value\u201d currently go for $260 a piece. And Harryween is significantly more expensive than other dates during his two-week stay at the Forum, which typically start at $117.\n\nThese prices, along with a new location, have turned away some fans who were hoping to attend Harryween. Ortega suggested that Styles switch locations every year to make it more fair for everyone.\n\n\u201cI think no matter where he does it, some people are gonna be bummed by it. So I think him alternating where he does it is a nice idea because it takes other peoples\u2019 locations into consideration,\u201d he said.\n\nFans on Twitter talked about how his Halloween show has become a tradition. One fan wrote, \u201dHarryween is a literal holiday.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis show gets better every year because of his stage presence,\u201d said Anais Campugan, who has attended his shows for the past few years.\n\nStyles has not yet announced a location for next year\u2019s show, but no matter where he plays, the fans are sure to follow.\n```"}

Rihanna is back with an announcement for a new song titled, \u201cLift Me Up\u201d for the new Marvel movie Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. \u201cLift Me Up\u201d is Rihanna\u2019s first song as the lead artist since 2016, written in collaboration with Nigerian singer and producer Tems, producer Ludwig Goransson, and director of the film Ryan Coogler.\n\nAccording to a press release, Rihanna, Tems, Goransson, and Coogler wrote \u201cLift Me Up\u201d as a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, the star of the first Black Panther film who died in 2020 of cancer.\n\nFans have anxiously awaited Rihanna\u2019s return to music, as the pop icon has been on musical hiatus since her last full-length release, \u201cAnti\u201d in 2016.\n\nHere\u2019s Kehinde Adebimpe, a senior studying cinemas studies, with her thoughts hiatuses. I mean, if someone needs to take a hiatus, it\u2019s good to stay out of the spotlight, like let\u2019s give yourself some space. And, you know, she\u2019s been working on her businesses, so that\u2019s like a lot to handle. So, yeah, it\u2019s a good thing.\n\nIndeed, Rihanna has been hard at work these past six years growing her makeup and lingerie brands, Fenty and Savage x Fenty, respectively. But, in September, it was announced that she would be headlining the 57th Superbowl Halftime Show next February 12th, continuing assumptions of her apparent return to music.\n\nKarla Ortega, a junior studying communication, thinks the Superbowl Halftime Show is the perfect stage for possible new music. I feel like that\u2019s like the perfect platform to like promote that on. So many people are going to be watching. And I feel like if anything, she doesn\u2019t promote it. I feel like people are just going to be going crazy because people just that\u2019s all they\u2019re expecting from her.\n\nAs for what we can expect sonically or thematically from Rihanna? Hmm. I\u2019m not too sure. I mean, like most of the big stars have been coming out with, like, electronic dance music, like Drake and Beyonce. Yeah. So maybe something like that or like something dedicated to her newborn baby. You don\u2019t. I feel like it\u2019s just going to be an explosive soundtrack of that makes sense....So I feel like it\u2019s just going to be pumped up. And, you know, you can just just see, like how she\u2019s been kind of holding back and she\u2019s just going to, like, let everything go now. I feel like she makes really great music and I feel like her vibe goes with Black Panther. So I think it\u2019s going to be like it\u2019s not going to be disappointing.\n\n\u201cLift Me Up\u201d will be available on all streaming platforms this Friday, October 28th.

Women who are seeking information about abortions might find themselves at one of these crisis centers. And instead of learning about healthcare options, they are met by a counselor who tries to talk them out of it. Mike Feuer: When it comes to a pregnancy. Time is essential and truth is essential. LA City Attorney Mike Feuer wants to keep women informed and says these crisis centers are aiming to mislead. That\u2019s why he introduced legislation that prevents these centers from using deceptive advertising and allows patients to sue organizations that have misinformed them. LA City Council passed Feuer\u2019s legislation this week. And Feuer says this is a step in the right direction. Mike Feuer: And that\u2019s what this ordinance is about. It\u2019s about deterring conduct that would mislead and empowering people who\u2019ve been victimized if they have been misled, to take action so that there\u2019s not another victim later on.\n\nThis decision comes just two weeks before California votes on Proposition 1 in the midterm elections. If passed, Prop 1 would change the California Constitution to say that the state cannot deny or interfere with a person\u2019s reproductive freedom, like the right to abortion. Could this legislation be an indication of how Angelenos will vote in November? Cathren Cohen of UCLA\u2019s Center for Reproductive Health believes that seeing people in power, like the city attorney, taking a stand on reproductive rights can have a massive effect on public perception. Cathren Cohen: It\u2019s also just valuable for people in positions of power like the city attorney or the state legislature or the governor. We\u2019ve seen a lot doing a lot of this, too, to make really clear statements that they support abortion rights and that they\u2019re not going to put up with the kinds of policies that we\u2019re seeing introduced in anti by anti-choice legislators in other states. I think that has a really powerful anti stigma effect, and it\u2019s also just valuable because people are very confused about what the law is right now. And so I think getting the message out that abortion remains safe and legal in California and in L.A. County is a really important piece of public education.\n\nBut opponents of Prop 1 believe it to be extreme, expensive and unnecessary. Catherine Hadro, spokesperson for No on Prop 1, worries about the strain this type of legislation could have on the state\u2019s healthcare system. Catherine Hadro: We\u2019re seeing the governor place commercials in Florida and Texas telling people to come to California. We just recently saw him place billboards in seven other states telling women to come to California for abortions. Late term abortions take place in hospitals. They are expensive and there are very serious procedures when you invite that kind of out-of-state chaos into our already overburdened hospital system. That\u2019s going to be an impact that every single Californian feels when it comes to their health care. And so we\u2019re saying there are issues here in California that we need to have addressed. Abortion is going to remain legal here in California. And this is a non problem that we\u2019re throwing money at. And it\u2019s our taxpayer money.\n\nBut Feuer doesn\u2019t see it that way. He sees legislation as essential in securing reproductive freedom. Mike Feuer: I want to ensure that in Los Angeles, no woman is misled when it comes to exercising these most intimate choices. Because Feuer attached an urgency clause to this legislation, this law is expected to take effect after Mayor Garcetti signs it. Prop 1 is on the midterm election ballot and will be decided on November 8th.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Rachel Hallett.\n```"}

Carrillo was born during the Salvadoran Civil War, which caused her and her family to flee the U.S. when she was five. She grew up 20 minutes away from the USC campus in the local neighborhood of Boyle Heights. There, she didn\u2019t have access to great health care and was a Medi-Cal recipient, so when she stepped into office, she strove for change.\n\nCarrillo: When you run for office and you represent the community that you grew up in and you share certain values, once you\u2019re at the table to be able to make decisions about your community, you have to show up.\n\nCl\u00ednica Romero is a clinic across L.A.

She led many delegations and an international trip to El Salvador with Governor Gavin Newsom to make these funds possible.\n\nCarrillo: And so it\u2019s been a while in the making. And sometimes policy takes time. And so we had an incredible budget in which we were able to allocate these specific funds for Cl\u00ednica Romero.\n\nThis is a huge help to support services for an underrepresented community, ensuring that the members have not only their physical needs taken care of but now, their mental ones as well.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Tatiana Sataua.\n```"}

Quinta Brunson, creator and star of \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d and an honoree at the 22nd annual Sentinel Awards, was one of many who paid her respects to Lear.\n\n\u201cNorman Lear was a big part of my childhood. ... I didn\u2019t know his shows would change my life,\u201d Brunson said at the Television Academy\u2019s Wolf Theater Tuesday. \u201c[Lear\u2019s] shows taught me that care and comedy were not mutually exclusive. They could exist together.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony and gala event, presented by the Norman Lear Center, hence his recognition throughout the night, celebrated television that champions social issues through its content. Honorees included \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d \u201cDopesick,\u201d \u201cNever Have I Ever\u201d and nine other \u201cinspiring\u201d series.\n\nHollywood, Health & Society, part of the USC Annenberg Lear Center, provides resources and guidance to television creators and writers to ensure accuracy on social and health issues. Over his illustrious career, Lear set a precedent of respectfully including issues such as racism or abortion in his television shows. The awards bear his name and honor his legacy.\n\n\u201cFrom episodes about LGBTQ+ rights, women\u2019s rights, exposing racism, mental health challenges, caring for the planet and so much more, Norman Lear\u2019s TV shows put meaningful content front and center 50 years ago,\u201d said Yvette Nicole Brown, the event\u2019s host. \u201cHis shows were always funny, always brilliantly produced, always on the cutting edge.\u201d\n\nBrown, of \u201cCommunity,\u201d \u201cDrake and Josh\u201d and \u201cA Black Lady Sketch Show\u201d fame, kept the evening going with enthusiasm and zeal. Her humor also shined through her commentary, and she joked that posts from the night should use the hashtag \u201c#NormanDidItFirst\u201d to honor his innovative body of work.\n\nIn the spirit of his work, the honorees were recognized for addressing topics like discrimination based on age and race (\u201cHacks,\u201d \u201cHarlem\u201d), physical and mental health and reproductive rights (\u201cDopesick,\u201d \u201cThe First Lady,\u201d \u201cNever Have I Ever,\u201d \u201cA Million Little Things\u201d) and economic disparities (\u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d).\n\nRegardless of what topic the honorees were recognized for, reproductive rights and mental health dominated their speeches throughout the night. Chris Schleicher, an honoree and writer for \u201cNever Have I Ever,\u201d spoke about the importance of therapy and equal access to mental health treatment in his acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cMindy Kaling and Lang Fisher were adamant in wanting to show that therapy is for everyone, not just rich white people who vacation at the \u2018White Lotus,\u2019\u201d said Schleicher. \u201cI hope that by showing a South Asian teenager being helped by a compassionate therapist, we\u2019ve been able to destigmatize getting help for mental health, especially in communities that haven\u2019t always seen themselves centered in discussions of mental health care.\u201d\n\nThe biggest honor of the night went to \u201cReservation Dogs,\u201d as its first season was recognized for depicting \u201cnative characters with more nuance and respect,\u201d as Brown said.\n\n\u201cWhen we set out to make this show, [we wanted] to really just celebrate our culture and humor. But you can\u2019t make a show without tackling bigger issues,\u201d said Sterlin Harjo, the creator, director and writer of \u201cReservation Dogs,\u201d via video. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily just approach [the show] as entertainment. We approach it as saving people\u2019s lives and making people feel seen and giving people something that they can relate to from all backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cReservation Dogs\u201d also showed off their spirited team, as cast members Lil Mike & Funny Bone performed at the ceremony, much to the audience\u2019s delight. Initiated by the cast of \u201cHarlem,\u201d all audience members were on their feet by the end of the rap and dance performance.\n\nThis lighthearted and amiable energy captures the heart of the Sentinel Awards \u2013 an evening honoring representation, ardor and the power of storytelling.\n```"}

They\u2019re pushing it by not getting creative and calling on to the governor and the president if necessary. We have to find a way where he gets down out of here without the city having to spend money on his rent, on his recall.\n\nNot all LA residents want De Leon out of office, though. A few residents speaking in the Zoom portion of the meeting urged the council not be pressured into it. There is no reason to basically remove him from these committees that he has been doing outstanding work, his record is there all of you have his record for the last year and a half.

As seen on Channel 4 and Netflix, \u201cDerry Girls\u201d is a coming-of-age comedy set in the middle of a paramilitary conflict in Northern Ireland. But despite its violent setting, the show focuses on friendship and growing up. The season finale premiered internationally on Netflix in October.\n\nThe show follows the lives of Erin, Orla, Claire and Michelle, four Irish Catholic teens, and James, a wee English fella who just moved in with his cousin Michelle after being abandoned by his mother. They live in Northern Ireland in a place called Derry, or Londonderry depending on your persuasion. The show starts with armed military officials guarding the streets and people painting political messages on the streets. Somewhere else in the city, five teenagers are getting ready for the first day of school.\n\nThroughout the course of the three seasons, they argue with their parents, have feuds with classmates, get detention and live their regular teen lives. Oh, and the guerrilla-like conflict that\u2019s occurring in their hometown? They have bigger problems. You see, the thing about Derry is that, at the time of the show in the 1990s, residents were living through a conflict called \u201cThe Troubles.\u201d The Troubles were a nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland between paramilitary groups of mostly Catholic members who wanted Northern Ireland to separate from the United Kingdom and join a United Ireland, and mostly Protestant groups, who disfavored joining Ireland and wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom. It is estimated that over 3,600 people died as a result.\n\nThe conflict started in the 1960s and lasted until The Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Among many things, it was agreed that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the U.K., but this could change if the majority of the residents chose to be part of the Republic of Ireland. But the show isn\u2019t about the deaths, the bombs or any of the violence. It\u2019s about friendship, being a teenager and growing up.\n\nDespite the clear violence around them, the show focuses on their lives: they go to school, they have crushes on people and they feel anxious about exams. Their adventures \u2014 and misadventures \u2014 throughout the series include sneaking into school to see their test results and ending up in police custody, convincing a hot priest that a statue of the Virgin Mary cried real tears (spoiler: it was dog piss) and sneaking out to a concert and running into a polar bear. You get the idea.\n\nBut whether it\u2019s a regular day at their all-girls Catholic school (James is the only boy in the school as there were concerns about his safety in the all-boys school because he is English), or one of their more unique experiences, the violence in the background remains exactly there \u2013 in the background. With this, the show stays true to the comedic, coming-of-age story of friendship that it wants to be.\n\nIn fact, the show portrays the type of friendship that we all wish we had: loyal and true. Despite their disagreements, flaws and ill decisions, the characters always find a way to stay true to each other. In the first season, when other students were making fun of Orla\u2019s talent show performance, the rest of the group put their fight aside to join her on stage, following her choreography. In season three, when the group got the opportunity to meet the \u201cmodern-day Beethoven,\u201d Fatboy Slim, they let go of their chance to look after a girl that Claire had a crush on. And in the second season when James\u2019 mom comes back to take him back to England... well, you should see it for yourself.\n\nDespite the excellence of these warmhearted scenes, what \u201cDerry Girls\u201d does best is the portrayal of what growing up in a violent country is like. Most of the people who live in real-life conflicts are not activist leaders or faces of a rebellion, but they will have to live with it and they learn how to deal with it. And sometimes the best way to deal with it is to not deal with it at all.\n\nDerry Girls is set during The Troubles, but it is not about The Troubles. Instead of focusing on the politics and the controversy, the show illustrates the conflict as simply existing within this context, which makes it more real. Among the violence and fights, the Derry Girls have to grow up, so they do. It\u2019s not that they never address the conflicts, they do, but it is usually reserved for everyday conversation or with jokes. For example, in the first episode, when the family found out that there\u2019s a bomb on the bridge it simply means the bus will have to take the long road to get to school. For Orla\u2019s mom, it also means a bigger complication: she can\u2019t cross the bridge and make it to her tanning salon appointment.\n\nThe season finale is the only episode where the show goes in-depth on the conflict and its cost, the girls turning 18 and the decision all the characters have to make on whether to vote \u201cyes\u201d on the Good Friday Agreement. It is also the only episode in the series that is not a comedy. The episode featured serious conversations, moral conflicts and the possible fallout of the agreement. But the characters don\u2019t yet know what we as an audience do: In 1998, shortly before the Derry Girls would go to university, the Good Friday referendum passed with over 71% of the votes. Northern Ireland voted \u201cyes\u201d for peace.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that doesn\u2019t really want to grow up. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for it, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for the world. But things can\u2019t stay the same, and they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Erin at the end of the series finale. \u201cNo matter how scary it is we have to move on and we have to grow up because things, well they might just change for the better.\u201d\n\nIn the end, James, the girls and their families are seen leaving the voting polls, with Erin\u2019s little sister, Anna, jumping behind them, holding Grandpa Joe\u2019s hand. Most of the characters had lived in conflict for most or all of their lives but Anna would grow up in peace.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nBy Alexa Hernandez Diaz and AC Shick\nOctober 26, 2022 at 4:24 pm PDT\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in California may have passed, but that does not mean you cannot vote in the upcoming election. In California, the deadline to register is 15 days before the election; however, the same-day voter registration process can be completed in the remaining 14 days leading all the way up to Election Day. Additionally, college students are granted the choice on where to register, either their home state or California. USC students can vote in Los Angeles by using their local address.\n\nDylan Gatua, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science who is registered to vote, said, \u201cIf you have a problem with what\u2019s going on in the world, you should try and make an impact on that.\u201d Freshman Sadie Duca, a music production major, is not registered to vote but believes that students who have not registered yet should use the same-day voter registration process. \u201cThat is something I\u2019d be interested in. ... I\u2019m going to get on that,\u201d she said.\n\nLack of voter registration information is not a problem Duca faces alone. Sophia Valdez, a sophomore majoring in Spanish who is also not registered to vote, believes in the importance of registering. Valdez comes from an immigrant family who is not familiar with the voting process and said that she thinks voter information accessibility is crucial. \u201cLearning about how you can do it...is really good,\u201d she said.\n\nHow to vote after registration closes\nStudents interested in registration after the deadline can do so at early voting locations. The closest spots to campus are the Masjid Omar ibn Al-Khattab, open October 29 to November 7 from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and the Vermont Avenue Elementary School auditorium, open November 5 to 7 from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Both locations are within walking distance and are within the free Lyft zone which is available everyday after 6 p.m. You can find the closest place to register based on your address or zip code here.\n\nOnce at the locations, you\u2019ll need the last four digits of your social security number, your date of birth, and a California driver license or California identification card number if you have one. If you do not have a California identification card, you should bring your social security card and be prepared to tell them your full name, date of birth, and address. After same-day voter registration, you can vote right away or wait until Election Day. Polls open on November 8 from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.\n\nResources on campus include VoteSC headed by USC Political Student Assembly (PSA), the USC Center for the Political Future and the Unruh Institute of Politics. VoteSC\u2019s website provides guides, information and resources aiming at making voting more accessible to students. For any questions about voting or to report fraud, you can call the Secretary of State\u2019s voter hotline at (800) 345-8683.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Chris Pietsch)\n\nBy Jacob Hare October 26, 2022 at 3:43 pm PDT\n\nEvery week in the Pac-12 is seemingly crazier than the previous week. This week was no different. Between upsets, come-from-behind wins and elite performances, I have you covered in my Week 8 edition of \u201cUnpack The Pac.\u201d\n\nUSC (6-1, Week 8 result: Bye Week)\nUtah (5-2, Week 8 result: Bye Week)\nOregon (6-1, Week 8 Result: 45-30 win vs. UCLA)\nOregon developed one of the most alluring offenses in all of college football over the past month and a half. With a 45-30 statement win over UCLA, the Ducks prolonged their winning streak to six games, scoring 40+ points in six straight. Transfer senior quarterback Bo Nix continued his spectacular play as he had 283 passing yards and five passing touchdowns. Nix has also rushed for 50+ rushing yards in his last three outings. First-year head coach Dan Lanning was fantastic, and vastly out coached by UCLA\u2019s Chip Kelly. The keenest example of Lanning\u2019s brilliance in this game was after the Ducks went up 17-10, Lanning called for an onside kick which the Ducks recovered. That particular play shifted the momentum. While the playoff is looking improbable for the Pac-12 this year, the Ducks could sneak in with a few miracles.\n\nOregon State (6-2, Week 8 Result: 42-9 win vs. Colorado)\nIn his three games as the team\u2019s starter, redshirt freshman quarterback Ben Gulbranson has gone 3-0 and was outstanding. There were many question marks around Gulbranson after he replaced junior quarterback Chance Nolan, who was in concussion protocol after being injured on Oct. 1. Gulbranson has erased those question marks by going out the past three weeks and finding a way to win. Oregon State has impressed these past few weeks and if they keep up this winning formula, expect the Beavers to play in a high-quality bowl game.\n\nStanford (3-4, Week 8 result: 15-14 win vs. Arizona State)\nWith a 15-14 comeback win over Arizona State, Stanford had its first two-game winning streak since last September. Stanford has impressed me these last two weeks. After a humiliating 1-4 start, the Cardinal now sit at 3-4 and have a decent shot at making a bowl game this season. If Stanford can find a way to slow down UCLA\u2019s running attack as Oregon did last weekend, the Cardinal may be able to play UCLA down to the wire.\n\nWashington (6-2, Week 8 Result: 28-21 win vs. Cal)\nDespite a 28-21 win over Cal, Washington put up a lousy performance. The Huskies had numerous opportunities to seal the game in the fourth quarter but kept giving Cal chances to win. The Huskies defense, which has been below average for most of the season, finally showed up and bailed the offense out. One noteworthy stat, the Huskies committed nine penalties compared to Cal\u2019s two. The Huskies now face a talented Oregon State team in a game where they won\u2019t be able to make the same mistakes they did against Cal.\n\nColorado (1-6, Week 8 Result: 42-9 loss vs. Oregon State)\nAfter a fluke win against Cal last weekend, Colorado returned to its old ways and was embarrassed by Oregon State. You can\u2019t find many positives in the Buffaloes\u2019 miserable performance. At this point, they should focus on finding a head coach who can change the entire culture of this program.\n\nArizona (3-4, Week 8 Result: Bye Week)\nArizona State (2-5, Week 8 Result: 15-14 loss vs. Stanford)\nArizona State had many opportunities to win but couldn\u2019t get the job done as the Sun Devils lost 15-14 to Stanford. The most eye-opening stat from this game was that Arizona State was 4-of-13 on third downs. Games are won and lost on third down; if you can\u2019t convert, you limit your ability to win. After this challenging loss, Arizona State now prepares to face Colorado on the road next weekend.\n\nUCLA (6-1, Week 8 Result: 45-30 loss vs. Oregon)\nUCLA was dominated in every aspect. From the start, UCLA\u2019s run defense got exposed as it allowed Oregon to rush for 262 yards. On the other side of the ball, UCLA was never able to establish a consistent running game which has been the Bruins\u2019 bread and butter this season. This loss stings for UCLA as it looked like going undefeated was a legitimate possibility for the team after beating two ranked opponents prior to facing Oregon. UCLA will look to get back on track against a lowly Stanford team next week.\n\nCal (3-4, Week 8 Result: 28-21 loss vs. Washington)\nCal had multiple opportunities to come back and potentially win against Washington but ended up losing 28-21. Like Arizona State, struggling to convert on third downs was the most prominent reason Cal lost. The Golden Bears were 6-of-15 on third downs. Cal was also dominated in time of possession as the Golden Bears had the ball for over 24 minutes compared to Washington, who had it for more than 35 minutes. Looking at the rest of Cal\u2019s schedule, I expect the Golden Bears to win only one or two more games in what has become a lost season.\n\nWashington State (4-3, Week 8 Result: Bye Week)\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

Wade in June, California voters face a new proposition that would add an amendment to the California Constitution to solidify reproductive freedom in the state. If passed, Proposition 1 would secure \u201cthe fundamental right to choose whether or not to have an abortion\u201d and \u201cwhether or not to use contraceptives\u201d for California residents, according to the state\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\n\nThe proposition has already received an overwhelming amount of support. Data from the Public Policy Institute of California found that 69% of voters would support the proposition. 25% would vote \u201cno,\u201d and 6% were unable to decide, the Institute found.\n\n\u201cState law can change quite easily with the changing legislature, so, if the legislature swung to the right for whatever reason, then those laws could change,\u201d according to Paula Tavrow, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and director of the Bixby Program in Population and Reproductive Health. \u201cNow, a constitutional amendment is much more difficult to change because it requires not only the legislation to pass, but then it would still have to go to the voters.\u201d\n\nThe right to abortion was previously protected under the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. However, the decision of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization this past summer resulted in the overturning of Roe v. Wade, giving states the power to decide their positions on abortion on their own.\n\nThe right to buy and use contraceptives, including condoms and birth control is already protected under federal law, according to the Right to Contraception Act. According to Tavrow, there could be \u201clooming battles about contraception that we wouldn\u2019t have to engage in\u201d if Prop. 1 is passed.\n\nCurrently, California\u2019s Reproductive Privacy Act \u201cprovides that every individual possesses a fundamental right to privacy with respect to reproductive decisions,\u201d according to the California Legislature.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a leader in general when it comes to issues related to abortion and reproductive freedom and I think this is just another example of it,\u201d Tavrow said. \u201cIt also communicates to other states, \u2018Hey, we are taking this action, and we want it to be known that if you come here, you can get your reproductive needs met.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalifornia law prohibits abortions when fetuses reach \u201cviability,\u201d or when the fetus is able to survive outside the uterus with medical care, with certain exceptions, as stated in California Health and Safety Code 123468.\n\nThere are currently 18 states that impose some degree of bans on abortions, according to the New York Times. This ranges from complete bans with no exceptions for rape or incest, to gestational limits banning abortion after a certain number of weeks during pregnancy. States with no exception on abortions include Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nSupporters of the proposition, such as Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and Gov. Gavin Newsom, want to ensure California residents have the right to abortion and contraceptives by placing it in the California Constitution. That would make it harder in the future to make any changes to the law.\n\n\u201cAccess to affordable, comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion and access to contraceptives, allows people to plan their lives and achieve their dreams,\u201d according to Yes on 1, the leading Prop. 1 supporting committee. \u201cNo matter what the conservative United States Supreme Court has decided, we must continue to ensure that here in California, health care is a right. Prop. 1 would add that right into our state Constitution, and give the voters the chance to weigh in this November,\u201d Yes on 1 said.\n\n\u201cI fully support it, 100%,\u201d said Ariella Rabbani, the executive director of WYSE (Women and Youth Supporting Each Other) at USC. WYSE provides members the opportunity to mentor middle school girls in the surrounding areas on topics including body positivity, healthy relationships and sex education.\n\n\u201cEspecially through my involvement in WYSE, we\u2019re just encouraging people to have the choice to make those decisions in their future,\u201d the senior majoring in law, history and culture continued. \u201cI think if it gets voted in, it would be reassurance for people in California to know that they feel safer and they feel some trust in the government that they\u2019re here to protect us.\u201d\n\nThe No on 1 campaign, which is backed by 13 organizations, including the California Republican Party and California Catholic Conference, states that Prop. 1 is \u201cextreme, expensive and unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike current state law, Prop. 1 contains no limits on abortion, allowing taxpayer-funded, late-term abortions at any time, for any reason, up to the moment of birth \u2014 even if the baby is healthy and the life of the mother is not threatened,\u201d No on 1 says.\n\nYes on 1 counters that Prop. 1 will not change the \u201cexisting state constitutional protections and law, which provide for the right to choose an abortion prior to viability or to protect the pregnant person\u2019s life or health,\u201d according to the committee\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cI think that when we have this conflict between bodily autonomy and the right to life of the fetus, that we should be protecting the right to life of the fetus,\u201d said Morgan Farrier, a junior majoring in Astronautical Engineering and the president of Trojans for Life, a pro-life USC club. \u201cThat\u2019s why I will be voting no on Proposition 1.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Prop. 1 have contributed about $9.3 million, with top donors including the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, Physicians\u2019 Issues Committee of the California Medical Association, Planned Parenthood Advocacy Project Los Angeles County and the California Federation of Teachers COPE Prop/Ballot Committee.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)\n\nBy Maya Gomes October 25, 2022 at 8:10 pm PDT\n\nFor the third election in a row, California voters will decide on regulations for dialysis centers November 8 in Proposition 29. Prop. 29 would require dialysis centers to have a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant with at least six months of relevant experience on-site or available via telehealth. However, there hasn\u2019t been any proof that increased staffing will improve patient care at dialysis centers, said Erin Duffy, a research scientist at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.\n\n\u201cThere haven\u2019t been studies that link improved quality with that kind of staffing,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cTypically, before you would want to do some sort of sweeping change in the way staffing structures would happen, you would want it to be evidence based.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the proposition also requires clinics to disclose infection data to the state, publish a list of physicians with 5% or more ownership in practices and protect clinics from a reduction or closure of services without approval from the state. According to the L.A. Times, however, clinics are already required to have a physician on staff overseeing patients\u2019 care and a kidney specialist directing patients\u2019 treatment plans.\n\n\u201cI think that overall there is the potential for harm, particularly in underserved areas where small facilities are and would be at risk for closing,\u201d said Dr. Eugene Lin, an assistant professor of Medicine and Health Policy & Management at USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine and the Price School of Public Policy. USC Keck partners with DaVita to run a dialysis unit through the USC Kidney Center, located by Keck Hospital in the Ramona Gardens area. Lin claims no affiliation with the partnership.\n\nAn on-site doctor \u201cwould not have the authority to make changes to the care prescribed by a patient\u2019s doctor,\u201d the L.A. Times argues in their editorial condemnation of the bill. This makes the requirement a redundancy that could cost clinics several hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, potentially forcing them to scale back operations or close entirely, according to the L.A. Times. Additionally, dialysis centers are already required to report their infection data to the federal government.\n\nProp 29 is the third attempt to regulate the dialysis industry in the past four years: Prop. 8 in 2018 proposed similar changes to the industry, as did Prop. 23 in 2020. Both previous propositions were shut down by approximately 60% of voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware that much has changed in the last two years,\u201d Duffy said. \u201c[There is] no new data that has been presented that I\u2019ve seen on why this is needed. And so it\u2019s hard for me to see the outcome being very different from two years ago.\u201d\n\nAll three propositions were sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare West, who has been in a drawn-out battle with private dialysis companies DaVita and Fresenius to unionize workers. DaVita and Fresenius have combined ownership or operation of 75% of the 650 dialysis facilities in California, which treats about 80,000 California residents, according to state analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\n\u201cThe policies in general have not been advantageous from a patient perspective,\u201d Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that it is not benefiting patients at all because it\u2019s sort of putting them in the crosshairs of what looks to be like a labor dispute.\u201d\n\nThe proposition, which is being promoted by the union as a measure to protect patients receiving dialysis care from exploitation, is opposed by several prominent healthcare groups, including the California Medical Association, the California chapter of the American Nurses Association and the American Academy of Nephrology PAs, along with the Renal Physicians Association, the California Dialysis Council and others.\n\nLin also expressed concerns over healthcare policy being decided by state voters who may not be educated on the intricacies of the dialysis industry.\n\n\u201cIt does strike me as something where we should be concerned about overly regulating a highly complicated and technical industry via ballot pressure,\u201d Lin said. \u201cInstead what we should be doing is allow health care experts and policy experts to be regulating it, perhaps at a federal level.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2022/10/25/former-trojans-world-series-run-reflects-his-baseball-past/", "response": "```\nAmid the Philadelphia Phillies\u2019 underdog run to the World Series is Garrett Stubbs, a former Trojan trying to write a storybook chapter in USC baseball\u2019s heralded history and his own career. The Phillies\u2019 catcher is perhaps one of the best representations of the Trojan spirit on an active professional sports roster.\n\nStubbs had an illustrious four years at USC. He was a stud on both sides of the field, among the Pac-12 conference leaders in batting average, steals and runs \u2014 to name a few. In 2015, Stubbs won the Johnny Bench Award given to the best catcher in college baseball, as well as the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year award. He led the Trojans to the College World Series regional final.\n\n\u201cHe helped turn that USC program around when we were down, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that the teams that he\u2019s on are successful,\u201d said Nigel Nootbaar, a former Trojan pitcher and one of Stubbs\u2019 teammate. \u201cI think his mentality and what he brings off the field are very valuable.\u201d\n\nYet Stubbs\u2019 college success didn\u2019t immediately translate to professional opportunities. He wasn\u2019t drafted until the eighth round of the 2015 MLB Draft. But Stubbs fought on, never losing sight of his goal. He worked for four years in the minors before finally being called up to the Astros in 2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been amazing to watch him experience it and grow and support him along the way,\u201d Stubbs\u2019 mother, Marti Jo Stubbs, said.\n\nHowever, Stubbs could never carve out a regular role with the Astros. The limited opportunities for playing time caused him to shift back and forth between the major and minor leagues in his three-year stint in Houston. In the 2021 offseason, the Phillies traded for Stubbs, in hopes that he could become their backup catcher.\n\nNow, finally on a team with an established role, Stubbs was put in a position to thrive, and he overachieved. He had easily the best season of his career, was consistently on the major league roster all season and was ready to provide a spark off the bench whenever the starting catcher needed rest.\n\nStubbs had a successful first season in Philadelphia, but his path through the playoffs is a remarkable journey that\u2019s been in the works since the beginning of his baseball career. Throughout the postseason, the Phillies have been on a quest for a World Series title that has called back to Stubbs\u2019 baseball past all along the way.\n\nIn the Wild Card Series, the Phillies matched up against the St. Louis Cardinals, where Stubbs faced former Trojan outfielder Lars Nootbaar. Lars\u2019 older brother Nigel attended a game during the series. Garrett\u2019s younger brother CJ Stubbs, another former Trojan baseball player, was also in the stands for the same game.\n\n\u201cOur families, our friends and I were hanging out with [Garrett\u2019s] little brother [CJ] before the game and he was playing against my little brother [Lars],\u201d Nigel said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty wild to see that a couple of years ago, we would have never guessed that that\u2019s the situation we\u2019d be in.\u201d\n\nReconnecting with the Trojan family in the playoffs was fitting, as it was a common theme during Stubbs\u2019 entire season. \u201cThe past couple of road trips that we\u2019ve been on with the club, whether it be in New York or Chicago or wherever we are with the Philadelphia Phillies, we\u2019ve been met by USC alumni that Garrett went to school with, and he\u2019s going to lunch with them out on the road,\u201d Garrett\u2019s father, T. Pat Stubbs, said.\n\nIn the next page of reconnecting to Stubbs\u2019 past, the Phillies won the Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, who kept him from winning a World Series with the Astros in 2021. In the National League Championship Series, the Phillies faced off against the San Diego Padres. Again, it was a throwback for Stubbs, who grew up in San Diego and attended Torrey Pines High School. The return to his childhood home for a postseason series allowed the opportunity for many of Stubbs\u2019 family and friends to watch his team get to a win in the playoffs.\n\nTo win a World Series title, Stubbs and his fellow Phillies will have to beat his former team, the Astros. The Astros are the team that drafted him, the team that gave him his first shot in the major leagues, the team that brought him the first taste of the playoffs with and the team that would eventually draft his brother CJ, who plays in the Astros minor league system.\n\nTo put the finishing touches on his storybook season, Stubbs will have to help his new team triumph over his old one. Regardless of what happens, he has been the embodiment of a Trojan all season long, with his red armor-like catcher\u2019s gear and readiness for battle whenever called on.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anybody to go in and in a clutch situation that I would trust, it\u2019s that guy, and I\u2019d be excited to see that happen if it does,\u201d Nigel said.\n\nThe world will be watching as he takes the field for his biggest battle thus far. The series will begin on Friday in Houston and can be viewed on Fox at 5:03 p.m.\n```"}

The new PM, who goes by Rishi Sunak, is the first person of color, the first Hindu, and the youngest person to ever have the prestigious position. However, that is not much to say concerning the daily lives of the British voting populace.\n\nProfessor Nick Cull, founder of the USC Masters of Public Diplomacy program, stated that Sunak\u2019s position will come with a tough road ahead. Cull: Well, Sunak\u2019s big problem is the British economy, which is in a mess right now. Britain still hasn\u2019t recovered from the shock of Brexit. Walking away from its single largest market was and is an expensive thing for a country to do. It also, like the rest of Europe, is coping with the shock of the invasion of Ukraine and the disruption of the European energy market. So these are two big things for anyone to deal with.\n\nGiven what has happened in the United Kingdom in the past few weeks with the passing of Queen Elizabeth II and a new prime minister, Cull believes that the best thing the new prime minster can do to bring back trust within Britain is to keep a level of honesty and integrity. Cull: I think people in Britain are tired of politics right now, but what they\u2019re tired of is being mistreated by politicians and especially being lied to. So one of the most important things for Rishi Sunak to do is to tell people the truth.\n\nCull\u2019s evidence of this resides in the heaps of promises laid out by his predecessor, whose plan for the economy was seen as impossible to implement by those in parliament, and the rest of Britain. Cull: The shocking thing about Liz Truss is that Sunak himself made clear this summer that she was promising people impossible things, which is exactly what Boris Johnson had done in his walkaway from Europe and still be prosperous, Johnson promised. Well, Liz Truss was promising that you could have tax cuts for everybody and still have money to spend. This is fantasy economics and the markets won\u2019t put up with it.\n\nThe Conservative Party in the UK, often short named \u201cThe Tories\u201d, have had a strong hold on the parliament majority and hence the Prime Minister seat for the past twelve years. Recent unstableness within the Conservatives Party alongside the death of the Queen may lead to a different turn of events in the near future. Sunak\u2019s new position brings a solid foundation amongst the Tories that their party still has a leg to stand on.\n\nCull: Right now, the Labor Party is 30 points ahead in the opinion polls. That suggests that the next election, probably in 2025, will be the Labor Party\u2019s election to win. But they\u2019ve got lots of experience losing elections everybody thought they were going to win. Even with that said, Cull believes it is too soon to tell if Sunak will be a successful stabilizer for the British Parliament and the rest of the Kingdom. Cull: So it\u2019s way too soon to dismiss Sunak pulling things together. I think that his MPs will be well aware that unless they support him and support the measures that he puts in place and do so quickly, they could well be out of jobs by 2023.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Spencer Cline.\n```"}

Gap has already removed all of the Yeezy products from their line, with Footlocker following suit. Maddy Brown has the story.\n\nAdidas announced this morning that they will be terminating their deal with Ye, the artist formally known as Kanye West, after public disapproval of his recent antisemitic remarks continue to grow. For over two weeks, Ye has continued to post antisemitic tweets, comments that have spurred rising pressure for Adidas to cut ties with the rapper.\n\nIn a statement released early this morning, Adidas said they \u201cdo not tolerate antisemitism or any other sort of hate speech.\u201d The partnership between Ye and Adidas has proved to be lucrative for both parties. The release of Adidas Yeezy sneakers on June 27th sold out online in the U.S. in only 12 minutes. The partnership, which lasted for nearly a decade, earned the artist nearly $100 million per year.\n\nBy cutting ties with Ye, Adidas has stated that they are losing $246 million this year. The decision to end their deal comes after companies like Balenciaga and the talent agency CAA announced the severing of their partnerships with Ye. These are the consequences of increasingly erratic behavior from Ye.\n\nAlthough the influential artist is no stranger to controversy, his recent antisemitic comments in social media posts, interviews, and his adoption of the white supremacist slogan \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d have drawn increasingly widespread criticism.\n\nWhat does this mean for Adidas? How will their business, brand, and vision be impacted? We spoke to Professor Hank Wasiak, from USC\u2019s Marshall School of Business, about how Adidas\u2019 decision to cut ties with Ye has affected their business.\n\nHank Wasiak: Well, it affects it a lot because it takes a product line, a brand, an attitude, a niche, and something that they\u2019ve had. And they don\u2019t have that anymore. You know, and Nike is a brand that is very much into that. I\u2019m not going to say controversial space, but the advocacy and activism space in another way. So they\u2019ve got to really do some things that are going to fill in that niche.\n\nProfessor Wasiak believes that Adidas is going to have to take a closer look at customers\u2019 desires in the wake of Ye\u2019s dismissal from the brand.\n\nHank Wasiak: What Adidas has got to do is say, I have a customer base that I\u2019m not serving anymore with this. And every single brand does, everything is geared towards making, selling and serving. And I reverse the order serving and selling that customer. So they\u2019ve got a heck of a lot of research and discussion and soul searching to do there. It\u2019s got to be customer focused first.\n\nDespite the chaos, Professor Wasiak sees a way forward for Adidas after the controversy.\n\nHank Wasiak: So it needs a really good, strong strategic look at how they\u2019re going to replace not only that brand in that volume, but that\u2019s a brand with a specific target audience that it appeals to. And they will now be not represented with that target. And so they\u2019ve got to really step back and look and see how are they going to address it with some consumers that might say, why are you doing this?\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Maddy Brown.\n```"}

With prices up nearly 10%, the California government is stepping in to bridge this financial gap and help families who have been feeling the pressure.\n\nOver the past year, inflation has driven prices up by 9.9% according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics! This is the highest it's been since the 1980s! It's no surprise that a lot of families across the US and specially California have been struggling to make ends meet these past couple of months.\n\nThis is why the California government has announced that they will be sending Inflation relief debit cards to people across the state. The cards will contain a one-time payment, ranging from $400 to $1,050 for couples who filed jointly on their 2020 state income tax return and $200 to $700 for those who filed independently.\n\nBut are these one-time payments enough? Dario Laudati, a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Southern California, thinks they are not.\n\nDario Laudati: \"Worst case scenario, this makes it worse because it keeps more purchasing power by giving more purchasing power to families and that generates more demand. It pushes on the supply even more, and therefore prices go up even more. So potentially, it\u2019s self-defeating.\"\n\nThe debate over the effectiveness of one-time payments, however, is not cut and dry. Juan Andres Espinosa Torres, another PhD candidate for Economics at USC, believes that although risky, they could bring a lot of benefits for Californians.\n\nJuan Andres Espinosa Torres: \"This will try to align the Californian economy to the long-term growth instead of overheating it with this expenditure. This could in principle create a little bit of short-term inflation and very short-term is within 12 months. But then it will depend on how will the aggregate that is in the United States as the country will go up.\"\n\nUltimately, the recent rise in inflation and consumer prices has been an international issue. With supply chain issues, the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine being some of the main factors contributing to the hike in prices.\n\nLaudati believes that regardless of the one-time payments, inflation will be something Americans will have to endure for a while.\n\nDario Laudati: \"For sure, this is not something that is going to disappear tomorrow. It is something which most likely is going to stay with us for a while, at least probably more than a year. Now, that is a problem because the check is going to be sent is a one-time only. And then you have to wonder, okay, this one-time only, how much relief can you get from that one-time check and at the same times these are expensive.\"\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that all hope is lost. There are still options for Americans to ease the effects of inflation, according to Espinosa Torres.\n\nJuan Andres Espinosa Torres: \"Well, one thing they can do which I think will make it better is not necessarily give relief in terms of, let\u2019s say, student loans or what are not tax credits. But trying to delay some things that the government collects in terms of money. That could give California some needed relief.\"\n\nFor now, if you are eligible for a payment, the first cards will start being mailed this week.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Hanah Abualhaj.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Michael Allio)\n\nBy Terence Holton October 25, 2022 at 4:19 pm PDT\n\nThe Big Ten has it pretty great already. In 2020, it was the highest-earning conference in college football. The Big Ten consistently produces championship contenders in practically every single sport. So, why does the conference need USC? In one word \u2014 prestige.\n\nWith the addition of the Los Angeles market into the Big Ten\u2019s already booming revenue from NBC, CBS and Fox, the sky\u2019s the limit for marketing deals. L.A. is one of the largest markets in the world, and it brings a whole new point of interest to a primarily regional conference. The city itself is most likely one of the driving factors for bringing UCLA and USC to the Big Ten.\n\nThe L.A. dazzle in particular is what is so tantalizing. The L.A. dazzle is what gives USC an even greater advantage of expansion over the likes of Stanford or Cal, who also sit in the Bay Area\u2019s massive market. You may be wondering: what is the L.A. dazzle? It\u2019s what draws people to the city. The glamor of the L.A. dazzle is what drew in the Big Ten interest to USC and UCLA.\n\nThe brands and novelty of the Bruins and Trojans are other reasons why the Big Ten was so keen to bring in the programs. Both USC and UCLA are historically dominant teams in football and basketball. With Lincoln Riley now at the helm of USC and the Bruins finding their way into the AP Top 10 for football, the Big Ten is seeing stars with what they have just brought in.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the Big Ten has only had one consistent national football contender over the last 10 years: Ohio State. Adding two high-level Pac-12 contenders to a currently one-sided conference could spice it up and make it more interesting for the fans. As of right now, Ohio State and Illinois would play in the Big Ten championship which, even though it is a top 25 matchup, would be a bloodbath in favor of Ohio State.\n\nOhio State dominating the Big Ten aside, USC and UCLA are foundational conference programs. Once it was announced that the Trojans and Bruins would be leaving the conference, everyone else in the Pac-12 panicked. Immediately, several other programs were scrambling to join the Big Ten or Big 12. I can say with confidence that this would not happen with any other program leaving. If Oregon and Oregon State were to suddenly jump ship and leave for the Big Ten, no other program would bat an eye.\n\nThe Trojans and Bruins are the staples of their current conference and are more than just the Los Angeles market to the Conference of Champions. The Big Ten is a powerhouse conference, no question about it, but it needed a little something extra to prove they are the A-list conference many believe them to be. That something extra, of course, being two pieces of sunshine from the City of Angels: USC and UCLA.\n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

The pair gathered to discuss their recently released book, \u201cThe Big Truth: Upholding Democracy in the Era of the Big Lie.\u201d Director of USC Annenberg\u2019s Media Center Christina Bellantoni moderated a discussion during which the authors debunked claims of fraud during the 2020 election.\n\nWith the midterm elections just two weeks away, Becker and Garrett shared worries over voter turnout. Garrett has traced voter sentiment since 1984. \u201cElections are a miracle,\u201d Garrett said. He pointed out how successful election officials have been in making a complicated endeavor work so efficiently. They wrote \u201cThe Big Truth\u201d to dispel misinformation that might prevent voters from trusting the current election process. The book explains how elections are run, and how the process is more foolproof than ever.\n\nGarrett described the 2020 election as, \u201c10,000 little elections all over the country on different pieces of paper, with different things on the ballot, using different technology.\u201d And yet not only are they veritable, but they are also verifiable. Garrett said this while referring to the ballot recount that took place in Georgia in 2020. Because of current technology, the paper trail of the ballots can be checked, and rechecked.\n\nDespite that, both Garrett and Becker spoke on how misinformation efforts have distorted the public\u2019s view of the election process. Students left the talk with a greater understanding of how elections work, but with an equal concern about the power of misinformation.\n\n\u201cIt brings up questions of what happens next,\u201d Tawfiq Othman, a sophomore majoring in architecture and employee of the Center on Communication, Leadership and Policy shared. \u201cWhat\u2019s the next election going to look like if people are very riled up?\u201d Othman worries that voters often seek a confirmation bias when consuming news. \u201cEveryone supports their own news organization that they listen to,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019re shielded from the other side of the stories.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s for this reason that Garrett and Becker wrote the book. It is meant to be a reference for those who may not yet fully distrust the election process but who have concerns that could be quelled with more concrete information. \u201cPeople are more anxious about voting than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cWe wrote this book as an answer to the lies and the slander,\u201d Becker said.\n```"}

The demonstration came after a string of antisemitic tweets and television appearances by rapper Ye, who had previously changed his name from Kanye West. Many of his remarks promoted hate and violence against Jewish people while also spreading conspiracy theories about the community.\n\nA tweet shared by West October 8 read, \u201cI\u2019m going death con 3   On JEWISH PEOPLE   The funny thing is I actually can\u2019t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got somebody so prominent saying horrible things online, that makes the crazy person who\u2019s doing Nazi salutes on the 405 feel more comfortable.

According to Abrams, the same group is responsible for a number of antisemitic fliers which were scattered throughout the west side of Los Angeles in Beverly Hills, Westwood and Brentwood. However, Abrams believes that West\u2019s remarks have been the leading cause of the recent emboldening of such groups.\n\n\u201cKanye West has tens of millions of fans and followers,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cNow, groups like the one that hung the banner are trying to leverage the support of those people. They\u2019re trying to leverage the support of companies that are partners with Kanye West, like The Gap and Adidas ... who continue to be in business with someone who\u2019s spouting this antisemitic rhetoric.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about local law enforcement\u2019s response to the antisemitic incidents, Abrams pointed to the First Amendment as a limitation faced in properly combating hate speech.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, law enforcement prosecution is not going to be the way out of this problem and certainly not the sole solution. It really comes down to the people,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that there are far more people of good faith, far more people who care about their fellow humans than these perpetrators of hate, so we need to use those numbers in our favor.\u201d\n\nAbrams also praised the Los Angeles Police Department and the Beverly Hills Police Department for their response to the antisemitic fliers distributed in recent weeks, saying they devoted a great deal of resources and want to do everything in their legal power to stop these acts.\n\nSaturday\u2019s incident caught the attention of District Attorney George Gascon, who condemned the act on Twitter, writing, \u201cWe cannot tolerate the #Antisemitism that was on full display [Saturday] on an LA Fwy. ... I stand with the Jewish community in condemning this disgusting behavior.\u201d\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti also shared a tweet in support of the Jewish community. \u201cWe condemn this weekend\u2019s [antisemitic] incidents.

Today at Annenberg we hosted a discussion on The Big Truth! What is the Big Truth? It\u2019s a clarification to the \u201cBig Lie\u201d and to those non believers that the 2020 general election was in fact not stolen.\n\nMedia Center Director Christina Bellatoni hosted Major Garrett, he is the chief Washington correspondent for CBS News and David Becker, the executive director and founder for the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research in Washington. If there is one thing you should take away from this book, is that elections are a miracle. David Becker: I mean, every two years we come together as a country and we facilitate the voices of over 100 million Americans in a process that\u2019s incredibly decentralized. We know that the election officials are doing the job they need to do to get it right rather than get it fast and be grateful for our fellow citizens, our neighbors, our family members, our friends who are working in elections and are contributing to this miracle of American democracy.\n\nThe book focuses on the 2020 general election in the United States. It explores the intricate processes that go into running an election, as well as the challenges it faces. They also argue that the last election was, \u201cThe Most Secure, Verifiable, And Transparent In American History.\u201d The pair have worked on reviewing elections and US politics for years on major TV networks and other media outlets. But as Becker explains, their presence on a college campus aims to inform the most powerful generation today.\n\nDavid Becker: We always talk about young voters. They\u2019re kind of the silent force that can come forward and actually vote in high numbers and change outcomes. And yet, every single election, that doesn\u2019t happen. And that\u2019s been true throughout our history. If young voters participate at the same rate as 50 year old voters, we would see very different outcomes in all likelihood in the United States.\n\nThis year\u2019s midterm elections will take place on November 8. The House and Senate are both up for grabs. And although young voters have been turning up to the polls more in recent years, it is still one third of the eligible voter base. Even though we are talking about a wide range of major issues! Here is Major Garrett Major Garrett: And if they if you care deeply about climate change, if you care about social justice, if you care about trans rights, gay rights, bisexual, right. Anything that is in your world and matters to you, then the very best thing you can do, the first and best thing you can do is to vote\n\nThe ways in which the younger generation thinks and approaches politics and social issues brings hope to Garrett Major Garrett: There\u2019s a tremendous sense of communitarian spirit in this generation, and they\u2019re constantly asking themselves what works in our country, what works collaboratively, what works with cooperation across party lines, across races. Elections are one of those things. They\u2019re a beautiful representation of all of these inclinations. Collaboration. Cooperation, cross-party across race, across neighborhood. They really are a great thing.\n\nAmerica does Its up to young people to decide the future of the many issues we hold dear to our hearts. David Becker says this next Congress will make decisions that will affect your life. David Becker: They\u2019re going to be appointing judges who are going or approving judges who come in and hear cases about those issues. And the one way that you can make sure that you have no say in those things is to not vote. And now we\u2019re likely going to see low voter turnout. I would love to be surprised among young people. I would love to be surprised by an unexpected wave of young people showing up and voting. So... Surprise him. Go vote on November 8 and show the future what this generation is made of.\n\nFor Annenberg Media I am Valeria Diaz\n```"}

Despite this ongoing crisis, Oregon will be the only state to consider state-wide gun control in the midterm elections.\n\nOregon\u2019s Measure 114, known as the \u201cChanges to Firearm Ownership and Purchase Requirements Initiative,\u201d would require gun buyers to obtain permits from law enforcement. To get a permit, a person must present a photo ID and fingerprints, complete safety training, pass a background check and pay a fee. Magazines holding over 10 rounds will be banned, and owning one will be classified as a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nGun control activists and survivors spoke in support of Oregon\u2019s Measure 114 at a Monday Zoom conference organized by Yes on 114. \u201cI\u2019m 16 years old urging the people in power above me to put a price on my generation\u2019s lives that are higher than the value of guns,\u201d Juniper Rook, a high school gun control activist, said. \u201cI can\u2019t vote on November 8th and neither can many of my peers. But regardless, passing Measure 114 is the next step to creating a safer world for my generation, those of voting age or not.\u201d\n\nIn support of Measure 114, Rook organized a seven-school walkout, which took place Tuesday afternoon. \u201cReal people\u2019s lives and children and safety are on the line and on the ballot,\u201d Ari Feilich, policy director at Giffords Law Center, said. \u201cThis measure is a critical step on the path to progress \u2013 and other states, lawmakers and stakeholders are watching what happens in Oregon for how they can mobilize the electorate for life saving reforms in their own states.\u201d\n\nA poll published by the Oregonian this month revealed that more than half of Oregon voters supported the measure, while 39% opposed it and 10% were unsure. The measure is similar to California\u2019s Proposition 63, which passed in 2016 with a 63% majority vote. Prop 63 required background checks and banned high-capacity magazines. Restrictions on magazines were in contention until last year, when the U.S. Court of Appeals and the 9th Court upheld the law banning the production, purchasing and owning of cartridges that hold over 10 rounds.\n\n\u201cMeasures like this one we\u2019re trying to get passed in Oregon are critical,\u201d David Hogg, a gun control activist and survivor of the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting, said. \u201cWe know in the states that have passed them that they have some of the lowest gun death rates in the country...They\u2019ve been ruled constitutional and they\u2019ve been proven to be effective.\u201d\n\nGun deaths in California have consistently decreased since the law\u2019s passage in 2016. In 2021, California was ranked first in the country for gun safety by Giffords Law Center after exhibiting a 37% lower gun death rate than the national average. The center was created by former Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was the victim of a mass shooting in 2011 which killed a nine-year-old girl.\n\nAri Freilich, who also aided in the creation of Prop 63, spoke about the 2011 shooting. \u201cIf the gunman had to stop and reload after firing ten rounds instead of 35, she might very well be alive today,\u201d Freilich said. \u201cReal people\u2019s lives and children and futures and safety are on the line and on the ballot here in November.\u201d\n\nStop114, an Oregon organization rallying against the reformative measure, states on their website that the Measure 114\u2032s regulations are unrealistic for police to enforce. Their website reads, \u201cNo matter where you stand on guns, the simple fact is someday, somewhere you may have to protect yourself. And you cannot rely on the police.\u201d\n\nOther states, including Illinois, Hawaii and New Hampshire, have put strict gun regulations in place despite these concerns. \u201cEach day brings dozens of newly titled survivors, all of whom join this club unwillingly and unjustly,\u201d Zoe Turay, a survivor of the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in Michigan, said. \u201cColumbine. Sandy Hook. Hartland. Buffalo. The list is endless \u2014 Oregon can\u2019t be next. The voters of Oregon have a unique chance to take matters into their own hands to prevent gun violence.\u201d```"}

Drivers on the 405 freeway in Los Angeles last Saturday were shocked to see a hate group standing on an overpass, performing Nazi salutes and hanging a banner saying \u2018Kanye is right\u2019 in reference to the controversial influencer\u2019s recent antisemitic rants on social media.\n\nThese incidents follow West\u2019s hateful rants on Twitter, which resulted in his suspension from the platform about two weeks ago. Rabbi Dov Wanger leads USC Chabad. He knows that antisemitism is an age-old problem. But today, social media can amplify hate on an unprecedented scale.\n\nRabbi Dov Wagner: With Kanye West, you\u2019re talking about somebody who has more than twice as many followers on social media as there are Jews in the world, that that carries a lot of weight. When you\u2019ve got somebody so prominent saying horrible things online that makes the crazy person who\u2019s doing Nazi salutes on the 405 feel more comfortable, feel supported, as you saw in the rhetoric they used was about Kanye being right.\n\nAlso last weekend, fliers spreading hateful antisemitic conspiracy theories were found around Beverly Hills and Bel Air. The same group that hung the banners is responsible for the fliers, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The hate group has also spread fliers elsewhere in the Los Angeles area on an almost-weekly basis.\n\nCeline Masjedian, a student at Loyola Marymount University, noticed the fliers on her morning walk around her neighborhood. She says she was shocked, but didn\u2019t report the incident to law enforcement.\n\nCeline Masjedian: I wasn\u2019t really sure what to do. I did pick up as many as I could. I put them in the garbage. I haven\u2019t seen anymore, but I didn\u2019t report it, no. It didn\u2019t even cross my mind to contact law enforcement, because I felt that I don\u2019t know if this is something they could deal with.\n\nThe Los Angeles and Beverly Hills police departments said they were investigating the distribution of the fliers. Rabbi Wagner hopes that those responsible for spreading these hateful messages will be prosecuted.\n\nRabbi Dov Wagner: What I do think is important is that law enforcement recognize that if these things are allowed to pass on unchallenged, they do inevitably escalate into something worse.\n\nWhile law enforcement has been helpful, the extent of their response is limited, says Los Angeles Regional Director of the Anti-Defamation League, Jeffrey Abrams.\n\nJeffrey Abrams: Unfortunately, law enforcement prosecution is not going to be either the way out of this problem or certainly not the sole solution. It really comes down to the people. There\u2019s no question that there are far more people of good faith, far more people who care about their fellow humans than these perpetrators of hate. So we the numbers are in our favor. So we need to use those numbers in our favor.\n\nAbrams says that a recent ADL study shows that antisemitism surged by 34 percent in 2021 with a 28 percent increase in the Los Angeles area. It appears to be rising further in 2022.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sullivan Barthel.\n```"}

The 11-time Grammy Award winner released her tenth studio album on Friday at midnight, appropriately named \u201cMidnights.\u201d In true Taylor Swift fashion, release night was full of surprises, Easter eggs and, for some, tears both happy and sad. Whether you\u2019re a fan or not, there\u2019s a good chance you have something to say about the country-turned-pop-turned-folk-rock-turned-pop-again singer.\n\nMidnights is already topping charts - it quickly broke Spotify\u2019s record for the most streamed album in a single day. Fans stayed up through the night awaiting the release of her thirteen songs. If you\u2019re a Swiftie, you\u2019ll know that Taylor\u2019s favorite number is thirteen, and, as fans would have you convinced, the singer doesn\u2019t do anything by accident.\n\nFreshman communication major Grace Oh has been listening to the album on repeat. GRACE OH: I really did like it. Maroon is my favorite song right now. Swift surprised fans at 3 a.m. by releasing seven more songs. She wrote on Instagram that whereas the first thirteen songs signify the intensities of \u201cthat mystifying, mad hour,\u201d the seven additional tracks provide a glimpse into her journey in finding the \u201cmagic 13.\u201d\n\nThe singer released her first album - a series of country songs about love and heartbreak - in 2006. Since then, she has broken records, performed in sold-out stadiums and re-recorded some of her old music in a move to take ownership of the tracks. Despite her genre-shifting career, Swift has managed to maintain a strong fanbase - 229 million followers on Instagram to be precise.\n\nHere\u2019s Sol Yoo, a junior politcal science and communication major. SUL YOO: We kind of grew up with her, and the audience that she currently has, like we\u2019ve seen her like really progress through the genres and we\u2019re trying to we just eat up everything that she puts out, honestly.\n\nInternational relations and global economy major Zahra Raja attributes Swift\u2019s success to the quality of her songs and her ability to relate to listeners. ZAHRA RAJA: I think she\u2019s really relatable to a lot of women, and I think so much of her message is female empowerment and being as authentic as she can to herself. And the genuineness of her lyrics, I feel like draws a lot of people in.\n\nWhile Swift is most well-known for her breakup songs often alluding to one of her famous exes, Midnights explores topics like self-hatred and commentary on scheming fans. For some, this was a welcomed change. Esquire called the album her \u201cmost revealing music yet.\u201d \n\nGrace Oh, a freshman communication major, talked about the success of Midnights in relation to the evolution of the music industry. OH: I think because it\u2019s all about like change and how we\u2019re becoming more like open minded about different type of music. We\u2019re like exploring new genres. So I feel that artists as well are going through this change. So as they are like adapting, we are also adapting.\n\nWhereas the shift was a welcomed one for many - Entertainment Weekly called it a dreamy return to pop - the genre and so-called over-production was too much for others. Nostalgic for Swift\u2019s slower, folksy evermore and folklore, the Daily Beast called her latest album \u201cshockingly dull.\u201d\n\nHowever, if you are in fact a fan of Midnights, the thrill of a new album isn\u2019t over yet. Tune into the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon for an interview with Taylor Swift tonight, and, if you\u2019re ready for a second late night, get ready for another music video release tomorrow at midnight eastern.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Meredith McCabe.\n```"}

Indian and Hindu student organizations are finding ways to celebrate the holiday with the support of USC.\n\nBy Donny Assefa, Eric Yeh, and Anjali Patel\nOctober 24, 2022 at 5:33 pm PDT\n\nHappy Diwali! Today we celebrate the Hindu religious festival. Often known as the festival of light, it lasts for five days and symbolizes the victory of light over darkness. 1.5 million lanterns were lit across India on the first day of the festival. Here at USC, student organizations are keeping up with their traditions.\n\nDonny Assefa has more on how students are celebrating Diwali. One common tradition is the lighting of special clay lamps known as diyas. These lamps, which are usually placed at temples, houses, and rivers, light up the night and complement the colorful decorations on homes. The holiday is celebrated by people wearing traditional colorful attire, gathering, and exchanging gifts with loved ones. Stunning lights and fireworks are a big component of Diwali. The holiday spans five days and celebrates the arrival of the Hindu New Year.\n\nWe spoke with the presidents of the Hindu Student Organization and the USC Southern California Indo-Americans about how they are celebrating. The president of the Hindu Student Organization, Prasanth Reddy, says here at USC, they welcome everyone to celebrate Diwali.\n\nPRASHANTH REDDY: We\u2019ll be starting with the traditional Hindu Prayer to Goddess Lakshmi, following which we have a few cultural performances including a Japanese Drum performance by Kazan Taiko, a team from UCLA joining us to perform a Punjabi dance. These, along with cultural performances from our very own student teams. In Hinduism, that\u2019s one thing we all consider important, the concept of \u201cVasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201d meaning the entire world is our family. So, irrespective of culture, ethnicity, and religion, they\u2019re all our family. So bringing diverse and cultural teams into our celebration is the best way to do it.\n\nThat\u2019s reinforced by Ashish Kumar, a leader of the USC Southern California Indo-Americans.\n\nASHISH KUMAR: We are planning to have some cultural performances followed by dinner at Bovard Auditorium, so our chief guest is going to be the consulate general of India, the office. So, it will be coming, and we\u2019ll be celebrating Diwali function together.\n\nBoth student organizations are hosting events for Diwali on October 30th. Despite no USC-sanctioned events for the holiday, student organizations still feel supported and are carrying out their own celebrations.

But can it be inducted and accepted into the art world?\n\nAI art of \u201ca painting of USC football players at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum by Leroy Neiman.\u201d (Photo by Alex Storch via Dall-E)\n\nBy Ethan Huang October 24, 2022 at 4:56 pm PDT\n\nSocial media sites have long been a place for artists to share their work and creative vision. But now, one might have to look twice at the images they see on their Twitter and Instagram feeds. Sometimes, these images might look like a digital painting of a vibrant landscape, and other times, it might be an illustration of Walter White from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d in a Starbucks barista apron. The thing these images have in common is their origin \u2013 they were created not by brush or pen, but through code.\n\nArtificial intelligence-generated art has seen a rise in popularity across social media platforms over the past year as computer programs like DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are being used to generate these pictures. \u201cAI art refers to programs that analyze huge data sets of images and text that is attached to each image so that we can use our own text to generate brand new images,\u201d said Mats Borges of USC\u2019s Ahmanson Lab, an extension of the Sidney Harman Academy focused on interdisciplinary research and experimentation. In a nutshell, an individual writes a prompt and the program looks at thousands of images across the internet with similar words attached to them to create something new.\n\nFor many, this is an exciting breakthrough that bridges the gap between art and technology, but a debate has slowly come to the forefront regarding the use of AI art. While it started as a fun way to generate bizarre images, some artists are voicing their concerns about the technology, with some even calling AI artists \u201cnightmare clients\u201d when attempting to pass their work off as \u201creal\u201d art.\n\nThe reason people are getting increasingly frustrated with AI \"artists\" is that no, they AREN'T artists. They're nightmare clients. They tell the AI what they want, demand infinite revisions of it, and once finally satisfied, claim the work as their own. \u2014 Sedona (@Anodesu) September 3, 2022\n\nThis heat comes off the tails of an AI artist winning a fine arts competition. While the judges let him keep the money, the incident was still met with backlash. Now, a steady rise in AI-generated images have begun to circulate the internet, with some defending them and others criticizing their classification. The lingering question now is whether AI art is \u201creal\u201d art.\n\nOf course, the first question to raise is the definition of art itself. To some, it is a form of expression, and to others it is simply a way of bringing human creativity to life. Elea Zhong, a sophomore at USC\u2019s Harman Academy believes that art can be split into two categories. \u201cFor some people, they think that art is solely used for artists to express their ideas and emotions and passions and politics and culture,\u201d Zhong said. \u201cBut I would also argue that at the same time, besides that, there is art that isn\u2019t necessarily emotional or passionate, like corporate art or the art on billboards or Coca-Cola bottles.\u201d\n\nHowever, to others, art also includes the human technique and practice put into artistic creation. They feel that carefully crafting their sketches or digital drawings cannot compare to an individual sitting in front of a computer and typing a few words into a machine. Borges explained that this debate has happened before with something that is now recognized as a hallmark in the art community. \u201cI think the best parallel, and you\u2019ll probably start hearing more of this too, is comparing it to when photography was first invented,\u201d Borges said. \u201cThey were like, \u2018This is going to put all the artists out of business, there\u2019s going to be no more portraiture,\u2019 [and] that it\u2019s all going to be photos. \u2018Photography is not real art, you just click a button and that\u2019s it,\u2019 and that\u2019s not really true. I think over time we have all generally as a society come to accept photography as an art form.\u201d\n\nOn top of this, there is also the idea that many consumers purchase art not for any expression or technique, but for aesthetics. According to Zhong, many people think little of how pieces come to be, and pay closer attention to how they look. She said that from \u201clive, laugh, love\u201d signs to the decorations people hang in their dorms, there are several pieces of art where people are less interested in their creation and subtext. \u201cWe\u2019re not really thinking about emotions and the cultural background and history. We\u2019re just seeing that it\u2019s a pretty thing that is in our rooms or it\u2019s a pretty thing that\u2019s my background wallpaper, or it\u2019s a pretty thing that\u2019s on a sticker. Not necessarily like an emotional piece,\u201d Zhong said.\n\nAI art of \u201caward-winning design for \u2018Sushi\u2019 inspired by Cirque du Soleil\u2019s \u2018O\u2019 show with an amazing stage, smoke and circus chefs.\u201d (Photo by Alex Storch via Dalle-E)\n\nEven with these qualifications, there are ethical concerns regarding AI-generated art in regard to the types of images it uses and the styles it borrows. Borges gave the example of how typing in the word \u201cCEO\u201d will most oftentimes generate images resembling old, white men given the datasets they sort through. This is a fault that algorithms across the internet, even in search engines, have had since the advent of this technology. As author Safiya Noble once discussed in a 2014 TEDx Talk, the top Google auto-fills for \u201cwhy are Black people so...\u201d included words like \u201cloud,\u201d \u201cathletic\u201d and \u201clazy.\u201d While these algorithms have evolved over the years, many of these biases persist and bleed into the programs generating AI art. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the data set? How are they combing through things? What do they choose to say, \u2018this should be in the data set?\u2019\u201d said Borges. \u201cThat\u2019s not even talking about artists whose whole careers have been building a style, especially concept artists. And now, someone can just type what they want and say in the style of blah blah blah and take that while the artist never consented to having their [art] in the dataset.\u201d\n\nAI art of \u201ca man levitating over the Grand Canyon painted by Ralph Steadman.\u201d (Photo by Alex Storch via Dall-E)\n\nIn a way, these machines could be seen both as biased and as thieves. These flaws ultimately exist because of the lack of direct human involvement in their creation. \u201cIt has no comprehension of what these images are...Type in paintings of bodies, like artistic paintings, nude images, etc. and what comes out is really grotesque,\u201d said Borges. \u201cYou will get like these double bodies where one person\u2019s leg becomes the neck of another person and like their arm becomes a foot and their foot is a hand.\u201d\n\nI don't know who made this but it's the funniest AI art I've seen so far pic.twitter.com/iYno97QpEZ \u2014 ska.harumi(* '\ua4b3' *)6 (@skaharumi) October 18, 2022\n\nThis returns to the question: can this be considered art? On one hand, in aesthetic terms and historical precedent, it perhaps could be put under that umbrella. But these machines still have holes that make them incomparable to the standards of human creation and leave them vulnerable to abuse. Regardless of the answer, it seems that AI art will remain in this increasingly digital world. For Zhong, there is immeasurable potential for its continued growth both technically and socially. \u201cI feel like [normal artists\u2019 spaces] are valid in disliking it and I feel like there has to be some way that we could try to get them to accept it or try to create tools that are not intrusive and not abrasive and not like touting its revolutionary, etc. that would actually help normal people to create art,\u201d said Zhong.\n```"}

After Taylor Swift announced the release of her tenth studio album, coined \u201cTS10\u2032\u2032 by fans, practically the entire internet spiraled into a frenzy \u2013 and in less than 24 hours following the album\u2019s release, Swift broke the record for most single-day streams of an album in Spotify history. At USC, campus was buzzing, both when the original 13-track album was released, and again three hours later when the artist released seven bonus tracks. The album could be heard echoing in the halls of Birnkrant Residential College and outside Leavey Library near McCarthy Quad as students engaged in the magical experience of listening to one of Swift\u2019s masterpieces for the first time.\n\nSwifties have craved a new concept album following the 2021 releases of re-recordings \u201cRed (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201cFearless (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d, and \u201cMidnights\u201d came just as her fans grew concerned that she would release new music only after she finished re-recording the remaining four albums, \u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d \u201c1989,\u201d and \u201creputation.\u201d With \u201cMidnights,\u201d Swift responded to demand from fans with an album that excels in transporting listeners into the frantic, magical fever dream that defines her career and personal life \u2013 guiding Swifties through experiences that are so uniquely hers, while capitalizing on conveying feelings that nearly any listener can relate to.\n\nSwift\u2019s approach with the album, leading listeners through \u201cthe stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout [her] life,\u201d resulted in a diverse compilation of sounds that reflect her critically-acclaimed albums. \u201cLavender Haze\u201d and \u201cMaroon\u201d serve as a strong kickoff to the album with flawless vocals and powerful production elements similar to \u201cI Think He Knows\u201d from her seventh studio album \u201cLover\u201d and \u201cKing of My Heart\u201d from \u201creputation.\u201d\n\nBut the record\u2019s first lyrical standout is track three, lead single \u201cAnti-Hero.\u201d An upbeat yet lyrically dreary track, Swift reflects on the toll that her life in the spotlight has taken on her: \u201cWhen my depression works the graveyard shift / All of the people I\u2019ve ghosted stand there in the room / I should not be left to my own devices / They come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis.\u201d Unlike so many of Swift\u2019s previous tracks, rather than calling out those who have wronged her, the artist rather reflects on her own faults and flaws in the track\u2019s chorus: \u201cIt\u2019s me / Hi / I\u2019m the problem, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nWhile Swift has mastered the art of storytelling, her willingness to share her struggles with mental health and body image unlocks a new level of vulnerability for the artist only previously seen in her 2020 documentary \u201cMiss Americana.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s only track featuring another artist, \u201cSnow On The Beach (feat. Lana Del Rey),\u201d sets a more somber tone for the next portion of the record. Despite the hype surrounding this highly anticipated collaboration between two of the most notable names in the music industry, the track was a letdown, as Del Rey only contributed backing vocals. While the track does succeed in creating an ambient aura for listeners following an upbeat introduction to the album, the lack of a Del Rey verse was a disappointment.\n\nHowever, the album\u2019s next track, \u201cYou\u2019re On Your Own, Kid\u201d makes up for the missed opportunities that taint \u201cSnow On The Beach.\u201d The gut-wrenching ballad is a breakthrough for Swift, fusing all of her strengths into three minutes and 14 seconds of perfectly curated heartbreak. On this track, Swift and her praised longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff dive deeper into the themes introduced on \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d and \u201cthis is me trying\u201d from Swift\u2019s eighth studio album \u201cfolklore.\u201d\n\nHer unparalleled vocal range lends to a poetic masterpiece of a bridge: \u201cFrom sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes / I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this / I hosted parties and starved my body / Like I\u2019d be saved by a perfect kiss.\u201d Listening to the track is transformative \u2013 the emotions of isolation, loneliness and betrayal that the song outlines cause listeners to experience all stages of grief at once.\n\nThe middle of the album, while still succeeding in showcasing both old and new sounds and Swift\u2019s clear vocal talent, exposes some of the album\u2019s minor faults. \u201cQuestion...?\u201d displays one of the record\u2019s notable downfalls \u2013 lyrics that are occasionally too specific or odd for listeners to relate to, as seen in the track\u2019s chorus when Swift sings \u201cDid you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room / And every single one of your friends was makin\u2019 fun of you / But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin\u2019 too?\u201d\n\nThe lyrics of \u201cVigilante S***,\u201d a track mirroring the themes of \u201creputation,\u201d highlight this same issue, with verses stating \u201cShe had the envelope, where you think she got it from? / Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride / Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife.\u201d These oddly specific lyrics take away from one of Swift\u2019s clearest strengths \u2013 her ability to foster a deep emotional connection with listeners \u2013 and creates a sense that Swift is simply word-dumping rather than employing her skill for beautifully packaging a complete, relatable story in just a few minutes.\n\nBut somehow, by pairing some of the album\u2019s strangely particular lyrics with an upbeat bassline, Swift presents listeners with some of the best bops of her discography. \u201cKarma,\u201d track 11, showcases this strange phenomenon. Attempting to figure out what Swift is communicating in lyrics such as \u201cKarma is my boyfriend / Karma is a God\u201d and \u201cKarma is a cat / Purring in my lap \u2018cause it loves me\u201d is impossible, but the track still serves as a serotonin-boosting earworm regardless.\n\n\u201cSweet Nothing\u201d presents a complete shift in terms of both lyrical composition and musical style. A mix of \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d from \u201creputation\u201d and \u201cinvisible string\u201d from \u201cfolklore,\u201d the track, written by Swift and \u201cWilliam Bowery\u201d (a not-so-indiscreet pseudonym for the artist\u2019s partner of six years Joe Alwyn), conveys the comfort and security Swift\u2019s relationship provides. The singer paints the relationship as an escape from her public life polluted with \u201cindustry disruptors and soul deconstructors.\u201d She explains that \u201cEveryone\u2019s up to something / I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings / Outside they\u2019re push and shoving / You\u2019re in the kitchen hummin\u2019 / All that you ever wanted from me was nothing.\u201d\n\nThe track\u2019s lullaby-like sound and wholesome lyrics juxtapose the album\u2019s deeper themes of trauma, guilt and self-hatred, contributing to the album\u2019s contrasting lightheartedness and complexity.\n\nWhile Swift\u2019s originality in creating a diverse album that compiles her most celebrated sounds, styles and themes is worth appreciation, the record does feel disjointed and inconsistent at times, lacking the sense of unity that set preceding sister albums \u201cfolklore\u201d and \u201cevermore\u201d apart. However, this lack of cohesion is a natural result of her decision to meld an array of emotions, stories and plot points in her rise to fame, and many of the album\u2019s tracks individually still serve as musical gems.\n\n\u201cWould\u2019ve, Could\u2019ve, Should\u2019ve,\u201d the bonus track marking a powerful punch on the last leg of the record before the album\u2019s melancholic closer \u201cDear Reader,\u201d is the epitome of a classic Taylor Swift post-breakup banger. The track\u2019s eerie introduction and electric guitar riffs set the stage for the rollercoaster of rage that Swift has constructed through her lyrics: \u201cI would\u2019ve stayed on my knees / And I damn sure never would\u2019ve danced with the devil / At nineteen.\u201d\n\nWhile fans speculate the song is about the artist\u2019s tumultuous past relationship with John Mayer, the emotions the track evokes \u2013 regret and self-loathing \u2013 are themes any listener can connect with. The song\u2019s top-tier production quality accompanied by Swift\u2019s heated tone and the outro\u2019s octave change serve as the perfect cap to the emotionally-charged tales of \u201cMidnights.\u201d\n\nA poetic patchwork of fresh sounds and the musical styles she has mastered throughout her remarkable career, \u201cMidnights\u201d marks the revival, celebration and evolution of Swift\u2019s previous works. The singer\u2019s new spin on eternally relevant themes guides listeners on a vibrant journey through the painful yet liberating stages of personal growth: \u201cbreak up, break free, break through, break down.\u201d\n\nThe digital format of \u201cMidnights\u201d retails for $14.99, and it can be streamed on most major streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify, SoundCloud and Amazon Music.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n\nBy Matthew Calma October 24, 2022 at 12:14 pm PDT\n\nAcross the entire U.S., housing has become one of the most pressing issues for city dwellers. Rent and inflation have skyrocketed, and tens of thousands of people have been pushed out of their homes. Since the 1980s, urban centers, such as Los Angeles and New York City have simultaneously experienced housing crises, accompanied by an explosion in homelessness. Although the United States has always had an unhoused population, the number of people and the face of those people have changed drastically in recent years. Today, our housing crisis has made renting unaffordable, left extremely limited options, and pushed so many out of their communities. Homelessness is our modern day crisis.\n\nInterestingly enough, the two largest urban centers, Los Angeles and New York have parallel experiences with the housing market and comparable rent pricing. In the 1970s, housing prices were relatively inexpensive in both cities. However, in New York, from the 1970s to 1980, the average rent jumped from $335 monthly to $1700 monthly, over a 500% increase. By 1999, the average rent in NYC nearly doubled to $3,200 a month. In Los Angeles, the picture is quite similar. In 1980, median rent in Los Angeles was $838 monthly. Today, median rent in both cities hovers around $2,500, representing a similar housing crisis for New Yorkers and Angelenos alike.\n\nThe shift in wealth from the many to the few began in the late 1970s and rapidly shifted in the 1980s, the exact same time that rents began to skyrocket across both New York and Los Angeles. Our unprecedented rates of wealth and income inequality have been the strongest explanation for the modern housing crisis that we now face.\n\nHousing, being almost entirely unregulated, was left to the desires of New York City landlords. What is most interesting about the rise in rents in New York and Los Angeles is the inability to point fingers in any single direction. Landlords across the city have simply sought to maximize profit by increasing rental prices and targeting higher income individuals that are able to pay more. Without constrictions of residential policy, under the new era of wealth and income concentrated at the top of the economy, real estate builders were in the position to pursue their desires of building new unsubsidized, high-income housing across the city. Affordable housing was not being built.\n\nOn the contrary, affordable housing has simultaneously been taken out of the rental market in both New York and Los Angeles. Mitchell-Lama, the largest affordable housing policy established in New York City which produced over 115,000 units of affordable housing, has speedily been taken out of the market due to expiring regulations. With a growing upper income class and an even faster growing lower income class, alongside the hollowing out of the middle, new development targets high income individuals. As the story goes with rampant inequality, there becomes heavy populations on each side of the spectrum of wealth, putting an even heavier weight on the lower income end. Low income individuals are now pitted against each other for low-rent housing.\n\nMore serious than increasing the high-rent housing supply, is the decrease in the supply of low-rent housing. The decrease in vacancy rates for low-rent housing supply New York has been directly linked to increases in homelessness across the city. From just 1970 to 1990, units renting under $304 decreased by half in just a 20 year period. In the two decades, homelessness doubled. This was the scenario we saw in New York in the short time span between 1987 and 1990, where homelessness dropped from 27,000 to 18,000 when there was a slight increase in low-rent housing. The same scenario is mirrored in Los Angeles, where the high-rent luxury market has high rates of vacancy, but low-rent housing is squeezed with low rates of vacancy.\n\nThe ability of high-income individuals to rent those same low-rent units further decreases the total available supply for those without many options to begin with. Lower levels of vacancy push rents higher, the affordable housing supply falls further and farther away from those who are most desperate, and many are pushed out of the housing market entirely.\n\nIn New York, the next option of housing outside of the market is the shelter system that the city is required to provide. Since 1979, under the Right to Shelter, anyone who is in need of a bed has a \u201cright to shelter\u201d and must be provided one. This produces the current burgeoning shelter population that the city has continued to divert billions of dollars annually to maintain and expand. New York City has a nightly shelter population of about 52,000 people with only about 3,400 people living on the streets.\n\nFor Angelenos, the next step out of the housing market is the streets. Only 32% of the unhoused population lives in shelters. The remaining 68% is spread across the city streets day and night. The cities are almost identical in their rate of homelessness, but their policy approaches are vastly different. Neither city, however, has managed to properly deal with the housing and homelessness crisis. Policy approaches have not gone after the root causes, the lack of affordable housing for those of the lowest income.\n\nIf Los Angeles or New York wish to make a dent in the ever growing unhoused population, they must treat it as a symptom of the underlying illness: an ever increasing rental market.

{"key": "/2022/10/24/college-football-roundup-long-term-head-coaching-contracts-are-a-disaster/", "response": "```\nCollege Football Roundup: Long-term head coaching contracts are a disaster\n\nThis season shows us why fully-guaranteed long-term head coaching contracts hardly ever work out.\n\nTexas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher gestures during the first half of the team's NCAA college football game against South Carolina on Saturday, Oct. 22, 2022, in Columbia, S.C. (AP Photo/Artie Walker Jr.)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade October 24, 2022 at 12:01 pm PDT\n\nHead coach buyouts are getting out of hand. The point of handing out massive contracts to head coaches is to retain those coaches for a long period of time and to reward them for building the program into what it currently is. But that comes with a significant cost if the coach loses steam later on. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing with programs such as Northwestern, Iowa and Stanford \u2014 programs where success wasn\u2019t as common until the current head coach took the helm. Eventually, that success has to fade away and if you don\u2019t have an out, you could be stuck with that head coach for a very, very long time.\n\nNorthwestern head coach Pat Fitzgerald has two Big Ten West titles since 2018, but Northwestern started off this season 1-6 and is 4-15 over the past two seasons. Fitzgerald\u2019s contract runs through 2030. Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz has led the Hawkeyes to four nine-win seasons since 2015, but the team is 3-4 with no hope of turning the season around. Ferentz will be at the helm through 2029. You can probably guess that Stanford is in a similar position with head coach David Shaw. Although his contract is not public, Shaw earned $8.9 million in 2019 and is 14-23 in 2019-2022.\n\nThese huge contracts give coaches the freedom to run the program however they want, even into the dirt. Shaw has no urgency to adapt to the new NIL and transfer rules to put Stanford in a better position to succeed. Ferentz had the liberty to hire his son, Brian Ferentz, as Iowa\u2019s offensive coordinator in 2017, and guess what? The Hawkeyes are averaging just 227.3 yards and 14.0 points per game.\n\nThese long-term contracts don\u2019t offer much benefit but have the potential to sink once-successful coaches and programs. There are definitely individual cases of success with contracts similar to those listed above. Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban is an obvious example. Saban will be under contract through 2030 and will be paid more than $10 million each year. That\u2019s essentially an impossible contract for the Crimson Tide athletic department to get out of if things go south. But the contract works. In the eyes of many in Tuscaloosa, Saban walks on water and for good reason. Saban has won six national championships in 15 seasons and is rightfully considered by many to be the greatest college football head coach of all time. That is a coach you can give one of these contracts to.\n\nFerentz, Shaw and Fitzgerald have hardly entertained the idea of leaving their respective programs. If you don\u2019t give them a massive long-term deal, are they going to walk out of the role they\u2019ve held for over a decade? I don\u2019t think so, and I\u2019m sure the athletic directors agree with my line of thinking.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to the elephant in the room. I\u2019ve talked about coaches with sustained success at their program and why those coaches don\u2019t even deserve lengthy contracts. But there\u2019s one coach who was given one of the largest contracts in college football history before coaching a game for the school. Jimbo Fisher. Who else could it be? Fisher is the head coach of Texas A&M and, when he was hired, was given a plaque for a future national championship in \u201c20- -.\u201d Well, Fisher hasn\u2019t delivered on that promise yet, and he only came close to even making the College Football Playoff during the COVID-19 year. In Fisher\u2019s other four seasons, the Aggies suffered at least four losses each year. Starting the 2022 season at 3-4 doesn\u2019t have Aggie fans feeling any more confident in Fisher\u2019s reign. And if things continue to slide, the Texas A&M athletic department has zero leverage to pull Fisher from his duties.\n\nWhen Fisher initially signed his contract, it was worth $75 million for 10 years. In 2021, Fisher signed an extension through the 2031 season worth $95 million. And it\u2019s entirely, unequivocally, undoubtedly fully guaranteed. Texas A&M \u2014 or let\u2019s be honest, some booster \u2014 would have to pay Fisher $86 million to fire him after the 2022 season. None of that can be whittled down. It\u2019s as if it was etched in stone.\n\nI understand why Fisher was initially given such a substantial contract. Fisher won a national championship with Florida State just a few years before bolting for College Station and there aren\u2019t many coaches better than Fisher in all of college football. The Aggies needed to convince him to leave one way or another, and money talks. That makes sense to me. You start to lose me when the fully guaranteed 10-year contract is given out.\n\nWith all of these bad contracts floating around, I\u2019ve come up with a two-step process to determine whether a 10-year fully guaranteed contract should be offered. Step 1: Is the head coaching candidate Nick Saban? If yes, pay him to your heart\u2019s content! Step 2: If the answer to the first question is no, then do not, under any circumstances, offer that fully guaranteed contract. I\u2019m hoping that process seems easy enough. Many athletic directors before have failed, but with this new litmus test we should see some improvement. Who am I kidding \u2014 we\u2019re going to continue to see these awful contracts given out, and we\u2019re going to wonder how these athletic directors were even hired in the first place.\n```"}

Through the Caleb Cares Foundation, Williams\u2019 new partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Los Angeles hosted an anti-bullying assembly at the Los Angeles Lakers Youth Foundation gym during National Bullying Prevention Month.\n\n\u201cI was in the Boys & Girls Club, and being able to give back to make sure they are being seen and heard is an awesome experience,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe Boys & Girls Clubs encouraged their students to take a stand against bullying by displaying posters that read \u201cBe a Game Changer,\u201d \u201cReal Players Don\u2019t Bully\u201d and \u201cTake a Stand And Unite Against Bullying.\u201d Students from the ages of six to 11 sat in the bleachers of the gym and waited for the anti-bullying assembly to start.\n\nThe assembly started with fifth grade leaders asking Williams questions about life as a student-athlete, Caleb Cares and bullying. When the fifth grade leaders asked their questions to Williams, he encouraged the students by telling them, \u201cYou got this.\u201d\n\nOne fifth grade leader asked Williams how he handles bullying as a football player. \u201cMy support system, which includes my dad, my mom and my mentors are always there for me whenever I need to speak up and talk about anything,\u201d Williams said, \u201cand staying consistent with a routine helps me. For students, you should find someone who is able to sit there and speak to you so that you can talk and let everything out.\u201d\n\nAfter Williams answered questions, the Boys & Girls Clubs facilitated anti-bullying skits for students to understand how to identify different forms of bullying: physical, verbal, social and cyber. USC Annenberg undergraduate and graduate students volunteered to act out the anti-bullying skits with fifth graders.\n\nOne of the nine Annenberg volunteers, first-year graduate public relations and advertising student Anayissa Rebollo expressed how leading cyberbullying skits inspired her to volunteer again. \u201cAs not only an SC student, but as someone who grew up going to community centers I want to remind students that they can achieve their dreams because a lot of the kids that I talked to said that they wanted to go to USC,\u201d Robello said.\n\nWilliams\u2019 foundation presented the first-ever Caleb Cares Hero Award to a student who modeled kindness, empathy, respect and has been a good model to their peers. This award will be presented to a new student every month for the next year.\n\nThe Challengers Clubhouse director Alejandra Liera announced that fourth grader Nylah Ferns was awarded the first Caleb Cares Hero Award. Liera said Ferns overcame challenges, is a leader to her peers in school and the Challengers Clubhouse and refrained from retaliating against bullying.\n\nFerns received gifts from Williams\u2019 partnerships: a Beats by Dre wireless earbuds, Futuremood Aurabliss Sunglasses, Hall of Goats\u2019 Caleb Cares Hero Award t-shirt, Fatburger and Alo gift certificates, custom bobblehead of Williams and a USC Annenberg backpack.\n\n\u201cI feel awesome,\u201d Ferns said. \u201cI was proud of myself and I was pretty shy.\u201d\n\nFerns was inspired to continue to show her peers how to be kind to others in school and at the Boys & Girls Clubs at Metro Los Angeles. \u201cIf someone is feeling hurt, sad, uncomfortable, I will rub their back and ask how they are feeling,\u201d Ferns said. \u201cThen, I would say sometimes life is hard but you have to get through the hard things first and tell them to take a deep breath.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 ordered a Fatburger food truck to feed the students, volunteers and Boys & Girls Clubs\u2019 staff members. The quarterback handed boxes of hamburgers and chips to the students.\n\nWith about 50 students waiting for their hamburgers, some students stepped out of line to throw the football and ask Williams for a signature. At one point, he played rock, paper, scissors with a student and a line of students formed as each student waited eagerly for their chance to take on the Heisman Trophy candidate.\n\nWilliams hopes to be a frequent visitor at the Boys & Girls Clubs and for students not to view him differently due to his position on the gridiron. \u201cHopefully, the students will all know me and won\u2019t look at me as Caleb who plays football,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHopefully, the students see me only as the Caleb who comes and supports them.\u201d\n\nThe anti-bullying event opened Williams\u2019 eyes to the impact he is leaving on students for bullying and mental health awareness. He hopes to make another effort soon to continue spreading awareness.\n```"}

The Trojans came out hot from the get-go, pushing the Colorado defenders and goalkeeper the entire first half. The Trojans were dominant in the first half when it came to possession; it seemed every single time they got the ball they were pushing the attack. In the second minute of play, it seemed that this aggressive play style was paying off. Sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer was positioned perfectly in the middle of the 18-yard box, but she just barely missed off the right goal post. In the 12th minute, yet again the Trojans had an opportunity to score, but junior midfielder Zoe Burns\u2019 shot was denied by the crossbar. One of the killers of the Trojans was, in fact, their aggression and overeagerness to score, as they were called offsides seven total times in the game to Colorado\u2019s one. In the 25th minute, it was still mostly USC controlling the tempo and possession when Farmer just barely overshot the goal from just inside the 18-yard box. Probably the best chance at a goal in the first half for the Trojans was when Buffaloes\u2019 sophomore goalkeeper Bella Grust whiffed on an overshot pass from outside the 18-yard box, but the Trojans were unable to capitalize on the mistake. USC\u2019s first-half dominance would end in the 38th minute. Colorado senior forward Civana Kuhlman broke away from the defense and scored a rocket from outside the 18-yard box to make the score 1-0 right before the break. The second half wasn\u2019t much different from the first. The Trojans kept up the pressure on the Buffaloes and kept up the barrage of shots as well. In the 63rd minute, the Trojans maneuvered their way down the field, and Simone Jackson sliced through the defense to the edge of the 6-yard box. But just as Jackson thought she had the equalizer, Grust came forward to jump and save the shot. In the 74th minute, hope was starting to dwindle for USC after an offsides call. But that didn\u2019t last long. Graduate defender Brandi Peterson crossed the ball into the box where it was headed up in the air by the Buffaloes, then masterfully headed in by Farmer, tying the score 1-1. With time running out in the 84th minute, the Trojans had one final chance to turn this into a come-from-behind victory, but Farmer\u2019s shot was saved by Grust. The Colorado goalkeeper was by far its MVP of the game. With just 20 seconds left, the Buffaloes had one last corner kick to try and keep this game a win. The ball was batted out, and senior midfielder Amaya Gonzales missed the top right of the goal, ending the game 1-1. If you looked at this game from an analytical perspective, you would have thought the Trojans destroyed Colorado. USC finished with 21 shots, compared to Colorado\u2019s measly six. The Trojans now stand at 9-2-3 overall and 5-1-2 in Pac-12 play. They head home for their final three games of the regular season, still in the hunt for the Pac-12 Championship. USC will face Washington on Thursday at McAlister Field at 2 p.m.\n```"}

Despite \u201cBros\u201d receiving  critical acclaim , the film had a  disappointing  box office run, making only $4.8 million, or about half of the projected $8 to $10 million, against a budget of $22 million. This resulted in a controversial  tweet  from creator and star Billy Eichner that blamed the film\u2019s lackluster performance on \u201cstraight people.\u201d \n\nFrom the quick-witted angry comedian, Eichner, who is best known for \u201c Billy on the Street \u201d (2011), and filmmakers Nicholas Stoller and Judd Apatow, \u201c Bros \u201d is a rom-com about two men who fall in love. And not to be dramatic, but \u201cBros\u201d is literally the best gay film I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nEichner plays Bobby Lieber, a successful podcaster and chairman of a committee that is overseeing the creation of the first LGBTQ+ history museum. Bobby takes on the same charms as Eichner: He\u2019s intense and cynical yet crass and self-deprecating. He\u2019s a 40-year-old gay man who has never been in a serious relationship until he meets Aaron, played by Luke Macfarlane. \n\n\u201cBros\u201d is an easy watch with some familiar story beats. The jokes are hilarious in both its writing and delivery, with standout performances from Bowen Yang and Jim Rash. The comedy is smart, largely critiquing gay culture without mocking it, and pokes fun at infighting among the LGBTQ+ community, impossible beauty standards and the promiscuity of gay men. \n\nAs a gay man who has spent most of his pubescent years secretly binging the LGBTQ+ catalogue on my family\u2019s Netflix account, I am both glad and upset that \u201cBros\u201d has moved to streaming. While it is disappointing that the film didn\u2019t perform well, considering how  revolutionary  its theatrical release was, \u201cBros\u201d will now be accessible to people who may have had second thoughts about seeing a gay movie in theaters. However, this could be a cautionary tale that prevents Hollywood from investing in future gay cinema. \n\nUnlike most gay films that involve teenagers discovering their sexualities or battling homophobia, \u201cBros\u201d is a breath of fresh air that tells a relatable story with flawed characters that you can\u2019t help but root for. A lot of what makes \u201cBros\u201d so charming is in the parallels that it draws between the plot and real life. Though the museum serves as a nice backdrop for the film, it points towards a larger message of gay liberation while also nodding at the  historical nature  of Eichner\u2019s film as the first big studio gay rom-com with an all LGBTQ+ principal cast. \n\nWhile not everyone is a successful gay New Yorker in their forties, there\u2019s something painfully relatable about the two leads. Bobby\u2019s pessimism stems from his fear of rejection. He\u2019s afraid to be loved by Aaron, because he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s attractive enough. Meanwhile, Aaron is afraid that he\u2019s too boring to fit into Bobby\u2019s life. \n\n\u201cBros\u201d is at its best when it focuses on the distinct struggles of a gay romance. Emotionally unavailable men are prevalent in the gay community and the movie explores why these characters reject the possibility of love. The introspection into the trauma they carry from their youth, and how they later deal with that trauma, was raw and fascinating. \n\nThe film also explores an experience that many older gay men have: struggling to reconcile with a society that accepts them today but ostracized them less than two decades ago. Bobby and Aaron are a microcosm of a generation of gay men who lacked queer role models and were surrounded by rampant homophobia, only to enter adulthood with a sudden acceptance of homosexuality. \n\nSeeing how these characters come together, break down their walls and allow themselves to be loved is a beautiful and intimate study on queer characters who rarely grace our screens. \n\nAt its core, \u201cBros\u201d is a hilarious movie that packs a lot more heart than expected. When the movie is funny, it\u2019s laugh-out-loud hilarious, and when it\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s tear-jerking. There\u2019s something very emotional about seeing a relatable representation of gay men, and \u201cBros\u201d makes me optimistic for the future of gay cinema, especially as it stands to impact many more queer adolescents by widening its audience and accessibility.\n```"}

Credit: Aadya Chidanand.\n\nBy Rajvinder Singh, Aadya Chidanand, and Eric Lambkins II\n\nOctober 23, 2022 at 4:47 pm PDT\n\nJennifer Mack grew up in Compton and remembers shopping for groceries with her grandma. She couldn\u2019t understand why they needed to go to three or more stores to find everything they needed. Now 41, she follows the same routine.\n\n\u201cIt was the lack of quality,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cOur grandparents knew that the local market had fresh produce from local farms, whereas the major grocery stores probably don\u2019t handle their produce as well.\u201d\n\nThe Food 4 Less in Compton sells tiny, often bruised fruits and vegetables, and she fears that the Costco is too big to maintain the quality of all its meats. Her husband, Simmie Mack Jr., grew up in the Jordan Downs projects in Watts, one of the poorest neighborhoods in L.A.\n\nIn Watts, the option for fresh produce is overwhelmed by corner stores and fast-food eateries. When the meats and produce are available two miles away from the projects, they\u2019re often bruised or approaching expiration dates on the shelves of Food 4 Less.\n\nThanks to his grandfather, Simmie embraced urban farming at an early age. His grandfather\u2019s backyard vegetable plot provided a bounty of fresh produce. Now, Simmie and Jennifer barter with neighbors who grow their own produce.\n\nSimmie likes to say that he and his wife live in a neighborhood rather than a community. It\u2019s a more intimate relationship. One of the small communities working to reform their identity and tackle the climate crisis in L.A. can be found in Watts, which is just across the street from Mudtown Farms on 103rd and Grape streets.\n\nReports from across the U.S. show that urban agriculture helps the recovery of low-income communities disproportionately hit by the climate crisis. The Conservation Law Foundation states that urban farming is meant to reshape a community\u2019s idea of empty space, rather than compete with traditional farming practices.\n\nThe roots of urban farming lie in providing security and survival to individuals, but in 2022, urban farming plays an even greater role in the wellbeing of people in Los Angeles. Starting in 2013, Cultivate Los Angeles showed increased interest in urban farming in Los Angeles and found creative approaches to growing crops in the concrete jungle.\n\nToday, L.A. County alone accounts for 1,261 urban agriculture sites, out of which roughly 60% are school gardens.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here to fend for ourselves because the government is not assisting,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cWhat we have on every corner is McDonald\u2019s and liquor stores, but we don\u2019t have fresh farms, fresh fruits, or fresh produce.\u201d\n\nSpoiled tomatoes at Food 4 Less. Credit: Aadya Chidanand\n\nIn one instance of watercooler talk with her coworkers, Jennifer realized something. Compton and Watts didn\u2019t have stores like Trader Joe\u2019s, Ralph\u2019s, and Whole Foods.\n\n\u201cMy employees had no clue what a Food 4 Less was,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cThey had all the stores that cater to health, cater to what\u2019s better for us as humans.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, Simmie noticed the growing trend of organically produced foods in his community, which intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic with an even greater awareness of conscious eating.\n\n\u201cA lot of people started doing their own homework,\u201d Simmie said. \u201cThey started investigating and started doing research because they had nothing but time to do it.\u201d\n\nSince Mudtown Farm officially opened the doors to 2.5 acres of urban farmed land in 2022, it has become a beacon of hope for low-income residents and communities beyond Jordan Downs. Mudtown grows everything from fruits and vegetables to medicinal herbs and tea.\n\nIt has also gained a reputation for bridging the food insecurity gap between the community and fresh produce. Community volunteers harvest those crops for Mudtown and receive a portion of the harvests. The remaining produce is given to a neighboring community center.\n\nWatts Labor Community Action Committee (WLCAC) is creating a community gathering space within Mudtown that includes farm, education, and recreational programming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place where community members can reclaim space in the area and tell us what they want to see and what they want to do,\u201d opportunity leader Ava Post said.\n\nA sign for Mudtown Farms. Credit: Eric Lambkins II\n\nA history of contaminated soil\n\nJordan Downs, where Simmie Mack Jr. grew up, is one of the oldest housing projects in Los Angeles. It was a temporary shelter for factory workers during WWII and was known for its discriminatory practices in the 1950s.\n\nLeila Gonzalez-Correa, former executive director of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), admitted in 1989 the organization had failed to improve the quality of life in Jordan Downs.\n\nDuring the acquisition of the property, the city discovered high levels of lead, arsenic, and other chemicals leftover from a former steel mill and trucking operation. Lead contamination from gasoline and paint had become a prominent issue nationwide and especially in L.A.\n\n\u201cSadly, we find a lot of contamination of lead in our soils that affects the development of the brain in children,\u201d said Jonathan Galindez, a project coordinator of Carver Middle School Garden.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, my son does have a higher level of lead in him. We like to play in the soil, but because of that, we\u2019ve had those issues with our health, with our wellbeing, and even mental health.\u201d\n\nA statue of George Washington Carver at Galindez\u2019s farm. His farm is located near Carver Middle School.\n\nIn 2013, the city planned to turn the projects into an \u201curban village\u201d with restaurants, townhouses, and other attractions. However, a 17-month clean-up effort led to the discovery of trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene, substances that cause cancer and birth defects.\n\nWithin the ground of the northern side of the projects, where commercial buildings will eventually sit, perchloroethylene (PCE) was also found, according to a Curbed LA report. The report speculates that the contamination may have migrated from an underground pipeline belonging to ExxonMobile Corporation, just down Alameda Street.\n\nRemediation efforts by the city include the installation of vapor barriers, which are synthetic plastic sheets that prevent the chemical vapors from rising into buildings. In 2016, the city started hauling away 259,375 tons of this toxic dirt \u2013 over 1 million times the weight of a blue whale \u2013 and replaced it with clean, imported soil.\n\nAs of 2017, according to Housing Authority officials, the lead contamination did not spread beyond the renewal site. One question remains: does this affect Mudtown Farms?\n\n\u201cI have taken soil tests recently here, and we have not had any contaminants of concern,\u201d Post said. \u201cWe tested for heavy metals, and we did not have any metals of concern.\u201d\n\nGardening equipment at Carver Middle School Garden. Credit: Eric Lambkins II.\n\nThe Climate Crisis in the Concrete Jungle\n\nFarmers like Galindez see the residents of low-income communities as a metaphor for the soil itself. With care and patience, the soil may reap wonderful opportunities. Soil depends on factors such as soil structure and porosity, topsoil thickness, carbon and nutrient content, acidity, and salinity.\n\nIn addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that municipal solid waste, such as food, grass clippings, and sanitary waste, is the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to bring in the waste into an area like a garden, where we actually can manage it, turn it into a resource, and continue the cycle because food doesn\u2019t just leave and it\u2019s not a thing that can actually just go away,\u201d Galindez said.\n\nA man looks out at Los Angeles covered in a fine layer of smog. Credit: Aadya Chidanand\n\nGaldinez mentions that the garden provides space and education to people so they can bring their waste, learn to manage it the proper way, and create a resource that encourages production of organic food in the neighborhood.\n\nWhile Post says that contamination isn\u2019t an issue for the produce at Mudtown, soil compaction from former projects on the lot requires extra efforts to combat.\n\n\u201cCompaction is basically when there\u2019s a lot of construction, cars, or buildings being on top of something for so long, that squishes soil together into a really bad, hard layer that becomes impermeable to water,\u201d Post said.\n\nIntroducing more organic matter and plant roots into the soil could help loosen this kind of soil, Post asserts. However, much of the soil in L.A. is also masked by layers of concrete, making for the most important trappings of an urban heat island.\n\nSunflowers in bloom at Mudtown farms \u2013 provide shade to saplings. Their seeds are later used for composting. Credit: Aadya Chidanand\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the urban heat island effect in dense populations, in cities where it\u2019s even hotter than it would normally be,\u201d Post said. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to recognize the human aspect of climate change.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Public Health (DPH) found low-income communities and communities of color are most affected by the urban heat island effect. Public health officials say Los Angeles County alone will experience two to four times more days over 95 degrees in 2050.\n\nThese rising temperatures have a strong negative effect on plant growth.\n\n\u201cWe see the flowering patterns of plants, the distributions of certain plants that used to be further south of here now, are completely replacing certain species that you still have here because of these rising temperatures,\u201d Post said.\n\nHeat is not equally received\n\nThe UCLA Heat Map states that there are a total of 8,222 excess emergency room visits on the average hot day. Los Angeles County\u2019s total of 1,510 ER visits puts it at the top of the list.\n\n\u201cThe places that don\u2019t have the resources to deal with heat are going to be hit first and hit hardest,\u201d Post said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s essential to focus on places like Watts.\u201d\n\nWatts is a predominantly Black and Hispanic area with an average existing tree canopy coverage of less than half that exists twenty-three miles away in Beverly Hills, where more than half of the residents are white.\n\nNeighborhoods with the means to plant trees and vegetation can reduce heat by two to nine degrees Fahrenheit. In turn, this can reduce the need for air conditioning, which is a huge source of carbon emissions worldwide.\n\n\u201cEvery five degrees, the different microbial life ecology changes,\u201d Galindez said. \u201cSome go to sleep, some wake up, and some die. Having good soil allows us to actually grow vegetables, even in harsh conditions.\u201d\n\nAn important part of maintaining good soil is adding compost to it, which can help balance its density and acidity. The EPA states, \u201cIt is a resourceful way to turn food waste into a useful product which can help farmers increase their crop yields, provide a local resource for gardens, parks, and landscapers, restore habitats, and improve contaminated or degraded soils.\u201d\n\nAdding compost to soil not only helps prevent methane emissions but reduces carbon pollution emitted through waste treatment facilities.\n\nGrow and Tell\n\nRamiro Gonzalez\u2019s backyard garden.

Now, he finds a dozen or so freshly laid eggs waiting for him in his backyard when he comes home from work.\n\nTransitioning from the streets of Compton to Gonzalez\u2019s backyard is the suburbian equivalent of watching Dorothy step into Oz. The ripples of a waterfall juxtapose with the \u201cbuck-buck\u201d of hen, some of whom he poaches.\n\n\u201cThe flavor of the meat is ridiculous,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI always thought chicken was chicken... it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThen, there is the wealth of produce that surrounds a small pond where koi fish apprehensively observe visitors. Gonzalez says nurturing this miniature farm in his backyard not only saves a considerable amount of money during grocery trips but improves the quality of the food he eats.\n\n\u201cThe flavor is a lot stronger,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cJust like the apples, they\u2019re sweeter, juicer, and they always have that crunch.\u201d\n\nBuilding Community\n\nChili saplings at Mudtown Farms. Credit: Aadya Chidanand\n\nExamples from across the globe show that urban agriculture not only promotes the wellbeing of families by streamlining access to fresh produce and reducing costs but also enables communities to join the produce market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a food desert here,\u201d Salmeron said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t good produce available, lots of fast food, and this is going to show the residents that with just a little bit of TLC and some time, they can grow their own produce.\u201d\n\nWhile Mudtown produce is often given away to community members, the farm plans to promote entrepreneurship within the community by selling to local restaurants.\n\nAcross L.A., other farmers also foster their own relationships to their community. In the Carver Middle School garden, just beside Galindez\u2019s native plants of his indigenous Mexican heritage, sits a bust of George Washington Carver with green foliage hugging the foundation.\n\nIt comes after walking through a sea of greenery, mounds of moist compost hosting visible organisms underneath the surface, and a bed of sunflowers that would stop Vincent van Gogh in his tracks.\n\nGalindez says that by opening this space, he and his team of farmers can cultivate healthy relationships between all walks of life within the community.\n\n\u201cWe have our Black and Brown brothers and sisters come into the space and to just take a second and relax, take a second and breathe,\u201d Galindez said.\n\nJonathan Galindez explains composting.

Meanwhile, in Ohio, empty lots that were transformed into community green spaces have proven to reduce crime rates.\n\nMudtown follows a similar path in which members of the community have a say on what they believe the community needs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get input from the community on what they want to grow, so that we can grow,\u201d Post said. \u201cBut they want to eat, so that we can grow it and have this collaborative process to one, supplement people\u2019s diets, and also give them a place where they can just experience the tranquility of natural space.\u201d\n\nPost says that Mudtown Farms isn\u2019t in Watts to replicate our idea of nature; it\u2019s a contrived representation of nature.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never going to find pristine nature anywhere anyways,\u201d she said. Instead, it\u2019s about giving the community a second chance to define itself and what it could be, rather than the decades media coverage of gang violence, poverty, and 1992 Los Angeles uprising.\n\nGalindez rejects the idea that a college degree is the only way to streamline the practice of sustainable farming within low-income communities. Instead, the power to change a community for the better exists within the individual.\n\n\u201cThe difference between a gardener and a farmer is that a gardener grows food for himself,\u201d Galindez said. \u201cA farmer grows food for other people. So as soon as you start growing food for somebody, you\u2019re a farmer.\u201d```"}

Thakur also said that Share A Meal helps remove the stigma surrounding unhoused people.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to fear homeless people in L.A.,\u201d Thakur said, \u201cbut volunteers tackle this stigma by getting to know the people they serve on a personal level while providing them meals,\u201d he said.\n\nAnyone can volunteer with the organization, and Share A Meal encourages USC students to volunteer on Wednesday and Friday night service runs that wind through the streets of L.A.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that we\u2019re making an impact actually and helping these people, helping them get out of poverty,\u201d said volunteer Piyush Sud, a master\u2019s student studying computer science. \u201cIt always feels good when you\u2019re giving to people.\u201d\n\nThrough Share A Meal\u2019s goal of giving to others, they hope to help decrease L.A.\u2019s number of unhoused people.

Armed with gloves and a limit of only three people to a truck, volunteers delivered burritos to members of the unhoused community.\n\nShare A Meal burritos are stored on trays in a warmer located inside the food truck while the truck drives to different locations.

(Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)\n\nBy Drake Lee\nOctober 23, 2022 at 10:02 am PDT\n\nWith No. 5 USC coming off a heavy loss to Cal and graduate driver Massimo Di Martire out for the game, redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt knew he had to step up and lead the Trojans to a victory against No. 9 Pepperdine. He delivered for head coach Marko Pintaric by leading all players with four goals in a 13-11 victory over the Waves at Raleigh Runnels Memorial Pool. The potential Cutino Award finalist surpassed Blake Edwards for the 10th-most goals in program history with his 159th career goal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazing time with this program, and my teammates have always been there to set me up for success,\u201d Ehrhardt said.\n\nIn all, seven Trojans scored, including redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen who recorded six assists and four steals. Junior driver Carson Kranz supported Ehrhardt\u2019s effort with three strikes. Senior driver Marcus Longton scored in his 18th game of the season, the only Trojan this season to do so. Graduate goalie Kyle McKenney was the only man in the Trojan\u2019s cage for the entire match, blocking five of the Waves\u2019 attempts.\n\nBoth defenses were tested early in a back-and-forth first quarter with five ties. The Trojans kicked off the match with Molthen firing a quick pass to Ehrhardt in the middle who rifled a shot past the outnumbered Waves to give the Trojans their first of four power-play goals. Pepperdine rapidly seized the initiative back with consecutive goals from graduate attacker Dennis Blyashov and freshman attacker Adam Csapo.\n\nAfter junior 2-meter Max Miller drew an exclusion, the Trojans played hot potato with the ball before Kranz lobbed the ball past redshirt sophomore goalie Justin Edward to tie the game at two apiece. Caspo responded by capitalizing on a power-play, recording his second goal. Off the bench, sophomore driver Jake Carter jumped into the pool and proceeded to score the third goal for the Trojans with a strong pass from freshman utility Andrej Grgurevic.\n\nBlyashov struck again, feeding a quick pass to sophomore 2-meter Matty Walsh who blasted a rocket from the middle to give the Waves a 4-3 advantage. Longton responded by flanking to the right of the Waves\u2019 defense and skipping the ball into the net to tie the game. A crucial steal by Grgurevic halted Pepperdine\u2019s momentum. The Australian pushed the ball to Molthen who swam all the way to the two-meter line and scored up the middle to give the Trojans a 5-4 lead.\n\nThe tug-of-war between the two offenses continued until USC emerged with a 6-5 lead at the end of the quarter. Despite the Trojans retaining the lead heading into the second quarter, Pintaric was outraged at the defensive effort by his Trojans.\n\n\u201cIt is borderline unacceptable that we allowed five easy goals in the first quarter,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the matchups we wanted, and we struggled.\u201d\n\nAfter allowing two more goals to Pepperdine that gave the Waves a 7-6 lead, the Trojans tightened up, allowing just four more goals for the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cWe definitely got better defensively as the game went on,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cOur guys started to find their groove.\u201d\n\nThe strong screening effort allowed the USC offense to retain a one-goal lead heading into the half even though Pepperdine outscored its opponents 84-64 in the second quarter this season. The slim margin held for the rest of the game.\n\nThe Trojans will return home to face off against No. 3 Stanford for a Senior Day matchup on Oct. 30.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a difficult game,\u201d Ehrhardt said. \u201cStanford\u2019s got a new coach, so we\u2019ve been watching their games, trying to see how they operate.

Styles has been touring and selling out concert venues like Madison Square Garden, the Moody Center and the United Center this summer. Now, he is finally bringing \u201cHarry\u2019s House\u201d to the Kia Forum, much to the delight of his L.A.-based fans. Just as he did at MSG, Harry will also be performing for 15 nights in L.A.\n\nFans have been anxiously awaiting the pop star\u2019s arrival in the city and are eager to see him on stage. Fans are expected to camp out the night prior to their show in hopes of getting as close to the barricade as possible. The Forum is also expecting fans to line up for early merchandise stands and box office for the sold-out opening night show.\n\nStyles is known to be quite the showman. His iconic outfits, which usually feature feathers, sequins, mix-matched patterns, and bright colors, are custom-made by Gucci. Since the beginning of \u201cLove on Tour 2021,\u201d both he and his fans have treated each concert as their own fashion show. Fans have recreated his stage outfits and have DIY\u2019d their own outfits. These outfits are created based on Styles\u2019 fashion sense and fans\u2019 creativity.\n\nFans will go as far as dressing up in looks imitating the outfit he wore on the cover of his past album, \u201cFine Line,\u201d or his trending outfits from Vogue shoots. Not only are fans speculating what he is wearing for opening night, but they are predicting what his setlist is going to be, and if he will sing his well-known but unreleased song, \u201cMedicine.\u201d\n\nStyles is known for curating pre-show and on-stage setlists that surprise fans at each performance. The singer curates a perfect pre-show playlist that welcomes fans into the venue and is full of classics like \u201cOlivia\u201d by One Direction, \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d by Queen and \u201cToxic\u201d by Britney Spears. His past on-stage setlist for other residency shows started with his song \u201cDaydreaming\u201d from his current album \u201cHarry\u2019s House.\u201d It is likely going to be the same for his L.A. residency shows, but, the real question is, will Styles sing \u201cGrapejuice\u201d? \u201cGrapejuice\u201d is also from his current album, but he has yet to sing it on tour.\n\nA viral TikTok video gives some insight on why he doesn\u2019t perform the song: a fan at a concert had a sign asking why he doesn\u2019t perform the song and Styles replied with, \u201cIt is hard to sing\u201d, while pointing to his throat. Fans have gone as far as dressing up as grapes for his shows, since they are itching for the singer to perform the popular song.\n\nAt every show before Styles hits the stage, venue staff roll a storage box labeled \u201csoft goods\u201d past fans who all know the not-so-secret fact that Styles himself is inside the box. This practice has grown to be a tradition for fans to wait at a barricade, and see the box as it\u2019s rolled under the stage.\n\nFans are shelling out hundreds of dollars for tickets, but from the ticket proceeds, Styles and Live Nation will be donating $1 million to Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund. This fund is the largest gun violence prevention organization in the country. The campaign is a part of Styles\u2019 ongoing commitment to activism.\n\nAlthough his stay in L.A. marks the end of his U.S. tour, Styles will begin his international tour just days after his final night at the Forum.\n```"}

With fans dressed in merchandise from past concerts and custom-printed T-shirts with song lyrics on them, excitement was buzzing for the night ahead.\n\nMost might know Jepsen from her 2012 hit \u201cCall Me Maybe,\u201d but her three studio albums and EPs since then have garnered legions of dedicated fans. Alternative R&B singer Empress Of opened the night at 8 p.m. Supported by a DJ and with four dazzling mirrors on stage behind her, the L.A. native opened up with \u201cSave Me,\u201d the title track from her latest EP.\n\nEmpress Of performed a high-energy 45-minute set, continuously dancing across the stage. The loudest cheers emerged when she sang \u201cWild Girl,\u201d her 2019 dance single with Kito.\n\nAt 9 p.m., lights dimmed to reveal a large circular screen on stage. A large, anthropomorphic moon glowed to life on the screen. \u201cI offer you a safe place to feel whatever it is you need to feel. This night is for you,\u201d the moon coaxed. And feel we did.\n\nJepsen started off the night with dance-pop anthem \u201cThis Love Isn\u2019t Crazy,\u201d backed by celestial set pieces of clouds and stars. Jepsen\u2019s shimmering dress reflected off the stage lights, transporting the audience into the dreamy night sky with showers of confetti.\n\nDespite having a vast discography ranging from mainstream hits to indie favorites, Jepsen performed with equal parts passion and theatrics. Crowd favorites like \u201cI Really Like You\u201d and \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d had the whole venue singing along. Jepsen was not shy in pulling from lesser-known tracks as well, like \u201cCry\u201d from EMOTION Side B and \u201cComeback\u201d from Dedicated Side B, while still engaging the crowd with her effervescent vocals and dance moves.\n\nJepsen radiated energy and never stood still. Dancing across the stage and up and down the stairs, she only stopped to take pictures with fans. Throughout the night, themes of love in Jepsen\u2019s music resonated with the audience, and she delivered them with catchy instrumentation, sharp songwriting and a knowing smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a beach house in Malibu / And I\u2019m probably gonna hurt your feelings,\u201d she sang in \u201cBeach House,\u201d an all-too-relatable dance track about the struggles of online dating. \u201cI won\u2019t want to embarrass anyone here, but let out a little sigh if you\u2019ve ever been friendzoned before,\u201d she said before launching into \u201cYour Type,\u201d a song about, well, the friend zone.\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers when Jepsen reminded the audience of the release of her new, full-length album on Friday. She teased the audience with the performance of an unreleased song, \u201cGo Find Yourself Or Whatever.\u201d The bluesy guitar piece is about \u201cthat wanderer\u201d who breaks your heart. The crowd sat down to listen to the introspective and melancholic song in a short break from the upbeat songs thus far.\n\nAfter a quick outfit change to a metallic jumpsuit, Jepsen brought out a special guest, Rufus Wainwright. They performed the disco-inspired duet \u201cThe Loneliest Time,\u201d the title track from her upcoming album. Jepsen made special mention of her \u201chighly supportive\u201d band, who even put on foil costumes of moons and stars to match the space-themed music video.\n\nJepsen shows off the sword a fan gave her before she sings \"Cut To The Feeling\" (Photo by Jefferson Lim).\n\nAs evidenced by her performance, Carly Rae Jepsen is an artist who knows how to have fun. A longstanding tradition of her concerts is for a fan to hand her a sword as she sings \u201cCut To The Feeling.\u201d This closing song of the concert brought the crowd jumping up and down to its catchy, synth-pop melody as confetti rained from the sky.\n\nThe nearly 90-minute show was an unforgettable, energetic night of fun. Jepsen performed non-stop with such vigor and passion that it was just too hard not to dance and sing along. If love is a lonely road, then we can rest easy knowing that we have the comfort of Jepsen\u2019s music to go along with it.\n\n\u201cThe So Nice Tour\u201d continues through Nov. 5 in the United States and Canada. \u201cThe Loneliest Time\u201d releases on Oct. 21 with Interscope Records.\n```"}

The movie dives into 1930s Harlem, and is based on the true story of young Orson Welles as he navigates the public and personal pitfalls of directing the first production of \u201cMacbeth\u201d with an all-Black cast. \u201cVoodoo Macbeth\u201d stars Jewell Wilson Bridges as director Orson Welles, Inger Tudor as Broadway actor Rose McClendon, and many more talented actors.\n\nThe ambitious \u201cVoodoo Macbeth\u201d project boasts a whopping ten directors and eight writers. Annenberg Media spoke with directors Zo\u00eb Salnave and Christopher Beaton and lead actor Jewell Wilson Bridges to learn how a cohesive vision was achieved, despite the unorthodox number of directors.\n\nThe team went to great lengths to collaborate and ensure a unified vision, according to Salnave. She said that to prepare for the actual shooting, the ten directors first filmed rehearsal scenes on their iPhones individually and reviewed the footage together to gauge the flow and brainstorm ideas for transitions. The collaboration didn\u2019t stop in the early stages, either. Salnave was often present even on days when she wasn\u2019t shooting and directing the scenes slated for that day. This level of involvement among the directors created a supportive environment in which \u201cthere was always a little team of us that could get together and say, like, this is what we talked about or, you know, let me help you with that, or let\u2019s problem solve together,\u201d Salnave said.\n\n\u201cI actually think it elevated everything,\u201d said director Beaton. \u201cAnd everybody was also up for the challenge. You know, there was no single voice that felt like it was, you know, overpowering any of the others.\u201d Beaton also credits the director of photography, Bash Ashkar, and various in-depth script meetings for the creation of a singular vision.\n\nGiven that there were ten directors instead of the usual sole leader at the helm of the film, the actors also had an unorthodox experience in their work on the project. According to lead actor Bridges, it was not the chaotic or confusing experience that some might have expected it to be. \u201c...It really is a testament to collaboration that the entire piece, even though we had ten directors, it looks like a cohesive story both in design and in the narrative structure and whatnot,\u201d said Bridges. \u201cBut every single director empowered us as actors to understand our entire arc and to communicate.\u201d\n\nThe number of directors wouldn\u2019t be the only challenge for the cast and crew, either. The film tackles some difficult subject matter, including Orson Welles performing in blackface. The creative team had to decide the most respectful way to depict this part of history. According to Salnave, Orson Welles did indeed put on blackface and go onstage during one of his productions. The team decided to put the spotlight on the justified outrage that ensued rather than center the scene on Welles or excuse his actions, Salnave said. \u201cWe wanted to show the anger that the other characters had against it,\u201d Salnave said. \u201cI think it was just as, you know, discriminatory and hurtful then. But they just maybe, perhaps didn\u2019t have the voice or the ability to voice their opinions on it and put their foot down and say that they really didn\u2019t like it. So we invoked a little bit, I think, of like a modern touch on that, but it gets the point across that, you know, it is a part of our history, and it\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nActor Bridges shared that the scenes that featured his character in blackface were \u201cthe biggest concern\u201d for him going into the project. Concerned that extras who had not seen the script would be caught off guard or offended by seeing him in blackface, Bridges said \u201cone of the things I talked with the producers is please make sure that everyone knows, please make sure if possible, let them read the script, let them know the story, let them understand the context. And out of respect for that, whenever I shot those scenes, I was never on set until I needed to be...If you see that scene out of context of the film, it can be just horrific. And, but everybody handled that with a lot of respect and I was very grateful for that.\u201d\n\nEven with the challenges and experiential nature of this project, the intense effort and collaboration paid off. The cinematography is dynamic, the set and sound designs are immersive, the performances are stellar, the story is moving and the dialogue is witty. The film grips viewers early on and doesn\u2019t let them take a breath until the curtains fall. While the pace is quick, every scene is well-composed and builds towards the climax. No screen time is wasted.\n\nOf course, every film has its flaws. \u201cVoodoo Macbeth\u201d would have benefited from allowing more time for viewers to connect with the setting of Harlem in the 30s, as well as Rose McClendon. For the most part, the film keeps an unerring focus on Welles, which can sometimes detract from the larger history. At certain times, it felt like the Black community and Haitian inspiration were serving as backdrops for Welles\u2019 vision. I found myself wanting more insight from McClendon. The film also brushes over some of the backlash to the production of \u201cMacbeth,\u201d and the protesters and critics aren\u2019t given an opportunity to fully explain their grievances, either. It would have been fascinating to hear more about the opposing side and their concerns.\n\nThe film is still thoroughly enjoyable. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit I started clapping in my apartment before remembering I was not, in fact, among the theatergoers in 1930s Harlem. The experience opened my eyes to a part of history I never knew existed. \u201cVoodoo Macbeth\u201d is a beautiful story, and it\u2019s beautifully conveyed.\n```"}

We can break through the veil of otherness. The foreign can become the new and exciting. People crave release from their prejudices,\u201d said Micah Huang, composer and artistic director of \u201cAmerican Dreams/Asian Nightmares.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Dreams/Asian Nightmares\u201d melds technology and sonic art to build an unforgettable performance exploring the violence Asian Americans have experienced, as well as a look into what the future may hold. At the creative core of this audiovisual experience is the same team that brought you \u201cBlood on Gold Mountain,\u201d a narrative podcast delving into the cruelty of the Chinese Massacre of 1871.\n\nHao Huang is a professor of music at Scripps College who has long had an interest in forgotten Chinese American histories after learning the true history of L.A.\u2019s Chinatown. Micah Huang, his son, is the creative mind behind it all, blending tech and music into a truly unique experience. Emma Gies, who is also Micah\u2019s partner, brings the whole experience to life as the performer for \u201cAmerican Dreams/Asian Nightmares.\u201d\n\nThe trio takes the audience through a triptych of sonic experiences, starting with \u201cOther Bodies.\u201d This electroacoustic piece explores the relationship between anti-Chinese rhetoric online and anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic through data sonification \u2014 a process that determines sound density using data from academic articles, departmental info from the FBI and state of California, and the Stop AAPI Hate codebook. Through an acoustic performance of the traditional Chinese plucked instrument, Pipa, of the piece \u5341\u9762\u57cb\u4f0f (Ambush from Ten Sides), this opening act is a blend of spoken word and instrumental music.\n\nFollowing \u201cOther Bodies\u201d is \u201cOther Minds,\u201d a piece that uses biofeedback based on Hao Huang\u2019s real-time responses to anti-Asian rhetoric from social media. Huang\u2019s heart rate will be monitored and processed through a custom modular synthesizer, giving the audience a glimpse into what Asian Americans feel witnessing this violence.\n\nThe final piece of this experience, \u201cOther Futures,\u201d is a musical reading of the I-Ching, which is an ancient Chinese text used to determine divine intent. The concluding segment was performed by Annie Zhou on the Guzheng and Yihan Chan on the Pipa, and Emma Gies performing a reading of the I-Ching. It thoughtfully explores what the future holds for Asian Americans.\n\nThe performance is not only a technical feat and artistic masterpiece, but also a reminder that Asian Americans are more than brutalized bodies to ogle at. While social media and traditional news outlets have moved on from Asian hate crimes, the brutality of racism remains a reality for Asian Americans.\n\n\u201cThere were a bunch of headlines about anti-Asian American violence for a while and now it\u2019s died down a bit. The cycle is gone,\u201d said Hao Huang. \u201cIt feels like the only good Asian is a dead Asian,\u201d said Micah Huang. \u201cTo these people, in a certain way, we are only truly seen when we are a mutilated, dead body. We\u2019re worth a lot more.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Dreams/Asian Nightmares\u201d pushes beyond the visual world of Instagram infographics and simple #StopAsianHate tweets into an auditory experience that the audience cannot ignore with a swipe of their finger. Moving forward, the Huangs and Gies will continue to explore sound art as a means to amplify the voices and experiences of Asian Americans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for people to shut their eyes to our lives, to our experiences,\u201d said Micah Huang. \u201cBut it\u2019s harder for them to shut their ears and that\u2019s where the hope comes in.\u201d\n\nAmerican Dreams/Asian Nightmares will be showing at the USC Pacific Asia Museum starting on Oct. 27.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)\n\nBy Baoqi \"Eileen\" Chen October 20, 2022 at 12:55 am PDT\n\nThe post-Olympics figure skating season unfolded in September 2022 with Challenger Series around the world, where Czech ice dance pairs Natalie Taschlerova and Filip Taschler danced to an experiential, first-of-its-kind climate change-themed free dance program at the Lombardia Trophy 2022 in Italy. The Czech duo skated to a rich selection of music about nature and environment remixed with climate change news and documentary voiceovers, making history with a program that actively communicated socio-environmental messages and sparked heated discussions on social media.\n\nThis marks another artistic innovation since the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics cycle, which allowed lyrics to be used in figure skating programs. \u201cWe were both surprised at first [and] shocked that this video was real,\u201d said Jacob Simon, a retired competitive figure skater. One of his skater friends shared the program clip with him, which has since garnered more than 1,200 interactions on Twitter as of October 18. \u201cI really like the fact that they are taking this brave step and skating to music that isn\u2019t intuitive or common,\u201d Simon said. He now works as a freelance environmental writer and content creator. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to draw attention to the climate crisis,\u201d he added.\n\nBuilding a contemporary nature medley: A musical critique\n\nTaschlerova/Taschler\u2019s program made a strong case for itself as an exquisite, novel piece, even considering the state-of-the-art precedents that have used themes of nature and voiceovers in the past few years. Some standouts include the breathtaking Pyeongchang gold medalist program \u201cLa Terre vue du ciel (The Earth from Above)\u201d by German pair skaters Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot, and the avant-garde \u201cspoken word poetry\u201d program by French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron during the 2019-2020 season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had this idea since junior year,\u201d Taschlerova and Taschler shared in a Youtube interview. The siblings made their senior debut in 2019. \u201cWe try to send some message to the public and to connect with the people a lot.\u201d Their program featured voiceover remixes from news outlets and documentaries by Conservation International, an American nonprofit environmental organization. The ice dancers borrowed three pieces from Conservation International\u2019s \u201cNature Is Speaking\u201d campaign, which personify different elements of nature and explain climate change from nature\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe music selection accompanying the voiceovers was a unique combination of celebrated contemporary works about nature and environment, including \u201cOn The Nature Of The Daylight\u201d by Max Richter, \u201cRun\u201d by Ludovico Einaudi, and \u201cEarly Morning Fog\u201d from the renowned documentary \u201cPlanet Earth II.\u201d An Ezio Bosso medley was also part of the program, including his pieces \u201cMusic for Weather Elements: V. Thunders and Lightnings\u201d and Concerto No. 1 for Violin, Strings and Timpani \u2018Esoconcerto\u2019.\u201d\n\nConstructing a compelling climate narrative: A detailed component and choreography breakdown\n\nThe duo\u2019s program started off with a broadcast news lead: \u201c2014 will go down as the warmest year around the globe in recorded history.\u201d Then the audience heard the fragile C-major scale piano notes of \u201cOn The Nature Of The Daylight,\u201d with the same feeling of hopelessness and despair it carried in the sci-fi movie \u201cArrival.\u201d Three more news voiceovers seamlessly followed: \u201c2015 was the hottest year since climate records began.\u201d \u201cFigures show this July was the single hottest month in recorded history.\u201d \u201cAustralia is sweltering through its hottest spring on record.\u201d\n\nThe start of the program was unusual, according to Simon, because it included human voices. But it was also one of the program\u2019s \u201chitting moments.\u201d \u201cYou hear it, then take a few seconds to register that they are skating to the type of music. That brings attention to the show,\u201d he said. The ice dancers accompanied the fade-out of voiceovers, transitioning from stand-still arms imitating waves choreography into skating movements.\n\nViolin melodies fused in, along with the calm, dire male voice elucidating the definition of climate change: \u201cClimate change has these consequences for our oceans, our weather, our food sources and our health.\u201d After that, in the short, powerful declaration\u2014 \u201dI am the ocean. I\u2019m water.\u201d \u2014the skaters performed a curve lift that danced to the rest of the voiceover: \u201cEvery stream, every cloud, and every raindrop, it all comes back to me.\u201d\n\nThe program built up to a climax when the peaceful tunes of \u201cEarly Morning Fog\u201d abruptly shifted to a violin allegro cascade of \u201cConcerto No. 1 for Violin, Strings and Timpani \u2018Esoconcerto\u2019.\u201d It was accompanied by a dramatic choreography, during which the skaters pushed the judges\u2019 panel in expressions of distraught and anger. As the skaters came to a stop on ice, they carried out dramatic choreographic push-up movements, while the background voiceover solemnly described the human impacts on glaciers through a warming climate.\n\n\u201cI am ice. I move slowly. I keep the world cool. Well, I used to.\u201d \u201c[This voiceover] particularly stood out to me, because obviously it\u2019s ice skating,\u201d said Juliana Drozd, a retired ice dancer and a geosciences PhD student at Penn State University. Following the narration, the program narrative gradually slowed down. \u201cMusic for Weather Elements: V. Thunders and Lightnings\u201d slid in while the dancers performed a series of twizzles, which involved rapid, continuous rotations on one foot at the same rhythm while skating forward or backward over the ice.\n\nThey ended the set with a spinning movement, and the free dance concluded with the sound of thunder and a voiceover that said, \u201cIf nature isn\u2019t kept healthy, humans won\u2019t survive.\u201d \u201cIt was a really strong program, especially for so early in the season,\u201d Drozd said. \u201cSkating wise, it was a very intense program, which I think is something we really need for the music choice.\u201d\n\nCommunicating PSA: the competitive stage isn\u2019t something new, but voice-overs are\n\nDespite heated debates on social media over the ice dance program being turned into a public service announcement, the phenomenon isn\u2019t new, according to Daniel Durbin, director of USC Annenberg Institute of Sports, Media and Society. Durbin said it has been an ongoing trend in many sports, exemplified through Muhammad Ali\u2019s anti-war messages in the 1960s and NFL\u2019s recent PSAs through uniform backs, helmets and zone statements.\n\nHowever, the skaters\u2019 extensive use of voiceovers did mark an unconventional attempt that became controversial. When figure skating first became a part of the Olympics in 1908, all music selections had to be classical and without lyrics, except for ice dance programs. It was not until the 1980s and 1990s that music selections branched out to lyric-free movie and theater soundtracks.\n\nSince the 2014 post-Olympics season, the International Skating Union has allowed lyrics in music as an attempt to engage a younger audience, which significantly diversified figure skating music genres and inspired the use of popular music. Team USA\u2019s Adam Rippon has skated to Coldplay\u2019s \u201cO,\u201d Madison Chock and Evan Bates have danced to \u201cFever\u201d by Elvis Presley, and last season, they danced to a Billie Eilish medley.\n\nEight years into the movement, the integration of lyrics still receives criticism for digression from the classic tradition. The use of pure human speaking, a bolder move, is still extremely rare and gets backlash on social media. The case of Taschlerova/Taschler is also more particular. Compared with Papadakis/Cizeron\u2019s use of poetry in their program that challenged the boundaries between music and texts, the Taschlerova/Taschler siblings\u2019 program synthesizes voiceovers to present an argument.\n\nCommenting on audience reactions that the program might start an undesired trend of politicizing the ice rink, Drodz said \u201cthe fact that the climate is changing is not something that\u2019s really debatable.\u201d She added that it would be unusual for programs to make a political stance. \u201cGoing to the judging system\u2014a lot of your judges are old people, who are probably not on the same stands as you politically,\u201d she said.\n\nDurbin described the situation as \u201ca question between rhetoric and art, [where] there\u2019s some rhetoric in all art, and some art in all rhetoric.\u201d \u201cThe concern that\u2019s being laid out is that rhetoric will overtake art, and it will diminish the aesthetic appeal of the figure skating,\u201d he added.\n\nProposing \u2018cool\u2019 solutions to a warming planet: climate change and sports\n\nOver the past decades, the average daytime temperature at the Winter Olympics host locations has increased from just above freezing at 32\u00b0F (0.4\u00b0C) in the early and mid 20th century to 46\u00b0F (7.8\u00b0C) during the 2000-2014 Games. As warming temperatures have increased the frequency of unreliable winter conditions in the 21 Olympics host locations, it is projected that if global emissions follow a similar trajectory of the last two decades, there would only be one reliable host city left by the end of the century.\n\nResearch has found that climate change can shrink skating seasons. Montreal and Toronto are likely to lose more than one-third of their current outdoor skating days, while in Beijing, a one degree rise in temperature could lead to a four day delay in skating-field opening dates and a five day decrease in the operation duration times.\n\nEven though figure skating is an indoor sport not directly impacted by climate change, maintaining an ice rink is carbon intensive. \u201cSkaters don\u2019t really have an ability to change the energy consumption of the sport as a whole,\u201d said Simon, mentioning that sustainability had been an emerging trend in sports, such as Formula E, the electric equivalent to Formula One. \u201cBut they do have the ability to talk about and bring attention to the overall theme,\u201d he added, \u201cmaking this decision to skate to a program that is not necessarily what people and judges are expecting to see.\u201d```"}

The movie features standout performances from Danielle Deadwyler (\u201cThe Harder They Fall\u201d), Jalyn Hall (\u201cAll American\u201d, \u201cAll Day And a Night\u201d), and Whoopi Goldberg (\u201cThe Color Purple\u201d, \u201cSister Act\u201d).\n\nAhead of the movie\u2019s nationwide release on October 28, the film is already being met with criticism.\n\nNow why are we getting a Emmett Till movie??? I\u2019m so tired of seeing the way black people have been tortured and terrorized turned into entertainment. \u2014 Irene (@theirenerenee) October 16, 2022\n\nwhy did they make another emmett till movie? IM OVER IT! every black movie has to be about trauma like let\u2019s move forward. \u2014 NIJAH (@NIJAHJIHAN) October 17, 2022\n\nAn Emmett Till movie...I didn\u2019t even like when Lovecraft Country touched on it. We do not need this. I feel like we all know how awful what happened to that poor boy and hope that lady burns in hell. Making media out of it just seems...a bit much. \u2014 alien superstar (@youdoingtoomuch) July 25, 2022\n\nI think I\u2019m going to have to pass on the Emmett Till movie, thanks \u2014 philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) July 25, 2022\n\nIn an interview with USA Today, Deadwyler met these criticisms head-on. \u201cDo you want to turn a blind eye to history in the way that certain people and systems and institutions want to turn a blind eye to our imprint on this country?\u201d \u201cIn the same way that people did not want to look at Emmett, you\u2019re saying it again by saying you don\u2019t want to see [the film],\u201d she continues. \u201cWith love, I ask you to be a witness.\u201d\n\nThis weekend, I went to an early showing of \u201cTill\u201d with my grandmother. It was important for me to see a narrative that allowed an impactful Black female activist to take center stage in a genre that favors Black male-led stories. Having grown up with Till as a core marker of my Black history education, I\u2019d felt appropriately prepared for what I was about to witness and, to Deadwyler\u2019s point, obligated to \u201cbe a witness.\u201d\n\nThe film starts with unassumingly bright imagery. Mamie (Deadwyler) and her son Emmett (Hall) sing to each other in the car as they complete a shopping trip ahead of Emmett\u2019s trip to Money, Mississippi in 1955. The sun shines down on the smiling duo, but there\u2019s an evident undercurrent of fear. The snare bangs a little too loud in the background. Emmett\u2019s smile is too bright. Mamie\u2019s eyes are too wide. Someone who didn\u2019t know what lay ahead could enjoy the scene for what it was: a nice outing on the town between mother and son. I knew better.\n\nThe movie maintains this atmosphere until it reaches its unnatural apex in the convenience store, where the fateful encounter between Emmett and Carolyn Bryant unfolds\u2014the same encounter that would lead to his death. The anxiety in the room is palpable when Emmett speaks his first flirty line to Carolyn, but the biggest crowd reaction follows the infamous wolf whistle that seals his fate. I feel my body cage in on itself. My grandmother, sitting to my right, sighs. A Black elder to the left shakes her head. We all knew what was coming.\n\nViewers are spared visuals of the lynching that follows, but the damage had already been done. I\u2019d sat in my shock and tears, only comforted in that Mamie and moviegoers alike cried with me upon seeing what had been left of the once kind and ebullient fourteen-year-old boy.\n\nThe movie itself is everything a Black history film should be: no gratuitous racial violence, no fictionalized benevolent white savior, and no dishonest happy ending to gratify the audience into dismissing the atrocities they\u2019ve witnessed. Deadwyler\u2019s portrayal is excellent: I smiled when Mamie smiled, I sobbed when Mamie sobbed, I raged when Mamie raged. Yet, I left the theater feeling as though I\u2019d been psychologically tortured for the full duration of the two-hour runtime.\n\nMy grandmother, who shared a similar distance from racialized violence as Mamie growing up, raved about the impact of Till-Mobley\u2019s work and couldn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t enjoy the movie. \u201cEmmett Till put a name to this injustice that countless nameless Black males had experienced for decades before him,\u201d she texted in our discussion long after we\u2019d gotten home. \u201cLike George Floyd, he made the nation acknowledge [the] evilness of racism.\u201d\n\nThat much had been clear, through both her words and her actions. When the distraught mother removes the sheet from her son\u2019s corpse and allows a photographer to document the damage that Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam had inflicted, Mamie firmly demonstrates to the world \u201cwhat white supremacy has done to my child.\u201d Her decision was audacious and impactful set against the landscape of the United States in 1955, where even Mamie concedes that she\u2019d been content to live her life in Chicago thinking that racial terrorism was a Southern problem that didn\u2019t and never would truly concern her.\n\nHowever, the numerous images of young Emmett Till\u2019s disfigured body blend into a horrific sequence of mangled Black bodies circulating the ever-growing feed of news and media in today\u2019s increasingly overexposed society. These sentiments aren\u2019t just felt among Twitter users; Yahoo and Time Magazine recently shared articles reflecting a community-wide exasperation with the continued push for Black pain and suffering in popular media.\n\nUltimately, we as a generation are far too familiar with seeing society let the harm and suffering of Black people go unpunished in real life\u2014we don\u2019t need it redone in 4K. Despite the ongoing discourse, \u201cTill\u201d has been in talks to receive Oscar nods and, given the Academy\u2019s proclivity for recognizing Black history films depicting trauma, it is a strong contender.\n\nThe story of Mamie Till-Mobley is one worth being a witness to\u2014if you can take it.\n```"}

To her, the fruit holds special meaning. \u201cThe avocado symbolizes the lightness with the dark,\u201d Gray says.\n\nOn September 17th Danielle Gray, a personal trainer and fitness model in L.A., returned to her alma mater\u2014The University of Southern California\u2014to teach a fitness event for the Girl Gains USC club. Girl Gains is a USC female weightlifting and empowerment club designed to get girls lifting and supporting each other. Their event with Danielle was a 45-minute gymnast training focused class. They ran in a circle on all fours doing bear crawls, partnered up to do squats while holding their partners legs in a plank position, and plank up and downs with a clap in the middle.\n\n\u201cI want working out to be playful and fun,\u201d Danielle said. Danielle definitely achieved that at the event. Girl Gains members were smiling and laughing at the new positions they were being put in, while bonding with their partners.\n\nGymnastic training is not new to Danielle. She has been a gymnast since she was four years old, and has always kept her athlete mentality with her. However, she eventually stopped gymnastics and pursued a career in marketing. When she graduated in 2014 and began her first job she recalls feeling like she wasn\u2019t doing enough, and that there was more out there for her.\n\nDanielle decided to reconnect with lifelong passion\u2014gymnastics. So she decided to become a personal trainer and naturally incorporated her gymnastic background into sessions with her clients. This included a holistic training program with strength, balance and stretching. She decided to take the success of her training style and create a 28-day online challenge to help people outside of her in-person clientele get stronger and healthier. She now has an app with workouts and Train Like a Gymnast retreats.\n\nHer upcoming retreat to Bali will include all the elements of Train Like a Gymnast fitness, while also incorporating mindset work, journaling and personal development. She explained that getting healthier \u201cstems from your mental health. It doesn\u2019t have to just be physical training.\u201d\n\nMental health is a subject close to Danielle, as she has been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and was open about being suicidal. Her work now lies outside of just helping people achieve their fitness goals. She tries to foster a safe space for her clients to talk about their mental health, because when she was suffering she wished for a space like this.\n\n\u201cPeople would try to \u2018fix it\u2019. I didn\u2019t want to \u2018fix them.\u2019 I knew what my problems were, but I just wanted someone to listen,\u201d Danielle said. Danielle believes we need to open up platforms for people to share thoughts through emotion management and truly understanding what we are feeling, while normalizing these feelings.\n\nIn addition to her work with her clients, Danielle uses her social media presence to advocate for mental health. While she uses trendy TikTok sounds to discuss not having normal serotonin levels, she also provides serious descriptions of her struggle with anxiety and depression.\n\nDanielle hopes to continue incorporating the mental and physical into her training and social media to pioneer a space for both mental and physical wellness. \u201cHold your darkness and your light.

The focus narrows on the band\u2019s two guitarists and originators, Shery Bechara and Lilas Mayassi, who are struggling to maintain their friendship and composure after once being romantically connected. Mayassi battles with her sexuality and Bechara fights with the rest of the band. Meanwhile, all the Sirens face demonizing stereotypes as five women who prefer death metal over pop music in a country known for heavily stigmatizing \u2014 and at times, banning \u2014 the former genre as \u201cdevil-worship music.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime a woman wants to be anything other than what society wants, it\u2019s always an issue,\u201d Mayassi says in the film.\n\nBaghdadi and Lady & Bird Films, an all female run production company responsible for producing \u201cSirens,\u201d admitted to using the narrative to directly challenge some of the stereotypes metalheads, women, LGBTQ+ people and the Arab community face in the media. The film has won various awards such as the 2022 Grand Jury Award for Outstanding Documentary Feature at Outfest, the LGBTQ+ film festival in Los Angeles.\n\nFollowing the L.A. screening, XTR Studios head of film Katheryn Everett facilitated a Q&A between Baghdadi, Lady & Bird Films co-founder Camilla Hall, \u201cSirens\u201d editor Grace Zahrah and Slave to Sirens members Mayassi and Alma Doumani \u2014 the band\u2019s bassist.

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo)\n\nBy Jose Romo October 17, 2022 at 11:39 am PDT\n\nThe cloudy sky seemed odd for a Saturday afternoon in Carson, California, but still, it proved to be the perfect weather for a beautiful game of soccer. It is postseason time for Major League Soccer and Dignity Health Sports Park, home of the LA Galaxy, welcomed Nashville SC for a ticket into the next round of the MLS Audi Cup race.\n\nIn the first half the Spanish Midfielder, Riqui Puig, took charge on the pitch, leading the strings of play. Through him, a number of opportunities came for Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Douglas Costa, the two starting attackers for the team led by Greg Vanney. However, not much action was taken on either side to influence the momentary result of the match.\n\nThe fans did not let their guard down as they eagerly waited for the goal to arrive through a symphony of chants and cheers. It was until the fifth minute of the second half that Chicharito opened up the scoreboard with a wonderful right-legged shot making it past Nashville keeper, Joe Willis. However, after a trip to the monitor, VAR advised referee Armando Villareal to recall the goal for a previous foul on the play.\n\nThe foul that was attributed to defender Juli\u00e1n Araujo occurred three minutes prior to the goal. And since the foul had initiated the scoring run, Chicharito\u2019s attempt was called back. It would later be Araujo, who in the 60th minute, would arrive with a header to put the ball in the back of the net. With this, Araujo scored his first playoff goal in his career and placed the LA Galaxy on their way to victory.\n\nThe last time the Los Angeles Galaxy won an MLS Cup title was in 2014 when manager Bruce Arena led the \u201cgal\u00e1cticos\u201d to the podium. With 61 points in the season and a total of 69 goals, the Angelenos placed their fifth star on their crest. Back then, their leading striker was legendary Irish soccer star, Robbie Keane, who ended the regular season as the third striker with the most goals (19).\n\nToday that leadership role lands on the shoulders of Javier \u201cEl Chicharito\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez who currently holds a total of 18 goals and two assists this season and stands in the race for most valuable player.\n\nThe next task for LA Galaxy is to visit the current Supporter\u2019s Shield winner, LAFC, who just so happens to be their archnemesis. This edition of \u201cEl Tr\u00e1fico\u201d will take place this Thursday, October 20th at 7 p.m. and will grant one ticket into the western conference semifinal.\n```"}

California\u2019s earlier victory came in the form of an 11-10 contest in the MSPF Tournament.\n\nThree-time Newcomer of the Week Award-winner graduate driver Massimo Di Martire scored three goals, swiped three balls and recorded one assist. Di Martire leads USC and the MPSF with 42 goals this season. Junior driver Carson Kranz and redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen also scored twice.\n\nJunior goalie Adrian Weinberg and the Bears\u2019 defense successfully pinned down redshirt 2-meter Jake Erhardt and senior driver Marcus Longton, two of the Trojans\u2019 top scorers. Erhardt went 0-4, and Longton scored just once in eight attempts.\n\nThe Bears opened the match with a 3-0 run before Di Martire scored the first goal for USC at the 1:20 mark in the first. \u201cThe early deficit really put us into a bind,\u201d head coach Mike Pintaric said.\n\nCal led USC 5-1 before the Trojans cut into the deficit with consecutive strikes from Di Martire and Kranz. At the end of the half, the score was 6-4 in favor of the Bears.\n\nIn the third, the Bears scored back-to-back goals. Molthen answered by receiving a pass from sophomore two-meter Luka Brnetic and firing a shot past Weinberg. Kranz followed up with a power-play goal to make the score 8-6.\n\nThe fourth quarter saw Erhardt receive a third exclusion early on, eliminating him for the rest of the match. Sophomore attacker Roberto Valera notched his third smash of the game, giving Cal a 10-6 lead.\n\nThe momentum quickly shifted after a key block by freshman utility Andrej Grgurevic allowed Longton to score his first goal before two-meter junior Max Miller earned an exclusion. Miller passed to Di Martire, who flushed his third smash of the game.\n\nThe Trojan bench erupted when Brnetic capitalized on a missed shot by Cal and recorded his first goal of the game, bringing the tally to 11-10 in favor of the Bears.\n\nCal called a timeout to restore order, and they proceeded to bypass the Trojan\u2019s defense. On a penalty shot, sophomore attacker Max Casabella rifled the ball past graduate goalie Kyle McKenny. Grgurevic tried to counter, but the Bears blocked the Australian\u2019s shot, allowing senior utility Marko Valecic to extend the Bears\u2019 lead to three.\n\nAfter Longton missed the Bears\u2019 goal for his eighth attempt of the game, Casabella struck again, heaving a long toss to score on an empty goal. The 3-0 run gave the game a final score of 14-10.\n\nTwo of the three goals came from sophomore attacker Max Casabella, who led all scorers with four strikes. \u201cWe kept the game close,\u201d Pintaric said, \u201cBut we faltered again on defense.

(Photo courtesy of Documenta)\n\nBy Viktoria Capek October 16, 2022 at 8:44 pm PDT\n\nMadu Udeh turned on the oven, then the stove, then the music. Beyonce\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d played as heat filled the apartment\u2019s small kitchen \u2014 a dance to prepare a skillet of nachos. \u201cCan you fry?\u201d they asked me as though we hadn\u2019t just met 15 minutes prior. I\u2019d never been asked to help an interviewee cook dinner, but I obliged and cut a stack of tortillas in four. At the time, I didn\u2019t know this simple interaction \u2014 cooking and talking \u2014 was a revolutionary experience that Udeh spent weeks embracing in \u201cGood Kitchen\u201d at Documenta, an experimental art exhibition in Kassel, Germany that takes place every five years.\n\nIt had only been a week since Udeh had returned to the states. The 22-year-old USC film major, who prefers to be called \u201cMagic,\u201d fell into visiting Documenta after a professor offered to pay for a ticket to the exhibition. It was Magic\u2019s first time learning about the longstanding event that namely contemporary artists, critics and art historians interact with.\n\nDocumenta started in 1955 as a way to bring Germany out of the cultural darkness of Nazism by showcasing art and artists from around the world. The 15th installment, which ended its 100-day run in September, fell two years behind because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMagic compared the Documenta experience to fermenting bread, where dough \u2014 in this case artists and their work \u2014 could mold and grow in a confined space and time. But as an outsider and one of only two Americans Magic knew of at the event, they found their first few weeks at Documenta more overwhelming than accommodating.\n\n\u201cThere was this whole town just filled with exhibits,\u201d they said. \u201cIt was too much art.\u201d\n\nMagic shared their indifference to art such as \u201cBorrowed Faces,\u201d a graphic photo novel of stories from the Cold War by the Berlin collective Fehras Publishing Practices, that was hung in galleries. But visual art such as paintings and photography were only a small sector of the work produced by the hundreds of international artists invited to participate at Documenta.\n\nMagic\u2019s breakthrough finally happened when they discovered the experimental exhibit \u201cook_,\u201d a collective and creative space organized by Netherlands artist Reinaart Vanhoe. According to Vanhoe, \u201cook_\u201d refers to a vision of free space inhabited by neighbors and friends. It\u2019s also a way to collaborate with other people.\n\nArtists called it \u201cGood Kitchen,\u201d Magic said, a colloquial name for the space where people cooked for each other, listened to music and held conversations, much like what Magic and I were doing in L.A.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea that you can create a space for people to chill, and curating that space, is an art form,\u201d Magic said. \u201cIt was really radical to me.\u201d\n\nVisitors dance at a Lumbung-themed Documenta exhibit. (Photo courtesy of Documenta, Martha Fridel)\n\nMagic knew they\u2019d bring this experience back to California immediately after cooking their first \u201cGood Kitchen\u201d meal \u2014 a savory coconut curry and potato dish. It was the first time they thought of art as something more than what lives on walls or movie screens, but also what lives in people, experiences and communities \u2014 an idea represented by Documenta 15\u2032s theme of \u201cLumbung,\u201d the Indonesian word for a communal rice barn.\n\nNot every Documenta guest, however, experienced the sort of community encounter Magic described. This year\u2019s exhibition \u2014 under the artistic direction of the Indonesian art collective ruangrupa \u2014 was criticized for alleged displays of antisemitism. Early visitors encountered a 60-foot painted banner, an art piece titled \u201cPeople\u2019s Justice.\u201d One of the figures on the banner had a soldier\u2019s body with a pig\u2019s face, wearing the Star of David on a neckerchief and a helmet bearing the word \u201cMossad,\u201d the name of Israel\u2019s security service. A later incident called attention to the event\u2019s over-censorship of Palestinian films. All the while, Israeli artists lacked visual representation at Documenta 15, which sent Jewish organizations into an uproar.\n\nBarely a month into the exhibition, Documenta\u2019s director general Sabine Schormann resigned amid the scandal. Ruangrupa responded to the allegations of the acts of antisemitism being intentional with an open letter addressing the controversy.\n\nDespite knowing of the allegations, Magic said artists and guests at Documenta rarely talked about the controversy. The dispute appeared to impact mainly Documenta leaders more than day-to-day visitors and exhibits.\n\nAfter dinner, Magic and I continued our conversation over glasses of wine in their driveway \u2014 pinot grigio out of mason jars, a very twenty-something experience while reflecting on their five weeks spent in Kassel.\n\n\u201cEven though people from here didn\u2019t go all the way to Germany to experience the idea of collective living, doesn\u2019t mean the idea doesn\u2019t exist here,\u201d said Magic, dragging on the intention like they did their cigarette.\n\nThis may be the only Documenta experience Magic said they\u2019ll have, but it\u2019s inspired them to look for spaces like \u201cGood Kitchen\u201d to share with L.A.\n\nArtist or not, Magic believes every person can benefit by sharing time, space and conversation with their community; even in the smallest ways, such as cooking dinner with a new friend.\n\n\u201c\u2018Lumbung\u2019 is an Indonesian word,\u201d Magic said. \u201cCollective living is not.\u201d\n```"}

USC alum Tina Graudina made it to the finals of the Elite 16 tournament in Paris. (Photo by Jason Goode) \n\nBy Chris Nigro October 14, 2022 at 11:04 pm PDT \n\nWith the Phoenix Championships in the past, the AVP season is essentially over. There are two more tournaments left \u2014 one from November 12 to 13 and the other from December 2 to 4. But international volleyball is a different beast. Tournaments of all different levels continue to rage on until January. There was a International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) Elite 16 tournament in Paris that took place a few weeks back from September 27 to October 2. This was an exciting tournament with the best teams from all over the world. On the men\u2019s side, no American teams qualified for the tournament. Trojan alum Andy Benesh played with Miles Evans but lost in qualifying to Australians Mark Nicolaidis and Izac Carracher. Even without any Americans in the main draw, there was no lack of exciting play. Norwegians Anders Mol and Christian S\u00f8rum came out victorious. With that win in Paris, they reclaimed the No. 1 overall ranking on the international stage after over a year.\n\nThe women\u2019s side was a little more exciting for American and Trojan fans. Trojan alum Tina Graudina had an incredible performance throughout the tournament. Graudina and her partner Anastasija Samoilova battled their way into the finals before falling to the Dutch team of Ra\u00efsa Schoon and Katja Stam. The Latvians have much to be proud of as they beat the top-seeded Brazilians Eduarda Santos Lisboa and Ana Patr\u00edcia Ramos for the first time. Graudina and Samoilova were 0-5 against the Brazilians up to that point but finally defeated them in the semifinals of Paris.\n\nBesides Graudina, there were three more former USC players and one current USC player at Paris. The current player is Megan Kraft who is a junior right now, but that isn\u2019t stopping her from competing at the highest level internationally. Kraft was partnered with veteran Emily Stockman. The two had a solid showing, but, unfortunately, they didn\u2019t make it out of the pool because they had a worse point differential than the top two teams. Another former Trojan, Terese Cannon, was in the same pool but she and her partner Sarah Sponcil didn\u2019t win a match and thus didn\u2019t make it out of pool play either. The remaining two Trojans were also in the same pool but on different teams. One of the two, Sophie Bukovec, represented Canada alongside partner Brandie Wilkerson. They didn\u2019t have much success either as they won one game and didn\u2019t make it out of pool play. But the last former Trojan, Kelly Cheng, went 3-0 in pool play with her partner Betsi Flint. Their quarterfinal matchup came against the No. 2-seed and No. 1 team in the world of Carolina Salgado and B\u00e1rbara Seixas. The Americans squeaked out a three-set win before they went down in the semifinals to the eventual champions of Schoon and Stam.\n\nFormer Trojans placed second, fourth, ninth and 13th at Paris. All in all, it was a very impressive showing for former Trojans and it looks like the results will only improve from here. There are also still plenty of USC alumni that are less established at the moment but looking for a breakthrough. The Maldives qualifier is another FIVB tournament, but it\u2019s a challenger rather than an Elite 16 event. It is happening right now and will conclude on October 16th. Former Trojan Julia Scoles is partnered with UCLA alum Zara Muno, and another USC alum, Hailey Harward, is partnered with current Stanford player Xolani Hodel. There are also a total of 16 women\u2019s players representing the U.S. in the Maldives. The future for American beach volleyball looks bright with a few Trojan alumni leading the way.\n\nThe play of the \u201cweek\u201d comes from pool play in the Paris Championships.

(Photo by Tomoki Chien)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi\nOctober 14, 2022 at 10:30 am PDT\n\nAfter defeating the Washington State Cougars 30-14 last week, the No. 7 USC Trojans are set to face their toughest opponent yet: the No. 20 Utah Utes. The Trojans come into this game 6-0, their best start since 2006. This matchup pits two of the Pac-12\u2032s best quarterbacks against each other with USC sophomore Caleb Williams facing Utah junior Cameron Rising. Both quarterbacks are able to create magic inside and outside of the pocket, so the game is sure to be end-to-end entertainment.\n\nDespite falling 42-32 in its last game to UCLA, this Utah team is formidable, as the Utes were ranked No. 7 in the preseason AP poll. The Trojans will have their work cut out for them at Rice-Eccles Stadium, as the Utah fanbase regularly fills up the stadium and the team has chosen to make this game a blackout.\n\nIn a press conference after Tuesday\u2019s practice, Riley was asked about his mindset entering the hostile environment. \u201c[Rice-Eccles] is a fun atmosphere,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe need to operate a little more cleanly and we think we\u2019ll be ready to do that. An important part of the game is preparing to play great road football.\u201d\n\nUtah is the antithesis to USC; the Utes are led by head coach Kyle Whittingham who has led the team since 2005 and the team returned 17 starters and nine all-conference players this season. In contrast, USC only had five offensive starters and three defensive starters return this year along with a new coaching staff nearly across the board.\n\nSince the season started, the defense has been looked at as the team\u2019s anchor. The defense ranks No. 1 in the Pac-12 in points allowed and leads the country in both sacks and interceptions. To defeat the Utes, the Trojans will look to junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu to carry over momentum from his three-sack performance against Washington State.\n\nUSC will look to rely on its offense as well, a unit that has slowed down from its once blistering pace to start the year. USC is currently No. 18 in the country in yards per play at 6.84, almost a full yard less than where they were after the Fresno State game. Last week, redshirt senior running back Travis Dye nearly had 150 rushing yards and another stellar performance from him could see the Trojans control the game from the very start.\n\nWilliams also takes accountability for some of the offense\u2019s struggles in recent weeks and hopes to show everything he is capable of come Saturday. \u201cI\u2019ve played all right,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI feel like I can play a lot better. I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019ve unlocked everything that I can do and I\u2019m trying to get to that point. This team needs my best for this last stretch of the season, since we\u2019re in the second half of it.\u201d\n\nRiley is both excited for the future, yet recognizes the team as a whole needs to improve. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a challenging second half of the season, but this is when it gets most fun,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe gotta get better. The target moves. What\u2019s good enough Week 1 isn\u2019t good enough Week 3, isn\u2019t good enough Week 7, isn\u2019t good enough Week 9. With other teams that you play, you\u2019ve gotta expect their best and expect that they\u2019re gonna get better.\u201d\n\nThis game is shaping up to be a hard-fought battle between two teams that will contend for the Pac-12 title this year. Whoever comes out on top will be in a much better position to play in the Pac-12 Championship in Las Vegas. The Trojans will face the Utes on Saturday at 5 p.m. PST in Salt Lake City. The Utes are currently favored by 3.5 points.\n```"}

British musician Rex Orange County is the latest offender to prompt the question: can we ever truly separate the art from the artist? In short, not really.\n\nI was completely taken aback by the news from The Sun that Rex Orange County, also known as Alexander O\u2019Connor, was charged this week with six counts of sexual assault after a woman accused him of attacking her six separate times. As an avid listener of his music and a close follower of his career, I had gotten the impression that he was one of the good ones \u2013 a member of the increasingly rare rag-tag team of men in entertainment who were not objectively bad people. While O\u2019Connor pleaded not guilty in court on Monday, according to reports from The Sun, I almost don\u2019t care what the outcome of his January trial is: Rex Orange County will be forever tainted in my mind.\n\nThe 24-year-old musician, who\u2019s most known for his 2017 song touting his status as your \u201cBest Friend,\u201d is a Gen Z phenomenon. The Los Angeles Times dubbed him his generation\u2019s \u201cfavorite crooner\u201d and a \u201cheart-on-his-sleeve balladeer.\u201d His songs are relatable \u2013 they cover the growing pains of early adulthood and, of course, love. In one of his most memorable lyrics, he says \u201cI\u2019ll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses / And truly loves you long after our curtain closes.\u201d And his voice is almost as charming as his lyrics. He is undeniably lovable.\n\nThis boy-next-door persona is precisely why fans feel so betrayed and confused by these allegations of sexual assault against him. Because we have a window into entertainers\u2019 lives through social media, we feel like we know them as people, not just as artists. And since we feel like we know them personally, we hold them accountable for actions outside of their art. When they mess up, it hurts.\n\nRex Orange County\u2019s social media pages are inviting \u2013 they feature the bright-colored and animated artwork for his music, candid photos of him and messages of gratitude to his fans. So when O\u2019Connor is facing allegations of wrongdoings, the fans are personally hurt and disappointed. One fan, Kayla Ellis, who has his lyrics tattooed on her forearm, recently told Buzzfeed News that she cried when she heard the news because she knew \u201cnothing was gonna be the same after hearing this.\u201d every bit of darkness that his music helped me through feels untethered now. like his music was the silver lining to all those dark times. i was never alone bc i had his music. idk how else to explain it, i\u2019m just beyond hurt rn\n\nEllis is not alone in her disappointment. Social media exploded after Monday\u2019s news with fans sharing sentiments on Twitter like \u201cRex Orange County was literally the soundtrack to my life...I feel ill,\u201d and memes about their sadness and anger. What can you do when this newly problematic artist\u2019s music is such a significant part of your life? Do you take down your posters and stickers? Do you remove any trace of them from your playlists? Can their songs no longer be your favorites? It can be incredibly difficult for fans to let go of artists and their catalogs when situations like this arise. It feels like they\u2019re losing a friend, not just a favorite artist. It\u2019s like a breakup.\n\nMusic has always been littered with problematic people whose behavior we previously overlooked. Everyone knew John Lennon had a darker side, including allegations of physical abuse against his partners, but they ignored it. Now we don\u2019t ignore concerning behavior like this anymore \u2013 we can\u2019t stomach it. The calls to \u201ccancel\u201d artists like R. Kelly or Morrissey because of their past misdeeds or controversial statements is a part of a more recent movement. It\u2019s controversial, but the decision to stop supporting artists like this will only grow in popularity as we continue to reckon with the disturbing behavior of our heroes.\n\nI don\u2019t know how we reconcile our conflicting feelings, but I do know that listening to Rex Orange County no longer feels the same for me. Songs like \u201cPluto Projector\u201d and \u201cSunflower\u201d hold special places in my relationship, and I have many happy memories of long car rides and refrigerator-lit dancing scored by these songs. I\u2019ve replayed them hundreds of times to relive those moments. But now when I listen, something is off. I find it incredibly difficult to remove Rex Orange County\u2019s music from his public persona and these allegations against the artist. And it\u2019s not just him \u2013 I can\u2019t, in good conscience or with a level of comfort, listen to Kanye West (or keep up with his recent antics) anymore either. We\u2019re moving into a space where art will become intrinsically tied to the artist because of their digital presence and online persona. Art is already a deeply personal creation, and if these allegations are true, I don\u2019t want to support Alex O\u2019Connor or put any more money in his pockets than I already have. I guess my playlists were already in need of some updates.\n```"}

The 2019 Tony Award-winning revival dares to bring \u201cprovocative, gritty and sexy 21st century commentary\u201d to the 1943 Rodgers & Hammerstein classic.\n\nUpon entering the Ahmanson Theatre, you might expect to see the budding romance between a charming cowboy Curly McLain (Sean Grandillo) and a stereotypical ingenue Laurey Williams (Sasha Hutchings), culminating in a triumphant reprise of the tune we\u2019ve all come to know: \u201cOklahoma!\u201d Its original 1943 Broadway production, which debuted in the midst of World War II, reflected the ideals of a \u201cmore homogenous American society,\u201d according to the program\u2019s show note.\n\nThe new adaptation features a diverse cast of characters, including varying races, ages, gender identities and abilities, to better reflect America today. Notably, Ali Stroker, who played Ado Annie in the 2019 Broadway cast of the show, received a Tony Award for her performance, making her the first wheelchair user to be given this honor.\n\nThough all elements of the score and text remain the same, this revival drastically differed from the original production and previous revivals. In its attempt to make commentary on prominent issues of modern America, including gun violence, mental health and gender, it lost some of the play\u2019s original specificity.\n\nAs the house lights remained up, a fresh-faced Curly sang an acoustic version of the opening number \u201cOh What a Beautiful Morning,\u201d bringing a lovable, rockstar energy to the number. A seven-piece bluegrass band accompanied Grandillo and the rest of the cast, giving the Golden Age score a fresh, country twist.\n\nThe genre suited the setting of the show as characters lounged in wooden chairs and sported modern trucker hats, flannels and blue jeans. A cappella sections of songs like \u201cThe Surrey with the Fringe on Top\u201d emphasized the brewing romance between Curly and Laurey.\n\nWhile the bluegrass style fit this modern adaptation, the blaring electric guitar used throughout the show was jarring, and even caused the senior audience members at the Sunday matinee performance to cover their ears.\n\nAnother notable change was the adaptation of the dream ballet sequence. In the 1943 production, choreographed by Agnes de Mille, the groundbreaking 12-minute dance sequence was the first of its kind. Her choreography pushed the emotional lives of the characters forward through movement alone.\n\nRather than a company of dancers doubling as the leads, the new modern dance sequence, choreographed by John Heginbotham, featured a single dancer (Jordan Wynn), donned in an oversized, sequined \u201cDream Baby Dream\u201d T-shirt. Her piece, accompanied by the electric guitar, did not convey Laurey\u2019s turmoil of choosing between her potential suitors \u2013 the charming Curly and the lonely farmhand Jud Fry (Christopher Bannow).\n\nUnlike de Mille\u2019s choreography, Heginbotham\u2019s lacked clarity in how it was meant to propel the plot forward. While the dancer seemed to represent Laurey, her haphazard frolicking about the stage did not seem grounded in the conflicts within the play.\n\nThe repetitive choreography did not succeed in advancing the storyline or reflecting the heroine\u2019s inner struggles. The disconnect was intensified with the abrupt transition into the lively ensemble number \u201cThe Farmer and the Cowman.\u201d\n\nDuring the modern dance sequence, a live night vision camera projected a close-up of Wynn onto the backdrop, allowing audiences to see the details of her face, a luxury not normally granted in theater houses. This shaky projection sequence did provide insight into the dancer\u2019s expressions, but it still felt disconnected from the story at large.\n\nThe production also implemented these night vision projections in scenes between sinister boy-next-door Jud and leading man Curly. These intimate scenes, which discussed suicidal thoughts and pornography, first occurred in complete darkness. Bannow\u2019s creaky one-word answers sent a chill throughout the audience.\n\nThe scene, intensified by the presence of a gunshot, foreshadowed the play\u2019s bloody ending. The projections that flashed across the screen during \u201cPore Jud Is Daid,\u201d gave audiences permission to peer into Jud\u2019s eyes and truly see his emotions for the first time. Bannow\u2019s expressive eyes in the extreme close-up almost made me pity him.\n\nAnother notable change in the revival was Jud Fry\u2019s death sequence. As seen in the film adaptation and the 1943 production, a knife fight, solicited by Jud, ensues between him and Curly, moments after the cheery wedding ceremony. Curly kills Jud in self-defense.\n\nFish\u2019s revival spins the death sequence to reflect more modern modes of violence. Jud gifts the newlyweds a handgun at their ceremony. Without much prompting, Curly fires and kills Jud, leaving the bride and groom bloodstained and clearly guilty.\n\nAs the bluegrass band played a solemn, dirge-like \u201cOklahoma\u201d the characters and audience alike seemed perplexed and left craving more. Possibly per Fish\u2019s intention, the murder sequence left me with questions of what really is self-defense in our current political climate.\n\nHope was restored throughout the play, however, in Fish\u2019s interpretation of the female characters. Hutchings\u2019 Laurey was strong and had agency over the choices between the men in her life. She did not fall victim to the men\u2019s attempts to woo her, rather she stood her ground and made decisions on her own accord.\n\nThis strength and feminist approach to Laurey\u2019s character struck a chord with me opposed to the original adaptation. A personal favorite female empowerment moment was \u201cMany a New Day.\u201d The typical, sweet soprano uptempo was accompanied by all the women of the cast ripping corn shucks in half as they lamented about the frustrating men in their lives.\n\nUnderstudy Gwynne Wood gave a standout performance as Ado Annie, an innocent yet inherently provocative young woman. Her powerhouse, rock rendition of \u201cI Cain\u2019t Say No,\u201d packed with a corded mic and vocal riffs, left audiences cheering.\n\n\u201cOklahoma!\u201d will run at the Ahmanson Theatre through October 16. More information can be found on Center Theatre Group\u2019s website.\n```"}

(Photo by Tomoki Chien)\n\nBy Jacob Hare October 13, 2022 at 5:00 pm PDT\n\nWeek 6 was one of the most exhilarating and unforgettable weeks in college football this season. With prominent upsets, eye-opening performances and a plethora of close games, it\u2019s challenging to keep up with everything going on in college football. But don\u2019t worry, I have you covered with my Week 6 recap of Pac-12 results.\n\nUSC (6-0, Week 6 Result: 30-14 win vs. Washington State)\nUSC had an impressive outing in a 30-14 win over a very talented Washington State team. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams and the offense have been the main reason USC is unbeaten. This week, however, the defense stepped up and lifted USC over WSU. Junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu was sensational, as he had three sacks and four tackles for a loss. USC now prepares to take on a Utah team that is coming off a loss to UCLA and should come out very motivated to avoid dropping to 4-3.\n\nUtah (4-2, Week 6 Result: 42-32 loss vs. UCLA)\nIf you look at the box score, you might walk away stumped at how Utah lost 42-32 in a game where they had more first downs, committed six fewer penalties and trumped UCLA in time of possession. However, redshirt senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson made these stats irrelevant as he was able to walk all over Utah\u2019s highly touted defense. He completed 78% of his passes and had five total touchdowns on the day. This is a gut-wrenching loss for a team many believed could make a College Football Playoff appearance. Now with two losses, it looks like the Utes will be fighting for a chance to play in a decent bowl game.\n\nOregon (5-1, Week 6 Result: 49-22 win vs. Arizona)\nOregon has now won five consecutive games as the Ducks dominated Arizona in a 49-22 win. Transfer senior quarterback Bo Nix was fantastic, as he had three rushing touchdowns and a 96.3 QBR \u2013 his highest QBR of the season. The Ducks ran for 306 yards and had seven rushing touchdowns. Oregon will face UCLA after a bye week at a time when the Ducks look like one of the best offenses in the country. It will be interesting to see if the bye week destroys their momentum.\n\nOregon State (4-2, Week 6 Result: 28-27 win vs. Stanford)\nAfter two straight losses, Oregon State got back on track with a 28-27 win on the road against Stanford. Backup redshirt freshman quarterback Ben Gulbranson filled in nicely for injured redshirt junior quarterback Chance Nolan. Gulbranson was a game manager and finally got the offense off the ground late in the game after three miserable quarters. Oregon State now faces Washington State in a crucial matchup.\n\nStanford (1-4, Week 6 Result: 28-27 loss vs. Oregon State)\nThis was a heartbreaking loss for a team that hasn\u2019t beaten an FBS opponent since October of last year. Despite having junior quarterback Tanner McKee, an NFL-caliber talent, Stanford has not found its identity on offense. This is a lost season for a team that now drops to 1-4.\n\nWashington (4-2, Week 6 Result: 45-38 loss vs. Arizona State)\nIn the most surprising outcome of the weekend, Washington was upset by Arizona State. When junior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. throws over 41 passes, the Huskies are 0-2, compared to when he throws under that number, they are 4-0. Unfortunately for Washington, Penix threw 53 passes on the day. I don\u2019t understand why the Huskies abandoned their successful game plan earlier in the season. The Huskies have a get-right game next week as they face a weak Arizona defense.\n\nColorado (0-5, Week 6 Result: Bye Week)\nGood news, Colorado fans, your team didn\u2019t lose this week.\n\nArizona (3-3, Week 6 Result: 49-22 loss vs. Arizona)\nThe most telling stat in Arizona\u2019s 49-22 embarrassing loss was the zero sacks and quarterback hurries that the Wildcats had. They also allowed 306 rushing yards. Arizona has been decent on the offensive side, but its defense has put limitations on the team. I don\u2019t see the Wildcats winning many more games with a difficult schedule in the future.\n\nArizona State (2-4, Week 6 Result: 45-38 win vs. Washington)\nSometimes in sports, you just need a bit of magic to win a game. Former walk-on and fifth-string quarterback, redshirt junior Trenton Bourguet, had the best feel-good story of the week. Thrown into action when redshirt junior quarterback Emory Jones got injured, Bourguet led ASU to a significant upset over Washington. Bourguet had three touchdowns and a 93.9 QBR. Maybe Bourguet is the spark ASU needed in what seemed like a season to forget.\n\nUCLA (6-0, Week 6 Result: 42-32 win vs. Utah)\nNot only did UCLA prove itself to be a serious Pac-12 contender this weekend, but the Bruins also catapulted themselves into the College Football Playoff conversation. Not only that, but Thompson-Robinson also put his name in the Heisman race with a brilliant performance. UCLA will now take on its third ranked opponent in three games as the Bruins face red-hot Oregon next week.\n\nCal (3-2, Week 6 Result: Bye Week)\n\nWashington State (4-2, Week 6 Result: 30-14 loss vs. USC)\nWashington State couldn\u2019t find any offensive rhythm in a 30-14 loss to USC. The Cougars\u2019 offensive line was abysmal in the contest, which didn\u2019t give sophomore quarterback Cameron Ward any time to throw. No one expected them to beat USC on the road, but fans didn\u2019t expect to see their high-powered offense collapse. Washington State has a tough matchup coming up as the Cougs prepare to face Oregon State on the road this week.\n```"}

The game figures to be the Trojans\u2019 toughest test yet, as Utah was picked by many during the preseason to win the Pac-12. The Utes also boast one of the best home field advantages in the Pac-12, which USC is trying to prepare for by putting its speakers on full volume during this week\u2019s practices. In short, a win this Saturday will take a team effort.\n\nThe national narrative around USC is that the team has an elite offense with a subpar defense. However, so far this season, defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s defense has played better than expected. The defense leads the nation in sacks, while allowing only 18.67 points per game. But none of this comes as a surprise to Grinch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising when we don\u2019t get [the quarterback] on the ground,\u201d Grinch said when asked if the sacks have been a surprise. It has been the USC mantra all year to get to home on the defensive side of the ball, and it has been working.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a whole lot of ability to get the guy on the ground,\u201d Grinch said.\n\nTo win this weekend, though, the team recognizes that all three phases of the game must be on point. The special teams are headlined by redshirt freshman kicker Denis Lynch, who has gone viral for his pregame outfits this season.\n\n\u201cI liked the way they looked on TV,\u201d Lynch said when asked for his inspiration.\n\nRegardless of whether the outfits are helping Lynch\u2019s kicking game, Lynch has still had a successful season so far, making 80% of his kicks and remaining perfect on PATs.\n\nUSC\u2019s scoring flurry has caught national attention as the Trojans are putting up north of 40 points per game. Despite this success on the field, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams doesn\u2019t think the offense has played its best yet.\n\n\u201cI played alright,\u201d Williams said of his performance against Washington State. \u201cI felt like I can play a lot better. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve unlocked everything that I can do.\u201d\n\nWilliams also spoke on the way that defenses have been attacking him and the USC offense this year.\n\n\u201cThere have been a bunch of varied looks,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ve been showing things that we didn\u2019t go over or see on film.\u201d\n\nAgainst an elite Utah secondary, Williams and Co will have to be ready for the varied looks that will surely be thrown at them.\n\nThe Trojans, though, are confident heading into Saturday\u2019s showdown. Williams summed up the team\u2019s mentality best when asked what he wants his legacy to be at USC.\n\n\u201cI want to win,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThere is no better opportunity to do just that than on the road against Utah this week.\n```"}
{"key": "/2022/10/13/frankels-fantasy-files-week-6/", "response": "```\nFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files: Week 6\n\nNew guys on the block.\n\nBy Kyle Frankel\nOctober 13, 2022 at 3:39 pm PDT\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d is a column by Kyle Frankel about fantasy football. Week 5 of the NFL season had no shortage of storylines. The Cowboys upset the Rams and showed they might be real Super Bowl contenders. Conversely, the Rams disappointed again and now their potential to even make the playoffs is in question. Two different extremes: the Bills rule and the Lions are still the same old Lions. Buffalo looked like a college football powerhouse playing a tune-up game against an FCS opponent as they routed the Pittsburgh Steelers 38-3. Then, the highest scoring team of the season so far got shut out, as Detroit put up zero fight in a 29-0 loss to Bill Belichick\u2019s Patriots.\n\nDespite the Lions doing the complete opposite of what they had done through the first four weeks by failing to score a single point, Detroit wide receiver Joshua Reynolds still had himself another great game. Reynolds saw 10 targets leading to six catches and 92 yards. His 15.2 PPR points mark his fourth-straight game with over 12 points and it was his third-straight game with at least eight targets. I told you to get him last week. I\u2019m telling you to get him this week. He\u2019s a stud.\n\nThere\u2019s New Guys in Charge\n\nThere were two second-round rookie running backs everyone was talking about coming out of the draft: Breece Hall, drafted 34th overall by the New York Jets, and Kenneth Walker, selected by the Seattle Seahawks with the 41st overall pick.\n\nHall needs no introduction. The Iowa State product has been receiving an increasing workload throughout the season and just had an absolute breakout game for the New York Jets, finishing with just under 200 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown. All that was good for 27.7 PPR points, the 10th best of any player last week.\n\nHall is now the leader of the New York backfield, receiving the majority of carries, and a solidified every-week starter in fantasy leagues. He showed he can get it done both on the ground and in the air. Not to mention, he was one yard short of finding the endzone twice in Sunday\u2019s win, so he could have finished the day with three touchdowns.\n\nWhat about the other guy though? The latter of the aforementioned two continued to be hyped up during the offseason, but hasn\u2019t gotten much attention during the first quarter of the NFL season. That\u2019s about to change.\n\nSeattle\u2019s Rashaad Penny suffered a fractured fibula on Sunday and has undergone surgery, sidelining him for the rest of the 2022 season. This thrusts Kenneth Walker into the starter role in the Seattle backfield.\n\nWe saw flashes of Walker\u2019s talent during his first few games, but it was clear as day that he\u2019s a gifted runner when he replaced Penny in Sunday\u2019s 39-32 loss to the New Orleans Saints. Due to the limited time he was in charge of the rushing attack, he only had eight carries.\n\nHe made good use of his opportunities though, averaging 8.8 YPC for a total of 88 rushing yards and a trip to the endzone. He was incredibly efficient, scoring 14.8 PPR points with only eight attempts.\n\nWe just saw how effective he can be when given a chance. Now he\u2019s getting his chance. He will be the primary runner in Seattle\u2019s backfield moving forward and he\u2019s expected to receive the bulk of the work.\n\nHe\u2019s already off the board in just over 75% of ESPN leagues. If you\u2019re one of the lucky ones who can still spot him on waivers, grab him. Otherwise, see if you can put together a solid trade for him while he\u2019s still being slept on.\n\nPick Pierce Now\n\nI\u2019ve got a guy who\u2019s way more under the radar than the previously mentioned rushers, meaning he\u2019s also more available. This player is Alec Pierce, Indianapolis Colts wide receiver.\n\nI\u2019m well aware that the Colts\u2019 offense stinks right now. They haven\u2019t looked close to the team most people expected they would be and Matt Ryan appears to be a shadow of his former self. However, they can score. They have scored 17 or more points in three of their five games and I believe they will start to find their rhythm.\n\nRegardless of if they become as good an offense as people predicted during the offseason, the points and production still have to come from somewhere. Alec Pierce is somewhere. He is coming off back-to-back 80 yard performances, good for 12.0 and 16.1 PPR points. Also, I forgot to mention that he is out targeting Michael Pittman Jr. over the last two games. That\u2019s right, former Trojan Michael Pittman Jr.\n\nWill he continue to out target Pittman for the rest of the season? Probably not. Is he the clear WR2 on the Colts and a now-trusted place for Matt Ryan to put the football? Yes and yes.\n\nHe has the potential to become an every-week flex player in fantasy and is widely available right now, not rostered in over 80% of ESPN leagues. If you\u2019re running low on wideouts or looking for a sleeper to stash on your bench, Pierce could be your guy.\n\nI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t give a shout out to my beloved New York Jets, who made a statement with their 40-17 win over the Dolphins. Fun fact: this is the first time since 2015 both the Jets and Giants have been above .500 this late in the season. If the Jets and Giants can win, so can you. If that\u2019s not inspiring, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

The U.K.-based high school dropout turned alternative indie pop star took his tour to the U.S. to promote his 2020 album \u201cZeros,\u201d selling out nationwide \u2013 from Los Angeles to New York.\n\nWhen he was just 15 years old, McKenna\u2019s hit single \u201cBrazil\u201d debuted in 2015, which won the Glastonbury Emerging Talent award and allowed him to drop out of high school with job prospects at 17. Since then, the singer has released two albums and toured around the U.K., Europe and U.S., performing at festivals worldwide, from Lollapalooza to Coachella.\n\nThe English singer-songwriter has 4.4 million monthly listeners on Spotify and gained mainstream popularity in the U.S. when \u201cBrazil\u201d blew up on TikTok in 2022. With its catchy tunes and eccentric analogies, \u201cBrazil\u201d critiques the corruption and economic inequality that came to light when the 2014 World Cup was hosted in Brazil. In the song\u2019s silly chorus, he describes a man with \u201csix cars and a grizzly bear\u201d to hyperbolize the country\u2019s privileged people, revealing McKenna\u2019s commitment to social activism in his lyrics that appealed to Gen-Z\u2019s political awareness.\n\nTo date, 22.1K videos have been created using his sound, with TikTok virality sending \u201cBrazil\u201d to the U.K. singles tops charts seven years after its debut. TikTok has undeniably overtaken the music industry, influencing mainstream music charts, according to artists, top record labels and streaming services.\n\nAlt-rock band The Walters was revitalized by TikTok, reuniting after their 2017 break-up due to sudden TikTok fame. In 2021, The Walters\u2019 2014 song \u201cI Love You So\u201d blew up on the TikTok \u2013 nearly 800,000 videos have been made using their mellow indie-pop single, which peaked at #6 on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Hot Rock & Alternative charts and #21 on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Top 40 charts eight years following its debut.\n\nSince their reconciliation, The Walters have signed with Warner Records, coming out with a new EP and embarking on a national tour. In Billboard\u2019s coverage of the record deal in November 2021, Warner Records CEO Aaron Bay-Schuck said, \u201cThe Walters song \u201cI Love You So\u201d is a perfect and modern example of a great song that is finally getting its due recognition thanks to discovery platforms like TikTok. The song is memorable upon first listen and timeless in its production, so no surprise it has risen above the clutter to identify itself as a hit song.\u201d\n\nMCKENNA AND THE HOLLYWOOD STARS\n\nOn September 29, I got the chance to see McKenna in concert and witness the TikTok phenomenon in person for the first time. By 8 p.m., there was already a line of eager fans winding around the corner of The Fonda. The sidewalks up and down the block are studded with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Located in the heart of L.A., the venue is renowned for its rock and indie concerts, hosting shows from Katy Perry to the Rolling Stones.\n\nUpon arriving, I was shocked to immediately see familiar faces; fellow USC students stood in the front of the line and I bumped into two more peers waiting for the bathroom inside. There\u2019s an underground quality to McKenna\u2019s stardom, but his fanbase is devoted, with listeners beyond his most popular single, \u201cBrazil.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had been waiting to see him live for a few years.

After her hour-long set, McKenna took the stage.\n\nA tangible enthusiasm swept the crowd, and they erupted in applause when McKenna took the stage. His stage presence and charisma were mesmerizing. One audience member Erin Munz tossed an orange bucket hat printed with beans onstage and McKenna playfully wore it for the rest of the song (Munz attested that superfans know of McKenna\u2019s vocal love of legumes).\n\nMcKenna played an acoustic guitar for some of his set and the crowd belted the lyrics in unison for the entirety of \u201cBrazil.\u201d Young musicians like Declan McKenna have their pulse on the notoriously outspoken Gen-Z \u2013 and these artists\u2019 socially conscious lyricism and indie pop styles have made their way from TikTok trends to top chart radio sensations.\n\nThe British artist\u2019s fame is indicative of the power of TikTok, both in exposing indie artists to the public and influencing mainstream music.\n```"}

You park your car on Vernon Ave and walk half a mile up to Degnan Boulevard, where you see a line of Afro-centric boutiques, food stands and art exhibitions. You\u2019re at the Leimert Park Artwalk, a space where the Black community gathers to share and commemorate their culture here in Los Angeles.\n\nThis monthly celebration was created by renowned artist, director and filmmaker, Ben Caldwell in the summer of 2010. Since then, the artwalk has brought the Black community together in a way that allows them to showcase their culture, passion and talents to the public.\n\nHandmade jewelry created by Shanika Bilal. (Photo by Halle Hazzard)\n\nThe cultural enclave fosters a sense of unity amongst its Black businesses owners and vendors. According to Jeanette Miller, a Leimert Park vendor who sells Kenyan body oils and soaps, Leimert Park has been a staple for Black creativity since she was a young girl growing up in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family unit,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe enjoy being here and we enjoy selling our goods. It\u2019s just the meaning of every Sunday.\u201d\n\nLeimert Park vendor Jeanette Miller proudly displays her jewelry, soaps, and body oils. (Photo by Halle Hazzard)\n\nThe art walk has garnered a lot of foot traffic over the years and each month vendors work to keep their ideas fresh and their inspiration flowing. Artist and jewelry designer Ishmael Israel, handmakes his own jewelry, but the bending of copper metal into bracelets is not the hardest part of jewelry designing for Israel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making sure the ideas stay fresh,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s something I could visualize in my mind, I could make it pretty quick.\u201d\n\nIshmael Israel, a jewelry artist.

(Photo by Halle Hazzard)\n\nIsrael started off as a painter before switching to jewelry making when he was just 18 years old. He now owns his own jewelry company, Douglas Designs Unlimited, and is proud to showcase his artwork in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m competing on the world stage. This is definitely one of the gateways into recognition on a larger platform.\u201d\n\nNot only is the art walk a safe space for artists to receive exposure for their work, but it\u2019s a way for historically Black neighborhoods like Leimert Park to be preserved. Even with 79.6 percent of the population being African American, looming threats of gentrification remain a major concern in the area. However, artists like Los Angeles native, Muhammed Bubaruk, continue to display their work to keep the culture of the neighborhood alive.\n\nMuhammed Bubaruk proudly stands next to his painting, \u201cModern Jazz Quartet.\u201d (Photo by Halle Hazzard)\n\n\u201cI love Black people. I love Black music, and I love our history. I\u2019ve been over in this part of the town since 1973. And there was a time when Black people weren\u2019t allowed to be on this side of town.\u201d\n\nBorn in Memphis, Tennessee and raised in Compton, Bubaruk remembers a time period in which America was still reeling from its Jim Crow Era. He recalls the drastic change in the area as more African Americans migrated to Leimert Park in the 70s and 80s. During this transition, Bubaruk\u2019s love for jazz culture and portrait art grew.\n\n\u201cA lot of these people were an inspiration to me when I was coming up, and I am still inspired by them today,\u201d Bubaruk says. \u201cI paint people because I am into people.\u201d\n\nThe Muhammed Ali portrait was painted with acrylic.

(Photo by Halle Hazzard)\n\nAs a portrait artist, Bubaruk uses different types of paint to showcase the visual elements of each individual. He uses a mix of oil and acrylic paint, using the acrylic to exhibit a rougher texture to a portrait and the oil to showcase a smoother finish. He stressed the difficulties in working with these paints, as the acrylic dries much faster than the oil, making his time with the acrylic paint limited.\n\n\u201cYou can go from light to dark, to dark to light much more easily with the oil than you could with the acrylic because you got more time to work with it.\u201d\n\nMuhammed Bubaruk\u2019s artwork is displayed against an art mural off Degnan Boulevard. (Photo by Halle Hazzard)\n\nHistorically Black figures such as Barbara Morrison, Nipsey Hussle, Muhammed Ali and many more remain an inspiration to Bubaruk, as he proudly displays his talent every Sunday on Degnan Boulevard.\n\nWhat makes the Leimert Park Art Walk such a friendly environment is the openness and vulnerability each vendor showcases behind their stand. Their work that is influenced by their culture is not gatekept, but displayed in a manner that piques curiosity and fascination. The sense of community the art walk exhibits is reflective of its residents, who welcome the public with open arms.\n\nSo if you are driving down Crenshaw on the last Sunday of the month, head to the Leimert Park Art Walk, where you can witness the beauty of Black creativity.\n\nLeimert park vendor Melinda Simon sells summer dresses and dashikis on the north side of the art walk.

The theme for this month\u2019s Latinx Heritage events is \u201cUnidos: Inclusivity for a Stronger Community,\u201d and the student assembly aims to \u201cencourage and facilitate the academic, pre-professional, cultural, social, and political self-realization of USC\u2019s Latinx community\u201d through these programs, according to their website.\n\nNoche de Cultura was the largest event the LSA held this month. In addition to speeches, organizations facilitated by the LSA were in attendance, ranging from pre-professional clubs to Latinx Greek organizations.\n\nStudents at the event reflected on Latinx Heritage Month and their excitement for the Noche de Cultura celebration.

I really like events like these because it gets Latinos around campus together which is good because you feel at home and welcomed. It makes me think how there are a lot more Latinos than I thought because you don\u2019t get to see a lot of Latinos around campus.\u201d\n\nLSA director Melina Quiles commented, \u201cWe wanted a chance to share all the diverse cultures of Latin America with the students on campus. I think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to spread awareness about the organization and also other organizations, and just show students that they have support if they need it, especially Latinx students.\u201d\n```"}

City Council 5th District candidates disagree on best way to address a top issue.\n\nAn encampment on the corner of Beverly Boulevard and Edinburgh Avenue. (Photo by Shreya Agrawal)\n\nBy Shreya Agrawal October 12, 2022 at 5:52 pm PDT\n\nLidia Garcia has worked as a cashier at the Bargain Fair on Beverly Boulevard for two years. Recently, the store owners were told by the landlord that the building will be torn down for redevelopment, forcing them to look for another place. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the same thing, the homelessness, it\u2019s just really bad,\u201d Garcia said. Many people, including the landlord of the building, believe gentrification is a solution towards solving homelessness. Garcia said some unhoused people started a fire in the alley next to their store twice. One of the fires threatened Bargain Fair, and she was not sure if the building would survive. \u201cIt hurt our business because they burnt down the cables, so we had no internet and power for about two weeks,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nGarcia isn\u2019t alone. Many small businesses along Beverly Boulevard in the Beverly Grove district fear their businesses are being hurt by the growing population of unhoused people. Homelessness has been a perennial concern in Los Angeles, and is now exploding as an issue in the city\u2019s fall political campaigns. The Beverly Grove district\u2019s current Los Angeles City Council member, Paul Koretz, gave up the post to run for city controller and will be replaced by either Sam Yebri or Katy Young Yaroslavsky in the Nov. 8 election. Both Yebri and Young Yaroslavsky have described homelessness as a major issue and have committed to making it a top priority.\n\nBoth have highlighted on their websites the recently expanded Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 41.18\u2013\u2013which prohibits anyone from lying, sleeping or putting personal property in certain public areas. Yet while both candidates have supported Section 41.18 in multiple debates, they differ on how it should be used. Yebri supports the ordinance as a way to reduce encampments in the city, while Young Yaroslavsky sees it as a \u201cbackstop strategy\u201d that prevents encampments but does not solve homelessness on its own.\n\nYebri, a civil attorney, community non-profit leader and small business owner, has advocated for the use of the ordinance as a way to reduce encampments near public areas, like schools, daycare centers and libraries. In a campaign video, Yebri said this ordinance \u201ccreates urgency to tackle our homelessness crisis by requiring the city to flood these sensitive areas with services.\u201d Young Yaroslavsky, who has worked as an environmental attorney for the Climate Action Reserve and was an adviser to L.A. County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, supports the use of Section 41.18 but for those who refuse to accept the housing, which is a small part of the unhoused population.\n\nYoung Yaroslavsky says on her website that the ordinance \u201cdoesn\u2019t, on its own, actually solve homelessness. It simply tells people where they CAN\u2019T sleep.\u201d \u201c41.18 can only be used if it\u2019s paired with housing and services,\u201d Young Yaroslavsky said during a recent debate. \u201cIt can be a useful tool as a backstop once we offer people housing and services that work for them. Otherwise, we are just moving people from one street corner to the next.\u201d\n\nWhat does L.A. Municipal Code Section 41.18 entail? While the ordinance prohibits people experiencing homelessness from living in the streets, it does not state any provisions for shelter or housing. \u201cDisplacing people without providing a good alternative is effectively criminalizing being homeless,\u201d said Chelsea Shover, an epidemiology professor at UCLA. Shover said that constant displacement makes the situation of unhoused people much worse and makes them vulnerable to sickness. \u201cThe population of people experiencing homelessness has a much higher rate of comorbidities,\u201d Shover said.\n\nShover and her colleague, Kathryn Leifheit, mapped all the public spaces that are restricted by Section 41.18 to see the effect of the law on COVID vaccination camps for people experiencing homelessness. She noted that the law resulted in an immediate removal of encampments in Downtown L.A., only for them to come back again a few days later. \u201cAn encampment gets swept and it moves a little way away, and then it comes back and it gets swept again. It is just shuffling people around,\u201d she said.\n\nThe biggest issue is the lack of available housing for people experiencing homelessness. During their last debate, on Tuesday, both Yebri and Young Yaroslavsky were questioned about where they would construct temporary shelters for people experiencing homelessness. Yebri said his team has identified 75 empty sites that could be used for safe camping and building temporary shelters, but many of these have been rejected as suitable spots by the city. \u201cWe have to fight the bureaucracy that is getting in the way of providing temporary shelter,\u201d Yebri said. He also stated that he would enforce Section 41.18 near schools, parks and libraries and move the people there into shelters.\n\nYoung Yaroslavsky said the city needs an all-of-the-above approach to solve homelessness and should use federal funding to buy motels and other underused buildings, and use old hospitals and tiny homes to provide housing. She also said that Yebri \u201coveremphasizes\u201d the usefulness of Section 41.18. \u201cThe biggest reason why it is has limited utility is because we simply don\u2019t have the beds right now for people to go into at the quantity that the council members want to use 41.18,\u201d Young Yaroslavsky said. She supported the use of the ordinance once the city had enough housing for all the unhoused people in the city.\n\nSmall business owners hope for change during November elections Since 2018, the population of people experiencing homelessness in the City Council 5th District has increased by more than 30%. Pam Sunderland, who has been running FastFrame on Beverly Boulevard for 25 years, says she has seen tents everywhere recently. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good for the business,\u201d Sunderland said. \u201cWe had one person sleeping on the roof recently. We called the landlord because at that point, it is trespassing. But on the sidewalk, it is not trespassing.\u201d Trespassing is an infraction, which makes it a minor crime. Sunderland says that the police have told her they can make the area around her store a non-encampment zone only if any of the people experiencing homelessness commit a serious or violent crime. \u201cI am sad for us as business owners, and I am sad for the homeless people,\u201d Sunderland said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where they can go. The city is trying different things but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s working. And it\u2019s not fast enough.\u201d Sunderland is looking into what she can do to solve the problem and help her business. \u201c[The policeman] said to look for the candidates who feel the way you do and then vote that way. And so, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do,\u201d she said.\n```"}

They include imagery of Mexico\u2019s matriarch saint, the virgin of Guadalupe.\n\nPHUNG: When you look at it at the center of design are the praying hands of the Guadalupe, you know, acknowledging this very somber, contemplative space that\u2019s sacred and devotional because a lot of the moms had to pray.\n\nThe rose and flower carvings that surround the virgin\u2019s hands reflect the hand-tooled designs that often embellish traditional Mexican purses and shoes.\n\nHuynh also drew huipils ... hand-stitched indigenous tunics with flowers that have become a symbol of indigenous resistance.\n\nPHUNG: But most importantly, when you sit there and gaze at the work, you\u2019ll see the words of the moms of metal permanently on the wall. ... And the way that the words are broken up, you\u2019ll see, at the space, it\u2019s broken because of the wall sectionals and you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a part where it\u2019s broken and it says: speak English. That phrase is symbolic of the discrimination women faced because they mainly spoke Spanish.\n\nOther quotes reflect the pain the women felt.\n\nPHUNG: \u2018Se me acabo la cancion,\u201d my song is finished and I always thought like, with all this suffering, this mother still could poignantly and poetically describe how this made her feel.\n\nHuynh admits the sculpture can\u2019t undo the harm to these women. But she says it\u2019s important to acknowledge the past.\n\nPHUNG: This artwork is about apologizing and telling the moms we\u2019re sorry, we didn\u2019t forget, and we\u2019ll never forget. And we\u2019re sorry, not only to you, but for your children and your grandchildren and your families.\n\nThe hospital will soon display four quilts to complement the sculpture created by community residents and activists.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Citlalli Ch\u00e1vez-Nava\n```"}

Will sports betting ever be allowed in California?\n\nCampaign fliers about Prop. 26 and 27. (Photo by Ian Roddy)\n\nBy Ian Roddy October 12, 2022 at 5:26 pm PDT\n\nYou\u2019d think hundreds of millions of dollars could buy you just about anything in the world. But apparently, even that just isn\u2019t enough to legalize sports betting in California. Despite a record amount spent on the two gambling-related state ballot measures this campaign season, both Propositions 26 and 27 are tanking in the polls just weeks from the election and are headed for near-certain defeat.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) survey released last week, which showed Prop. 26 down by 11 percentage points and Prop. 27 failing by 26 percentage points. \u201cThese results suggest that the sports wagering initiatives are foundering in the face of the opposition advertising campaigns,\u201d said IGS co-director Eric Schickler in a statement. \u201cThe lack of support among key demographic groups makes passage of each an uphill climb at best.\u201d\n\nProp. 26 would legalize in-person sports betting at tribal casinos, as well as allow dice and roulette games there. Prop. 27 would legalize online betting in California and is backed mainly by gambling websites like FanDuel and DraftKings.\n\nOver the past three years, nearly 40 states have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting, and most \u2014 most recently Arizona and Arkansas \u2014 have already passed. But in California, voters simply aren\u2019t buying what the betting companies have been trying to sell.\n\nProp. 27 promises to help fight homelessness in the state by taxing betting corporations and diverting those funds to the cause. Organizations in support of the legislation have focused heavily on that in their marketing. \u201cThey\u2019re promoting it as a solution to homelessness, but voters aren\u2019t buying that,\u201d said Kathy Fairbanks, spokesperson for No on 27. \u201cVoters don\u2019t believe that funding for homeless programs is the only problem [with the fight against homelessness]. It\u2019s government bureaucracy, it\u2019s red tape, it\u2019s all of that, none of which is considered in Prop. 27.\u201d\n\nNathan Click, a spokesperson for Yes on 27, told the Los Angeles Times that Prop. 27 has faced \u201cover $100 million in misleading and false attacks \u2014 $45 million before we even qualified for the ballot.\u201d\n\nLegalizing sports betting in-person would reap $300 million for tribal casinos by some estimates while introducing online betting with Prop. 27 could generate $2.8 billion. Because of the sheer size of the untapped California betting market, it\u2019s likely a matter of when, not if, some form of legalized sports betting makes its way into the state.\n\n\u201cThe reality is they\u2019re definitely going to try again,\u201d said I. Nelson Rose, author and emeritus gambling law professor at Whittier College. \u201cSome group is going to quickly start writing an initiative again.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rose, betting corporations are unlikely to give up and voters could even wind up seeing sports betting propositions on the 2024 ballot.\n```"}

They serve as the staple of our cultures. For those who identify as Latinx, we often resented our parents growing up when they told us \u201cHay frijoles en la casa\u201d instead of letting us eat from a popular chain restaurant. Now that we are surrounded by those chain restaurants and eating out often, all we could think about is mom\u2019s frijoles de la olla.\n\nThe struggle for many college students who identify with one or more of the cultures mentioned is making simple foods such as rice and beans bursting with flavor in their dorm rooms. Now that we are away from home, we look forward to home-cooked meals and the warm atmosphere associated with them. When the dining hall food remakes \u2013 or at least attempts to make \u2013 the foods we grew up eating, they lack two crucial ingredients: spices and love.\n\nNow, would you believe me if I were to tell you that there is a cheap and efficient solution to recreate some of the foods we love back at home?

The journey to create this line of products was not easy. \u201cIf I think about some of the biggest challenges we faced in the early days, it was just getting the product right, and getting it the way that I wanted it, you know, when you\u2019re cooking something in your house\u201d said Basir.\n\nA Dozen Cousins recently collaborated with Alter Eco, the world\u2019s cleanest and greenest chocolate company, to develop a limited-edition line of hot cocoa bombs that were inspired by some of its favorite drinks from Latin America. \u201cAlter Eco has expertise in making really great, really decadent chocolate products. And we understand cultural recipes, pulling out the history in a dish. And so we came together, it\u2019s been really fun to work with them,\u201d said Basir.\n\nBoth brands are dedicated to using natural ingredients instead of GMOs and artificial flavors.

Now is the perfect time to enjoy the fall in Los Angeles. And what a better way to enjoy it than by enjoying fall specialty flavors. Whether you are staying in town, or returning to campus on Monday, here are some restaurants to enjoy fall food in Los Angeles.\n\nGrand Central Market\nThe Grand Central Market is host to many vendors putting a fall twist on their menus, with three of them are featuring seasonal ingredients in their new items. The pie shop Fat + Flour is serving its cherry apple pie, which incorporates Mutsu apples. The Donut Man, which uses seasonal fruits throughout the year and most recently in its signature fresh strawberry donuts, has now pivoted to pumpkin cream donuts. DTLA Cheese will be selling holiday cheeses moving further into the season. For instance, the Moses Reaper is a Halloween-themed cheese that\u2019s ash-ripened, resulting in a black and white rind with an orange interior. The cheese counter and kitchen will also be selling apple cinnamon crisps and maple sugar cookies.\n\nPost & Beam\nPost & Beam, a restaurant just 15 minutes away in Baldwin Hills Crenshaw, is also incorporating unique items into its fall menu. \u201cOne thing we do for fall is we bring in a gumbo,\u201d said owner John Cleveland. \u201cOctober is the beginning of gumbo season, so we do a seafood gumbo and also incorporate vegetable items like smoked cauliflower with an apple cider glaze and herbs.\u201d Post & Beam is famous for its southern new-American style fusion brunch menu, which is available from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and complemented with an open bar that includes dishes such as shrimp and grits with scrambled eggs and pecan pie french toast. Homemade cornbread, pizzas with various toppings and sides such as black eyed peas and mac and smoked cheese are served for dinner.\n\nBe Bright Coffee\nBe Bright Coffee, a regular vendor at the L.A. Smorgasburg, has created new seasonal items just in time for its first store location\u2019s opening on Melrose Avenue this Saturday. Winner of the 2021 United States Cold Brew Championship, Be Bright started off offering a wide range of coffee grounds tailored to the drinker\u2019s preferences through the \u201cLet\u2019s Find Your Coffee Fit\u201d feature offered on their website that is delivered to the customer. Frank La, owner and founder of Be Bright, said \u201cblack sesame mocha is our most popular [this time of year].\u201d Other well-liked items featured on their menu include the pumpkin pie latte, pumpkin cream cold brew and the happy camper with dark maple syrup.\n\nLa Monarca\nLast, but definitely not least, is La Monarca. The Mexican bakery chain was founded in 2006 and donates 1% of their proceeds to conservation efforts to protect the monarch butterflies of Michoacan, Mexico. Ashley Hernandez, a shift lead from a La Monarca bakery in East L.A., said the most popular menu item is cafe de la olla. While their year-round items like Mexican hot chocolate and cinnamon cookies aren\u2019t out of place for the chilly weather, customers can enjoy pumpkin spice conchas and other Halloween-themed treats at one of their 12 locations in L.A.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza\nOctober 11, 2022 at 10:24 pm PDT\n\nWith the addition of new head coach Lincoln Riley last November, USC made it clear that it has every intention of returning to national prominence. The Trojans\u2019 efforts in the first half of this season have echoed that sentiment; for the first time since 2006, they\u2019ve started the season with six consecutive victories. But as the No. 7 Trojans prepared for their weekend showdown with the No. 20 Utah Utes, Riley expressed that the Trojans are not content with just six wins.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the winning and some of the good things we\u2019ve done,\u201d Riley said after Tuesday\u2019s practice. \u201cBut we still come back each week and know there\u2019s a lot more in the tank with these guys.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans, although undefeated, are far from firing on all cylinders. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams underperformed in last week\u2019s victory over Washington State. Williams passed for a meager 188 yards while only completing 15 of 29 pass attempts. Some of those incompletions don\u2019t fall on Williams though, as the Trojans were forced to overcome some critical drops by key receivers.\n\n\u201cWe missed a couple of throws and dropped some balls,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWhen you throw it 30 times and you take 10 of those off the board that were either a missed throw or a dropped pass... [We] missed some things that we would expect to finish, but we were able to make it up in other areas.\u201d\n\nThose other areas include the emergence of Travis Dye, redshirt senior transfer running back. Dye, coming off a Washington State game in which he rushed for 149 yards and one touchdown, has become the undisputed RB1 for the Trojans. And this is a USC team that has a plethora of talent at the running back position.\n\n\u201cIt meant a lot that coach Riley trusted me, it meant a lot that my teammates trusted me,\u201d Dye said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that everywhere. It felt really good.\u201d\n\nDye tied his career high in rushing attempts on Saturday with 28, and he believes he has even more in the tank.\n\n\u201cIf the team needs me to do it, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Dye said. \u201cI definitely could\u2019ve done more if they wanted to keep feeding me.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what makes Dye such a key contributor to this Trojans team, Riley emphasized one trait.\n\n\u201cConsistency. We see it every single day \u2014 there\u2019s a reason the guy plays like he does week in and week out,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe prepares at an elite level, he\u2019s very consistent and he makes very few mental mistakes.\u201d\n\nIf the Trojans have any hope of knocking off the Utes this weekend, they need another strong performance from Dye, as well as contributions from senior running back Austin Jones and freshman running back Raleek Brown. Utah deploys an elite pass defense, holding opponents to a mere 179.3 passing yards per game \u2014 good for first in the Pac-12. Utah\u2019s rush defense is not quite as formidable \u2014 it ranks sixth in the Pac-12 and is giving up an average of 136.5 yards per game on the ground.\n\nRedshirt senior offensive tackle Justin Dedich spoke on his running backs\u2019 abilities to keep drives going.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re intelligent players,\u201d Dedich said. \u201cThey\u2019re really experienced. They\u2019re patient. At running back and o-line you need to be quick but also patient at the same time to see what the defense is doing. They do a good job of keeping that patience and attacking when they get a chance.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will travel to Salt Lake City on Saturday for the first time since the 2020 COVID-19 season. The Trojans were able to take advantage of the lack of fans en route to a 33-17 victory that year. They will not have that luxury this time.\n\nWhen the Trojans traveled to Corvallis to take on Oregon State a few weeks back, the atmosphere got the best of the USC offense. The Trojans struggled to adapt to the noise, and it almost cost the team their perfect record.\n\n\u201cOregon State was a really tough environment, but this one coming up is gonna be our biggest challenge,\u201d Dye said. \u201cI\u2019ve played up there two times before and the fans are wild. It\u2019s gonna get loud and our guys really have to prepare for that \u2014 just blocking out the noise and going back to staying neutral.\u201d\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s practice, the music playing from the speakers was louder than normal. This was on purpose, in order to prepare the Trojans for Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been, with the sound behind us, really preparing for that type of environment,\u201d Dye said. \u201cOlder guys like me, Dedich, we need to let the younger guys know that this type of environment is gonna get loud, and you\u2019re not even gonna be able to really hear your own thoughts.\u201d\n\nThe hope for the Trojans is that the Oregon State game, as well as their preparations in practice, will be key in helping them adjust early to the loud noise and rowdy atmosphere in Utah. Riley believes the Trojans are up to the task.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a challenging second half of the season, but this is when it gets the most fun,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThis is what you do it for. You put yourself in a great position and now it\u2019s time to go accelerate and be our best.\u201d\n```"}

Both candidates criticized the current leadership in L.A., with Caruso claiming that \u201cthe system is broken\u201d and Bass asserting that the city needs \u201cnew leadership that will make sure we reject the politics of divide and conquer.\u201d\n\nCaruso and Bass were united in their condemnation of L.A. city leadership, citing the controversy surrounding several L.A. council members as an example of the current city leadership\u2019s inability to bring communities together successfully. Days before the debate, leaked audio surfaced of the former president of the Los Angeles City Council, Nury Martinez, along with council members Gil Cedillo, Kevin de Le\u00f3n and L.A. County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera, making openly racist remarks about some of their colleagues and Angelenos in general. Martinez went as far as saying that fellow council member Mike Bonin\u2019s 8-year-old son, who is Black, was an \u201caccessory\u201d and said his son is a \u201cparece changuito,\u201d which translates to \u201clooks like a little monkey,\u201d the L.A. Times reported. Martinez also made derogatory comments about Oaxacans.\n\nAs they entered the final debate before the election, the L.A. mayoral race remains close, according to a report by the LA Times. Bass leads Caruso by three points among all voters, compared to the 12-point lead she held back in August. Bass\u2019 lead among voters most likely to participate in November also shrank from 21 points to 15 points.\n\nBoth Bass and Caruso have deep ties to USC and its controversies. Bass was under criticism for a $95,000 tuition scholarship from USC\u2019s social work program in 2011 from Marilyn Flynn, the former dean of USC\u2019s social work program. As Annenberg Media previously reported, Flynn recently pleaded guilty in September to bribery in a separate case involving the former L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. Flynn was in dealings with Ridley-Thomas and planned to use USC social work as a transmission channel to the Ridley-Thomas campaign committee. Federal prosecutors have mentioned her in their case but have not said she is under investigation. According to the L.A. Times, \u201c[by] awarding free tuition to Bass in 2011, Flynn hoped to obtain the congresswoman\u2019s assistance in passing coveted legislation, prosecutors wrote in a July court filing.\u201d In addition, the Times reported that Bass supported a Congressional bill that would provide USC and other private universities with greater access to federal funds for their social work programs.\n\nCaruso has been accused by Bass of covering up sexual abuse at USC when he failed to disclose the results of the investigation into USC gynecologist George Tyndall, who was accused of sexually abusing numerous women during his time with the University. Caruso claims an investigation was conducted but has yet to release a report addressing the allegations.\n\nThe candidates agreed that the failure of leadership in L.A. extends far beyond the city council, affecting the city\u2019s policy regarding the housing crisis, policing and drug usage. Bass continued to pledge to address the root causes of homelessness to provide long-term solutions, which she has called for throughout several debates. Caruso once again faced criticism for his history as a contractor in L.A., with Bass calling him out for \u201chaving spent his life as a builder and never, ever built one unit of affordable housing.\u201d Caruso refuted the criticism by citing his business as focused on retail center construction and reiterated his plan to build 30,000 interim housing units.\n\n\u201cMy business has never been in building affordable housing...You need to have somebody who\u2019s a builder and is in business to know what the problem is so you know how to solve it... I\u2019m a builder,\u201d Caruso said. However, Caruso argued that his history as a \u201cbuilder\u201d in L.A. makes him uniquely qualified to facilitate the end of the housing crisis and criticized Bass\u2019 \u201cFEMA style\u201d housing solution, which he argued is inhumane. Caruso reiterated several times that his focus remains on \u201chousing and services,\u201d and that his plan to build 30,000 beds would bring unhoused individuals in and provide them with the psychiatric and drug rehabilitation services needed to get people off the street.\n\nThe candidates also disagreed on their plans for police reform and solving crime in the city. While both agreed that the Los Angeles Police Department is severely understaffed, they provided vastly different strategies to increase police presence on the streets. Bass\u2019 strategy centered around moving officers from desk jobs to patrol work, which Caruso criticized as impossible, claiming that at least half of the officers on desk work are injured and unable to enter the field. Instead, Caruso promoted his plan of hiring 1,500 new officers and, citing his previous experience leading the Los Angeles Police Commission following the 1992 Los Angeles riots, argued that his experience has proven his ability to take on crime. Bass previously critiqued Caruso\u2019s plan by pointing out that the \u201c[police] academy can\u2019t even fill a class now.\u201d Caruso doubled down on his plans for crime prevention while asserting that police reform should include hiring more officers as well as increased training and accountability.\n\nIn addition, Caruso advocated for the freedom to allow officers to execute their duties, which he claims is difficult in the current political climate because there is \u201ca culture of not allowing the cops to do their job.\u201d\n\nA pivotal juncture in the debate came when the moderators asked how the candidates planned on funding their plans on crucial issues. While Caruso was quick to promise voters he would not raise taxes, Bass did not. When Caruso attacked her on the point, Bass defended herself, saying, \u201cIf people are dying on our streets and it is necessary, I might [raise taxes]. ... I\u2019m going to do whatever it takes.\u201d```"}

Twenty years onward, \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d stands as a celebration of love, relishing in the fleeting moments that harken back to \u201cSabrina\u201d and \u201cThe Apartment.\u201d Anderson\u2019s frame isn\u2019t forbearing towards the urgency that love sometimes asks of people. It\u2019s driven by the unimaginable strength that comes with being understood in spite of one\u2019s flaws.\n\nContrasting to his latter effort, \u201cMagnolia,\u201d Anderson retreats to a decisive simplicity in \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d to usher in the 21st century. Its protagonist, Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), precedes a palpable on-screen social anxiety \u2014 one rooted in the age of social media and magnified by a pandemic. But this was no accident. For Anderson, this film is autobiographical. Like Barry, Anderson was prone to temper tantrums and outspoken in a large family, the director explained in a hotel kitchenette interview with the Guardian in 2003.\n\n\u201cYou have to be a brat in order to carve out your parameters, and you have to be a monster to anyone who gets in your way [in Hollywood],\u201d Anderson told the Guardian. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s difficult to know when that\u2019s necessary and when you\u2019re just being a baby, throwing your rattle from the cage. So I can be a real arrogant, bratty prick at times. But maybe not so much now.\u201d\n\nAnderson found inspiration for one of the film\u2019s B stories in a Time Magazine article from 1999. Engineer David Phillips discovered a frequent-flier promotion that enabled him to purchase three-thousand-dollars-worth of Healthy Choice pudding (or 12,150 cups) for 1.25 million air-miles. But Anderson insisted it was the opportunity to work with Sandler that gave the director a motive.\n\nA 32-year-old Paul Thomas Anderson (left) won his first Best Director Award for \"Punch-Drunk Love\" at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. (Photo courtesy of IMDb)\n\nBy 2002, Sandler made himself a household name with \u201cBilly Madison,\u201d \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d \u201cThe Waterboy,\u201d \u201cThe Wedding Singer,\u201d and a five-year stint on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Working with Anderson added an untapped depth that was waiting to be explored by Sandler.\n\n\u201cI wanted to work with Sandler so much,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBecause, if I\u2019ve ever been kinda sad or down or whatever, I just wanna pop in an Adam Sandler movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d follows socially inept business owner Barry (Sandler) as he falls in love with his sister\u2019s co-worker, Lena Leonard (Emily Watson). The director underscores the best of this cast, whether it\u2019s Watson\u2019s graceful decisiveness, or Phillip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s explosive temper as Dean, the mattress salesman and extortionist who threatens Barry\u2019s sheltered existence.\n\nThe script hijacks the \u201cboy meets girl\u201d formula, spinning it into a refreshing and off-kiltered pursuit of love that isn\u2019t hindered by unwarranted exposition or world-building. Our protagonist is allowed to be exemplary of the visceral delusions of love, especially in the unpredictable milieu of Sandler, and the colors of his tie \u2014 a motif for his blossoming self-confidence.\n\nThose moments are brilliantly exacerbated by Brion\u2019s unconventional rhythmic instrumentation. That was Anderson\u2019s idea, according to Brion. Playing into the film\u2019s rhythm essentially made way for a tangible, poetic pacing to a scene.\n\nThrough the film\u2019s non-diegetic sound, however, came the immortalization of Robert Altman, one of Anderson\u2019s greatest influences and a titan of the \u201870s period of New Hollywood. Anderson used the song \u201cHe Needs Me,\u201d sung by Shelley Duvall and written by Harry Nilsson from Altman\u2019s \u201cPopeye,\u201d to signal emotional longing between Barry and Lena.\n\nIn Mitchell Zuckoff\u2019s oral biography of Altman, Anderson kept the needle-drop from Altman until Anderson screened \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d for him. They got drunk together shortly thereafter.\n\nThe movie is askew in comparison to Norah Ephron and Nancy Meyers pictures from the \u201890s and \u201800s, though their contributions are immeasurable. \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d adds another layer of dimension to this misty-eyed genre through its mutated conventions.\n\nBy Barry and Lena\u2019s last sweet embrace, Anderson orchestrates a romantic comedy of the highest and most stylized caliber.\n```"}

County-USC hospital\n\nThe exhibit also pays homage to the Mexican immigrant women who endured the coercive procedures from 1968 to 1974.\n\nNestled among trees, bushes and plants, 'Sobrevivir' is located in front of LA County-USC's main administrative building in an elevated courtyard. (Photo by Citlalli Ch\u00e1vez-Nava)\n\nBy Citlalli Ch\u00e1vez-Nava\nOctober 11, 2022 at 6:52 pm PDT\n\nHow do you express an apology through art? That was the question Los Angeles-based artist Phung Huynh had to consider when she embarked on a journey to create \u201cSobrevivir,\u201d an installation at L.A. County-USC Medical Center. Commissioned by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 2018, \u201cSobrevivir\u201d (To Remain Alive), aims to publicly apologize and pay homage to more than 240 largely Mexican immigrant women who were sterilized without their consent at the medical center between 1968-1974. The procedures were part of federal population control programs that were underway across the nation.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be the most important work I\u2019m ever going to do,\u201d said Huynh, speaking from her studio in Northeast L.A. \u201cThis work is going to live for years and decades, even after I\u2019m not here anymore.\u201d\n\nThe installation, which was unveiled this summer in an elevated courtyard near the hospital\u2019s main administrative building, is composed of complementary elements that reflect the women\u2019s Mexican heritage. It features a steel disk sculpture that measures 21 feet in diameter formed with 300-pound corten-steel panels positioned flush against the ground. Corten-steel, known for its ability to withstand weatherization, captivated Huynh because to her the material symbolized the women\u2019s strength, beauty and resilience in the face of immense pain, shame and silence.\n\nThe disk is embellished with imagery of Mexico\u2019s matriarch saint, the Virgen de Guadalupe, etched in the hand-tooled style often found on traditional Mexican purses, belts and shoes. Surrounding the Virgen are etchings of flowers, which symbolize women\u2019s fertility. They\u2019re carved to resemble Mexican huipiles, hand-stitched tunics that have become a symbol of indigenous resistance against colonialism over the centuries.\n\n\u201c[The huipil] has lasted, and women today still wear it,\u201d said Huynh, who is herself a mother and educator. \u201cI feel it\u2019s a Mexican cultural identifier for the matriarch, for the mom, for women and for girls.\u201d\n\nAs artist Phung Huynh prepared to create 'Sobrevivir,' she drew inspiration from this pair of Mexican leather-tooled heels she found at a vintage shop in South Pasadena. Their beautiful hand-tooled elaborate designs reminded her of human skin, suffering but also transformation. (Photo by Citlalli Ch\u00e1vez-Nava)\n\nAt night, lights illuminate these designs to resemble candlelight. The sculpture is also surrounded by curved walls that feature quotes from the women taken from \u201cNo M\u00e1s Bebes\u201d (No More Babies), the 2016 documentary directed by oral historian Virginia Espino and filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pe\u00f1a.\n\n\u201cThe mothers were never heard when this was happening to them,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cAnd I want their words to be permanent and forever for people to know directly what the moms felt.\u201d\n\nThe film brought this dark chapter back into public memory and served as a fundamental source of research and connection to the mothers for Huynh\u2019s installation. According to the artist, when read together, direct quotes from the film function as a contemplative poem: \u201cYo por dentro siento mucha tristeza.\u201d (I feel a lot of sadness inside.) \u201cSe me acab\u00f3 la canci\u00f3n.\u201d (My song is finished.) \u201cIf you speak English, they treat you one way. If you don\u2019t speak English, they treat you another way.\u201d\n\nTo create \u201cSobrevivir,\u201d Huynh adopted a community-informed artistic approach that allowed local residents and activists to provide feedback during the design process. To facilitate this involvement, Huynh held virtual sewing gatherings with Mujeres de Ma\u00edz, the East Los Angeles Women\u2019s Center, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Comisi\u00f3n Femenil and the East Los Angeles Stitchers, among other organizations, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a sewing circle, where women got together to share very deep personal [reproductive justice] stories,\u201d said Huynh. Collectively, participants designed 60 hand-stitched squares that showcase a variety of reproductive justice-inspired messages. Huynh then stitched the blocks together to form four community quilts that will complement the hospital\u2019s main art installation.\n\nBefore the quilts are permanently displayed at the hospital, they are being exhibited at the Vincent Price Art Museum at East Los Angeles Community College through Feb. 18, 2023. In coordination with reproductive justice activists, the exhibition will also feature programming \u201cto examine this traumatic history and its repercussions in communities of color today.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cSobrevivir\u201d and the history it represents is now publicly accessible, its creation can largely be traced back to the positive public reception of \u201cNo M\u00e1s Beb\u00e9s,\u201d which prompted Los Angeles County officials to issue a public apology. According to Espino, who also served on the committee that selected Huynh\u2019s project, the forced sterilizations became the subject of multiple front-page features in the \u201870s. Yet, as time transpired, even in seminal books focused on documenting the Chicana and Chicano experience, \u201cthis history took up maybe a sentence,\u201d Espino said.\n\n\u201cNo M\u00e1s Beb\u00e9s\u201d changed this by centering interviews with the mothers, doctors, historians and the civil rights leaders behind the 1975 class-action lawsuit, Madrigal v. Quilligan, which finally challenged the coercive practices.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to make this history something that people would recognize in the same way that they recognize other civil rights struggles like Brown v. Board of Education, or Mendez v. Westminster,\u201d Espino said.\n\nThe film outlines how the federal government began incentivizing public health facilities to advance population control programs guised as family planning initiatives that disproportionately targeted brown and Black women across the nation. At the same time, eugenics laws aimed at reducing \u201cundesirable\u201d populations were also underway in 31 states across the country.\n\nUsing the logic similar to that applied to Roe v. Wade, the attorneys representing the 10 plaintiffs in Madrigal v. Quilligan argued that the women were entitled to the right to procreate, just like they also had the right to abort. Ultimately, a federal judge ruled against the women and held that the sterilizations were the result of miscommunication.\n\nDespite this, the women\u2019s efforts did not go in vain. The landmark case led to widespread public support of the mothers, an end to statewide sterilization laws, changes in sterilization practices and bilingual information surrounding the procedure and its consequences.\n\nHuynh acknowledges that \u201cSobrevivir\u201d will never rectify the harmful practices, but she commends the hospital for being the first public institution in the nation to express remorse.\n\n\u201cI think [apologizing] is really important in a country that has really bad karma, that has had centuries of harm from settler colonialism, genocide [and] racism,\u201d she said.\n\nEspino also hopes that the public installation draws attention to the activist spirit of the mothers. She believes the women were agents of change and, in many ways, advanced the way we understand reproductive justice today, a theme that played a central theme in her film.\n\n\u201c[The mothers] were saying, I don\u2019t want this to happen to anybody else,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir actions articulated this reproductive justice ideology, before we had that framework to make sense of it.\u201d\n\nBoth Huynh and Espino share the feeling that \u201cSobrevivir\u201d will serve not only as an apology, but that the sculpture\u2019s permanence represents a sense of reproductive security for future generations of women.\n\n\u201cFor me, the monument is this acknowledgment that this is the true history,\u201d Espino said. \u201cThis is saying we acknowledge something horrible that happened here. And we\u2019re going to do what we can to ensure that it never happens again.\u201d\n\nLearn more about \u201cSobrevivir\u201d at the Vincent Price Museum exhibit here.

The six films featured were \u201cMy First Native American Boyfriend,\u201d directed by Joey Clift; \u201cYour Name Isn\u2019t English,\u201d directed by Tazbah Rose Chavez; \u201cDogwood,\u201d directed by Maya Rose Dittloff; \u201cIn Our Own Hands,\u201d directed by Jennifer Varenchik; \u201cOChiSkwaCho,\u201d directed by Jules Koostachin; and \u201cTwoBears,\u201d directed by Anthony Florez and produced by USC alumna, Annika Dawson.\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media, Clift, a comedian and writer for Netflix as well as an enrolled Cowlitz Indian Tribal Member, explained the significance of the showcase for Indigenous filmmakers and audience members alike. \u201cThe lack of Native American representation in film can have a lasting impact on Native American youth,\u201d Clift said. Despite his passion for comedy growing up, Clift didn\u2019t believe that there was a place for him in the field until his college years. \u201cI really love comedy, but... I didn\u2019t see any Native comedians on TV,\u201d Clift said. \u201cMy professors fortunately in college gave me the very normal advice of, \u2018Hey, you know, you can just work in comedy, right?,\u2019 which was a very big shock to me in 2009 when I graduated.\u201d\n\nSome projects highlighted in the festival directly captured the alienation Native Americans feel in contemporary society, including Clift\u2019s film that was inspired by his own dating experience outside of the Indigenous community. Chavez\u2019s \u201cYour Name Isn\u2019t English\u201d was also born from personal experience, demonstrating the uncomfortable conversations sparked by strangers regarding her first name, Tazbah.\n\nThe Hollywood Diversity Report from 2021 reported that Native representation in film is less than 1%. New evidence from 2020 suggests that America\u2019s increasingly diverse audiences prefer diverse film content, UCLA\u2019s Diversity Report found. \u201cObviously, as a Native people, [we] aren\u2019t really represented well in this colonized world and westernized society,\u201d Amia Roach-Valandra, USC sophomore and secretary of the Native American Student Assembly said. \u201cFor native folks that don\u2019t see [representation] very often, having stories that they can relate to is important, especially for uplifting native youth and future generations.\u201d\n\nThe panel of Native American film industry members shared advice on how non-Indigenous filmmakers can uplift native voices. Clift recommended including Native individuals in key decision making positions for movies with an Indigenous subject matter. Chavez emphasized the importance of co-writing with someone from the specific tribe that is relevant in the production. Dittloff recommended that directors interested in Native topics familiarize themselves with the decision making process of Tribal Councils and their subcommittees. \u201cPart of my approach [consulting a Salish tribe] was me going to their cultural committee, which is a subcommittee of their tribe,\u201d Ditloff said. \u201cThey only meet every three months, so knowing that the pace and the way things function and the way things get done is also vastly different... is so helpful.\u201d\n\nClift hopes students gain a better insight into the world of Native cinema by expanding their perspective and understanding of independent short films. \u201cI hope that it opens [students\u2019] eyes to a world of Native cinema and Native storytelling and filmmakers that are doing great work that they might not necessarily know about,\u201d Clift said. \u201c[I hope] students come to us and just watch a bunch of dope short films through a bunch of cool filmmakers.\u201d\n\nFor more Indigenous resources and information, visit the official Instagram of the USC Native American Student Assembly.\n```"}

Nury Martinez resigned as president of the L.A. City Council on Monday, and announced a leave of absence from the council on Tuesday. Ron Herrera stepped down from his role as a top labor leader. The tape \u2014involving Martinez as well as council members Kevin de Le\u00f3n and Gil Cedillo\u2014 received national attention. Most recently, President Biden even called for the council members\u2019 resignations.\n\nLocally, dozens of protesters gathered outside the city council meeting on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt really could go either way. And that\u2019s a hard part because there is such corruption in city hall,\u201d said Adam Linder, a protester outside of the council meeting about the upcoming midterm elections. \u201cProgressive movements are coming together and fighting against this hateful rhetoric. I would like to hope that shining a light on it would bring people towards a positive movement, as opposed to moving backward and voting for someone like Caruso.\u201d\n\nProtesters screamed chants such as, \u201cI\u2019m with the Blacks,\u201d and demanded resignation from all council members included in the tapes. With the local election only weeks away, this publicity could garner momentum for mayoral candidates Karen Bass and Rick Caruso as they make their final push for the seat. Bass was endorsed by Martinez in August, but has already released a statement condemning the council member\u2019s racist comments. However, Bass\u2019s connection to Martinez received criticism in a statement released by candidate Rick Caruso.\n\n\u201cThe entire situation shows that city hall is fundamentally broken and dysfunctional,\u201d Caruso said in the statement. \u201cMost of the people involved in this ugly episode have endorsed Karen Bass ... I hope she\u2019ll do the right thing and demand for their accountability and renounce the endorsement of those who used hate speech.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to discussions of the mayoral candidates, opinions among protestors varied. \u201cBecause of this institutional racism, it illustrates the need to find a candidate that is above that and is ethical,\u201d said protester Erik Laykin. \u201cHopefully, [it is] somebody who is not in it for the power and the money or the prestige, but is in it for the right reasons.\u201d\n\nSome protestors discussed the hope for greater voter turnout. \u201cThis is ridiculous. I think that these three individuals got really comfortable,\u201d said Haydee Burrola, one of the protestors. \u201cI think that hopefully, it will bring more youth out to the polls to vote, but also it\u2019s going to mobilize everybody to hold our leaders accountable.\u201d\n\nUltimately, sentiment following the tapes emphasized that it\u2019s up to the voters to decide the outcome of the elections. \u201cRick Caruso has been portraying himself as the outsider who can clean up corrupt L.A. city governments,\u201d said Kamy Akhavan, the executive director of USC\u2019s Center of the Political Future. \u201cKaren Bass has portrayed herself as a bridge builder...she could also be well positioned to benefit from these scandals.

Under your eyes, three houses are burned to the ground. Residents who have seen the unhoused crisis grow over the years said they suspect unhoused people are responsible for the fire, but authorities are still investigating the origin of the blaze.\n\nThe Venice Canals are located across from South Venice Boulevard, home to encampments of unhoused people. Residents explained that a lot of unhoused people go through the garbage and walk on construction sites at night. This particular neighborhood is a testament to the sensitivities of the unhoused issue as two candidates, Erin Darling and Traci Park, vie to represent the area on the Los Angeles City Council starting Nov. 8.\n\nPark and Darling\u2019s teams did not respond to interview requests. Still, policies related to the unhoused are prominent on their websites. Encampments have been a big issue in the city for years. The two candidates, Darling and Park \u2014 both lawyers \u2014 have different views on it.\n\nDarling was born and raised in Venice. He opposed an L.A. city ordinance that would allow council members to design public spaces as off-limits for encampments. Darling doesn\u2019t support the dismantling of encampments without creating affordable housing. Access to affordable housing is one of the most prominent issues in the Venice district. Venice is now one of the most expensive neighborhoods in L.A., with rent for a 1-bedroom apartment averaging at $3,360 according to Zumper.\n\n\u201cShelters are only a temporary solution,\u201d said Erika Hartman, chief executive officer of Safe Place Youth. \u201cWe need long-term solutions, which means focusing on building affordable housing in the district.\u201d Safe Place for Youth houses 182 young people experiencing homelessness each night and tries to get them back on their feet through a progressing engagement process involving access to food, activities, therapy and more.\n\n\u201cMany [young unhoused people] are discouraged, because they know the shelter won\u2019t house them forever and the money they make will never be enough,\u201d Hartman said.\n\nDarling has already supported multiple proposals involving new housing construction. One of them, the Reese Davidson Community project, would include \u2013 if approved by California Coastal Commission \u2013 140 units for low-income and unhoused people on Venice Boulevard. In addition, Darling also hopes to pass the United to House L.A. ballot initiative. This initiative would fund 26,000 housing units for those experiencing homelessness in the city of L.A.\n\nOn the other hand, Park wished to use the anti-camping ordinance to block unhoused people from moving and living in public spaces. She also supported the L.A. City Council in banning camping near daycares and schools. One of her goals is to rid public spaces of unhoused encampments to give them back to the housed residents.\n\nOn the question of housing, Park suggests using resources already available: collaborative living, shared housing, affordable suites and using available infrastructure for emergency and temporary shelter. There is no specific project mentioned on Park\u2019s website.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, 981 people are registered as unhoused in the Venice district, with 259 of them sheltered.

Metro\u2019s new line is part of a larger plan to help increase public transportation throughout Los Angeles.\n\nThe K Line of the L.A. Metro opened on Oct. 7, 2022. (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nBy Devon Lee and Bryan A'Hearn\nOctober 11, 2022 at 6:23 pm PDT\n\nLos Angeles Metro opened a new $2.1 billion dollar metro line in South Los Angeles on October 7 with eight stations: Expo/Crenshaw, Martin Luther King Jr., Leimert Park, Hyde Park, Fairview Heights, Downtown Inglewood, Westchester/Veterans and Aviation/Century. Previously the line was known as the Crenshaw/LAX line, the K Line extends from the E line at Expo/Crenshaw Station and merges with the C Line at Aviation/LAX Station to connect the Crenshaw Corridor, Inglewood and El Segundo. It is the largest investment in public transportation in South Los Angeles in 20 years.\n\nConstruction for the project began in 2014 with plans to finish in 2019. These eventually got pushed back due to various roadblocks like a liquidated damages lawsuit and cost overruns. The original impetus for the K line was to spur economic growth and opportunity in a region that a new metro line could benefit. Hopes of new job opportunities and economic activity were met with fears of gentrification. The results have yet to play out, though, as L.A. Metro remains optimistic in its investment.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping and expect they will see more financial investment because you now have more access to it,\u201d said Patrick Chandler, L.A. Metro communications manager. \u201cPeople have an easier way to get to and from work or school or whatever they\u2019re going without having to drive throughout Los Angeles so they\u2019re making congestion [better].\u201d\n\nNew riders have reacted positively to the new metro line. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it, it saves me getting the kids in the car and keep[ing] them entertained,\u201d said L.A. resident David Bolour. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer to not be in traffic and it connects to the expo line so we can go to the beach or downtown. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nOverall, the new line helps locals in the community commute more efficiently and at a lower cost. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the positive impact,\u201d said street team worker Stephanie Leticia. \u201cIt\u2019s helping people get all the way from scratch, all the way to their homes instead of having to jump on the bus and pay for it. We\u2019ve been seeing the biggest impact on the older folks that live on these stops.\u201d\n\nThe K Line is slated to be fully completed in 2024 when the Airport Metro Connector and people mover projects are finished. This would provide direct transportation to LAX, a service that could greatly help travelers as an estimated 200,000 people move through the airport daily, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nLooking ahead, L.A. Metro has plans currently undergoing the environmental study phase that, if passed, would extend the K Line northward. \u201cThere\u2019s what we call the Crenshaw Northern extension which will eventually [exist] in maybe the next 20 years, if not sooner,\u201d Chandler said. \u201c[It] will extend the K Line farther north and connect to the Purple Line or D Line and then to the Red or B Line and have a potential terminus at the Hollywood Bowl.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the K Line, visit the Metro website.\n```"}

As one of the first radio DJs to play Black music in California, Laboe played a pivotal part in introducing his audience to a new style of music. Mia Thompson has more on his passing and his legacy. Art Laboe, the man who brought rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and r&b to Southern California and coined the term, \u2018Oldies but goodies,\u2019 passed away October 7th at the age of 97. An esteemed radio host throughout the mid 20th century, Laboe has spent the past several decades airing song dedications and advocating for diversity in national radio.\n\nLABOE: \u201cI was a radio engineer when I started. I had a first class radio, telephone and telegraph license, amateur radio all when I was 18. I\u2019ve been on the radio since 1943 and I believe that tallies up to about 71 years.\u201d\n\nLaboe was a pioneer in the field. He was the first radio host to connect directly with his audience through on-air song dedications, which revolutionized radio and left a lasting legacy. Annenberg professor of professional practice and director for the specialized journalism masters in the arts, Oscar Garza, believes that Laboe was an influential force in the industry.\n\nGARZA: \u201cHe tended to dig deep and finding not obscure but lesser known songs, oftentimes by by artists. Definitely the space that he carved out in Los Angeles radio for decades and decades is singular. No one did anything like him. I\u2019m not sure that anybody will.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career and especially during the 1950s and 60s, Laboe fought against racial discrimination against Black and Latino Americans in the radio industry and brought rock and roll and r&b to the West Coast.\n\nGARZA: \u201cThink probably before it was as widespread in journalism circles. He was pointing out the diversity of this of this city. You couldn\u2019t listen to his show and not be aware of that.\u201d\n\nHe was one of the first and only members of the press to interview Elvis Presley, but acknowledged the influence of blues.\n\nLABOE: \u201cSometimes people dig up a song or record that goes way back, you know, Willie Mae Thornton or something like that, and I\u2019ll play the original \u201cHound Dog.\u201d When Elvis came out with \u201cHound Dog,\u201d most people didn\u2019t know that Willie Mae Thornton did the original \u201cHound Dog.\u201d As you know, most rock and roll in the beginning were done by Black artists.\n\nGarza believes that one of Laboe\u2019s talents was how he could understand and gage the interests of the Southern California community and the impact he had on his work in journalism.\n\nGARZA: \u201cI grew up in Texas and after I moved here learning my way around town, learning who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what, you know. Very quickly, Art Laboe came into my consciousness, and just because of his presence here and it was. It was just somebody who was so dedicated to keeping this music alive and keeping it vital and understanding really on his part what it meant to people. He\u2019d been doing it for so long that he had an insight that no one else had into, you know, the connection that people had to this music going back to the fifties and sixties when he was starting out.\u201d\n\nLaboe \u201cdied peacefully in his home\u201d in Palm Springs, California after a case of pneumonia according to Laboe\u2019s family via Facebook.

Williams is doing a great job of making sure that all the wide receivers are engaged...Defense has also been decent. I think our defensive line has been a lot better than last year. There\u2019s still some improvement... But compared to last year, everything\u2019s in a positive direction. And we\u2019re still a highly ranked team right now.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nBy Jeremy Kole October 11, 2022 at 4:59 pm PDT\n\nThe NFL and head injuries have a storied, shameful history \u2014 the latest chapter in the problematic book being the concussion of Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. During Week 3 of the NFL season, Tagovailoa exhibited symptoms of ataxia, or an abnormality of motor coordination caused by a neurological issue, after being tackled and hitting the back of his head. Upon getting up, Tagovailoa grabbed his helmet, shook his head and fell after he took a few steps. An independent neurologist diagnosed Tagovailoa with a back injury and he was allowed back into the game. Four days later, in Week 4, the Dolphins quarterback endured a far more severe injury against the Cincinnati Bengals. Tagovailoa was violently slammed into the turf and hit the back of his head again \u2014 this time, the trauma induced a fencing posture.\n\nSince the incidents, both the NFL and NFLPA have agreed that the situation was not handled correctly. Tagovailoa shouldn\u2019t have returned in Week 3, nor started the next game. In a joint statement on Saturday, the NFL and NFLPA changed the official concussion protocol following the controversial head injury circumstances with Tagovailoa. Specifically, they added ataxia to the mandatory \u201cno-go\u201d symptom list that determines whether or not a player re-enters a game.\n\n\u201cWhat I find very confusing about it is why was ataxia or some sort of descriptor of that was never added in the first place,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Sum, a professor of clinical physical therapy at USC. In an interview, Sum said he was happy to see improved concussion protocol policies but isn\u2019t fully satisfied. Specifically, he wants more no-go criteria on the symptom list and additional spotters watching for potential injuries in the booth. However, Sum sees ongoing problems with diagnosing concussions, pointing out, \u201cif they\u2019re not exhibiting symptoms, there\u2019s really no way for us to see if that person did have head trauma.\u201d\n\nThis uncertainty has been a focal point of debate long before the recent Tagovailoa situation. One example of the longstanding mistreatment was when the NFL failed to include concussions to quarterbacks Troy Aikman and Steve Young, who were both forced to retire due to repeated trauma, in a 1990s study. Still, the NFL and NFLPA are taking more action than in the past by adding ataxia to the no-go symptom list. NFL Chief Medical Officer Dr. Allen Sills commented on the addition of ataxia, recognizing a potential pitfall that some players who do not have concussions might get pulled out of games; yet, it\u2019s a tradeoff the NFL and NFLPA accept.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather hold someone out that doesn\u2019t have a brain injury than put someone out there that does have a concussion, and we weren\u2019t able to diagnose it,\u201d Sills said.\n\nIronically, the backup Dolphins quarterback, Teddy Bridgewater, was the first player removed from a game under the new concussion policy. Bridgewater has an unfortunate history of injuries over his career, including three previous concussions. After his first play, the official spotter saw Bridgewater \u201cstumble\u201d following a big tackle and removed him. This decision prompted heavy criticism from fans, but for Bridgewater and his frightening injury history, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\n\nAlong the same lines as the Bridgewater decision, the NFL endured a few controversial, game-altering \u201croughing the passer\u201d penalties in Week 5. It\u2019s clear that the NFL has taken a firm stance on protecting quarterbacks, but many are questioning their judgment. Fox Sports broadcaster Skip Bayless weighed in on the debate, examining the hypocrisy behind criticizing roughing the passer penalties while also grilling the NFL on quarterback safety.\n\n\u201cYou hypocrites out there cannot express RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION over Tua, then be equally outraged over Brady getting the call after being slung down (just like Tua was at Cincy). TUA CHANGED EVERYTHING. CAN\u2019T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS NOW,\u201d Bayless wrote in a tweet Monday.\n\nGoing forward, every potential concussion and roughing the passer penalty will be analyzed more than ever \u2014 the NFL is under a microscope. The situation with Tagovailoa sparked meaningful change, as now more than ever, player safety is at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nOctober 11, 2022 at 4:48 pm PDT\n\nName, image and likeness: an athlete\u2019s ability to make money off their brand. How does it affect USC student-athletes? You know the saying, \u201cmoney makes the world go round?\u201d It applies to the college football landscape now more than ever. Ever since the introduction of NIL into college sports, more and more athletes have been using it to finally legally make money from their athletic involvement. However, recruiting and the newly popular transfer portal have unearthed an even greater market for players to earn profits and also prompted a new type of NIL.\n\nNIL deals from boosters are heavily talked about, as they are very controversial. An NIL deal from a booster is pretty close to paying players to play for their team. One of the biggest NIL booster deals to date is the case of Nico Iamaleava. Iamaleava is a five-star quarterback in the high school class of 2023. When he committed to Tennessee back in April, it was reported shortly after that Iamaleava had a $8 million NIL deal with the school. Eight million dollars for a guy who still has yet to set foot on a college campus? Seems pretty ridiculous to me.\n\nWhen deciding where to play, part of what factors in is how much money can be made from NIL deals at each school. Iamaleava is from Downey, California, but if he is promised $8 million to play for an SEC team, you bet he\u2019s going to head south to Knoxville.\n\nIn a joint message to UCLA fans and students, Chancellor Gene Block and athletic director Martin Jarmond said it best, \u201cBig Ten membership offers Bruins exciting new competitive opportunities and a broader national media platform for our student-athletes to compete and showcase their talents. Specifically, this move will enhance Name, Image and Likeness opportunities through greater exposure for our student-athletes and offer new partnerships with entities across the country.\u201d That message, just intended for UCLA, is even more applicable to USC as one can argue USC has a larger fanbase with more dedicated boosters.\n\nBy moving to the Big Ten, programs such as USC and UCLA will be able to attract better high school and transfer recruits within a bigger market. With the Los Angeles market and a larger, more passionate audience in the Midwest, the sky\u2019s the limit when it comes to future NIL deals for players.\n\nAlready, the new-look Trojans have begun taking advantage of NIL and reapings its benefits. On August 31, Fletcher Jones Motorcars from Newport Beach signed a deal with USC junior wide receiver Jordan Addison and junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu. This landed both players brand new Mercedes vehicles. And of course, Addison has a deal with United Airlines, promoting United\u2019s attempt to connect Pac-12 fans to more East Coast teams.\n\nTo me, moving to the Big Ten will go down in history as the best move of all time for the USC football program. From a player\u2019s standpoint of wanting to maximize NIL deals, there are almost no downsides. In the underrepresented Pac-12, players do not get the exposure they would with other conferences. Sports such as volleyball, which are crammed onto the Pac-12 Network, would be broadcasted to larger national networks, thus boosting exposure. There are no negatives in my eyes.\n\nThe only shady thing about NIL is when it comes to boosters who incentivize players to come play for their school, but the NCAA is working on preventing that the best they can by prohibiting boosters from being involved in recruiting.\n\nWith the combination of being in Los Angeles and now in the Big Ten, gone are the days of USC losing athletes from its own backyard to the Tennessees or the Alabamas of college football. In the new world of NIL, players are demanding more and more from their schools, wanting the opportunity to make money from the sport they love at a non-professional level.

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Sam Bitman, MJ Newsom, and Steven Tran\nOctober 11, 2022 at 4:34 pm PDT\n\nUSC Pharmacies will supply both the COVID-19 bivalent booster and the flu vaccine to USC students, faculty and staff at Engemann Student Health Center from October 10 to 21 as part of their \u201cVaxchella\u201d event. This walk-in clinic will be held on the first floor weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Students receiving vaccines at Vaxchella must be currently enrolled in the USC Health Insurance Plan and must be available to receive both the COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine at once.\n\nVaxchella coincides with the emergence of new variants that have caused a rise in cases, hospitalizations and deaths, said USC Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman. From September 25 through October 1, 660 COVID tests were administered, resulting in 25 new positive cases in students and two in staff. Currently, 5% of students tested for COVID-19 are positive, with 67 students in isolation. Alongside COVID-19, around two to three influenza cases are reported per week. According to Van Orman, it\u2019s uncommon to see influenza cases this early.\n\nVaxchella aims to offer a quick and easy way for students, faculty and staff to get these vaccinations in order to combat a spike in case numbers and ensure people are safe on and around campus. \u201cA lot of healthy people get their flu shot, whether that\u2019s in student health or everywhere else. It\u2019s really about communicating and the importance of it providing a whole range of opportunities for people to be vaccinated,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done that historically, and this is just another opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nWhile the flu vaccine can easily be administered at any type of location from an off-campus pharmacy to a farmer\u2019s market, Van Orman said that the COVID booster is a bit more complicated to administer. Therefore, a special event like Vaxchella creates an opportunity for both vaccines to be easily administered at the same time on campus.\n\nSarah Wager, a graduate student studying double bass-performance, recently received both vaccines at Vaxchella. \u201cThe fact that they have the option for people so that they don\u2019t have to go out of their way since public transit is so difficult in L.A. was probably a good thing,\u201d Wager said.\n\nCharlie Korman, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, is another student who received vaccinations at Vaxchella. \u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Korman said. \u201cI think everybody should get vaccinated. I don\u2019t want to get sick. And if everybody gets vaccinated, then hopefully we won\u2019t get sick.\u201d\n\nVan Orman said the university hopes to administer between one to two thousand flu shots by the end of Vaxchella\u2019s two-week run. \u201cWe still have a really strong requirement for students to have their primary series, and we still strongly recommend everybody is up to date on their boosters,\u201d Van Orman said.\n\nAside from Vaxchella, other walk-in vaccination sites will be held at the USC Village Plaza on Tuesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., McCarthy Quad Farmer\u2019s Market on Wednesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Pappas Quad on the Health Science Campus on Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Additionally, vaccination appointments can be scheduled at the Student Union Pharmacy, Medical Plaza Pharmacy at HSC and Verdugo Hills Professional Pharmacy.\n```"}

City Council after a racist-fueled audio recording from October 2021 was released on Sunday. As president of Los Angeles Council District 6, Martinez was responsible for overseeing legislation, budgeting and business operations of North Hills, Panorama City and the surrounding area. Despite her resignation, Martinez currently still remains a member of the city council.\n\n\u201cWhat was caught on tape was a shock to anyone in Los Angeles,\u201d said Kamy Akhavan, the executive director of USC\u2019s Center of the Political Future. \u201cWhat we saw was people resorting to the lowest common denominator \u2013 using the language of hate, division and cynicism in a way that does not represent what Angelenos or anyone in this country wants.\u201d\n\nMartinez stepped down from her position Monday after receiving widespread backlash from the leaked audio clip. Recorded councilmembers Martinez, Kevin de Le\u00f3n and Gil Cedillo discussed redistricting and made offensive comments about councilmember Mike Bonin\u2019s Black son.\n\n\u201cI was completely disgusted about the remarks,\u201d said Anna Ellazar, a freshman majoring in environmental studies. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad to see that the people who are supposed to be representing a place as diverse as L.A. are actually racist.\u201d\n\nLeaders at Southside Bethel Baptist Church hosted a community gathering Monday to call for Nury Martinez\u2019s resignation. The gathering quickly became a space for people to speak openly about what occurred.\n\n\u201cI think that what it demonstrates is that anti-Blackness and white supremacy is pervasive in our community,\u201d said Matthew Lyskwa, who attended the community gathering in South L.A. \u201cEven community members that appear to be for racial progress aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMichael Lawson, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Urban League, was one of the leaders present at the gathering. He admired the ability of the community to come together so quickly, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done, but this has to happen now.\u201d\n\nThe president of the Baptist Ministers Conference, Reverend K.W. Tulloss, saw Martinez\u2019s resignation as a point of celebration. \u201cWhat she did was horrible. What she said was horrible. What was said in that meeting was horrible.\u201d\n\nAfter announcing her resignation, Martinez released a statement in which she said she took full responsibility for her offensive remarks. Not everyone deemed it enough.\n\n\u201cNury Martinez may have issued an apology, but she will continue to have intense pressure on her to step down from her role on the council,\u201d Akhavan said. \u201cThere are 15 council members \u2013 the council can function with one fewer person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the right call to make, but we need the other two out of there as well,\u201d said Mateo Sabio Paese, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. \u201cHopefully some change can be made so we have better people in office.\u201d\n\nDe Le\u00f3n and Cedillo have yet to step down from their positions despite L.A. leaders urging for their resignation.\n\n\u201cIt was really shocking to read about these racist remarks... especially coming from a person that identifies as a Latina,\u201d said Miguel Hijar-Chiapa, a political science and international relations PhD student. \u201cI think that public servants should [hold] themselves to higher standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a matter of personal and hateful attacks on character and on children, which was really uncalled for,\u201d Akhavan said. \u201cI think that is why most Angelenos are outraged.\u201d\n```"}

Immensely influential groups like Twice, BLACKPINK, BTS, and even solo artists like Jackson Wang, IU, and Jessi have been shedding cultural borders and language barriers alluring to an international community of fans. But did you know that Latino fans play a major role in its domination? In 2021,  K-PopTwitter  posted an image showcasing the countries tweeting the most about K-Pop with Mexico and Brazil in the top 10 and Peru, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador in the top 20.

Particularly in Mexico the Korean government promotes its culture through the Korean Cultural Center in Mexico. The website of the Korean Culture and Information Service (KOCIS), previously published an article about the  2018 Friendly Cultures Fair,  \u201cheld from April 14 to 29 in the Z\u00f3calo, recognized today as a major multi-cultural festival of Mexico City, attracted more than 3.5 million people. On the opening day, the Korean Cultural Center in Mexico set up a booth featuring various activities such as Korean calligraphy, hanbok dress-up and photo-taking, and K-pop dancing. The K-pop Dance Experience in Mexico Program presented K-pop fans with the opportunity to follow dance moves of their favorite songs. The Korean Cultural Center in Mexico had been visiting remote areas in touring caravans to promote Korean culture throughout the country. The third Korea Festival was set in Chiapas and business forums for Korean investors were held to promote direct investments in Monterrey and other lesser-known cities.\u201d\n\n \u201c The growing trend  in Latine and K-pop collaborations is an additional factor of K-pop\u2019s emerging success in Latin America, with fans embracing each collaboration between the artists or creating potential collaboration predictions of their own.\u201d Lucia Ruan a Journalism MS graduate student at USC Annenberg, noted the following   K-Pop/Latin collaborations \u201cChicken Noodle Soup\u201d - J-hope and Becky G \u201cLullaby (Spanish ver.)\u201d - GOT7 \u201cIce Cream\u201d - BLACKPINK and Selena Gomez \u201cSG\u201d- featuring Ozuna, Megan Thee Stallion and Lisa from BLACKPINK\n\nThe K-Pop fanbase is electric and overpowering.

{"key": "/2022/10/11/akashi-kama-bridges-the-disconnect-between-asian-and-american/", "response": "```\nAkashi-Kama bridges the disconnect between Asian and American\n\nAlec Nakashima always had a passion for fashion. Growing up, he, his brother, Davis, and his cousins printed their own T-shirts and had liked creating their own clothes. So it makes perfect sense that years later, Nakashima would create Akashi-Kama, a streetwear brand with designs clearly influenced by the Japanese aesthetic and blends his love for fashion with his Japanese background.\n\n\u201cI wanted something, like a physical thing or representation, of traditional aesthetic with modern, something we could wear day to day; taking cues from things that I saw in my grandparents\u2019 closets growing up, but that would fit someone who grew up wearing Jordans,\u201d Nakashima said.\n\nNakashima pinpoints the origins of Akashi-Kama to the homeland itself, having found inspiration while on a trip to Japan in 2018 with the Kakehashi Program. The program, coordinated by the Japanese American Citizens League and the Japan International Cooperation Center, sends young Japanese Americans on all-expense paid trips to Japan to foster relations between Japan and the United States through \u201cmutual trust and understanding\u201d and to \u201cpromote a global understanding\u201d of Japanese society and history, according to the program\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cI felt this when we went to Kakehashi, that I wasn\u2019t \u2018Japanese Japanese.\u2019 It very much still feels like you\u2019re in a foreign country, but yet, there are certain things that feel familiar,\u201d Nakashima said. \u201c[The trip] kind of pulls up random spots that you have, and it brings them closer together, which I think is really cool.\u201d\n\nThe trip was Nakashima\u2019s first time traveling to Japan, which he said contributed to the gravity of its impact on his perspective of culture and identity.\n\n\u201cI think it was a really strong one-two punch in terms of cultural impact for me,\u201d Nakashima said. \u201cI had been thinking, before the trip, about Japanese American identity and feeling kind of between two worlds growing up ... \u2018Am I fully Japanese? Am I fully American?,\u2019 and not really understanding that I can be both.\u201d\n\nIt is this duality, Nakashima said, that is \u201creally the inspiration\u201d behind what would eventually manifest itself in Akashi-Kama.\n\nOfficially launched in 2019, Akashi-Kama creates \u201cModern products designed and influenced by \u65e5\u7cfb\u4eba,\u201d or nikkeijin, a Japanese word that refers to people who are Japanese by ethnicity that have emigrated to other countries. It\u2019s a fitting word to describe the experience of many Asian Americans, who grow up with the challenge of distinguishing two separate cultures within themselves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain imposter syndrome sometimes being Asian American. It\u2019s like, \u2018Am I really Asian enough? I know so many Asians who are more Asian than me,\u2019\u201d Nakashima said. \u201cMy hope is that our brand can kind of be something that is subtle, but still authentic in my experience as an American.\u201d\n\nThe brand, which operates solely as an online retailer, has accumulated over 15,000 Instagram followers and ships their products internationally. Their Spring 22 collection, released March 11, sold out of multiple pieces within two weeks, and their Fall/Winter 2022 collection, which dropped Sept. 22, looks to follow a similar trend.\n\nAkashi-Kama sells typical streetwear items like T-shirts, hoodies and sweaters, but prides itself on its \u201chero piece:\u201d the Noragi jacket. Inspired by noragi, a type of historical Japanese workwear for field laborers, Akashi-Kama\u2019s rendition consists of a unisex-style jacket in traditional Japanese colors, with tapered sleeves reminiscent of a modern American blazer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re blending a traditional Japanese piece with a little more modern twist,\u201d said Nakashima\u2019s brother, Davis, who contributes to the brand on the side of his regular job through modeling and creative design. \u201cBeing able to represent Japanese Americans and the complexity or identity of that into clothing has been so empowering.\u201d\n\nThe Noragi jacket has put Akashi-Kama on the map, earning accolades from GQ and Valet Mag, but for Nakashima, the most meaningful feedback he\u2019s received is that from the community in which the jacket was inspired by.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten emails that are like, just a Japanese American person out in Illinois or something, who is like, \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t even know I wanted this. This means a lot to me,\u2019\u201d Nakashima said. \u201cThat, to me, is as much validation as any publication, because that\u2019s the perspective that I was designing it with.\u201d\n\nYet, Akashi-Kama is in no way a company exclusively for Japanese American consumers. Their vision, as stated on their website, is \u201cInspired by Japanese-Americans. Created for Everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just love that our brand can hopefully mean the same to someone who\u2019s Japanese American or Asian American and not. That\u2019s the end goal, that our brand is [bridging] that gap.\u201d Nakashima said. \u201cCan I really wear something like this, or can I really come off as this, or do I deserve this? And the answer is yes.\u201d```"}

Here\u2019s the best of Saturday\u2019s slate.\n\nUCLA is back, baby\nI had no faith the Bruins would beat then-No. 15 Washington. I was wrong. I had my doubts about UCLA taking down then-No. 11 Utah. I was wrong. The Bruins are 6-0 and looking good. UCLA took down the Utes 42-32. Senior running back Zach Charbonnet bulldozed Utah on the ground with 198 rushing yards and a touchdown. Redshirt senior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw for four touchdowns, passing Bruin legend Brett Hundley for the most touchdowns in UCLA history.\n\nAgainst Washington September 30, Thompson-Robinson was equally as impressive. Thompson-Robinson obliterated the Husky defense with 315 passing yards, three total touchdowns and 53 rushing yards. He even made two Husky defenders ram into each other and hurdled another. Phenomenal stuff. UCLA\u2019s offense is scary good. Thompson-Robinson should be square at the top of the Heisman race for how he\u2019s playing this season. If he isn\u2019t in the mix, I have my doubts about whether the voters are actually watching the games. And if UCLA wins its next game against No. 12 Oregon, the Bruins have a clear path to the Pac-12 title game regardless of whether they beat USC. Things are really looking up in Westwood.\n\nThere\u2019s something brewing in Champaign, Ill.\nThe Fighting Illini are unranked no longer. For the first time since 2011, Illinois checked into the AP poll. After the Illini\u2019s 9-6 victory over Iowa, 5-1 Illinois is now the No. 24 team in the country. You heard that right. Illinois won 9-6. You might be wondering how an offense-less game like that would result in either team entering the rankings. Well, the win was more impressive than you\u2019d think.\n\nSenior quarterback Tommy DeVito went down with an ankle injury in the first quarter of the game. DeVito had been torching up defenses this season, but his replacement, junior quarterback Artur Sitkowski, threw a red-zone interception and, save for one 34-yard completion, averaged just over three yards per completion. Somehow Illinois won with that performance, and the reason was one man. Chase Brown. The junior running back rushed for 146 yards, and the team posted 200 rushing yards in total. Iowa had allowed an average of 82.8 rushing yards per game through the Hawkeyes\u2019 first five games. Brown has crossed the 100-yard mark in each of the team\u2019s first six games. The win was impressive. The team was impressive. And, hey, let the Illini faithful celebrate after their first win over Iowa since 2008. They deserve it.\n\nWith only one ranked team left on its schedule and DeVito\u2019s injury being described by head coach Bret Bielema as not season-ending, Illinois and its fans might have a whole lot more to celebrate this season.\n\nOklahoma is, in fact, not better off without Lincoln Riley\nThe Sooner fans wanted everyone to know it. And it\u2019s just blatantly not true. Oklahoma is not better off without Lincoln Riley. Full stop. Texas blew the brakes off the Sooners in a 49-0 beatdown Saturday. The Longhorns produced 585 yards of offense. And the Sooners? They managed just 195 total yards, including only 39 passing yards. Oklahoma is now 3-3 and the man who left Norman for the sunny beaches of Southern California is 6-0 at USC. The Trojans won 30-14 against Washington State Saturday. There should be no debate for who got the better end of Riley\u2019s move, and it might be time for the Sooner fans to admit that he really is as good as advertised.\n\nRocky Top is back on top ... at least for now\nTennessee hasn\u2019t had a 10-win season since 2007. That streak of mediocrity and despair could come to a close this season. The Vols have already beat Florida \u2014 only the second time in the last 18 meetings \u2014 and took down LSU and Pitt. Redshirt senior quarterback Hendon Hooker has been the catalyst for the team\u2019s ferocious start, averaging 286.4 passing yards and nearly three total touchdowns per game. Against then-No. 25 LSU Saturday, Tennessee put up 263 yards on the ground and 502 total yards of offense. And that\u2019s against a defense that was only allowing 293.4 yards per game heading into the matchup. The Vols have no issue moving the football. None.\n\nThe issues for Tennessee are its defense and its upcoming opponents. The Vols face No. 3 Alabama this weekend and travel to Athens to take on No. 1 Georgia at the start of November. Tennessee\u2019s pass defense has allowed an average of 307.4 yards per game and gave up 269 passing yards to Ball State. That\u2019s not going to bode well come Saturday when the Vols take on Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young, if he\u2019s healthy. Tennessee has a clear weakness, but for now, the Vols are up there with the best of college football.\n\n\u201cCollege Football Roundup\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

Today, we celebrate the presence and contributions of Native Americans in our society. This is not only a day of remembrance, but also a day to appreciate the current impact of Native Americans. However, despite President Joe Biden making Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day a federal holiday last year, only 10 states officially recognize this day via proclamation.\n\nWe talked with students on their feelings surrounding this holiday. Today, for the second year, President Joe Biden recognized Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day alongside Columbus Day. He officially proclaimed it a national federal holiday last year for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nSophomore Law, History, and Culture major Nizhoni McDonough is a member of the Navajo tribe and says the recognition is not enough.\n\nNIZHONI MCDONOUGH: There is a lot of issues still to be resolved within Native American communities and without especially important issues such as missing and murdered indigenous woman. It\u2019s one of, um, very bad epidemic of indigenous women going missing and then not being found murdered or sexually assaulted. And that often happens at a higher rate for Native American women than any other race.\n\nSophomore Psychology major Daniel Williams is part of the Navajo tribe and also part Sioux. He believes the national recognition of Indigenous populations has been increasing in recent years.\n\nDANIEL WILLIAMS: Lately within the news media, I feel like there has been a lot of improvements like you talked about, like the entertainment industry. We have a lot more native actors, actresses out there like have reservation dogs on Hulu. You got Prey that just recently came out. So it\u2019s really interesting to see how how much better has gotten.\n\nStates and cities have been celebrating the holiday for a lot longer. The day traces back to the 90s in states like South Dakota and California. Berkeley was one of the first cities to formally replace Columbus Day in 1992 with what they called \u201cDay of Solidarity with Indigenous People.\u201d The L.A. County Board of Supervisors passed a motion for the replacement of Columbus Day in 2017 and was formally recognized in 2019 at the same time as the entire state of California. Governor Newsom issued a proclamation that year to \u201cpay respect to the cultures and populations that existed long before European contact.\u201d\n\nSophomore Daniel Williams believes celebrating the holiday strengthens community in Indigenous populations and spreads awareness.\n\nDANIEL WILLIAMS: Not a lot of people realize or even recognize that we\u2019re still here. I mean, we\u2019ve gone through genocide, assimilation, and yet we\u2019re still here. So making this a day for us specifically just really helps other natives feel more empowered and just like to take pride in who they are.\n\nThe USC Native American Student Association held an event on Alumni Park today to spread awareness and host conversations regarding Indigenous populations. The event was promoted on social media with the hashtag #AskANative.\n\nJunior Health promotion and disease prevention studies major Natalie Battiest of the Choctaw tribe thinks USC has made slow progress in recognizing Indigenous students.\n\nNATALIE BATTIEST: There was the building renaming of Joseph Medicine Crow. There has been changes. However, it did take a while and longer than it should have. We are still actively making efforts to become recognized on campus, such as on the Native American Heritage Month. This upcoming November, we\u2019re finally possibly might be getting banners. And I feel like they should have done years ago.\n\nThe Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day celebrations will continue tonight at 7 pm with a Native American short film showcase at Norris cinema. People should also look out in November for banners hung across campus in honor of Native American Heritage Month.\n```"}

City Council President Nury Mart\u00ednez, with Councilmembers Gil Cedillo and Kevin de Leon as well as L.A. County Federation of Labor President, Ron Herrera, revealed racist and crude sentiments. The recording was made about a year ago, but was posted to Reddit and then reported by the L.A. Times yesterday. The group was discussing redrawing council district boundaries and which groups would maintain power and influence. Mart\u00ednez is heard on the tape making racist remarks about white Councilman Mike Bonin\u2019s two-year-old adopted Black son.\n\nMart\u00ednez, de Leon, Herrera and Cedillo apologized separately on Sunday, and Mart\u00ednez issued more apologies today as she announced her resignation as Council president. She remains a member of the City Council.\n\nIn Green Meadows, South L.A., a small white church stands on a corner of a residential neighborhood. Southside Bethel Baptist Church hosted about 75 people today, who came together to protest the audio -- and the racist sentiments -- they heard from members of the L.A. City Council.\n\nCROWD: Get them out! Get them out! Get them out!\n\nPumping their fists in the air, the group said Nury Mart\u00ednez\u2019s resignation from the presidency is not enough. They called for Mart\u00ednez to either completely resign or be dismissed from her City Council seat.\n\nOne by one, leaders and activists got up to speak, including Najee Ali. He directs the grass-roots civil rights organization Project Islamic Hope. He says he\u2019s heard enough from Nury Mart\u00ednez.\n\nNAJEE ALI: She has failed the city and does not deserve to be in elected office, and that\u2019s why we believe she should step down completely as the Council member.\n\nMart\u00ednez was one of the members present during a racist rant that was recently leaked on Reddit. In the recording, she can be heard making malicious statements against fellow Councilmember Mike Bonin\u2019s Black son.\n\nThe President of the Los Angeles chapter of the civil rights group National Action Network, Lori Condinus, also decried the racism.\n\nLORI CONDINUS: There are civil servants speaking anti-Blackness and also speaking about suppressing our vote. The fight for justice is a long one.\n\nThe President and CEO of the Los Angeles chapter of the Urban League, Michael Lawson, expressed disappointment with persisting racism among people in authority.\n\nMICHAEL LAWSON: We have fought this fight so many times. We did not expect to have to fight the fight with our colleagues, with the people they were working arm in arm with.\n\nReverend Dr. William Smart is the President and CEO of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Southern California. He echoed the statements made by Lawson, greeting the crowd before speaking out against Mart\u00ednez\u2019s racist remarks.\n\nREVEREND DR. WILLIAM SMART: We\u2019re here to stand for justice. We\u2019re here to stand for righteousness. We know that Nury Mart\u00ednez has resigned the presidency, but right now it\u2019s time in L.A. for there to be a new paradigm in leadership. We believe that this leadership needs to be called into accountable. But most importantly, we as a people need to stand up and say, working with African Americans, Latinos and Asian Pacific Islanders, that we are going to move beyond this.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or not Mart\u00ednez will hold her position as an L.A. City Council member, but it\u2019s groups like those at the Southside Bethel Baptist Church that will continue the fight for her removal.\n\nThis afternoon, mayoral candidates Karen Bass and Rick Caruso, as well as U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, also called for the dismissal of Councilmembers Mart\u00ednez, Cedillo and de Leon.\n```"}

This year, most of congress is on the ballot. This includes seats in the House of Representatives, a third of the Senate, and state governors.

I feel like that\u2019s the biggest thing at stake.\n\nBLAKE STAUFFER: the upcoming elections in general, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s this year the next one, but our Senate seat is up for grabs and right now we\u2019re split, Democratic and Republican one of each. So if that flips to both Republican, then obviously that really hurts the Democrats in Senate.\n\nMidterm elections will take place Tuesday, November 8th.

The intensity was on point from the start of the game. With a high defensive block, the Trojans quickly smothered their opponents, pushing them back into their half of the field. And the effect was quickly felt.\n\nFollowing a promptly played foul in the 10th minute, sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio passed the ball to senior midfielder Croix Bethune, dribbled past the goalkeeper, and scored into the empty net. USC\u2019s College Soccer News Preseason All-American wasn\u2019t done yet. Bethune made a lot of defensive plays and helped her team recover precious balls in the midfield.\n\nSeven minutes later, off a pass from sophomore forward Kayla Colbert, Bethune unleashed a great shot from the inside of her foot into the top corner of the net, leaving no chance for ASU\u2019s keeper. Two goals on the first two shots on goal, and all in less than 17 minutes.\n\nBoosted by these two goals, the energy remained high, with USC shooting on the crossbar in the 24th minute. While ASU acquired more possession, USC\u2019s defense neutralized their offensive line attack, which seemed to be carried only by graduate forward Nicole Douglas. Too little to destabilize the Trojans\u2019 solid defense.\n\n\u201cThe team responded very well in the defense during both periods,\u201d USC head coach Jane Alukonis said after the match.\n\nIn the second half, two minutes of average intensity after the kickoff were enough for the Sun Devils to come back from down two goals to one. On an assist from freshman defender Meighan Farrell, unmarked by two USC defenders, hit a sublime shot from outside the penalty area that landed in the top corner.\n\nIf USC was safe in the first half, they played under pressure for the rest of the game. With the Sun Devils controlling possession, the Trojans had to resort to numerous counterplays before losing sophomore defender Brooklyn Courtnall to a cramp in the 65th minute \u2013 an unfortunate short break that boosted the USC players.\n\nA minute later, on a superb cross from Colbert on the right side of the field, Jackson, free of defensive marking, missed her header, which landed over the crossbar. In the 68th minute, after a pass from Sampaio, Jackson got a late shot off, but it was inevitably blocked by the goalkeeper, who was out of her goal.\n\nDespite a dangerous move by ASU in the 71st minute, USC maintained a solid defense for the last 20 minutes. USC, very disciplined throughout the game, with five shots on target and two goals, delivered a reliable performance winning 2-1 at the final whistle.\n\n\u201cI think we kind of overestimated ourselves and went into the game with that mentality [against Arizona].

Sophomore middle blocker Katelyn Smith kept it close as she recorded two kills in three points to cut the ASU lead to one. Fields then tied it at 21-21, forcing ASU to call their first timeout. Although ASU scored right out of the timeout, two errors by ASU senior outside hitter Iman Isanovic led to a 25-23 set victory for USC. This gave the Trojans a 2-1 lead despite ASU\u2019s playmaking ability.\n\n\u201cThe third set I thought could have gone either way,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThe stats were showing that we were out playing them, but they were making the big plays.\u201d\n\nAlthough the fourth set started out close, Smith tallied three kills in seven points to help the Trojans extend their lead to 12-8. The Trojans never had a lead less than three points and finished the set with a 25-16 victory. This marks the fourth straight victory in four sets for USC in conference play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been paying a lot of attention to our blocking defense and transition game, and I think that\u2019s really paid off for us,\u201d Keller said. \u201cIt\u2019s giving us secondary swings and third opportunities, fourth opportunities. We\u2019ve been able to capitalize on a lot of those, which can create a lot of momentum.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will look to continue their Pac-12 winning streak as they come home this week to take on No. 12 Oregon Friday and Oregon State Sunday at Galen Center.\n```"}

I just do what the team wants me to do so we can get the job done.\u201d At halftime, USC led 17-14. Washington State\u2019s final four drives went as follows: punt, turnover on downs, punt, punt. The Cougars would not score for the rest of the game. USC had a 13-play, 70-yard scoring drive in the fourth quarter which was the Trojans\u2019 longest timed drive of the season at 7:27. \u201cYou have to win these in different ways,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find ways to move the ball. If something\u2019s not working ... we continue to find ways to adapt to the situation. We adapted.\u201d Williams finished 15-of-29 passing with no interceptions. Last week against Arizona State, Williams held the longest active streak in the FBS for most consecutive pass attempts without an interception until a pick late in the third quarter of that game. The Trojans did not have a single turnover this week, remaining No. 1 in the nation with just one turnover on the year. For Washington State, Ward finished 19-of-32 for 172 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He entered the week leading the Pac-12 in completions and was tied for third in pass touchdowns with 13. During pregame, families of the players gathered from the end zone to the 50-yard line to greet the team during Trojan Family Weekend. USC alumna Allyson Felix made an appearance in the third quarter. Next Saturday, USC will travel to Salt Lake City to face No. 11 Utah, who fell to No. 18 UCLA this week. Washington State is on the road against Oregon State.\n```"}

Fields led the team with 20 kills while hitting .311. This was her fifth straight match with at least 20 kills. \u201cShe\u2019s taking some of the biggest and most ridiculous swings in the most ridiculous situations, and she\u2019s capitalizing on a great percentage of them,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cSo she can hit angles that a lot of players can\u2019t.\u201d The Trojans\u2019 offense hit .272, compared to Arizona\u2019s .136. Each set came down to the wire. USC committed 13 service errors. \u201cServing comes high-risk, high-reward,\u201d Fields said. \u201cTrying to get aces, but errors are going to come with that.\u201d In the first set, the Trojans dominated offensively and recorded six blocks. They hit .281 while the Wildcats hit -.071 in the set. \u201cWe work a ton on blocking and defense and transition and just trying to keep the ball off the floor,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we were pretty poor at at the beginning of the season. The last I would say at least two to three weeks, it has been 75-80% defense [during practice].\u201d The Trojans found unique ways to bond during the match. As freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson was subbed out after committing a service error, she and senior libero Keila Barra rested a hand against the other\u2019s. \u201cJust, you know, having those good moments of reassurance are really good for us on the court whether we\u2019re winning or losing,\u201d Fields said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know someone has your back.\u201d The second set resembled the first in that it was very back-and-forth. USC was down 11-10, and the following rally consisted of several sneaky attempts on both sides. Several players attempted to kill when the expectation was that they would set. Service errors plagued both teams, with USC recording four and Arizona three. USC had a .333 hitting percentage in the second set, and Arizona topped that at .394. Fields said Trojan supporters made their presence known. \u201cWe had a lot of our family and friends come out from Southern California, and then also this is Jordan\u2019s home state, so she had a nice crowd for us,\u201d Fields said. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have your fans travel with you.\u201d The second set was tied 21-21, but the Wildcats\u2019 offense quickly turned this into 25-22 with three kills and one service ace while only giving up one kill to the Trojans. \u201cWe still have highs and lows, which a lot of teams do,\u201d Keller said. We got to get more consistent. So we can\u2019t have the big dips.\u201d USC showed perseverance at several points during the third set by winning unusually long rallies. When the score was 2-2, Fields made several impressive digs to keep the rally alive, and it ended with a kill from Graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams. Fields, who was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week last week, had a career-high 13 digs. Keller praised Fields for her incredible effort in all aspects of the game. \u201cShe\u2019s a winner. At the end of the day, Skylar\u2019s dreams are to play for the national team,\u201d Keller said. \u201cSkylar\u2019s dreams are to do big things and to be a complete volleyball player and really to be a leader ... the sky is the limit for Skylar.\u201d USC had a 13-11 lead. Although the score remained close, USC never trailed again in the set. The Trojans were up 21-19. All that was needed was three attack errors from Arizona and a kill from Fields to close it out. In the fourth set, USC had a tight 13-11 lead, but two kills in a row from Wilson increased the lead to four. The freshman stand-out had the second-most kills for the Trojans with 13. \u201cSome of the ferocious plays she was making, and just the tenacity at which she went at it,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI was really pleased with how she just kept coming at it, just kept swinging, just kept being aggressive.\u201d The Wildcats came back and tied the fourth set at 17-17. During a rally later in the set, senior outside hitter Emilia Weske lightly tapped the ball, forcing it to bounce way out in front of every defender. She followed that up with a block assist and another kill, giving the Trojans the momentum they needed to win the game. Through all four sets, Weske had 12 kills while hitting .308. Williams recorded nine kills and hit .500. \u201cIt\u2019s really a weapon that we have on our team. is Wwe have a lot of hitters who can go off on any given night, any given circumstance,\u201d Fields said. \u201cI think it makes it hard for other teams to try to scout us and try to figure out who they\u2019re going to try to shut down.\u201d The last three matches ended in a 3-1 victory for USC. The Trojans now head 90 minutes northwest of Tucson to face Arizona State on Sunday, October 9. \u201cIt\u2019s really a weapon that we have on our team. We have a lot of hitters who can go off on any given night, any given circumstance,\u201d Fields said. \u201cI think it makes it hard for other teams to try to scout us and try to figure out who they\u2019re going to try to shut down.\u201d\n```"}

In last week\u2019s game versus the Arizona State Sun Devils, the Trojans played down to their competition. ASU has been struggling and going through internal turmoil so far this season. USC cannot take its foot off the gas against the 4-1 Cougars.\n\nUSC\u2019s offense is ranked No. 19 in yards per game, but the defense has struggled at times this year. Against Arizona State, the defense allowed a field goal, three touchdowns and a two-point conversion. ASU\u2019s offense has had trouble scoring in the previous games. If not for the offense\u2019s dominance last week, the ASU game could have gone very differently.\n\nThe offense, led by sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams, needs to continue its dominance. Williams has been the catalyst for the Trojans all year and needs to continue creating magic for the Trojans to succeed. Williams has averaged 280.4 passing yards and three total touchdowns per game. Going against the Cougars, Williams will need to find his go-to guy, junior wide receiver Jordan Addison, who currently has 442 yards and six touchdowns throughout five games.\n\nIn the press conference after the Arizona State game, head coach Lincoln Riley was asked about Williams\u2019 readiness for this upcoming Saturday, and he kept his answer short and simple. \u201cHe\u2019s ready,\u201d Riley said.\n\nThe Cougars\u2019 defense will be one of the tougher matchups for the Trojans as WSU has held all its opponents except for Oregon to two or less touchdowns. At Tuesday\u2019s practice, Lincoln was asked to address his thoughts on WSU\u2019s defense. \u201cThey are aggressive up front, and they move enough to cause you problems ... You got to be on your game, assignment wise,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou got to understand that this game can look a lot different than Arizona State.\u201d\n\nWashington State sophomore quarterback Cameron Ward has similar stats to Williams \u2013 288 passing yards and 2.8 total touchdowns per game \u2013 and creates very difficult matchups for the USC defense. Last week, Ward led his team to a 28-9 victory against Cal and threw for 343 yards, his second highest total of the season.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s practice, Riley recognized the threat of Ward. \u201cHe uses some of his natural born athleticism to make plays and it\u2019s a good system,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough system to stop with that combination of what they run and the quarterback making it go.\u201d\n\nThe Trojan coaching staff will need to prepare the defense for a team that has proven its ability to perform well in high-pressure situations and to score with anybody in the country. In last week\u2019s game against the Golden Bears, WSU struggled offensively in the first half, punting on four of its first five drives. After halftime adjustments, WSU put 21 more points on the board.\n\nUSC sometimes struggles in the first half and then turns it on in the second half. If last week\u2019s Arizona State game is any indicator, then the Trojans cannot afford to start slowly. They will need four strong quarters of football for the victory.\n\nThe Trojans look to send parents and fans home happy this upcoming Trojan Family Weekend by continuing their undefeated season against the Cougars this Saturday at 4:30 p.m. on Fox.\n```"}

Fans are still disappointed, despite the two stars leading the charge to the first Western Conference finals appearance in franchise history in 2020-21. The Clippers were the favorites to win the NBA Finals in 2019-20, the first year with their shiny new toys. Three years later, they\u2019ve yet to play for an NBA title.\n\nThe Clippers were unable to fill the bottom level of Galen Center despite making Thursday\u2019s practice free to the public; some fans may have given up hope. But among the fans who came to support, most were energetic and supportive as they cheered loudly when watching their favorite players drill impressive shots.\n\nLue remains optimistic ahead of the 2022-23 season, so long as his team can avoid the injury bug. \u201cThe biggest most important thing is making sure the players are healthy,\u201d Lue said in a press conference on Thursday.\n\nLue\u2019s concern is warranted by recent history. \u201cI think falling short the year Kawhi got hurt, and then last year Kawhi and [Paul George] both being out, I think that put a dent on everything as well,\u201d Lue said. \u201cSo we\u2019re excited to have Kawhi healthy, having [Paul George] healthy, having John Wall here healthy as well. If we stay healthy and do all the right things, I think we got a great chance.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers are tied for most scheduled back-to-back games this season with 15, and five of those are in the first month and a half. The strenuous nature of these games will force Lue to adjust his game plan. \u201cWith John and Kawhi who haven\u2019t played, John in two years and Kawhi in a year and three months, we got to make sure we\u2019re smart,\u201d Lue said.\n\nIf Wall remains healthy, Lue\u2019s expectations are tremendous. \u201cWe already know he can play. Perennial all-star,\u201d Lue said. \u201cThe guy is seventh all-time in assists \u2014 9.1 assists a game.\u201d\n\nHowever, Reggie Jackson presents tough competition for starting point guard. Not only is he an excellent team player, but his outgoing nature makes him a fan favorite. At the open practice, he did a ballerina dance after nailing a three-point shot. He also did the floss and \u201ctake the L\u201d dances from the video game Fortnite.\n\nLue said he is yet to determine who will earn the role. \u201cIt\u2019s not about who\u2019s the best player. It\u2019s about who\u2019s the best fit for our team to win and be successful,\u201d Lue said.\n\nIn the Clippers\u2019 first preseason game on Monday against the Portland Trail Blazers, Jackson started the game and Wall came off the bench. But during a scrimmage at Thursday\u2019s open practice, Wall started alongside Leonard, George and center Ivica Zubac, three projected starters. Jackson started with Norman Powell, Terance Mann, Brandon Boston and Robert Covington, who will likely serve as bench players.\n\nThere is still a competition for starting point guard, but it appears to be trending in Wall\u2019s direction. Wall\u2019s performance at the open practice likely helped his case. He scored 14 of his team\u2019s 49 points, including two explosive dunks, and added three assists along with one steal.\n\nWith one of these two coming off the bench, the Clippers will add more depth to a team that was extraordinarily deep last year. They ranked second with 40 points per game off the bench. \u201cYou got to sacrifice minutes, games, shots,\u201d Lue said. \u201cWe have a lot of competitors on our team.\u201d\n\nLue said properly distributing minutes each game will be tough because of his team\u2019s extensive talent, but he praises his coaching staff for their help with these types of decisions. \u201cOur staff does a great job just making adjustments, you know trying to read the game before it actually happens.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers remain one of the favorites to win the NBA Finals for the fourth year in a row at (+550) according to DraftKings Sportsbook. With the acquisition of Wall, the Clippers have arguably the best team on paper in the entire league. If their key pieces can stay healthy \u2014 which is a huge \u201cif\u201d \u2014 the Clippers may break their own glass ceiling and win the NBA Finals.\n\nLue said he hopes to deliver on these standards. \u201cI\u2019ll take those expectations every year. So we have a good team, but we need to put the work in,\u201d Lue said. \u201cWe need to sacrifice and do a lot of other things to achieve our goals. We have the right pieces in this room, so I\u2019m just excited to get started.\u201d\n```"}

The pair acknowledged her role in raising more than $640 million in scholarship and aid money last year, as well as her role in boosting the university\u2019s academic rankings. 17 of the university\u2019s 22 schools now have programs that are rated top 20 and above in their respective fields \u2013 more than any other university in the United States, she said.\n\nAfter the warm introduction, Folt began the address by saying that USC is \u201cclearly a private [university] with a public heart.\u201d Folt boasted about the strong Trojan Family and the success stories of former students from the School of Cinematic Arts. She also mentioned how the Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute received a $150 million grant from the National Institute on Aging to address health disparities in Alzheimer\u2019s research.\n\nFolt cited her background in biology as she spoke on USC\u2019s ongoing ambitious sustainability project, titled \u201cAssignment: Earth.\u201d She shared her plans of going carbon neutral by 2025 and waste neutral by 2028, as well as the efforts that the university has made on eliminating single-use plastic bottles. This is not the first time Folt has discussed reducing the university\u2019s carbon footprint. According to Folt\u2019s State of the University address in April, sustainability has become one of her \u201cmoonshots,\u201d a term she coined for her working goals.\n\nOne student attendee, who identified themself as a freshman in the School of Dramatic Arts, challenged Folt\u2019s dedication to sustainability by asking about the football program\u2019s partnership with a cryptocurrency platform. Folt went on to describe the various research projects on sustainability at the university, including decarbonization at the Keck School of Medicine, as well as green projects with USC\u2019s Sea Grant, but did not expand on the carbon impact of cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say much about sustainability if you don\u2019t walk the walk. I think we are excelling and walking the walk,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the talks of her achievements, parents also brought up tough issues, such as what the university plans to do to re-incorporate disaffiliated fraternities back into USC\u2019s fraternity system, in the question and answer session.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t bring them back. They have to decide to come back,\u201d Folt said. The university is working with national fraternity leadership in an attempt to bring disaffiliated frats back as registered student organizations.\n\nFollowing the event, families seemed satisfied with her speech and the direction that Folt is taking the school in. Christy Robinson Bortel, a USC mom, \u201cthought [Folt] was a really clear, inspirational speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a parent, she seemed like a very reassuring leader, especially leading us through a difficult time of the pandemic,\u201d Bortel said.\n\nAt the end of the address, Folt ended with a piece of advice to the parents: \u201cIn this dynamic time, opening your mind to [your children\u2019s] flexibility and their need to change and move is probably the greatest thing that you can ever do.\u201d```"}

On Sept. 27, she made her Los Angeles debut at the Moroccan Lounge in the Arts District, where she performed an intimate solo set featuring a mix of her older music, unreleased songs and newer tunes from her recent album, \u201cThe Shark In Your Water.\u201d\n\nPast the bohemian-style, dimly-lit bar at the entrance, the doors to the stage in the Moroccan Lounge led to a room full of fans who had been patiently awaiting Flower Face\u2019s first L.A. performance. Throughout the show, the dedicated audience was singing along to her earlier songs and newer songs alike.\n\nRuby McKinnon, stage name Flower Face, started her career by making DIY records in her room. It wasn\u2019t until she was 18 or 19 when her music took off and she realized she could pursue music as a career. Her latest album, \u201cThe Shark In Your Water,\u201d features McKinnon\u2019s intensely honest lyricism and hauntingly beautiful vocals from her older work, while giving the artist a new experience to professionally record this album with a team in Toronto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different from what I\u2019m used to because before it was usually just me in my bedroom with my setup producing everything myself. This time I went into a bigger studio and had a whole production team and it was a faster process,\u201d McKinnon said about her first foray in recording with a team. \u201cI think bigger now in terms of sound because I see now that it\u2019s more achievable. There\u2019s only so much you can do at home. I now think more cinematic, I think more in layers.\u201d\n\nMcKinnon said she wanted the feel of her album to be \u201cbig and dark, kind of scary and haunting.\u201d She said the album could be described in two words: \u201chaunted carnival.\u201d\n\nThe title \u201cThe Shark in Your Water\u201d comes from track one on the album, \u201cSpiracle.\u201d Although McKinnon\u2019s standard process of writing is starting with the lyrics and then moving on to the melody, she wrote the instrumental track first for this song.\n\n\u201cI recorded this demo. It\u2019s just layers and layers of different instruments and big strings. I just got my microphone and started singing over it. At the time, it felt like gibberish, but I ended up keeping all of the original lyrics because I feel like they found meaning afterwards,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cOne of them was \u2018I want your parties, the shark in your water.\u2019 Afterwards, I thought that actually kind of sums up the whole theme of the album in its entirety, which is the idea of loving someone in such a deep, insidious way that you want to be a good thing in their life, but you\u2019re also the shark haunting them and following them forever.\u201d\n\nEarly before the show started, two girls were waiting for the doors to open. One of the fans flew in for her birthday and gave bouquets of flowers to both McKinnon and her opening act, Olive Klug. Flower Face\u2019s set included some unreleased songs from the beginning of her career, appeasing fans who have been dedicated listeners from the start.\n\n\u201cAs much as it\u2019s hard to look back on my old songs and it\u2019s a little embarrassing, I feel like I owe the people who\u2019ve been listening to me for that long to play them,\u201d McKinnon said. Though she has recently played some shows with a full band, she performed alone. The show was a celebration of her roots as an artist. Her stripped-down style initially drew in her fanbase at the start of her career.\n\n\u201cI feel a little nervous doing just me and a guitar tonight, but the people who have listened to me for so long, what they connected to is what I put out there from the very beginning, which is honest lyrics,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cThat\u2019s always what\u2019s been most important to me. I find that personally, I feel more connected to a crowd when it\u2019s just me up there and I\u2019m just putting across the songs in the simplest, most raw form. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to put out there tonight, and I hope that people like it.\u201d\n```"}

Spearheaded by Dieuwertje \u201cDJ\u201d Kast, director of the STEM education programs at USC JEP, the book program works to provide children in the surrounding communities with science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics content (STEAM) that is both easily accessible and relatable to South L.A. kids, she says.\n\n\u201cThe community we work with is predominantly Latinx and Black, and it is really difficult to try and find science kids books that actually feature characters that look like our kids,\u201d Kast said. Kast was inspired to begin this project over two years ago and see it through. Along the way, she recruited the help of numerous USC scientists, faculty and staff to create a book series that now includes 10 different STEAM-related topics, ranging from oncology to data science and engineering.\n\nEach book is divided into two parts with one half using fictional characters to explain a given STEAM topic, while the second half profiles a project contributor who describes aspects of their career. These details include \u201cday in the life\u201d routines, STEAM career opportunities and vocabulary lists.\n\n\u201cThere was an obvious need to have ... these characters to come into fruition\u201d according to Maria Madrigal, an employee of the USC Dornsife Sea Grant and author of the marine biology book. \u201cYou just can\u2019t easily find a book about a student of color highlighted,\u201d she says.\n\nAs part of this push for STEAM accessibility, all 10 of the books from this project are available online, and Spanish translations are forthcoming, Kast says. Despite the two-year process to get these books out, those involved viewed it all as a worthwhile undertaking because of the impact it will have on South L.A. kids.\n\nAs part of the project rollout, Kast and other contributors handed out copies of the series to kids on 32nd street Thursday. \u201cIt was a dream come true,\u201d Kast said. She was ecstatic to be \u201cseeing this idea from start to finish, and then seeing how happy the kids were to be receiving these books that [had characters who] actually look like them.\u201d\n\nStacey Finley, a professor of biomedical engineering at Viterbi and author of the data science book in the project, explained how she kept her three children in mind when working on her writing. \u201cWhen I wrote the book, I had [my kids] in mind because I wanted them to see scientists and characters that they could relate to,\u201d she said.\n\nDarin Gray, another Viterbi professor and featured scientist in the engineering book in the project, described the importance the books have on how kids in these communities view those who work in STEAM and how they can get involved in the field. \u201c[The kids] get to see not only themselves in the STEM fields,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they also get a chance to see how STEM can impact their specific community.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect the grade levels that this program serves.

Despite the loss of key players junior defender Zoe Burns and sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo, who were away on national team duties, USC came into Thursday afternoon as the clear favorite. It was clear from the opening whistle, however, that the Wildcats were not going to just roll over. After a decidedly sloppy first half full of fouls, cards and turnovers, neither team gained the upper hand. The second half seemed to bring some life to the game with the Trojans controlling possession and eventually had a chance to pull ahead with a penalty kick in the 66th minute. USC\u2019s College Soccer News Preseason All-American, senior midfielder Croix Bethune, took the kick. Bethune went to her left, and so did Arizona senior keeper Hope Hisey. In a full stretch, Hisey was able to deflect the ball wide of the post and out of play. The ensuing corner was then handled with ease by Hisey. During the ensuing play the energy seemed to turn towards Arizona who would capitalize in the 68th minute with what can only be described as a hustle goal from junior forward Nicole Dallin. Junior midfielder Megan Chelf and sophomore midfielder Gianna Christiansen registered the assists. The ball was lifted over the head of the USC back line, and Dallin beat the Trojan defender to the ball, chipping it up and over senior keeper Anna Smith for the goal. The goal put the Wildcats up for good. After the game USC head coach Jane Alukonis said, \u201cIt came down a lot to work rate. They outplayed us.\u201d It seemed today that the will to win, and the luck manufactured by that hustle, was on the side of Arizona today. USC outshot the Wildcats 16-12. However, they only forced saves on five of those. Of those saves the penalty shot was the only one that gave any pause. In the late stages of the match, the Trojans were unable to get anything going against an Arizona squad that was quite content with sitting on their one-goal advantage. In the closing seconds, the Trojans made one last charge, but their shot from out wide was handled neatly by Hisey who then drained the clock of its last remaining seconds for the Wildcat win. It was just a tough day for USC who just could not generate enough dangerous chances all day. In spite of the loss, Alukonis and the Trojans still feel good about their chances to make their goal of a national championship. \u201cEvery season that I\u2019ve ever played at the college level has hiccups,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t fun, they aren\u2019t good, but it\u2019s the wake up call that you need. So our goal is still exactly the same.\u201d The Trojans will be in need of a quick turnaround however, as the 6-2-2 Arizona State Sun Devils will be in town on Sunday looking to avenge last year\u2019s loss in Tempe.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Josh Flowers, Paige Shea, and Reagan Smith\nOctober 07, 2022 at 4:45 pm PDT\n\nFans at Brigham Young University allegedly hurled racial insults at USC women\u2019s soccer players at a match last year, according to a story from USA Today on Tuesday. Members of the USC women\u2019s soccer team said that fans from BYU, located in Provo, Utah, yelled the n-word at them as they kneeled during the national anthem before a soccer game on August 26, 2021.\n\nThe Guardian first reported the alleged incident at BYU last Friday but did not reveal the name of the visiting team. USA Today published an updated article on Tuesday, naming USC as the visiting soccer team. It\u2019s unclear why the allegations took so long to emerge.\n\nEmily Rhinehart, a junior and former goalie for the USC women\u2019s soccer team, said that USC women\u2019s soccer is a highly diverse team compared to other college teams. At the time of the incident, the team also had a Black head coach. Before arriving at BYU for the game last year, Rhinehart said that Jason Lockhart, an associate head coach for the USC women\u2019s soccer team, prepared the team for the possibility of \u201cracially charged things\u201d from the large 5,000-person crowd.\n\nRhinehart says that coach Lockhart, a Black man from Birmingham, Alabama, encouraged the team to \u201cput [their] heads down and focus on the game.\u201d Shortly after the game \u2013 and the alleged racial slurs \u2013 USC players loaded onto the bus questioning everything that just happened, asking each other things like, \u201cDid you hear what they said?\u201d and \u201cCan you believe that happened?\u201d Coaches did not formally address the issue at the time.\n\nThis is not the only accusation of racist language from BYU fans. According to NPR, Rachel Richardson, a sophomore on Duke University\u2019s women\u2019s volleyball team, alleged that during a game against BYU that took place exactly one year after the USC-related incident, she heard racial slurs from the BYU student section whenever she went to hit the ball. Richardson is the only Black starter on the team.\n\nFollowing the incident, the West Coast Conference Commissioner Gloria Nevarez told USA Today that, \u201cBYU is currently looking into the matter with the same level of diligence as the prior incident. We\u2019ve not yet gotten to the point of understanding what [the] next steps should be.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until five weeks after Richardson\u2019s allegations that the incident with USC\u2019s team was reported on by the media. While BYU has yet to release a statement in response to the allegations made by the USC women\u2019s soccer team. BYU Athletics did respond to Duke volleyball player Rachel Richardson on August 27, initially apologizing to the Duke student athletes and stating that they banned the fan from sitting in the student section, who was not a current student.\n\nShortly after, however, BYU released another statement on September 9 stating that they \u201ccould not corroborate the use of racial slurs at the volleyball game\u201d and un-banned the disruptive fan. Their announcement also included an apology to the fan \u201cfor any hardship the ban caused.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that a discussion has emerged about the racial insensitivities present at BYU. The Black Menaces, a \u201ccoalition of students from various universities across the nation fighting to empower marginalized communities through social media,\u201d has gone viral on TikTok, specifically for videos they film at BYU.\n\nSebastian, a junior political science major at BYU involved in the Black Menaces who only wanted to be identified by his first name, said that the creation of the coalition was the culmination of failed attempts to advocate for change at BYU. He said that the goal of the Black Menaces is \u201cto highlight, and to find, ways to empower marginalized communities everywhere in any way possible.\u201d\n\nSebastian believes that BYU\u2019s handling of the USC and Duke athletic situations was \u201creactive,\u201d and not productive. He believes that the BYU administration needs to take tangible action. \u201cIt should be more than an apology, more than saying \u2018we don\u2019t condone racism,\u2019\u201d Sebastian said. \u201cThis is why we have repeat incidents.\u201d\n\nBYU released its \u201cReport and Recommendations of the BYU Committee on Race, Equity, and Belonging,\u201d which stated, \u201cThe most pressing concern is that BIPOC students often feel isolated and unsafe at BYU due to racism.\u201d Fewer than 1 in every 100 students at BYU is Black. A member of BYU\u2019s Black Student Union told the authors of the report that \u201cmy experience as a Black student at BYU is not equal to other students on campus because I don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\n```"}

The USA will play Japan in a friendly soccer match as part of the KIRIN CHALLENGE CUP to prepare for the World Cup in Qatar in Duesseldorf on Friday. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\n\nBy Adam Jasper\nOctober 07, 2022 at 3:51 pm PDT\n\nNo, I\u2019m not being dramatic. It\u2019s really that bad. At this rate, the U.S. might not even get a point in its World Cup group. The recent friendlies against Japan and Saudi Arabia confirmed my suspicion that this team isn\u2019t ready for primetime. These were supposed to be the games where the U.S. displayed its progress and readiness for the big stage. And, unequivocally, the team failed.\n\nI\u2019m the type of guy that, no matter how negative I can be, I always try to look for silver linings when things go wrong. It\u2019s rare that I come away with essentially no positive takeaways from an international window. That is the case this time.\n\nSo, on that remarkably negative note, let\u2019s take a look at the USMNT\u2019s schedule, game by game, and determine what exactly we should expect when watching this team in less than two months.\n\nNov. 21 vs Wales\nWales enters the group stage off the back of a disappointing display in the UEFA Nations League, earning just one point in six games. They qualified for the World Cup via a 1-0 win over Ukraine in the European qualifying playoff. The Welsh are led by winger Gareth Bale, who is notorious for being the driving force of the attack. While he may be past his day at the club level (he\u2019s unable to start for LAFC in MLS), he still has plenty to contribute to his national team. One difference-maker in attack can punish the USMNT\u2019s lackluster defense.\n\nBut it would be foolish to reduce Wales to just Bale. Surprise standouts such as forward Hal Robson-Kanu in the 2016 European Championship always seem to pop up with this team. My bet is that winger Daniel James\u2019 pace poses major issues for the U.S. backline. The Welsh defense is the weakness that the USMNT will have to take advantage of. If not, the U.S. will start off on the wrong foot.\n\nBest case scenario: scraping out a win with a late winner \u00e0 la Ghana 2014. Worst case scenario: close loss with costly defensive mistakes\n\nNov. 25 vs England\nLike the U.S., the English have been on a terrible run of form heading into the World Cup. So, there\u2019s a chance to defeat our former motherland, right? Not so fast. The real discrepancy with this matchup isn\u2019t a tactical advantage, as crazy as that may sound. England manager Gareth Southgate has come under fire recently for his team\u2019s uninspiring play, much like U.S. manager Gregg Berhalther. So who wins out in a battle of bad managers? The team with more firepower. And this England team is loaded.\n\nThe attack features one of the best strikers in the world, elite wingers with pace and technique, a balanced midfield and mostly competent defenders. Here\u2019s why I say mostly. I truly believe the only hope that the U.S. has of even garnering a single point in this game is a costly defensive mistake from English center back Harry Maguire. His affinity for costing his team goals is truly unique, and it gives the U.S. a miniscule sliver of hope for a positive result.\n\nAll this being said, with the way the U.S. has looked recently, I genuinely can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to even get a draw. I\u2019m officially, and with a heavy heart, writing this game off. Fly away, bald eagles.\n\nBest case scenario: close loss in an entertaining game Worst case scenario: embarrassing loss to one of our biggest rivals\n\nNov. 29 vs Iran\nMy bold take of the group stage predictions comes in this game. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for the U.S. to win against Iran. This Iran team is notorious for playing in a low block and absorbing pressure from the opposition. That just so happens to be the one thing that this U.S. team is absolutely worst at. No matter the talent discrepancy, I cannot talk myself into believing that this team will find a way to break down Iran and win this game.\n\nOn the other hand, Iran\u2019s star striker Sardar Azmoun just picked up a calf injury that will likely sideline him up until the start of the World Cup, if not later. If he does miss the competition, it\u2019s a huge blow for a team already lacking in threatening attacking options. Therefore, if I had to predict one game to end 0-0, it would be this one.\n\nAlso, if my Spanish professor is reading this, I will unfortunately be sick on this specific Tuesday and won\u2019t be able to attend class. Sorry not sorry.\n\nBest case scenario: dominant draw but unable to find a lead Worst case scenario: heartbreaking loss in a low-scoring game\n\nIf I\u2019m a fortune teller, the U.S. will end up with anywhere from zero to four points. Based on other results around the group, it\u2019s more than likely four points will be a bare minimum to make it to the knockout stage. So, basically, everything is going to have to go right. Great.\n\nAnything can happen, and I will personally invite the USMNT to prove me wrong in every capacity. And if you\u2019re feeling more optimistic about this team\u2019s chances, then good for you. Seriously, I wish I could look on the bright side here. But if the U.S. goes up in flames and is out of the tournament by December, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel)\n\nBy AC Shick October 07, 2022 at 11:56 am PDT\n\nAndrea Contreras, a Santa Monica College student, felt a responsibility as a pet owner to purchase an air conditioner. She called local stores only to discover none had AC units in stock. The closest was a Costco in San Luis Obispo, about a three and a half hour drive from her house. \u201cBecause my dog was so hot, I had to bathe her a couple times during the week just because she was panting so much, \u2018\u2019 Contreras said. \u201cI felt so bad. I would constantly be taking showers to cool down too.\u201d\n\nContreras is not alone. Residents of Los Angeles experienced a record heat wave in early September, which many people of color and low-income populations in South L.A. had to endure without air conditioning. \u201cI had to go and live with a family to stay cool,\u201d said South L.A. resident Jasmine Rizo, who does not have AC.\n\nAir conditioning is not required by California\u2019s habitability laws. As the climate becomes hotter, a lack of cooling options could have potentially devastating effects on residents. Only 41% of South L.A. residents have air conditioning compared to 68% of L.A. residents overall, according to a 2020 USC study.\n\n\u201cRelative to more affluent populations, people in communities like South L.A. are both ... financially and infrastructure underprepared for climate change,\u201d said Chelsea Kirk, the Assistant Director of Policy and Research at Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE).\n\nCalifornia\u2019s official data from death certificates reported 599 deaths from heat exposure between 2010 to 2019, but an investigation by the Los Angeles Times estimated the death count to be 3,900 during this period. While excess heat can be deadly, even non-fatal heat affects South L.A. residents\u2019 well-being.\n\n\u201cI felt more lethargic throughout the week, and I wasn\u2019t as productive when doing work from school or just concentrating on getting things done,\u201d Contreras said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) is the agency responsible for public housing. Specifically, they aid homeless and low-income people, but they don\u2019t provide air conditioning and have no current plan to change this despite increasing temperatures. Rizo said that houses like hers are very old and should have better insulation in addition to air conditioning.\n\nWhile residents like Rizo desire better cooling resources, the LAHD states that AC is an \u201camenity\u201d for residents. \u201cThe date of construction as well as geographic and climate factors influence landlords\u2019 decisions on whether to provide AC,\u201d the LAHD said in a written statement to Annenberg Media.\n\nLos Angeles County provided resources like cooling centers during the heat wave, but some residents say they are not easily accessible. To get to the centers, residents could have to wait outside at hot bus stops and take long commutes, Kirk said.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to pretty much stay in either parks or malls or big stores,\u201d Rizo said, adding that the heat wave affected everybody that she knows.\n\nMany people in South L.A. have an annual income of less $15,000 a year and are more likely to have housing, transportation and energy burdens, Kirk said. Heating is required in housing by California habitability laws, but efforts to include cooling have been unsuccessful, organizations like SAJE say.\n\nAs the climate changes, L.A. residents in \u201cinland urban areas\u201d are most vulnerable to heat through the \u201cstrong increasing trends in frequency, duration and intensity,\u201d according to a 2020 study published by American Geophysical Union.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for places to go during the heat wave...because being home is unbearable,\u201d Kirk said. She explained how low-income populations are often not able to afford an escape to air-conditioned spaces like movie theaters, museums or restaurants. She added that SAJE wants \u201cto see a local cooling mandate for rental units, so that way landlords must provide air conditioning units.\u201d\n\nAlyah Anderson lives at Vernon and Central in South Los Angeles. She has air conditioning, but she noticed many of her neighbors do not. \u201cSome of them leave their doors and windows open just so they could get the breeze,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nAnderson may have AC, but the heat wave across California required so much power she faced power outages lasting hours. \u201cYou have nothing,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just black.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles is predicted to experience longer and more intense temperature changes over the next 30 years.

The Trojans were particularly dominant in the second half in which they outscored the Sun Devils 21-8. They look to continue this trend.\n\n\u201cExecute, execute. Energy, energy. And just don\u2019t get big-headed,\u201d redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyron Hudson said regarding what the team\u2019s mentality has been during practice. \u201cStay humble. Be hungry.\u201d\n\nUSC will need to keep this mentality during the game, however, or the Trojans will face a recognizable situation. The Trojans were in a tight game at halftime during their last two games, which they will look to avoid as they go up against the Washington State Cougars Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe do need to come out hot,\u201d redshirt senior left guard Andrew Vorhees said. \u201cWe need to really step on the gas pedal in the beginning and really put ourselves in the best position to win.\u201d\n\nPlaying well in both halves comes down to consistency, which is a concern for defensive coordinator Alex Grinch.\n\n\u201cFrom a consistency standpoint, that\u2019s probably [our] failing grade,\u201d Grinch said.\n\nWhen USC is on its game, however, the Trojans are lights out. USC ranks third in the nation in ESPN\u2019s offensive efficiency rating, behind only Ohio State and TCU. USC\u2019s offense is led by Heisman Trophy candidate Caleb Williams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing [to play with Williams],\u201d Hudson said. \u201cHe makes us all look good. He puts [the football] in the right spot to make the play.\u201d\n\nWilliams has taken college football by storm this season with his ability to extend plays by escaping pass rushers, but so has Washington State sophomore quarterback Cameron Ward.\n\n\u201c[Mobile quarterbacks] can make a bad play a good play real quick,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cThey can punish you for doing things right, which is the worst situation you can possibly be in defensively.\u201d\n\nAlthough the offense has been USC\u2019s main selling point, the Trojans\u2019 new defensive system has been praised by players.\n\n\u201cThis [defensive] coaching staff is all about making plays,\u201d redshirt senior cornerback Mekhi Blackmon said. \u201c[They\u2019ve been] harping on it. You need to make plays in order to stay on the field.\u201d\n\nThe emphasis on big playmaking has translated to in-game success, as USC is tied for first in the nation in total forced turnovers with 15. Add into the equation the offense, which has only given up one turnover, and USC\u2019s turnover margin is plus-14. This ranks first in the nation by a landslide; second place has only nine.\n\nThe entire coaching staff has prioritized a rough playing style, which starts in practice. After head coach Lincoln Riley arrived at USC from Oklahoma, he brought with him Bennie Wylie, one of the premier strength and conditioning coaches in the country.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have energy every day, so you can\u2019t be moping around the weight room,\u201d Blackmon said of Wylie. \u201cThat\u2019s just the type of guy he is.\u201d\n\nWylie\u2019s mentality has spread across the coaching staff.\n\n\u201cCoach instills [straining] in us every day, and playing at the edge, practicing at the edge. When you\u2019re tired, find that second gear ... and keep pushing,\u201d sophomore safety Jaylin Smith said on what the coaching staff focuses on in practice.\n\nGrinch practices what he preaches. He was seen wearing a shirt with the word \u201cstrain\u201d written across it during Wednesday\u2019s practice press conference.\n\nAs the 5-0 Trojans aim to stay undefeated in an attempt to make the College Football Playoff, they appear to be sticking to the basics: executing, bringing energy and capitalizing on their big play ability both offensively and defensively.\n```"}

Haviland: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a situation where you have to separate the art from the artist because it gets to a point where it\u2019s just like that\u2019s just somebody like being a bad person and intentionally, intentionally challenging and saying provocative things. And that\u2019s not art at that point. It\u2019s not a statement. It\u2019s not. I think part of his character, that\u2019s just like him just being a terrible person.\u201d\n\nAndre Rodrigues, a sophomore studying computer science, said that while art is up for interpretation, the racial undertones of Keynes messages are not. Rodrigues: \u201cI think art can and should be anything you want it to be. But for something that he has to have, like one miracle of a reason to explain it. And if he\u2019s not going to provide a reason, then he can only expect the public to interpret it as it is, which is like explicitly racist in the contemporary context of what that phrase means and what is also meant. And so, yeah, I don\u2019t I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any justification as to why he should run that. And I feel like if anyone, like, I feel like African Americans should know better than most what exactly like that phrase means.

North Korea today fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea.... in the direction of Japan. This is the latest sign that the nation continues to develop its weapons program. This was North Korea\u2019s sixth missile launch in just the last 12 days. Earlier this week. North Korea fired an intermediate-range missile over Japan prompting joint missile drills from South Korea and the U.S. North Korea fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan this week. This was the first time in five years that North Korea has flown a missile over Japan. Many people in the north of Japan were ordered to take shelter.\n\nDerek Grossman teaches Political Science and International Relations at USC. He says this week\u2019s missile launch by North Korea.. over Japan.. was not unique!. Grossman : \u201cNorth Korea, unfortunately, has launched missiles over Japan now seven times. The first was in 1998. The one before this was in 2017. And in 2017, tensions between the U.S./South Korea/Japan and North Korea got really, really heated. And North Korea actually did its nuclear test in 2017. And, of course, now we\u2019re worried it\u2019s going to do its seventh nuclear test in a matter of weeks. And so it seems like recent history is repeating itself.\u201d\n\nProfessor Grossman thinks Kim Jong-un. The Supreme Leader of North Korea.. might be acting partly for petty reasons. Grossman: \u201cI think that I top at the top of Kim Jong Un\u2019s mind has got to be, you know, keeping attention, keeping focus, international focus on North Korea. And what we see now after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a lot of the focus has shifted.\u201d He recalls Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019s trip last August.. not to Kim Jong-un\u2019s country but to Taiwan. Grossman: \u201cThere was a lot of focus on that hot spot in Asia, a lot less so on North Korea. And the problem for North Korea is when we\u2019re not focusing on North Korea, then the possibility of sanctions relief diminishes greatly. Right. And so what Kim wants is sanctions relief and to keep his nuclear arsenal. And we\u2019re saying you can\u2019t have both.\u201d We\u2019re saying that but is Kim listening? He is unpredictable. Will there be more missiles and history as Professor Grossman says: Will repeat itself over and over again?\n```"}

(Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy Kassydi Rone October 06, 2022 at 6:33 pm PDT\n\nMost people are familiar with the acronym STEM -- Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math education, but add a simple \u201cA,\u201d to make STEAM education--and you add into the mix arts and humanities. Now, USC faculty, staff, students and alumni are collaborating to bring STEAM education to thousands of children in South LA communities. And they\u2019ve found a clever way to do it!\n\nUSC\u2019s Joint Educational Project partnered with the nonprofit organization Room to Read for the creation of the \u201cSTEAM-Powered Careers Book Collection.\u201d In this series of 10 books, first through third grade students can explore topics ranging anywhere from polar science to virtual reality.\n\nUSC JEP communications intern, Grace Galante shares how the pillar of diversity extends through the subject matter of the books and into the actual characters themselves.\n\nGrace Galante: \u201cAnd the really cool thing about these books is that they were specifically made for diverse audiences because they want, you know, the kids to see these scientists and these people in these fields that look like them and represent them. Because a lot of the times in the children\u2019s books that we see about, you know, doctors and nurses and scientists, you know, they look a certain way. It\u2019s mostly like white man. That\u2019s just how it is. And a lot of these kids can\u2019t necessarily relate to that.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a trio of diverse main characters that delve into the possibilities that STEAM offers, each book also features interviews with working USC scientists, including perspectives from those who have come from underrepresented communities in STEAM. A look into the daily lives of these professionals provides these young students with an opportunity to see how their path to a STEM career can be achievable.\n\nGrace Galante: \u201cThink like you\u2019re young, years are very formative. And, you know, a lot of people maybe aren\u2019t necessarily conscious of it. But, you know, growing up, those things that happened at the age like impart you so deeply like into your adulthood. And so instilling at a young age that know you are capable, you are start enough, you can be in STEAM. You know, I think that\u2019s something that when they\u2019re, you know, in college or preparing to go to college, that\u2019s something that they might have in the back of their minds that if we they weren\u2019t introduced to that, you know, they might just grow up and just think, oh, that\u2019s that\u2019s not for me.\u201d\n\nGalante got a first hand look into how the community enjoyed these books as students lined up down 32nd street to receive them.\n\nGrace Galante: \u201dAnd you know, obviously taking this job, I was like, oh, like I\u2019m the communications intern. I\u2019m not like hands on on the ground. But then once I started, they had me shadow the schools, help out with some of these events. And so, you know, that was just took me by surprise. But like in the best way, it was a great surprise.\u201d\n\nGrace Galante: \u201cYou know, just seeing, like, the joy on their faces was probably the best part of it.\u201d\n\nAs USC JEP continues to provide resources and curriculum to neighboring schools, the hope is to facilitate a positive change in the bond with residents of the South LA community.\n\nGrace Galante: \u201cI think our programs and other programs through USC are really trying to like strengthen that relationship with the surrounding community. And so I really hope that this is just one of the steps to sort of build that relationship and sort of include them. You know, obviously throughout history we pushed them out. And I think, you know, now it\u2019s our job to bring them back in. And because this is their community, their neighborhood. Well, we\u2019re lucky to go to school here. You know, USC does not own South Central Los Angeles. And so I think it\u2019s important to remember, you know, the community here and how we can best serve them.\u201d\n\nUSC JEP will be hosting school assemblies to introduce STEAM Topics in addition to delivering books in seven schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n```"}

Unless a student is in class, clocked into work or attending a USC-sponsored event, everywhere and anywhere is fair game as long as a photo is snapped and submitted to Duffl USC\u2019s Instagram account as evidence.\n\nDuffl will give the last person standing $300 in Duffl Cash, free delivery for a year, AirPods and a $75 901 Bar & Grill gift card.

During an event hosted by the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism on Tuesday, Dr. Fauci said it would be, \u201ca bit cavalier to...say we\u2019re completely through with [COVID-19],\u201d just weeks after President Joe Biden referred to the pandemic as \u201cover.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should anticipate that we very well may get another variant that would emerge that would elude the immune response that we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Fauci said.

(AP Photo/John Amis)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel\nOctober 06, 2022 at 4:12 pm PDT\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d is a column by Kyle Frankel about fantasy football.\n\nSo... this is awkward. Let\u2019s address the elephant in the room. Seven days ago I proclaimed Kyle Pitts as an \u201cabsolute must start.\u201d Since then, the Falcons tight end put together his worst performance of the season, catching one of his four targets for 25 yards. His 3.5 PPR points marked the third time through the first four weeks that he\u2019s been unable to reach the four-point mark.\n\nI\u2019m an honest man who can admit when I\u2019m wrong. I was wrong. I\u2019ve defended him since he began his NFL journey last year, but I can\u2019t keep believing anymore. When he gets the ball in his hands, he makes plays and shows his physical dominance. However for some incomprehensible reason, the Falcons refuse to give him the rock.\n\nShould you trade him away? It depends on your situation. If you\u2019re 1-3 or 0-4 and need to win right now, see if you can convince someone in your league to take a chance on him. Otherwise, hopefully you grabbed one of my early season waiver wire tight ends. If not, I\u2019ve got someone who can fill that void.\n\nDespite how horrible he\u2019s been, I simply can\u2019t advise anyone to just drop Pitts. Put him on your bench and start someone else. Don\u2019t drop him. I could be wrong, but I will forever convince myself that he\u2019s too much of an athletic monster to be on waivers. The potential is there. If you can afford to stash him, do it and pray he makes us glad we did.\n\nI would\u2019ve loved to give you the usual weekend recap and discuss Zach Wilson returning to football with a career fourth-quarter to bring my Jets the win, but I have to answer for my shortcomings.\n\nThe Pitts Replacements\n\nI preached to buy low on Kyle Pitts and it\u2019s not quite panning out. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not hanging you out to dry. There\u2019s still someone available on the waivers that is more-than suitable for your newly open starting roster spot. Tyler Conklin.\n\nAs a member of the minority that\u2019s actually watched every Jets game this season (which is often a miserable sight), I have seen Conklin\u2019s usage firsthand. I\u2019m shocked he\u2019s still not rostered in the majority of leagues. Through four weeks, Conklin has scored the eighth-highest PPR points among all TEs.\n\nLast week in the Jets 24-20 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, he snagged three of his five targets for 52 yards. Zach Wilson\u2019s return brought a slight dip in his target share, as he averaged eight targets per game during the first three weeks. However, I don\u2019t see this dip in targets as concerning.\n\nThe return of Wilson under center will only give Conklin more opportunities to put up points. The New York Jets went all in on their second-year signal caller this offseason, bringing in multiple talented pieces to help him succeed. Conklin is one of those pieces. He\u2019s a solid pass-catcher who will be used as a safety valve over the middle for the young QB.\n\nWhile Garrett Wilson, Elijah Moore and Corey Davis will be responsible for most shots downfield, Conklin will be there over the middle when the deep ball isn\u2019t available. Not to mention the Jets gave Conklin a $20 million check this offseason. Believe me, they want their money\u2019s worth.\n\nSomehow, he\u2019s available in less than 40% of ESPN leagues. If you wait much longer, he won\u2019t be on the waivers anymore.\n\nMotor City Magic\n\nEveryone\u2019s talking about USC alumnus Amon-Ra St. Brown. They should be, because the Detroit Lions wide receiver is off to a spectacular start. There\u2019s another member of the Lions\u2019 wide receiver corps though that isn\u2019t getting nearly enough love: Joshua Reynolds.\n\nReynolds has quietly put together three-straight weeks of double digit PPR points and back-to-back weeks of 15 points or more. Last Sunday, he brought in seven of eight targets for 81 yards and a trip to the end zone along the way, dropping 21.1 PPR points for his delighted fantasy owners.\n\nHe\u2019s clearly the WR2 in this offense, garnering eight-plus targets from Jared Goff in each of the Lions\u2019 past two games. As a WR2, he\u2019s a great start because the opportunities will be there. Detroit scores, plain and simple. They\u2019re the highest scoring team in the NFL this season, averaging 35 ppg.\n\nIf they want to win, they need to get some touchdowns because their defense has failed to hold an opponent to under 27 points in any of their first four games. Along with St. Brown, Reynolds is nursing a sore ankle and did not practice on Wednesday. However, Reynolds played through his injury last weekend and had his best game of the season while St. Brown sat out.\n\nThey are both listed as questionable for this Sunday\u2019s contest up in Foxborough, but I fully expect Reynolds to play. The injury didn\u2019t limit him last week and shouldn\u2019t be a problem this weekend either.

This phenomenon isn\u2019t only affecting California, but it\u2019s also affecting the outskirts of the Amazon forest in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The Chiquitania region covers most of the eastern part of the department of Santa Cruz and is home to more than 1,200 animal species, some of which are endangered, according to Agencia EFE. According to Kew scientists, there are about 15,000 identified plant species in Bolivia. The diverse flora in the Chiquitania region is not only home to hundreds of animal species, but also provides medicinal plants to the communities inhabiting the region.\n\nPeople in the Chiquitania region rely on nature to survive, but climate change has started to visibly affect their annual crops. The people of Chiquitania mostly rely on rainwater to irrigate their crops. While working with photojournalist Maria Daniel Balc\u00e1zar in late July of this year, I was able to witness the importance of nature to the communities in the Chiquitania region. During the last few days that I was in the Chiquitania region, in San Ignacio de Velasco, I noticed the cloud of smoke beginning to form at a distance. During my time there, it hadn\u2019t rained a single day.\n\nAccording to El Deber, a local news outlet, the smoke in San Ignacio de Velasco is making the air almost too contaminated to breathe. And according to the FCBC, the fires have burnt down about 134,600 hectares of forest. Even though it was the dry season when I visited, local residents told us that it was unusual for it to not rain for such a long time. The heat was another unusual occurrence during my visit. July is winter in the southern hemisphere, but most of the days I was in this region, the temperature was above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nJos\u00e9 Surub\u00ed Llopi\u00e9n is a coffee supplier and the local herbal doctor in San Lucas in the municipality of Velasco. The drought is so drastic that he is one of the few coffee cultivators left in his area; most of them have abandoned their crops to look for jobs elsewhere.\n\n\u201cSometimes there\u2019s coffee here when it rains, and sometimes there isn\u2019t any,\u201d Surub\u00ed Llopi\u00e9n said. \u201cFor example, now it\u2019s flowered twice and the flowers fall because it doesn\u2019t rain. The truth is that coffee gives fruit but only when it rains...It used to rain, but now in these years there\u2019s too much drought and it\u2019s harsh.\u201d\n\nThe drought caused by climate change isn\u2019t only affecting Surub\u00ed Llopi\u00e9n\u2019s harvest, it\u2019s also affecting his medicinal practice with the wildfires consuming the forests in that region. He learned about medicinal plants through his grandmother and has never had a book to teach him about the benefits of the plants near his home. Most of the residents in these communities rely on nature to heal themselves because of lack of accessibility to hospitals. The wildfires directly threaten generational knowledge of herbal cures.\n\nThe municipality of Robor\u00e9 in the Chiquitania region has been thoroughly affected by this year\u2019s wildfires. According to ANF, a local news outlet, in an interview with Ruben Dar\u00edo Arias, the president of the Civic Committee of Robor\u00e9, the municipality of Robor\u00e9 had run out of water trying to combat the fires in the Tucava Valley, a protected area. Rudy Edgar Vargas who\u2019s in charge of the protected area of Tucava through the Santa Cruz government is responsible for protecting the valley against any threats.\n\n\u201cOur work consists of protecting the whole region that\u2019s protected through patrols and inspections,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cWhat do we protect? Any type of threat to the protected area, for example, forest fires, landslides, illegal wood extractions, commercial hunting, and capturing endangered species of animals and plants...we\u2019re already in the dry season so what\u2019s most critical to us are the forest fires...The principal objective of creating this protected area is to protect and take care of the river sources.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the municipality has run out of water trying to combat these fires shows the severity of the drought within the region. While I was in the Chiquitania region, I noticed that the water levels of every body of water I came across were about one meter lower than their usual level. Even though we visited during the dry season, our guide informed us that these are concerning water levels.\n\nThe incidence of fires in the department of Santa Cruz have been increasing to devastating levels since 2019. According to The Foundation for the Conservation of the Chiquitano Forest, in 2019, 2020 and 2021 forest fires consumed 3.7 million, 2.2 million and 2.3 million hectares respectively. The majority of the area burnt down each of those years was concentrated in protected areas. According to research from the Universidad Mayor de San Andres, about 18 million animals died during the 2019 wildfires in the Chiquitania region.\n\nMost people I talked to while in the Chiquitania region would emphasize the importance of protecting nature. With the construction of new highways that facilitate access to this region, tourism has increased significantly. Even though local residents appreciate tourists who come to learn about the culture, some refuse to sell their land to large corporations trying to profit from the tourism in the area.\n\nErwin Duv\u00e9 Domich\u00e1 has a property that overlooks the Tucava Valley, which is a prime location for tourism. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in this place since 16 years ago with my wife because this was her father\u2019s land,\u201d Duv\u00e9 Domich\u00e1 said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to preserve, we\u2019re reforesting what had been cut down before...We\u2019ve had big offers to build cabins, hotels and societies but we don\u2019t want that because that will impact the essence of nature. As long as we\u2019re living here we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re going to maintain it as is.\u201d\n\nWith several points of fire within the Tucava protected region, Duv\u00e9 Domich\u00e1's property is in danger of being burnt down along with all the effort he and his wife have made to try and reforest the land. Climate change is devastatingly noticeable in the Chiquitania region. Not only is nature at stake, but also, people\u2019s livelihood, culture and generational knowledge about herbal cures found within the forests.\n\nTo stay updated with the latest news about the fires or to donate, follow Alas Chiquitanas, a non-profit organization that helps preserve the Chiquitania region.\n```"}

The story follows detective Hae-joon (played by Park Hae-il) as he investigates the mysterious death of a man while growing increasingly attached to and obsessed with the victim\u2019s widow, Seo-rae (played by Tang Wei). As the investigation continues, Hae-joon becomes infatuated with Seo-rae, constructing this relationship as he watches her during stakeouts and treats her to dinner in the interrogation room. At a certain point in their entanglement, the two are forced to make that decision on whether to walk away from the other.\n\nPark Hae-il as Hae-joon in \u201cDecision to Leave.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Festival de Cannes)\n\nThe film seamlessly blends aspects of a traditional detective flick and a schmaltzy romance reminiscent of Korean love dramas. It is a different take and tone from Park\u2019s usual work, deviating from the grim brutality of works like \u201cSympathy for Lady Vengeance\u201d and the twisted thrill of \u201cOldboy.\u201d Instead, it uses mild comedy and sentimentality to display how the protagonists\u2019 detective-suspect relationship grows into both something more, yet still remains ever-stagnant. Their relationship can be described as intrusive at the start, as the detective\u2019s heavy breathing fills the theater when he watches her. Repeatedly, a technique is used where two people who are apart physically seem to break space and time while on the phone or using binoculars to stand face-to-face in a room.\n\nAt a screening held at the USC School of Cinematic Arts on Monday, Park discussed this through a translator, calling it a \u201cgoofy technique,\u201d but also the most \u201caccurate method to express a character\u2019s emotions.\u201d Vice Dean of Faculty Akira Mizuta Lippit with director Park Chan-wook and translator at the Eileen Norris Cinema Theater on Monday, Oct. 3, 2022. Park was awarded the Sergei Eisenstein Award by the USC School of Cinematic Arts following a screening of \u201cDecision to Leave.\u201d (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nThis sense of closeness is best seen throughout the film\u2019s gorgeous cinematography that utilizes the contrast between the big picture and the little details to show the intense intricacy of police investigations. At times, a wide shot of a beach will portray people on the scale of ants and others, close-ups show ants crawling on a dead man. Even subtle shifts in camera focus are crucial to the film. In some shots, Seo-rae will be blurred, out of focus, but Hae-joon can be seen clear as day. According to Park, \u201cThis was achieved through the use of VFX and the focus basically moves according to who is speaking the truth at the moment.\u201d\n\nThis experience is further personalized through the depiction of Hae-joon\u2019s insomnia. The film is riddled with creative transitions, from clearing a table to make room for a new scene to a dead man\u2019s eye morphing into Hae-joon\u2019s. Scenes blend into each other without real distinction and create a question of reality and dreams, which is something seen in films such as \u201cOldboy.\u201d Of course, because this film holds a drastically different tone from his gritty classic, the context of these moments are completely different.\n\nIn one scene, Seo-rae uses her caregiving techniques to help Hae-joon sleep, and the scene dissolves into something taken right out of a K-drama. It shows the two together at a Buddhist shrine on a rainy day, keeping each other\u2019s company as they share umbrellas and Seo-rae rubs chapstick on Hae-joon\u2019s lips. Such transitions make it so the scene both feels real and also dreamlike at the same time.\n\nTang Wei as Seo-rae and Park Hae-il as Hae-joon in \u201cDecision to Leave.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Festival de Cannes)\n\nThis is just one of the ways Park walks the line between police drama and love story. Where it becomes most evident is in the film\u2019s interrogation scenes. He said that if this was an ordinary detective film, these scenes would be dry with \u201cyour typical two chairs, the one fluorescent light on the ceiling in a dark setting and high contrast glow.\u201d On the other hand, he said if he made it a typical romance film, \u201cmaybe the two characters would have been walking along the forest or drinking coffee together at a cafe in Paris.\u201d Using production design and lighting techniques, Park sought to marry the two ideas into a single, cohesive idea. He said, \u201cIt had to be one unified thing: all the stakeouts, all the watching... it all had to be a part of the relationship process.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Park\u2019s depictions of modern technology on screen, such as smartphones and other devices, strengthens the bonds between characters. While technological devices are notorious for being tricky to adapt in film, Park was able to find a way to not only portray them creatively, but also make them necessary to the plot. PC cafes, Siri, translation devices and smart-watches are ever present in the film.\n\nTang Wei as Seo-rae in \u201cDecision to Leave.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Festival de Cannes)\n\nHae-joon constantly texts Seo-rae in the awkward way teenagers try to start text conversations with their crushes throughout the film. In all those moments, his face is reflected behind a loading message, slowly anticipating a response. Seo-rae, who is originally from China, has to use a translation app to avoid mistranslations such as \u201conly\u201d into \u201csolitary,\u201d while communicating with Hae-joon. Voice recordings become especially important as a detective watches every detail of his suspect\u2019s life, and ultimately records their most intimate moments.\n\nBy the end of it, the romance aspect of the film actually overtakes the detective component. While there\u2019s plenty of murder to go around, these cases eventually reach their end, but the love between protagonists seemingly continues drifting into uncertainty.\n\n\u201cDecision to Leave\u201d is an excellent tale that is not only impressive from a technical standpoint, but impressive because it views those techniques as essential. In capturing the feel and emotions of both types of stories, Park effectively blends two genres into a single film without making either feel like a disposable subplot. While slow-moving at times, it leaves space for viewers to contemplate and unravel this mystery of relationships themselves.\n\nIn the film, Seo-rae asks the question, \u201cIn Korea, if the person you love gets married, does the love cease?\u201d The same question can be applied within different contexts. When the chase ends\u2013even in death\u2013do their feelings and desire for one another end?\n\n\u201cDecision to Leave\u201d will officially release in theaters in the U.S. starting October 14, 2022.\n```"}
{"key": "/2022/10/05/what-to-consider-when-reporting-on-iran-from-the-equity-board/", "response": "```\nWhat to consider when reporting on Iran, from the Equity Board\n\nWhy addressing nuance and remaining mindful when reporting on Iran is key.\n\nRecently, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini (also known by her Kurdish name Jina Amini, which she was not allowed to go by in Iran) was arrested by the Islamic Republic or Iranian morality police who enforce the Islamic Republic\u2019s dress code. It\u2019s worth noting that there has been Islamophobic rhetoric surrounding Iran; this is not an Islamic morality police, but the Iranian government\u2019s morality police. She was arrested for improper wearing of her hijab, but it is also integral to note that she is from the Kurdish minority in Iran, and integral reasoning behind her targeting. To ignore Amini\u2019s Kurdish identity would be to miss an integral part of the story. She was pronounced dead three days later in a hospital after she fell into a coma.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, \u201cIran\u2019s Islamic Republic requires women to cover up in public, including wearing a \u2018hijab\u2019 or headscarf that is supposed to completely hide the hair.\u201d It is also important to note that hijab doesn\u2019t just refer to the head scarf; it is an overall concept of modesty for both men and women. What constitutes good or bad hijab is arbitrary and up to the morality police, and, as in other cases, can be influenced by the identity of the person approached by the morality police. For example, Black Iranian men have not been allowed to wear locs by the morality police. Thus, the want for bodily autonomy applies to everyone, not just women, and is only one of the demands of the protestors.\n\nIt has been widely suspected that the morality police beat Amini to death following her arrest, resulting in her fatal coma. The latest information can be found here surrounding the situation. Not all Muslim countries have these rules; as previously mentioned, the morality police is a government entity, not an Islamic entity. As we reported last week, Amini\u2019s death has galvanized Iranian feminist groups, activists, minority groups, and journalists on the ground and online. As previously mentioned, the demand for bodily autonomy is just one aspect of the protests, in addition to economic freedom, freedom from discrimination and the demand for more democratic processes. Many of the protests, and arrests, have been in areas with large Kurdish populations.\n\nAnd as we continue to report on these mobilizations, it\u2019s important to recognize that these actions are not unprecedented in Iran. In fact, for decades, Iranian women have manifested in support of their rights. This quote from the previously cited AP story, captures the long history of Iranian women\u2019s resistance: \u201cHistory and recent events in Iran leave us in no doubt. Women\u2019s desire to be free to choose could not be strangled or silenced,\u201d explained Farzaneh Milani, an Iranian scholar and professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Gender Studies Department.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Iran\u2019s history of political movements, it might be because western media traditionally underreports news stories from the Middle East, Global South, Latin America, and other non-western regions. According to CARE International, 9 out of the 10 most underreported humanitarian crises in 2021 happened in these regions. More recently, western media\u2019s reporting of the Ukraine-Russia conflict may exemplify these coverage discrepancies and Eurocentric biases. In February, a CBS news correspondent reporting from Kyiv commented, \u201cUkraine isn\u2019t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a quote from The Washington Post dissecting the incident and its larger implications: \u201cSuch coverage resorts to Orientalist concepts of \u2018civilization\u2019 that have long been present in European colonial discourse,\u201d said Denijal Jegic, a postdoctoral researcher at Lebanese American University in Beirut. \u201cThis implicitly suggests that war is a natural phenomenon in places outside of the Euro-American sphere, and the Middle East in particular, and that war would take place because of a lack of civilization, rather than due to unjust geopolitical power distribution or foreign intervention.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s important, as both journalists and news consumers, to approach underreported world events with nuance and care. It is also important to consider that both Los Angeles and USC have substantial Iranian populations. It is vital to address this nuance in any story surrounding Iran to avoid spreading misinformation or harming the very communities we report on.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of iStock)\n\nBy Jonathan Martin\nOctober 05, 2022 at 6:24 pm PDT\n\nIt might sound too good to be true for students thinking of flying home for the holidays: A shuttle directly to LAX terminals will be provided for students free of cost. Starting with the upcoming fall break, students will not have to beg their friends for rides to LAX or drain their bank accounts with ride-share services.\n\nThe Undergraduate Student Government has launched the pilot program SC\u00dcP, a free, \u201csafe and sustainable\u201d shuttle service that will run from USC to LAX. The free service will be made available for the upcoming fall break on October 12 and 13 with a single pick up location on McClintock Avenue in between the football practice field and the track.\n\nCarlo Di Bernardo, a senior studying transportation and engineering, and Sarah Stienecker, a sophomore majoring in political science, have been collaborating with professors and faculty to promote the launch of the shuttle with flyers around campus, social media posts and a new QR code that will direct USC students to the SC\u00dcP website.\n\nDi Bernardo has been working on this shuttle plan and hopes the shuttle can continually assist students in the future. \u201cThe funding has been put out. There is a full plan for the entire year. So, it\u2019s very exciting, and I\u2019m really hoping that this is something that can actually last,\u201d Di Bernardo said.\n\nThe shuttle will also be accessible to students with disabilities, with Gold Coast Transit supplying the 55-person buses to the university. The buses are accessible to people using mobility devices and will be able to accommodate wheelchairs, scooters and similar mobility devices, according to Gold Coast Transit website.\n\nThe SC\u00dcP buses will be equipped with free Wi-Fi, air conditioning, comfortable seats and luggage spacing. The driving forces behind the shuttle initiative are accessibility, safety and sustainability. The shuttle will be free to all students during academic breaks when trips to LAX are in high demand.\n\nIn addition, the shuttles will have one SC\u00dcP representative on each bus, helping with luggage and keeping track of how many students are on the bus. \u201cBy having a capture of one fourth of the student population, we do estimate to cut about 17,000 pounds of [carbon dioxide] over 17 service days, which is environmental sustainability,\u201d Di Bernardo said.\n\nStienecker, a Los Angeles native, recalled that upon arriving at USC she was surprised to find that USC transportation did not offer a shuttle service. She ended up spending hundreds of dollars on Ubers to and from her house, which inspired her to join Di Bernardo in his shuttle project.\n\n\u201cI was just really ecstatic to join the project and even more excited that it\u2019s actually happening. All day, I\u2019m just super excited that people can finally get their tickets and take part in this amazing project,\u201d Stienecker said.\n```"}

Well, the good news for USC students is that they can now book a free ride to Los Angeles International Airport for fall recess.\n\nA pilot program funded by the Undergraduate Student Government, SC\u00dcP, aims to provide safely and environmentally-friendly transportation services to every student to the airport. In response to the Green Week initiative on campus, senior civil engineering student and the founder of SC\u00dcP, Carlo Di Bernardo, describes how he started this program.\n\nCarlo Di Bernardo: When we talk about sustainability, it\u2019s in the simplest way moving people with less vehicles possible. Every single academic year, over seventy thousand pounds of carbon dioxide are emitted when students travel from USC to LAX round trip. That is equivalent to cutting down every tree on campus.\n\nWith seventeen service days for starting the program, Di Bernardo projects a long-term solution for student transportation during every academic break.\n\nCarlo Di Bernardo: By the end of the pilot, which is this academic year, we will have a framework to run this service every single year going forward in the best and most sustainable way possible.\n\nThe President of the Undergraduate Student Government, Hannah Woodworth, believes higher riderships with SC\u00dcP service can benefit the greater student body.\n\nHannah Woodworth: The students have been signing up rapidly. We have the capacity for about 1500 students for this first fall break program, but we plan to expand that for winter break as more students will be traveling. Our goal is to eliminate that barrier to entry for students to travel during breaks. All students should have an equal opportunity to be able to go home, explore, and the costs of a fair to the airport should not be a big factor.\n\nTo reserve a spot in the shuttle, students can sign up through SC\u00dcP\u2019s Instagram account at scup.usc.

What do some young baseball prospects think about it?\n\nNew York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge smacks his record 62nd home run of the season. (Photo courtesy of AP)\n\nBy Ian Roddy October 05, 2022 at 6:01 pm PDT\n\nFor 61 years, the American League record for most home runs in a single season remained untouched. But on Tuesday night, the baseball world watched as Aaron Judge clobbered his 62nd home run of the year, eclipsing Roger Maris\u2019s long-standing milestone of 61. The New York Yankees slugger drove a slider into the left field seats to open up the first inning of play in the second game of a doubleheader in front of a record crowd at Globe Life Field.\n\nAfter a season that saw Judge passing Yankees milestones like billboards on a highway, this officially puts a bow on the entire thing. Judge became the first player in the post-steroid era to enter such an exclusive stratosphere of MLB greats. Some have already taken to calling him the \u201ctrue home run king\u201d in reference to the fact that the only players to hit more than 62 homers in a season were all on performance-enhancing drugs at the time.\n\nIt\u2019s because of this fact that many, at least until Tuesday, viewed Maris\u2019 American League record of 61 as the clean, untainted MLB record. Among those already crowning Judge home run king include Maris\u2019 own son, Robert Maris Jr.\n\nWhen asked what he believes the true all-time home run record is, Judge himself told Sports Illustrated: \u201c73, in my book. No matter what people want to say about what happened in that era of baseball, for me, they went out there and hit 73 homers and 70 homers and that\u2019s for me what the record is.\u201d\n\nBut what about the younger generation of baseball players? After all, these are the stars of tomorrow. What are their overall thoughts on Judge\u2019s historic season? And does it put him over guys like Barry Bonds (73 home runs) or former USC Trojan Mark McGwire (70 home runs)?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good for the sport,\u201d said Ryan Costeiu, currently the 29th-ranked prospect for the Los Angeles Angels. \u201cBaseball needs things like this to keep people entertained... Obviously it\u2019s not the all time record but pitchers are so much better now than McGwire or Sosa ever hit off of.\u201d\n\nCosteiu, a pitcher himself, said he still views Bonds as the home run king, but that Judge is right there with him, above Sosa and McGwire in his book.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an unpopular opinion. \u201cI think the crown still belongs to Bonds,\u201d said Gunner Mayer, a prospect for the Philadelphia Phillies. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Judge can\u2019t get there, but he\u2019s also still new in the game.\u201d\n\nJudge\u2019s home run ball was caught by Texas Rangers fan Corey Youmans, who is yet undecided on what to ultimately do with it. It has been reported that Youmans already has a $2 million offer on the table from JP Cohen, president of Memory Lane Auctions in Tustin, California.\n\nThe most expensive home run ball ever sold was hit by McGwire when he smacked his then-National League record 70th home run in 1998. The ball sold for $3 million in 1999.\n```"}

(Photo by Salome Nebiyu)\n\nBy Salome Nebiyu, Shane Dimapanat and Carson Dorais\nOctober 05, 2022 at 5:53 pm PDT\n\nUSC football is once again a hot ticket. But for some students, that ticket is counterfeit. On social media platforms including GroupMe, Snapchat and Discord, USC students are worried and warning each other after several students sent money for tickets they never received.\n\nKali Wilding, a sophomore majoring in business administration and real estate development, said she sent money for two resale tickets, but never received the tickets or a response after sending the money. \u201cI called [the scammer] and then called them again,\u201d said Wilding.\n\nIn other instances, scammers may ask students to give the money to the scammer\u2019s friend or significant other via Venmo. Once given money, the account disappears, leaving students ticketless.\n\nCristina Got, a sophomore majoring in occupational therapy, said she initially paid half of the reseller\u2019s asking price with the intention to send the second half after receiving the ticket, but the seller did not send any tickets. \u201cThe person that I actually got scammed for was asking for $105 for three tickets, and I only sent half of them, so I only sent $50,\u201d Got said. \u201cAnd I got scammed for that $50.\u201d\n\nGot said one scammer even took a USC student\u2019s identity, impersonating that student while reselling tickets. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going around claiming to be a student at campus, and they have a photo of the ID,\u201d Got said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t actually that person because I contacted that person on Instagram, and she\u2019s aware of it now.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Media was able to connect one of the alleged scammers by text message. The person denied scamming any USC students but stopped commenting when pressed for more answers.\n\nIn response, students have taken to group chats to warn others about potential scammers and their methods. But the chats themselves have been compromised by people selling fake tickets there.\n\nJerri Lopez, a sophomore majoring in business, said a GroupMe chat, USC tickets!, that was once reliable now feels risky. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of bummed because this group chat last year was really helpful if I wanted to sell tickets or buy them,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s kind of just a shame that it\u2019s been taken over by hackers or scammers.\u201d\n\nThe USC Ticket Office will sell individual student section tickets for a minimum of $80 per game for the remainder of this season. But, students who purchase the season tickets for $200 sell individual game tickets for much cheaper on unofficial marketplaces.\n\nWith the high prices of individual tickets on the USC Ticket Office website and students reselling their tickets for less, students are often inclined to seek tickets from other marketplaces, thus more susceptible to being scammed.\n\nDespite this, students have not reported these types of scams to the Department of Public Safety. When questioned about the prevalence of these scams, a DPS spokesperson said, \u201cAt this time, DPS has not received any reports that students have been victims of a scam involving football game tickets. Any student who is scammed is encouraged to immediately report it to DPS so that officers can investigate.\u201d\n\nDPS also has some tips so that students can take precautions that might protect them from being scammed, although none of these options catered towards this type of scam.\n\nThe USC Ticket Office also has tips on reselling tickets.\n```"}

This comes after world chess champion Magnus Carlsen lost to Niemann, walked out of the Sinquefield Cup, and then strongly implied Niemann cheated on Twitter. Niemann has admitted to cheating before in online games. The report mentions this while concluding that Niemann likely cheated in more than 100 games-some as recent as this past August. But what they couldn\u2019t find was evidence of any cheating in his game with Carlsen nor in any in-person games.\n\nJack Peters is a professor at USC and an international master at chess. He believes that we shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions based on a past track record. Jack Peters: The two positions are mutually exclusive. Maybe he did cheat in Internet games. Who cares? But he can\u2019t be accused by Magnus of cheating against him just because he may have cheated in the past.\n\nVijay Damerla, a member of USC\u2019s Chess Club, echoes some of these thoughts, saying that despite the accusations, Niemann is still human. Vijay Damerla: I think that chess grandmasters need to be held to a high level, and cheating multiple times is not okay. However, chess grandmasters become grandmasters as early as the age of 12, and 12-year-olds make mistakes, 16-year-olds make mistakes, 19-year-olds make mistakes. And so I think it\u2019s important to zoom out of the chess world and understand that these are still human beings, and human beings have flaws.\n\nPeters says that Magnus acted purely out of emotion, and that there was likely no foul play in Niemann\u2019s checkmate. Jack Peters: I can tell you that I analyzed the two games that Hans beat Magnus, and he played well. He didn\u2019t play extraordinarily well or like a computer would play and Magnus played well, as usual...he\u2019s a good enough player that if there were no cheating involved and he played Magnus ten times, he\u2019d win a game or two.\n\nBut how will this affect the chess world? With two prominent players butting heads beyond the board, Damerla says that the community will be divided. Vijay Damerla: I think that this is going to be one of those things that just splits the community down the middle because everyone loves to take a side - have a strong stance on something. After their game in St. Louis, it seems that Niemann and Carlsen are engaged in a new battle - one using the pawns of social media and bishops of scandal. It will likely be up to the community as to who takes the king.\n```"}

The three day event is held each fall and \u201coffers families a snapshot into the life of your USC student and provides an up-close look at how the campus community achieves excellence in teaching, research and public service,\u201d according to the USC Family Weekend website.\n\nThe weekend will kick off Thursday with a host of events and seminars, followed by a free concert by new wave 80s band Flock of Seagulls at 8 p.m. facilitated by USC Visions & Voices. Other highlights include receptions with the dean of each school, an address from President Carol Folt and the Trojan Football Rally.\n\nRegistration for family weekend costs $125 and will increase to $150 after October 7. This includes all events listed on the 2022 program but increases by an additional $50 if families would like to reserve tailgate spots on campus for the football game against Washington State University at 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Tickets to the actual game must be purchased separately and range from $105 to $225.\n\nUSC does offer scholarships for families to cover registration but not travel costs or accommodations. These steep prices have deterred some students and their families from participating, especially those who aren\u2019t from California.\n\nVictor Falcon, a sophomore studying business administration, says that his family won\u2019t be visiting from Kyle, Texas for family weekend because of the cost. \u201cIt can easily be a $200 flight, and that\u2019s if you plan it out,\u201d Falcon said. \u201cAnd the hotels are expensive. I was looking at the prices for the USC Hotel, and that\u2019s like $500 a night.\u201d\n\nFalcon said that the inaccessibility of events like family weekend for out-of-state students can be alienating and has even made him reconsider his choice of school at times. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd like, sometimes I wish I would have gone to UT Austin. But I mean, I\u2019m here at USC. I have to make the most of it. This is my first time away from my family, right? It\u2019s good to experience that.\u201d\n\nMuxuan He, a second year doctoral student, said she feels that family weekend prioritizes students whose families live close or can afford to travel to Los Angeles. She is an international student from China and has not seen her family since last August because of political barriers and financial reasons. \u201cNo one would expect China to be so disconnected from the world and global society at this time,\u201d she said. \u201cSo [Chinese international students] feel, maybe abandoned is the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was a family weekend thing going on,\u201d He continued.\n\nStill, other students said they are excited for the chance to celebrate USC\u2019s resurgent football team with their family, especially after many domestic travel restrictions have been lifted.

On September 30, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law the Freedom To Walk Act (AB 2147), permitting California residents to jaywalk without receiving citations as long as people cross safely.\n\nStudents had mixed reactions to the bill. Some appreciated it, while others were indifferent or dismissive. Chanel Blue, a senior studying sociology, questioned why jaywalking is an issue that requires immediate attention. \u201cI think there [are] a lot of other laws or bills that need to be passed or enacted rather than dealing with jaywalking,\u201d Blue said. But she also expressed concerns over pedestrian and driver safety. \u201cMore people are probably going to get hit [with the law in place],\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the state, when the Freedom To Walk Act takes effect in January 2023, a person can walk across the street outside of crossing intersections without receiving a citation, assuming no vehicles present any danger. Police can still write citations and ticket individuals if individuals jaywalk in dangerous conditions. The act says that police officers should not stop to cite a pedestrian unless a \u201creasonable\u201d person could recognize a potential collision with a vehicle and chooses to cross the street regardless. Officer discretion still matters for the gray areas in that description. Two officers may see \u201cimmediate danger\u201d differently in any given situation.\n\nDemocrat Assemblymember Phil Ting of San Francisco, who first proposed The Freedom To Walk Act, echoed many peoples\u2019 attitude towards jaywalking upon the bill\u2019s signing. \u201cThe sentiment is very simple that we all have the right to cross the street without being fearful of being cited unnecessarily,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nOne student doubted the utility of the bill as a whole. \u201cIf people just have common sense to not be crossing at stupid time, I don\u2019t think a bill ... really does anything,\u201d said Anthony Winney, a senior majoring in mathematics and computer science. But the bill could lead to a decrease in police handing out a disproportionate number of citations to people of color. According to LAist, Black people received 32% of jaywalking citations in Los Angeles between 2010 and 2020 despite only making up 9% of the city\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cFor too long, our jaywalking laws were used as a pretext to stop and harass people, especially low-income people and people of color. The reforms enacted in AB 2147 will put an end to that and, in doing so, make all of California safer for pedestrians,\u201d said Zal Shroff, senior staff attorney at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, via the statement on Ting\u2019s personal website.\n\nDespite his doubts as to how the bill will affect civilians\u2019 behavior, Winney applauded the law as a step forward in reforming law enforcement\u2019s approach to criminal justice. \u201cI really appreciate the push to decriminalize petty crimes,\u201d he said. \" I think that jaywalking is absolutely something that has been a tool for racial profiling and other profiling or police having egos.\u201d\n\nCarly Rieger, a sophomore studying communication, emphasized how the bill is beneficial to California residents and gives pedestrians the option to cross streets earlier, without the fear of being ticketed. She explained how jaywalking is a large issue in her home state, New York, and appreciates the step towards safe, efficient crossing habits. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that you can\u2019t get in legal trouble for simply crossing the street if you\u2019re doing it safe,\u201d Rieger said.\n```"}

Between thrilling games, coaching changes and superstar performances, I\u2019ve got you covered with everything you need to know from this past weekend\u2019s results out of the Pac-12.\n\nUSC (5-0, Week 5 result: 42-25 win vs. Arizona State)\nThis was a tale of two halves for the Trojans. Arizona State was getting whatever they wanted on offense in the first half against USC\u2019s defense. However, the Trojans flipped the switch at intermission and only allowed eight points to the Sun Devils after allowing 17 in the first half. While the defense did struggle for a good portion of the game, the offense was spectacular and got back on track after a sluggish performance against Oregon State last week. Transfer sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams was dazzling as his dual-threat ability provided a problem for the Sun Devils the entire game. USC now has a vital matchup against Washington State and will need both sides of the ball to show up, or the Cougars will give USC a difficult time.\n\nUtah (4-1, Week 5 result: 42-16 win vs. Oregon State)\nUtah\u2019s defense shined yet again against a solid Oregon State team. Utah forced four turnovers, and sophomore cornerback Clark Phillips III was the game\u2019s MVP with three interceptions, including a pick-six. Utah has found its identity as a team which has been very impressive to witness. Junior quarterback Cameron Rising has been a stud so far this season. If the defense and Rising can continue their superb start to the season, Utah will be a serious Pac-12 title contender.\n\nOregon (4-1, Week 5 Result: 45-27 win vs. Stanford)\nTransfer senior quarterback Bo Nix was essentially written off after a whirlwind career at Auburn. Despite Nix\u2019s abysmal debut with Oregon against Georgia, he has turned a new page in his career, and he became one of the best quarterbacks in college football. This week he showed off his dual-threat ability powering Oregon over Stanford in a 45-27 win. Nix threw for 161 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed for 141 yards, adding two scores with his legs. If Nix can keep up his phenomenal play so far and Oregon\u2019s defense can play with more consistency, the Ducks are up there with the rest of the herd to contend for a Pac-12 championship.\n\nOregon State (3-2, Week 5 Result: 42-16 loss vs. Utah)\nOregon State entirely fell apart this weekend against Utah. Junior quarterback Chance Nolan had been dependable up until his four-interception performance last week against USC. This week, he had another deficient performance before he exited with a neck strain. There is a lot of uncertainty now with a team that had a promising start to the season. The extent of Nolan\u2019s injury is unknown, so quarterback going forward will be a significant question. Freshman quarterback Ben Gulbranson had a lousy outing when he replaced Nolan. However, Senior quarterback Tristian Gebbia has playing experience and even upset Oregon in 2020. OSU isn\u2019t in panic mode yet, but things are certainly starting to look that way.\n\nStanford (1-3, Week 5 result: 45-27 loss vs. Oregon)\nAfter losing 45-27 to Oregon, that marks three consecutive weeks in which Stanford\u2019s defense has allowed over 40 points. The stat that stands out from this weekend is that they allowed 351 rushing yards. The one positive from the game, despite his 20.3 quarterback rating, junior quarterback Tanner McKee did not turn the ball over for the first time this season. Stanford now prepares to face Oregon State in a game that is virtually a must-win if Stanford wants a decent bowl game.\n\nWashington (4-1, Week 5 Result: 40-32 loss vs. UCLA)\nIn the most surprising outcome of the weekend, Washington was upset by UCLA. Washington was red hot to start the season behind a superb start from transfer redshirt junior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. Despite another outstanding performance from Penix, Washington lost because UCLA completely exposed their weak passing defense. Washington also showed an enormous lack of discipline, with nine penalties for 98 yards. After being significantly fond of Washington the past few weeks, I am now worried about them because they have some particular kinks to clean up.\n\nColorado (0-5, Week 5 Result: 43-20 loss vs Arizona)\nLet\u2019s not talk about Colorado\u2019s 43-20 loss versus Arizona. I talk about a Colorado blowout every week in this column, but I want to focus on the future of Colorado football. Colorado fired head coach Karl Dorrell on Sunday after the season\u2019s 0-5 start. The program currently consists of a lackluster roster and will be an immense task for someone to rebuild. They need to bring in an experienced recruiter and coach who can come in from day one and ultimately shift the culture. Colorado needs a long and extensive search to get back to relevance in college football.\n\nArizona (3-2, Week 5 Result: 43-20 win vs. Colorado)\nArizona took their turn of being the team of the week to beat up on Colorado. Sophomore quarterback Jayden de Laura had a career day as he threw 484 yards and six touchdowns. Arizona also had three receivers go for 90-plus receiving yards, including junior wideout Jacob Cowing, an emerging superstar in the Pac-12. If Arizona can continue to get the ball in Cowing\u2019s hands, they will be a hard team offense to stop down the stretch.\n\nArizona State (1-4, Week 5 Result: 42-25 loss vs. USC)\nArizona State\u2019s first-half performance impressed me. They were doing everything right and looked like they would give USC a run for their money. However, they completely abandoned their first-half game plan and looked like a deer in headlights during the second half. Interim head coach Shaun Aguano did a solid job for what he currently has with this rebuilding program. I think their highlight of the season very well could be that they were only down four at halftime to USC. As ridiculous as it sounds, not much is going right in Tempe, Arizona. ASU has a tough rest of the season schedule, and it seems they are just looking toward the future.\n\nUCLA (5-0, Week 5 Result: 40-32 win vs. Washington)\nMy favorite quote from the weekend was from UCLA senior quarterback Dorian Thomspon-Robinson, who said, \u201cPeople were saying all week that we\u2019re the worst 4-0 team out there and writing us off. I think my boys came here with a chip on their shoulder.\u201d This was a complete statement win by the Bruins, who completely unleashed their passing attack against a weak Washington secondary. UCLA will now face the most formidable opponent they will have faced this season as they prepare to take on Utah at home.\n\nCal (3-2, Week 5 Result: 28-9 loss vs. Washington State)\nCal didn\u2019t show any signs of life during a 28-9 loss to Washington State. Coming off a 49-point outburst against Arizona last week, this was very interesting. Cal couldn\u2019t find anything in the run game, and the offensive line didn\u2019t play up to standards. Cal\u2019s performance should worry fans as they prepare to take on three ranked opponents in the next four games.\n\nWashington State (4-1, Week 5 Result: 28-9 win vs. Cal)\nWashington State continues to impress week in and week out with another critical win as they beat Cal 28-9. Despite his two interceptions, sophomore quarterback Cameron Ward had an eye-opening performance as he threw for 343 yards and three touchdowns. Washington State will now have its most challenging task yet as they go to Southern California to take on USC. A win could alter the course of their entire season.\n\n\u201cUnpack the Pac\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Samuel Reno\nOctober 05, 2022 at 3:01 pm PDT\n\n\u201cStoppage Time\u201d is a column by Sam Reno about NCAA women\u2019s soccer.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest road trip. Last season\u2019s edition in the Evergreen State proved to be the difference in a Pac-12 title race decided by a singular point between USC and UCLA. It was a test the Trojans failed in 2021, leaving Washington with just two points while their neighbors in Westwood escaped with a four-point weekend. Sure, UCLA\u2019s head-to-head win on the final night made it official, but surviving the weekend away from home could have rendered the result of that Nov. 5 contest irrelevant.\n\nThis weekend in Oregon, however, there were no dropped points for USC. They leave with no holes, no weaknesses. Nine points up, nine points down \u2013 in lockstep with the reigning conference champs.\n\nSo, why did nobody see this coming? And why does nobody seem to believe it? Not a single coach picked USC to win the 2022 Pac-12 title in the preseason coaches poll. When the votes were all tallied, the Trojans came in at fourth \u2013 trailing Stanford, UCLA and Washington State.\n\nDespite starting the season at No. 15 nationally, a shorthanded loss at Purdue let them go five straight weeks without receiving a vote while remaining otherwise unblemished. Even after dismantling No. 6 TCU 3-0, it still took four more weeks to jump back into the top 25.\n\nFor some context, that loss to Purdue came during the Boilermakers\u2019 welcome week on a night they broke their attendance record by more than 1,000 while playing without four starters \u2013 Simone Jackson, Simi Awujo, Zoe Burns and Brooklyn Courtnall \u2013 who were in Costa Rica for the U20 World Cup.\n\nTo answer the previously posed questions, hype is only delivered to programs with a historical precedent for validating it. Although USC is one of only seven programs to win multiple NCAA titles, they\u2019ve never dominated a regular season from start to finish. The Trojans have never won an outright Pac-12 title, as was well discussed during last season\u2019s chase. In fact, they\u2019ve only claimed as much as a share of the prize once \u2013 a split with UCLA and Cal back in 1998.\n\nHistory says this team isn\u2019t capable of sustaining the 11-game stretch of play required to top the Conference of Champions, and, incorrectly, many chose to listen. USC led the Pac-12 from the jump a season ago, and if all-time leading goal-scorer Penelope Hocking doesn\u2019t go down with an injury, they likely would have crossed the finish line before the Bruins ever got their chance to stop them.\n\nThis year\u2019s campaign, in spite of the departures of Hocking and USWNT midfielder Savannah DeMelo, boasts a deeper, more talented roster than the last. Croix Bethune \u2013 topdrawersoccer.com\u2019s No. 1 player in the country \u2013 and Jackson \u2013 author of the fastest hat trick in the history of the CONCACAF U20 Championship \u2013 are nothing short of showtime. These two have already dazzled with back heel passes, nutmegs, free kick goals and some of the best combination play in the country with the production to back it up.\n\nBethune leads the Pac-12 in assists, and she and Jackson have 18 combined goal contributions to their names. Courtnall and Burns, with four combined goal contributions, have proven to be reliable ball carriers and distributors while still bringing the one-on-one defending that earned them All-Pac-12 honors a season ago.\n\nAwujo and Helena Sampaio have racked up a combined seven assists out of the midfield, bringing the attacking creativity DeMelo supplied throughout her decorated career.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to that Pacific Northwest road trip. Last season, in a pair of games against Washington and Washington State, USC scored twice and conceded twice over those 220 minutes. This time around, in contests against the Ducks and the Beavers, the Trojans won the weekend 9-1 on aggregate with six different players finding the back of the net. And, most importantly, six points instead of the two-point trip that was 2021.\n\nUCLA is a perfect 11-0, a record that includes a stretch of three straight road wins over Santa Clara, Duke and North Carolina. The reigning Pac-12 champs have more than justified their spot at No. 1 in the national rankings. But what ultimately revealed the gap between the L.A. schools a season ago has given us no such indication this year.\n\nUSC is every bit the national front-runner UCLA has been hailed as, and if you\u2019re still choosing to doubt, I ask you look no further than the Pacific Northwest road trip.\n\n\u201cStoppage Time\u201d typically runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

The authors were joined by Laura Casta\u00f1eda, USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism professor and associate dean of diversity, inclusion, equity and access, Fel\u00edx Gutierrez, Annenberg professor emeritus of journalism and Oscar Garza, Annenberg professor and director of the specialized journalism (M.A.) program who moderated the panel.\n\nAccording to Puente, the roots of this book stem from the mutual agreement that Latinx journalists were lacking guidance. \u201c[Not] only do we not see ourselves reflected accurately in the media, but we just don\u2019t have a book to teach,\u201d Puente said. \u201c[We\u2019re] all doing innovative things.\u201d Ayala echoed this sentiment but also expressed some frustration with content like this book taking so long to hit the mainstream. \u201c[There] just were no materials and so it\u2019s amazing that this exists, but God, why did it take so long?\u201d\n\nOne focal point of the book is changing not how often the Latinx community is covered but rather how well the community is covered. \u201cWe will be covered. It\u2019s how we are covered and how accurate we are covered,\u201d Gutierrez said in his opening remarks. Reporting on Latino/a/x communities emphasizes Latinx coverage, but specific chapters focus on other groups lacking representation like Latina journalists and LGBTQ+ journalists, with Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s chapter, \u201cReporting on Latinas: \u2018She\u2019 Se Puede!\u201d being a prime example.\n\nAlthough the target audience is the Latinx community, Puente says the book is not exclusive. \u201c[We] just don\u2019t want this to be a book for Latino journalists or Latino journalism students,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should be for all journalists and I think non-Latino journalists need it more.\u201d Garza also believes that sharing the book\u2019s knowledge with non-Latinx journalists is still beneficial to Latinx journalists. \u201c[It\u2019s] almost more important for non-Latino editors and news directors to know this,\u201d said Garza. \u201cThere\u2019s a burden that comes with being a Latino journalist...which is now you\u2019re the in-house expert ... and that\u2019s a burden you shouldn\u2019t have to assume all the time.\u201d\n\nIn regards to the next steps, Garza thinks Reporting on Latino/a/x Communities and books to follow put journalism on a path to improve two elements: helping those in power positions understand the Latinx community and providing Latinx-specific outlets. These outlets are beginning right on college campuses with two prime examples being USC Annenberg\u2019s D\u00edmelo desk and Cal State University Long Beach\u2019s D\u00cdG en Espa\u00f1ol magazine.\n\nBooks like Reporting on Latino/a/x Communities are important because they set the standard for a new genre in journalism. However, the work is far from over. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step in the right direction, but it\u2019s a first step,\u201d said Gutierrez. This direction is decades in the making, but these authors and professors are confident students now will push the conversation forward.\n```"}

After holding Arizona State to minus-6 rushing yards in the second half of Saturday\u2019s game, the Trojan defense set the tone during Tuesday\u2019s practice. Their fiery energy radiated through their drills while \u201cI\u2019m on a new level\u201d pierced through the air.\n\nDuring practice, the team screamed in unison, \u201cSC\u201d and the defense continuously clapped, hyping each other up following the Trojans 42-25 win over Arizona State. Junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu said the defense knows how to be seen as a threat to other teams.\n\n\u201cBy just going out there and hitting someone in their mouth and letting them know who we are as the Trojans,\u201d Tuipulotu said. \u201cThat sets the tone.\u201d\n\nWith 33 seconds left on the clock Saturday, Arizona State\u2019s redshirt junior quarterback Emory Jones threw the ball on third-and-11. USC sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock read Jones\u2019 eyes and knew exactly where the ball was going.\n\n\u201cI sat there for three seconds because I knew our defensive line was putting pressure on [Jones],\u201d Bullock said. \u201cSince he had to get the ball out quickly, I knew he was going to throw it to the tight end, and I broke before he even threw the ball.\u201d\n\nBullock said it felt great to catch his second interception of the season. But he wasn\u2019t too fond of who stopped him from getting a touchdown on the return.\n\n\u201cAt the end, I was tackled by the quarterback,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cI had to laugh it off.\u201d\n\nBullock\u2019s pick wasn\u2019t the only interception the USC crowd saw. Although sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams threw for 348 yards and three touchdowns, the Trojans also had their first turnover of the season when Williams threw an interception in the end zone.\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley was not worried about Williams\u2019 hesitation during Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cAs the [offensive coordinator] and the head coach, you want to see it all clean and perfect all the time,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAt times, it\u2019s not. We have to be able to improvise and know what we want to do from there.\u201d\n\nRiley said Saturday\u2019s matchup against Washington State may look like a different game. Washington State\u2019s defensive style is similar to that of USC. The Cougar defense has held its opponents\u2019 offenses to less than 17 points in four out of five games.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re aggressive up front and their linebackers and safeties are active,\u201d Riley said. \u201c[We have] to be on [our] game assignment and understand that this game can look a lot different than Arizona State.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans are ready to set the tone against Washington State during Trojan Family Weekend.

The three-hour event taking place at McCarthy Quad will feature student drag performers, a gender-affirming clothing swap and the drag troupe United Queendom. This event is being held by the LGBTQ+ Student Center in collaboration with USC Queer and Ally Student Assembly for International Pronouns Day for the first time since its inaugural festival in 2018.\n\n\u201cAll the L.A.

The month was set in October to include the pre-existing October 11 National Coming Out Day and the anniversaries of the first two marches on Washington for LGBTQ+ rights. Another reason October was selected that\u2019s especially important to students is that it falls within the academic school year.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks are not here during Pride Month when a lot of the different organizations are able to provide visibility and community building opportunities,\u201d Monz\u00f3n said. \u201cFor us, it is a chance to not only learn our history but to have a little bit of that private moment on campus during a time when all of our students are here.\u201d\n\nThese events provide an opportunity for students to meet other members of the LGBTQ+ community and learn more about its history in a safe environment, an experience they might not have had access to before coming to college.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a freshman, knowing those spaces were created was such a beautiful thing,\u201d Sophie Hall, co-artistic director of the Dorothy\u2019s Friends Theater Company, \u201cFinding people in those places can feel very safe,\u201d\n\nThe Dorothy\u2019s Friends Theater Company, stylized as \u201cdftc,\u201d works to promote positive queer representation and stories in theater at USC.

A new partnership between unexpected bedfellows \u2013 a real estate developer and a pastor \u2013 may offer a solution for at least a few dozen people in need.\n\nWith a shovel in hand, Carl C. Baccus, the pastor of Southside Church of Christ, joined forces with local Southern California developer, John Stanley Inc. to break ground on what will be a 50-unit affordable building offering housing for seniors on Manchester Avenue.\n\nThe partnership is between real estate developers John Stanley, Inc., Southside Church and Innovative Housing Opportunities, a non-profit organization that specializes in building affordable housing for veterans, those living with mental illness, formerly unhoused people and developmentally disabled people.\n\nAccording to a press release from Newswire, the building, called \u201cSerenity\u201d by developers, will offer lodging for 18 unhoused people, 18 unhoused older adults and 14 independent older adults.\n\nAccording to Realtor.com, as of August 2022, the median listing home price in Downtown L.A. is trending up by 8.8% year-over-year. The average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in Downtown L.A. is currently $2,841, according to Zillow. This represents a 7% increase compared to last year.\n\nAlthough certain cases of homelessness have trended down in recent years, Spectrum News 1 found that homelessness among seniors had increased by 6.5% as of September 13. Senior citizens in particular are feeling the impact, as they live on fixed incomes.\n\n\u201cMy vision to break ground on this housing development took over 40 years to be realized,\u201d Baccus said.\n\nPresident of John Stanley Inc. Saki Middleton said the vision for this complex is to house unhoused and low-income older adults, but also to provide retail space to the local community. Middleton believes this will benefit the community by providing businesses and services.\n\nThe hope is that the project will encourage investment from other developers and investors, she said. Their plan is to design a market-rate project, despite the fact that it is an affordable building.\n\nThe group is still finalizing the specifics about the types of businesses that will go in the retail space at the Serenity complex.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a final agreement with the tenants. However, the goal is to provide healthy food and provide space for new locally founded and based businesses,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cThe tenants would create new jobs for the community.\u201d\n\nThe primary goal of constructing this complex is to house individuals in the community who can no longer afford to live there. Furthermore, the project aims to bring construction to the area and revitalize lots that are no longer in use.\n\nNate Lockett, a neighborhood local who was formerly unhoused, said that one of his concerns was \u201cthe bigger problem.\u201d Because drugs such as cocaine, heroin and now meth have been a long-time struggle in the area, a project like this \u201cmight be a temporary solution to a bigger problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe USC Village, a retail and housing area right off campus was built in 2017 to alleviate the need for students to find off-campus rental solutions. According to Zillow, South L.A. rents have increased by 17% since January 2021.\n\nKenji Corbisiero, a resident of the USC area, stated that the true tension in terms of affordable housing in the area stood between management companies and the local residents. Corbisiero said that often when residents do not have good credit, management companies charge \u201can arm and a leg\u201d for a deposit.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t fit the bill for what they\u2019re looking for, they\u2019ll lie to you and tell you that there is no space available,\u201d Corbisiero said.\n\nBuildings like Serenity may relieve these tensions in the community, Baccus said.\n\n\u201cGod is faithful, and the Southside Church of Christ is committed to serving the whole man both physically and spiritually,\u201d Baccus said.\n```"}

For better? The music, with huge thanks to its Gabber influence. For worse? The lyrics.\n\nSince her time in the 1980s with the Sugarcubes, Bj\u00f6rk has earned a name for herself through thoughtful lyrics, artful vocal interpretations and melodic abstractions. Her acclaim has few limits and her legacy of sonic worldbuilding has paved the way for transformative musicians such as Arca. Her highly anticipated album, \u201cFossora\u201d was recently released to more of that acclaim. \u201cFossora,\u201d mostly earns this hype by exploring themes including relationships, motherhood and the #MeToo movement and continuing Bjork\u2019s masterful creative direction.\n\nIn \u201cFossora,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk plays with the idea of fungi and gravity while molding her style with Gabber, a genre of hardcore techno originating in the Netherlands, to convey a sense of \u201clanding,\u201d like feet on the ground. The strength of this album\u2019s instrumentation, however, was unable to distract from hollow lyrics that failed to meet this project\u2019s thematic goals.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cAtopos\u201d, featuring Kasimyn, begins with vocals that sound alternatingly closer and far away, as though they were traversing time, like a fleeting memory. The clarinets echo in the background as though they were narrating an evil Sesame Street rhyme, a reminder that the plant reaching closest towards the sun has the darkest shadows under its petals. Perfectionism is always an overcompensation, erasing the flawed aspects of life that distinguish it from artificial reality.\n\nIn the context of a relationship, it erases the quirks that you once loved in the face of hardship, something echoed later in the album with \u201cFreefall\u201d \u2014 a soft and intimate ballad about an aging relationship that highlights the scope of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s vocal range. Another interpretation of Bjork\u2019s message yearns for peace and connection between people with different beliefs following a hectic past few years.\n\n\u201cIf my plant doesn\u2019t reach towards you / There\u2019s internal erosion towards all / Pursuing the light too hard is a form of hiding,\u201d she sings. More importantly, all you can make out by the end of \u201cAtopos\u201d is that \u201cHope is a mussel...\u201d Or \u201cHope is a muscle.\u201d Whatever. If you contort your thoughts to match your perception of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s, it nearly makes sense. Hope is the lifeform attachment reminding you that everything has value. Or, it is literally a muscle, something exercised tirelessly in the depths of a difficult relationship that only grows stronger as things digress.\n\nAll of which is very apparent in the skeletal and robotic beat that drives the song, like a zombified Jane Fonda working you to death. The drum in \u201cOvule\u201d goes \u201ctsk tsk tsk\u201d alongside ascendant, propulsive vocals. It\u2019s telling Bj\u00f6rk no, in comparison to lyrics that read as a digestion of emotions. The music is irreverent in its treatment of your expectations. Notes never land where you expect.\n\n\u201cThe hostility a broken heart endures / the velocity of that injury is returned to the world / with the same grin showing teeth,\u201d she sings. A lost relationship is eulogized in the face of a new beginning \u2014 a child. In that child, the love that was once shared comes back to Bj\u00f6rk with a similar face, but without all the ire. Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t make sense how you can love that face all over again. But you do. \u201cTsk tsk tsk.\u201d And that love is so transcendent that it needs to be prioritized over everything that occurred in the past.\n\nBj\u00f6rk\u2019s lyrics truthfully isolate one of the most conflicting aspects of being a parent in a household as \u201cbroken\u201d as this tune\u2019s rhythm. The imagery of a glass egg carrying Bjork\u2019s most cherished moments from her former relationship represents its precariousness. As the avatars inside that memory continue their romance, the physical Bjork has a permanently altered perception of loving that is only repaired by her dedication to her child. By the song\u2019s end Bjork has vowed to end the relationship\u2019s old habits and focus on her child, permanently raising the egg from her reach.\n\nThe old habits aren\u2019t restricted to fighting, however, and she comes to terms with the idea that raising her daughter in peace means sacrificing even the best parts of her partnership.\n\nI could see the eponymous \u201cFossora\u201d (also featuring Kasimyn) in a dramatic, all-female, off-Broadway rendition of Louis Sachar\u2019s \u201cHoles.\u201d It\u2019s a highlight of the album, but feels out of place on the tracklist. There\u2019s a sense of whiplash as a listener coming from \u201cFreefall,\u201d a pleasant ditty about falling/being in love. The powerful lyrics call to mind legions of women digging away at generational trauma and planting their roots for kin to come, but are almost sidelined by a kick that hits a thousand times, like shovels cracking the crust of the earth.\n\nIt\u2019s the sonic portrayal of realizing how badass all of your female ancestors are. This song has what\u2019s missing from others reconciling Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s relationship with motherhood. Mothers might just be like the Medusa. You can\u2019t face them dead on, lest you be turned to stone. The song\u2019s final lines, \u201cEven though the ground is burnt (Fossora)/Underneath monumental growth/Fossora (Fossora, Fossora),\u201d is Bjork recognizing that the loss of her mother has pushed her emotional resilience to its limits and taught her in the process. She gathers the strength to get through by digging deeply into her lineage and capitalizing on her maternal instincts, something alluded to by the track\u2019s alternating first and third person perspective.\n\nA moment of haunting peace is offered by the somber melodies of \u201cFagurt Er \u00ed Fj\u00f6rum,\u201d before the scariest idea conjured by this album \u2014 even beyond being devoured by fungi\u2013 is introduced. \u201cVictimhood\u201d starts off strong, with deep woodwinds on top of a simple tapping meter and industrial horn. It\u2019s potentially a landmark in the generally apolitical Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s public stance. With the context of #MeToo looming over this album, and no other tracks feeling as relevant, \u201cVictimhood\u201d is a hard pill to swallow.\n\nHowever, It\u2019s also supported by a cappella cries that underscore the helplessness of its subject matter as they\u2019re swallowed up by ominous clarinets and a Gabber beat. \u201cVictimhood / Has a saintly glow / Holier than thou / It erased my shadow(shadow) / Only bird\u2019s eye view / Can help me / Transcend this archetype,\u201d she sings. But it also reads as a tad victim-blamey. It seems to criticize other victims who aren\u2019t as strong as the author sees herself; those who are, in her eyes, actively choosing to remain victims.\n\nIt\u2019s a criticism of victims that only someone who has been victimized could make, begging the weaker person to try and imagine more important issues than their trauma. It is another opinion without nuance that hides behind an interesting concept. The correlation between victimhood and rejection is particularly discomforting and seems at direct odds with \u201cAtopos\u2019\u201d messaging. Where that song asks for love and respect amongst all people, \u201cVictimhood\u201d calls the sentiment naive.\n\nFor all of the song\u2019s intensity, it feels aimless. Altogether, the songs about Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s relationship with her mother tell a beautiful story, but individually fall flat when it comes to \u201cdigging deeper.\u201d \u201cFossora\u201d is the kind of album that is dampened by its context. Still, Bj\u00f6rk continues to excel in her conceptual worldbuilding through instrumentation. The extent of thought and imagination put into the album make up for lyrics that occasionally dip into simplicity. It\u2019s also singular in its kind. Bj\u00f6rk is making music for a new generation of mothers, even if she isn\u2019t completely sure how to do it.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Rene Jakobson)\n\nBy Camryn Brewer\nOctober 04, 2022 at 7:10 pm PDT\n\nThe lead soloist for the score of \u201cThe Woman King\u201d flew all the way from the United States to Scotland without so much as a script or music sheets to accompany her. Five-time Grammy-winning jazz vocalist Dianne Reeves had no idea what notes she was going to sing until she pulled them from her gut and thrust them into the air of the recording studio. All she knew was that producer Terence Blanchard wanted her and only her.\n\n\u201cI remember going to Scotland and not quite knowing exactly what he [Blanchard] wanted me to do,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd he looked at me and said, \u2018I just want you to be you.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018oh my God,\u2019 there\u2019s a space outside of the stage to be in a position like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can walk on the stage with shoes that hurt, and when I walk right on the stage, my feet stop hurting because now I\u2019m going out to do this thing that I am connected to that is greater than I am,\u201d Reeves explained. And \u201cThe Woman King\u201d recording studio felt no different to her.\n\n\u201cIt felt like the most comfortable place because that\u2019s how I feel on stage, you know, that place where I\u2019m connected and I just allow my feelings to be front and center.\u201d\n\nWith the title screen glowing on the wall behind her, director Gina Prince-Bythewood told the story of the Agojie, an all-female military regiment saddled with the responsibility of protecting the African kingdom of Dahomey. The pair swung from triumph to tragedy, sewing personal anecdotes into the film\u2019s narrative until they struck a chord: protagonist Nawi loses her sister figure in battle.\n\nReeves explained, \u201c[Prince-Bythewood] told me one story, and I\u2019m telling her that this particular story just happened in my life with my sister, and so we\u2019re going back and forth. Now my emotions are at an all-time high.\u201d\n\nReeves\u2019 gaze focused on the screen against the wall where Prince-Bythewood showed her scenes from the film to prompt her vocals. Watching the saliva pool from Nawi\u2019s lips as she screamed in grief, Reeves pushed her voice into the microphone until the vibrations shaking between her vocal cords became the heartbeat of an ethereal belt.\n\nYes, Reeves\u2019 vocal contributions were entirely improvised. The improvisation process was not new to Reeves, however. Improvisation lies within the essence of jazz as an art form. To improvise successfully, Reeves needed to fully immerse herself in the moment and let the sounds take on a life of their own. It was organic.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re raw,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no time to edit or doubt. You just feel what you feel in that moment and let it go. And so every time I would just trust myself, just do it. You hear the harmonies, you know what to do, just do it. I wouldn\u2019t even think. I only felt my way through this movie.\u201d\n\nWithout singing a full word throughout the entire score, Reeves\u2019 voice embodied the emotional journey of these women. Through a series of guttural sounds and exacting chord progressions, her voice simulated language while remaining otherwise wordless. The only moments in the entire score that contain lyrics are those filled with the cumulative chants of the Agojie warriors.\n\nThe Agojie battle cry consists not only of the whoops and screams of determined warriors but concrete chants of sworn sisters rallying each other to fight for Dahomey\u2019s freedom. \u201cBlood of our sisters! Make us invincible! You live for me, and I for you!\u201d\n\nDonned in white with grins glued to their cheeks, the newest warriors partake in a blood oath to initiate becoming official Agojie. The power of this moment lies not only in the sung words themselves but in their collectivity. Each warrior\u2019s voice stacks on top of her sister\u2019s as she takes the oath. Rejoicing in their triumph, their voices ring out in chorus in a way that feels reminiscent of ancestral gospels.\n\nFor Dianne Reeves, a battle cry pulls directly from the deepest emotions that live within the core of a determined people. \u201cIt\u2019s just letting go of what is inside and just letting it, whatever it is, into the universe, letting your emotion just rise without even thinking about it, letting it out,\u201d Reeves said.\n\n\u201cWhen I listened to them, whatever they were dealing with, they had a purpose. They had destruction, they had determination, they had all of these kinds of things that they needed to work together in sisterhood.\u201d\n\nAs humans, we rely on sound to communicate with one another, yet, distinguishable words are not the only vehicles of meaning. The sounds that Reeves made in the studio blended with feet stomping the ground, swords clashing against armor, and hands clapping other hands. Together, this confluence of sound emanates the emotional lifeblood of the Agojie experience solely through the power of vibration.\n\nReeves traces her connection to vibrational sounds back to her childhood intergenerational home. \u201cGrowing up and knowing the difference from when she [her grandmother] said \u2018mmm\u2019 to me, or \u2018mhmm,\u2019 those are just sounds, but I knew in the moment what they meant,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cThat is the thing that I felt that they wanted in this film.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Hayes Flanagan, Sam Bitman, and Ethan Inman\nOctober 04, 2022 at 6:48 pm PDT\n\nThe last time USC football boasted a 5-0 record in a full season was in 2006, when many current Trojan undergrads weren\u2019t even in kindergarten yet. This thrilling start has not only garnered students\u2019 attention, but has also put USC on the map nationally. USC\u2019s undefeated record and consistently high scoring have earned the team a #6 national ranking in the most recent AP Poll. Fans have hopes for a Trojans\u2019 college football playoff appearance and potentially a chance at their first national championship since 2004.\n\nStudents, faculty, and members of the extended Trojan family have made it clear that they feel like they are part of something special this season. \u201cIn Los Angeles, you need three components to build a following. You need to win. You need to be entertaining when you win. And you need to have star power,\u201d said Jeff Fellenzer, associate professor of professional practice at USC Annenberg who has decades of experience in sports media. \u201cAnd this USC football team really checks all three of those boxes very clearly.\u201d\n\nTrue to Fellenzer\u2019s assessment, students said they have been more happy to cheer on the Trojans this season than last. \u201cIt really excites me because last year we sucked. We were so bad,\u201d said Charlie Leoni, a sophomore majoring in acting. \u201c[Winning] makes this year more exciting to go to the games and more exciting to tailgate with friends.\u201d\n\nStudents like junior psychology major Sepi Nazarian are thinking big \u2013 national championship big. \u201cI\u2019m very excited and actually very proud. I have seen the morale go up,\u201d Nazarian said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to win it all.\u201d\n\nNazarian is not the only student eager to see the full potential of the team. \u201cI see [the excitement] in my classes,\u201d Fellenzer said. \u201cThere are more questions about the team, more observations, more hands going up to weigh in on developments with the team, with the program.\u201d\n\nThe buzz has spread to college football fans across the country. Alessia Lubrano, a junior studying public relations, said that people from the East Coast have taken notice of the Trojans\u2019 excellence. \u201cPeople from my hometown in New Jersey text me or call me every time we have a game and when we win,\u201d Lubrano said. \u201cThey\u2019re supporting me from so far away.\u201d\n\nThis weekend the Trojans host the Washington State Cougars, who hold a 4-1 record and recently received the most votes of any FBS team outside of the AP top 25 poll. As USC has yet to face a ranked opponent, the stage is set for what could be the most exciting game yet. The Trojans also look toward marquee road matchups against #11 Utah and #18 UCLA on the horizon. With a prime time slot of 4:30 p.m. on FOX this Saturday, USC has the potential for even more fans, more energy, and more investment in Trojan victory.\n```"}

It can be streamed on Disney+, Amazon Prime and Vudu.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas\nA true classic of the Halloween genre, \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas\u201d is one of Tim Burton\u2019s most timeless films and perhaps his most artistic. The film follows the infamous Jack Skellington, a character whose name conjures up images of the creepy and yet endearing skeleton man.

Its themes coupled with its excellent animation and loveable characters, makes it one of the most unique Halloween films in its time. You can watch it on Disney+, Youtube and Vudu.\n\nWhether you enjoy being scared in your home, on campus or out in L.A., you won\u2019t be bored this Halloween season.\n```"}

Parents were confused, and you might be, too. An honest mistake or a deceitful plan? Who knows? Tyler Pak and Matthew Tsai have the story.\n\nOn Monday, Los Angeles Unified Futbol Academy (LAUFA) parents attended what could be mistaken as a routine mandatory meeting. According to one parent present, Robert Hernandez, attendees were surprised when they were handed signs that read \u201cLatinos for Rick Caruso\u201d and LA mayoral candidate Rick Caruso appeared to speak.\n\nHernandez wrote that some of the parents felt as though the LAUFA and Caruso had deceived them with a covert campaign event. Here\u2019s the first tweet in his Twitter thread from Monday:\n\nRobert Hernandez: Wow. Y\u2019all my kid\u2019s soccer club called a meeting...it turns out we are being used for a Rick Caruso campaign event. None of the parents knew. Many took time off work for this. When you see these pics know that they was a setup under false pretense.\n\nThe tweet caught fire, receiving 1,500 likes and over 500 re-tweets. Parents were also upset because as a nonprofit organization, the LAUFA is not allowed to endorse political candidates. However, things were not as they seemed.\n\nRocky Delgadillo, the president of the LAUFA, issued the following statement today:\n\nRocky Delgadillo: We at the Los Angeles Unified Futbol Academy (LAUFA) take pride in the full development of all our youth soccer players and encourage community and civic engagement. This was an informational event. This was optional and we would do the same for any candidate. Unfortunately, there was a misunderstanding with the invite issued. We welcome civic engagement with all candidates.\n\nIn a final tweet about the situation, Hernandez clarified:\n\nRobert Hernandez: A reporter reached out to the club and spoke with the president who said it was a misunderstanding. A staffer on the club sent out an email for an optional event. He says people misunderstood it as mandatory. This event was NOT organized by the Caruso campaign.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Tyler Pak and Matthew Tsai.\n```"}

Nora Miller has the story on voter mobilization.\n\nMidterm elections are just around the corner, and USC is working to ensure students have a better idea of how their vote will count. USC Price School of Public Policy professor Mindy Romero is heading resources for the USC community. Her most recent effort is a voter access Zoom webinar on Thursday at 12 p.m.\n\nROMERO: We\u2019re going to talk about really the state of access for voters, from disability rights to outreach and voter education efforts for a broad range of groups, particularly historically under-represented groups. The discussion will also include two state-level election officials from Georgia and Colorado. The event can shed light on the state of voter access in California and hopes to discuss the possible impacts of the constantly evolving voting methods today.\n\nROMERO: What we\u2019re talking about here is people\u2019s access, ability, opportunity and, quite frankly, challenges, to being able to actually participate and how do we get a representative electorate.\n\nRomero identifies the biggest roadblock facing youth voter turnout as the disconnect between current policy and young people.\n\nROMERO: We don\u2019t support young people in helping them learn how and why it\u2019s important to mobilize really key. And instead, young people turn 18 and we expect them to magically both know how to vote and want to vote.\n\nOnly about 50% of young people typically vote while around 76% of people from 65 to 74 vote according to the United States census. Romero also noted this while she was discussing the event.\n\nROMERO: There\u2019s lots of research in the elections field that shows that the best motivator, our trusted messenger, is a fellow young person for young people, peer to peer contact.\n\nThe mobilization of young voters impacts policy within communities and leads to a disconnect between people who want to be involved and do not know how.\n\nROMERO: If young people care about a certain set of issues, they want to see real change to affect themselves, their communities, the world. It\u2019s a multi-pronged approach. Voting is one very important part of that approach.\n\nThis year\u2019s election is coming up soon on Tuesday November 8th.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\nBy Nia Harris\nOctober 04, 2022 at 6:10 pm PDT\n\nLebron James. Anthony Davis. Russell Westbrook. The infamous trio here to save Los Angeles. The NBA season is right around the corner and the Los Angeles Lakers are back for yet again another chance to win an NBA Championship. Nia Harris has more.\n\nLast season the Los Angeles Lakers disappointed their fans, being eliminated in the play-in-tournament. The Los Angeles Lakers spent the off season rebuilding their team in hopes of a better season than last. Part of that effort was hiring a new head coach, Darvin Ham, for the team in hopes to execute changes needed to be potential championship contenders.\n\nThe Lakers struggled last season defensively, this off season they added new players such as Patrick Beverley and resigned players such as Dennis Schroder to strengthen their defensive depth. Kendrick Nunn is a returning player for the Lakers who will also help on the defensive end of the ball.\n\nGoing into this upcoming season, health is a concern in the success for the Los Angeles Lakers. Maintaining a healthy team will benefit the Lakers winning record. Due to injury, their superstar duo in LeBron James and Anthony Davis missed multiple games in the previous season. LeBron only played 56 games and Anthony Davis only played 40 games out of the 82 regular season games.\n\nLukas Landsgesaell, a Lakers fan from Germany says; \"I think health is probably the most important thing, especially with Anthony Davis because he was often injured and last season I think James, Westbrook and Davis only played 21 games together. And I think if they can stay healthy then yeah, it will be better than last year.\"\n\nWith the new additions to the team roster, chemistry is a major factor in the new construction of this team. Having multiple dominant players like LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook who are known facilitators, seeing how the players share the ball will depict if this team\u2019s chemistry will hinder their ability to win.\n\nCameron Cole: \"That\u2019s going to be hard. What might work better is if LeBron takes more of an off the ball approach and just tries to figure out ways to get less touches, but maybe be more of a facilitator, maybe possibly take him point guard. So give him less touches. Let other people who need it work.\"\n\nSays Cameron Cole, a senior studying computer science and business at USC.\n\nAs stated previously, the trio has only played 21 games together, winning only 11. Hopefully, unlike last season\u2019s 41 changes in the starting lineup this season brings more stability.\n\nThe Lakers off season brought many adjustments to their roster but fans still believe the Laker\u2019s competition may be too much of a challenge for them to go far this season.\n\nCameron Cole: \"I don\u2019t think they can make it to the conference finals. You\u2019ve got too many good teams that are going to be ahead of them.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see how the Los Angeles Lakers perform when their regular season starts Oct.18th.\n```"}

Anna Thomas, a freshman studying biochemistry, is looking forward to Rihanna\u2019s early hits. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a Rihanna fan, but I know some of her older songs from the early 2000s...songs like \u2018Pon De Replay.\u2019\u201d\n\nAngelynn Huang, a junior studying biomedical engineering, agreed. \u201cI feel like everyone knows her most famous songs, like \u2018Umbrella,\u2019\u201d said Huang, highlighting one of the songs that played a pivotal role in making the singer a household name.\n\nSeveral students commented that Rihanna\u2019s discography requires more spectacle than the average performance. Emre Aricioglu, a junior studying biomedical engineering and a Rihanna fan, is looking forward to the visual effects whereas Emily Nguyen, a junior studying human biology, is looking forward to \u201ca more dynamic performance.\u201d Marina Beam, a senior studying business administration, is looking forward to something uniquely Fenty. \u201cSomething unconventional, but at the same time not trying too hard.\u201d\n\nAbove all, students are just happy to see that she\u2019s returned. \u201cHonestly, I need everything,\u201d Beam gushes. \u201cRihanna hasn\u2019t released a couple of hits in a while, so I\u2019ve been having a bit of a Rihanna withdrawal.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really excited,\u201d says Huang. \u201cI feel like she\u2019s kind of a cultural icon at this point.\u201d \u201cI just know she\u2019s gonna go all out,\u201d said Alexis Medrano, a biokinesiology major. \u201cIt\u2019s Rihanna.\u201d\n\nHowever, one student is more concerned with the implications of Rihanna\u2019s performance. \u201cFrom a fan point of view, I am very much excited,\u201d said Matthew Strickland, a junior studying electrical and computer engineering. \u201cA bunch of [popular artists] from our childhood performing together is exciting, but morally, I feel a bit conflicted because previously Rihanna has stated that she...[didn\u2019t want to] work for the NFL when they continue treating Black people in a poor manner.\u201d\n\nStrickland is referring to Rihanna\u2019s statements following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s NFL suspension after his controversial decision to take a knee during the national anthem in 2016. \u201cI couldn\u2019t dare do that,\u201d the singer told Vogue during a 2019 interview in reference to working with the NFL. \u201cFor what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn\u2019t be a sellout. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler. There\u2019s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\u201d\n\nAmid the palpable excitement surrounding the Super Bowl announcement, the comments have not gone unnoticed. A USA Today article described the singer\u2019s decision as \u201cfascinating\u201d while a Jezebel article links the decision to the controversial partnership between the NFL and rapper Jay Z\u2019s label Roc Nation, which Rihanna is signed to. At the time of this article\u2019s publication, Rihanna has not commented on the change in stance.\n\nIf Strickland were to tune in to the Super Bowl performance, they\u2019d appreciate a statement. \u201cI doubt she will [address the shift in stance], but it\u2019s always good to be hopeful because I feel like that\u2019s really important for her to do.\u201d```"}

The sun scorched down on soccer fanatics this past Saturday, but that didn\u2019t stop them from bringing ice coolers and grills to ramp up for a partido amistoso, a friendly match between Per\u00fa and M\u00e9xico. Both countries reign over the culinary scene in Latin America; The rich, decadent scent of dozens of parrilladas permeates throughout the lawn. Each family brings their own saz\u00f3n. Is that carne asada or anticuchos? Probably both.\n\nFans of la selecci\u00f3n Mexicana don their jerseys, dance to banda, and belt out \u201cViva M\u00e9xico!\u201d every few minutes. In a predominantly Mexican community like Los Angeles, it\u2019s no surprise that verde, blanco y rojo are the colors you see the most on gameday. This may be a friendly game, but M\u00e9xico is preparing for the ever-looming World Cup in November. This game is where they test their strategies and defense.\n\nPer\u00fa has a new coach, Juan Reynoso and this match can prove that they\u2019re still a team to watch. Per\u00fa's community in Los Angeles is comparatively smaller in numbers, but they are repping hard, with countless Lapadula jerseys, Inca Kolas in hand and an undying optimism. After a tough loss during the repechaje against Australia in June, disqualifying them from the World Cup, Peruvian fans are excited to show their intense loyalty even for a friendly game.\n\nThe energy shifts near the gate A entrance as Peruvians belt out a guttural chant, \u201cBlanquirroja no le falles a tu hinchada. Poco a poco volveremos al mundial.\u201d Little by little, Per\u00fa will make it back to the World Cup. For Peruvians, every soccer match is a chance for redemption.\n\nThe crowd is filled with gleeful energy and excitement, but as I make my way into the stadium, my stomach tightens and my palms sweat. Each team gears up to play each other. Los himnos nacionales are sung and as a Peruvian-Mexican, what does national identity look like when you proudly represent two countries? Nationalism can be a dangerous display of paternalism and patriarchy, but during soccer games it\u2019s on full display and celebrated. Nobody dares to criticize la madre patria. Everyone is rooting for their respective country and to fit in \u2013you declare your loyalty to your team by defending them until the end.\n\nWhen you grow up in a bicultural household like I did, your family pits your other identity against you, especially during soccer matches. It\u2019s pretty rare that Per\u00fa and M\u00e9xico play each other, but over the years, I\u2019ve had to prove my loyalty by picking only one. So when my family, friends, and partner ask, \u201cA qui\u00e9n le vas?\u201d My answer is usually \u201cEl que gane.\u201d I\u2019ll be happy with whoever wins.\n\nBut at the 85-minute mark, M\u00e9xico scores the only goal of the game and I let out a visceral groan that surprises me. Truthfully, I am always secretly rooting for Per\u00fa to win. The underdog team. Even within the Latinx diaspora, Per\u00fa is often overlooked or ignored. I feel an obligation to lead with that identity first to remind others that we\u2019re here too.\n\nAs Latinos en el extranjero, I understand the displays of nationalism during Independence Day celebrations and soccer games. It\u2019s a portal to our home countries. It evokes a sense of belonging and identity in a country that still sees us as foreign.\n\nIn July 2022, Peruvian Mexican soccer player, Santiago Orme\u00f1o was signed to Guadalajara\u2019s Chivas team, a historically all-Mexican team. This led to an outrage from Chivas aficionados. Orme\u00f1o also plays for Per\u00fa's International team, so when Orme\u00f1o sang Per\u00fa's national anthem during Saturday\u2019s game, diehard Chivas fans also criticized him for that. Orme\u00f1o handles the criticism gracefully and says, \u201cSoy Peruano en M\u00e9xico y Mexicano en Per\u00fa.\u201d\n\nNationalism isn\u2019t meant to foster nuanced conversations about identity. It plays a large role in identity formation, but it falls short for people like me that are searching for belonging in both cultures. Asking me to quantify my identity into halves is to not see me fully.\n```"}

Thirty-five states, and the District of Columbia, legalized sports betting. California could join them if voters approve either Proposition 26 or 27.\n\nProposition 26 would allow in-person sports betting at racetracks and tribal casinos for people over 21. Prop 26 would also allow Native American tribal casinos to offer additional gambling, such as roulette and dice games. The prop would require racetracks to pay the state 10 percent of all sports bets wagered each day. A portion of this state tax would go towards a new California Sports Wagering Fund. The fund would first go to education funding, with the remaining monies used towards gambling addiction programs and the enforcement of gambling laws.\n\nProposition 27 would legalize online and mobile sports betting for people 21 years of age and older. Licensed tribes operating casinos and gambling companies would be limited to state regulation. Like Prop 26, Prop 27 would require a 10 percent tax to be paid to the state each month. Tribes are required to pay $10 million dollars to receive a 5-year license to offer sports betting. All expenses paid to the state would create the California Online Sports Betting Trust Fund. The fund would set aside 85 percent of its funding to support homelessness and gambling addiction initiatives. Fifteen percent would go towards community development for tribes not operating casinos.\n\nMore than 60 Native American tribes have joined the coalition to support Prop 26, including the Barona and Pechanga Band of Indians. Major gaming corporations like FanDuel and DraftKings and some proponents of its homelessness measures support Prop 27. Recently, three Native American tribes also joined the \u201cYes on 27\u2032\u2032 campaign, saying the prop would increase economic growth in their communities.\n\nSupporters of both propositions say regulation is needed or sports betting will continue in illegal and unregulated markets if the measures are not approved by voters. They say California can benefit by managing the markets and by taxing sports betting revenues. Both propositions would expand residents\u2019 access to sports betting, which raises concern for state officials and residents alike. How will California address the increased risks of gambling addiction?\n\n\u201cBy having more gambling you are going to have more public health costs. You\u2019re going to have more addiction, potential harm, [and] bankruptcies,\u201d said Timothy Fong, co-director of UCLA\u2019s Gambling Studies Program. \u201cIs our quality of life better in California because of having expanded and regulated gambling, or is there actually more cost because you have this product?\u201d\n\nFong believes whether or not either measure is passed, it is necessary to lean on state agencies such as the Office of Problem Gambling, housed in the California Department of Public Health, with expertise in gambling disorder prevention and treatment.\n\n\u201cEven if these two propositions do not pass, it will not be the end of this discussion about sports betting in California,\u201d Fong said. I would expect it to come back in future elections. Ultimately, I do feel strongly that it really should be managed well by a state agency.\u201d\n\nIf both propositions pass, Proposition 26 will govern in-person sports betting, and Proposition 27 will regulate the online and mobile markets.\n```"}

Wade, despite abortion matters being a top issue among Democrats. Their panic stems from a years-long project following the tireless efforts of pro-life supporters \u2014 who they call \u201canti-abortion\u201d supporters \u2014 and their initiative to enter a \u201cpost-Roe world,\u201d a journey chronicled in the new documentary \u201cBattleground.\u201d\n\nThe film had its first Los Angeles screening at the West Hollywood Edition hotel on Sept. 20, leaving audiences aghast as they were motivated to elicit change in the abortion movement. Lowen, an Emmy-nominated filmmaker known for directing and producing 2018\u2032s \u201cNetizens,\u201d a feature documentary following a group of women targeted by online harassment, directed and produced \u201cBattleground.\u201d\n\nThe film opens with a voice recording of former President Donald Trump speaking with a group of far-right Christian Republicans, 40 days before the 2016 election. It\u2019s revealed during this recording and throughout the course of the film that Trump promised several anti-abortion organizations that he\u2019d intervene with matters of legislation and the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade in return for their votes in the election.\n\n\u201cBattleground\u201d takes an editorial approach following the perspective of three ambitious women \u2014 Kristan Hawkins, Marjorie Dannenfelser and Terrisa Bukovinac \u2014 as they travel across the country, faithfully attending major anti-abortion events, including the enactment of the Alabama 2019 Human Life Protection Act, former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s funeral service and the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nAll three women effectively and tenaciously rallied large groups of anti-abortion supporters in the years leading up to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling, while pro-choice supporters incredulously sat on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to look at sort of the bird\u2019s-eye view of the power structures and how it\u2019s possible that the \u2018antis\u2019 were being so successful,\u201d Lowen said in an interview with Ampersand prior to the film\u2019s screening.\n\nA moment of clear impact that stood out to the director during the shooting of \u201cBattleground\u201d was summer of 2020 when feminist and civil rights champion Justice Ginsburg died. Lowen had been following the anti-abortion movement for more than a year, and said it became immediately clear that Roe would be overturned, bolstered by the leaked Supreme Court draft decision that surfaced in 2022.\n\n\u201cBeing inside the movement in advance of that happening was a window into just how determined and how organized [the anti-abortion supporters] were,\u201d she said.\n\nShipley, meanwhile, is the CEO of Safe Space Pictures, a media organization responsible for producing social impact stories such as Netflix\u2019s five-time-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7.\u201d When Shipley joined as an executive producer of \u201cBattleground\u201d in September 2021, she felt as if no one in entertainment media had covered the prominence of abortion issues and how quickly they were changing at the hands of anti-abortion supporters.\n\nShipley was furious that there were \u201ccrickets\u201d from the pro-choice side, which she believes led to a domino effect for the women spearheading the anti-abortion movement.\n\n\u201cIt was essential for me that we help Cynthia and team get this film in front of as many people as possible,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cWe want to put stories out there that support filmmakers who take risks and showcase opinions that are different than their own.\u201d\n\nFollowing the film\u2019s screening, former CNN chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin led a thought-provoking conversation with Lowen, the co-founder of Center for Intersectional Media and Entertainment Joy Donnell, and journalist and founding member of I am a Voter, Melissa Magsaysay. Together the group unpacked questions about the surprising demographics of anti-abortion activists, how people of color are disproportionately impacted by anti-abortion policies, and what Democrats and pro-choice advocates still need to do to galvanize voters for November\u2019s election.\n\nOne audience member, who told the panel she was 13 years old, asked what she could do to help pro-choice advocates. Magsaysay encouraged her to engage with her peers about the subject on social media, and Lowen directed her to the \u201cBattleground\u201d website to learn about the multi-partner impact campaign rolling out with the film\u2019s theatrical release on Oct. 7.\n\nIn addition to the film\u2019s release, civil and reproductive rights organizations will attend screenings across the country to engage audiences in a Q&A following the film.\n\nLowen and Shipley\u2019s hope for \u201cBattleground\u201d is that it educates audiences about the ongoing anti-abortion movement from a disparate perspective and encourages them to have conversations with those who have opposing views. But their biggest expectation for the film is that it serves as a catalyst for the pro-choice side to take political action in the same relentless way anti-abortion supporters have shown up for the cause.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much work that needs to be done,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cBut we can be a part of that change.\u201d\n\nFor a list of upcoming screenings of \u201cBattleground,\u201d click here.\n```"}

Speakers like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and two-time track and field Olympic gold medalist Edwin Moses expressed their gratitude in front of the Coliseum\u2019s torch lit in Ueberroth\u2019s honor. \u201cOur greatest angel in the city of angels,\u201d Garcetti said of Ueberroth. Ueberroth, 84, spoke briefly at the event saying, \u201cIn this society that we live in, we can make a difference, we can all make a difference.\u201d \n\nPeter Ueberroth served as the chairman of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee which brought the games to Los Angeles in 1984. After the 1976 Summer Olympic games in Montreal, which left the city  1.6 billion  Canadian dollars in debt, the United States Government restricted funding for the 1984 games. However, Ueberroth convinced the International Olympic Committee that the games could be sponsored by private, corporate funding. The result: a $223 million profit. \n\n\u201cWith Peter\u2019s management, the city didn\u2019t pay for anything,\u201d said Don Matso, vice president of external affairs during the 1984 Summer Olympics. \u201cThe interest of [the profits from the 1984 Summer Olympics] is still paying for underprivileged children in sports in the U.S. Olympic Committee, so it was a rather significant contribution. In Canada, they\u2019re still paying for the games they had in the seventies.\u201d \n\nWith the Olympics making its return to Los Angeles in 2028, Matso believes that without Ueberroth\u2019s contributions, \u201cThere would be no Olympic games,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a legacy.\u201d \n\nUeberroth\u2019s close friends and family were also in attendance, celebrating his lifetime achievement. Alice Saviez has known Ueberroth and his wife Ginny Ueberroth since their freshman year in college. \u201cPete knew that I knew Ginny, and one day he said to me, \u2018Would you introduce me to that girl down there?\u2019 And now they\u2019ve been together for 62 years.\u201d \n\nSaviez added, \u201cI\u2019m so glad they\u2019re having this today because I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s really acknowledged for all that he has done for the Olympics.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe L.A. Games in \u201884 were the most successful ever,\u201d said Debra Duncan, board chair of LA84, which managed Southern California\u2019s endowment for the 1984 Games. \n\nGeorge Pla, president of the Coliseum, credited Ueberroth with putting the city back together. \n\nUeberroth is the 66th inductee into the Memorial Court of Honor.

In 2019, USC\u2019s Viterbi School of Engineering achieved gender parity for the first time as well, with an equal percentage of males and females pursuing an engineering major. Still, some believe that percentages aren\u2019t enough to solve disparities women face in the classroom, particularly in historically male-dominated majors.\n\n\u201cDefinitely in group project situations or clubs where I have to work with more men, I\u2019ve had situations where I felt like my opinions or words weren\u2019t being respected,\u201d Megan Zhang, a junior majoring in business administration with a Viterbi minor in innovation, said. \u201cI had to fight to get my words heard.\u201d\n\nThe issue expands past USC. The Magazine of the Society of Women Engineers reported in 2021 that prior to the pandemic 24% of students who pursued engineering degrees were women. When compared to USC, an official statement released by the dean of Viterbi in the spring of 2020 revealed that the school had the largest number of women engineering graduate students in the nation.\n\nElectrical engineering graduate student Ecrin Yagiz recalled her experience pursuing an undergraduate degree in Turkey, where there were only two other women in her department. Comparatively, there are far more women in her USC masters program this year.\n\n\u201cOne thing that I\u2019m noticing is that especially in the [computer science] classes and in general the CS department, I think the number of women is growing,\u201d Yagiz said. \u201cMaybe people are realizing that anyone can do this.\u201d\n\nStill, despite seeing improvement, gender parity has not been achieved for USC graduate students. In 2021, out of the 1,178 students pursuing a masters in Viterbi, 70.6% were males, while only 29.4% were females. These statistics were clear to Yagiz in her classrooms.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, I was one of the only girls out of two or three,\u201d Yagiz said. \u201cBut it can change depending on the field.\u201d\n\nUSC freshman and biomedical engineering major Cydria Harris feels as though men are more likely to speak up in male-dominated classes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll interrupt the lecture to correct the professor sometimes,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI think males are more likely to ask questions in my math class, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just because there\u2019s more [of them].\u201d\n\nZhang, who studies business administration, shared that out of the 10 business requirements she\u2019s taken so far, only two of her professors were women. On several occasions, she noticed how hard it was to make her voice heard during group projects. Zhang recalled one experience where she was the only woman out of five in her group. Usually surrounded by friends who made space to listen to her, she wasn\u2019t used to this new type of environment: one where she felt she had to fight to make her presence known, and even then, still feel ignored by her male peers. She noted that it was only when her male mentor told her classmates she had good ideas that they listened. Even then, she voiced her frustrations over only being respected after the fact.\n\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just have realized the things I said had value in the first place?\u201d\n```"}

Regenerate aimed to inspire sustainability and mindfulness in the production of artistic activism.\n\nUpbeat rock and roll music set the tone for participants as they mingled and painted cardboard signs reflecting their political frustrations. \u201cI like the experience, the music, the ambiance,\u201d said Hilal Balik, a sophomore double majoring in international relations and global economy. \u201cI like that they\u2019re passionate.

Since Assignment: Earth\u2019s launch last spring, USC has already made strides in achieving neutrality by eliminating single-use plastic bottles at all USC-run events, dining halls and restaurants, which is estimated to have averted the purchase of at least 570,000 plastic bottles.

Between a storied history of Heisman winners, national championships and a massive pipeline to the NFL, this is a natural next step for the Trojans when it comes to competition and media representation.

Many college athletic organizations feel blindsided, left behind or disappointed, Annenberg Media reporting has revealed.\n\nIt was announced in June that USC and UCLA will move from the Pac-12 conference to the Big Ten conference in August of 2024, a decision with ripple effects reaching schools on both the East and West coasts. USC has roots in the Pac-12 dating back to 1922, and UCLA 1928. The crosstown rivals\u2019 switch was prompted by the Pac-12\u2032s lack of media coverage and resources, and the Big Ten\u2019s partnership with Fox presented a promising opportunity for the schools to make a monetary upgrade.\n\nThe Big Ten\u2019s media deal distributed $46.1 million to each college in the conference for the 2021 fiscal year, while the Pac-12 only distributed $19.8 million. A source familiar with the Pac-12\u2032s current media rights deal and how it compares to the Big Ten provided some background.\n\n\u201cPac-12 really botched its whole media situation back in 2012 thinking that this product was so desirable that people would pay for all these networks,\u201d said the source, whom Annenberg Media provided anonymity to allow them to speak freely about the situation. \u201cThe Pac-12 moved to this model where...it had enough money to produce X number of major events. So, football games, basketball games, but then it couldn\u2019t do all of it. They couldn\u2019t do volleyball matches, lacrosse games and whatnot.\u201d\n\nUSC football is a predominant moneymaker when it comes to the intersection of athletics and media. But what about teams who haven\u2019t experienced the same wealth of resources and media coverage? It\u2019s time to dissect how this switch from the Pac-12 to the Big Ten will affect athletes and teams in sports that exist in football\u2019s shadow.\n\nTwo of USC\u2019s sports, water polo and beach volleyball, will be staying in their conferences, the MPSF and the Pac-12, respectively. The Big Ten will gain USC\u2019s baseball, basketball, football, golf, swim and dive, tennis, track and field, volleyball, women\u2019s lacrosse, women\u2019s rowing, women\u2019s cross country and women\u2019s soccer teams.\n\nLike any significant change in the world of collegiate athletics, there are positive and negative repercussions on these sports and their respective student-athletes. But do the benefits outweigh the costs?\n\nThe most obvious downside for student-athletes on the West coast is travel. Competing against teams who are between a four and six-hour flight from L.A. has consequences, for both student-athletes individually and the teams as a whole. As a competitive and academically-rigorous university, USC values a well-rounded student body. Student-athletes are no exception.\n\nMore time off campus and away from class is a juggling act \u2013 one that few student-athletes master in their time at USC. \u201cI was surprised and then I [was] a little bit annoyed because Big Ten schools are really far away,\u201d said Chris O\u2019Grady, a Division 1 USC swimmer and sophomore studying human biology. \u201cEvery time we have a dual meet now... we\u2019re going to be flying four to six-hour flights every other week to go up there.\u201d\n\nWhen you account for both dual meets and tournament-style competition, the Big Ten\u2019s travel schedule will be a huge adjustment for West coast-residing swimmers, and one that will come with a new set of challenges. A cross-country flight already impacts one\u2019s body in many ways: hydration, sleep, and sitting for extended periods of time. But those small inconveniences in a travel day are compounded when an athlete is simultaneously recovering from an injury.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you sprain your ankle on a Monday and you\u2019re traveling on a Thursday for a Friday to Sunday game weekend; that ankle when you fly is going to swell up,\u201d said Claudia Shevitz, a Division 1 USC lacrosse player and junior majoring in public relations. \u201cThat\u2019s just an example that I\u2019ve thought about and talked to my trainer about, [saying], \u2018Oh, I wonder how that\u2019s going to work.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite these negatives, the Big Ten move \u2013 if everything goes as promised \u2013 has the potential to benefit every student-athlete at USC, regardless of the sport they play. Shevitz hopes the change will provide a new opportunity for lacrosse to grow as a sport and for her team to face higher competition.\n\n\u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s going to be a great move, I think it\u2019s going to really diversify the competition and just change things up,\u201d said Shevitz. \u201cI think that\u2019s super important... I\u2019m really excited.\u201d\n\nShevitz added that the prominence of the sport in Los Angeles is similar to her hometown near Chicago. \u201cI feel like hotbeds for lacrosse are Connecticut, Long Island, Massachusetts. So growing up outside of Chicago definitely wasn\u2019t the same as being in those hotbeds. And here at USC... it\u2019s pretty much the same,\u201d Shevitz said.\n\nShevitz has been working to expand lacrosse on the West coast during her time at USC by coaching youth club teams in the area with some of her teammates. But there is still more work to be done. One piece of this promotion puzzle could lie in USC\u2019s new deal with the Big Ten.\n\n\u201cTypically, [games] would just be, if we were playing Stanford, on like the Pac-12 Network, but that\u2019s super inaccessible to a lot of people... you have to pay for it, you have to make an account, it\u2019s expensive and you don\u2019t [want] to bother making a free trial and canceling it,\u201d said Shevitz. \u201cI think playing other teams, hopefully that would help with just having ESPN cover it, you know, [instead] of these super small, school networks.\u201d\n\nLacrosse, along with the majority of other sports in the Pac-12, are almost impossible to stream without acquiring a laundry list of bills for mediocre coverage of an event. The Big Ten\u2019s media deal with Fox will aim to bring that media coverage to a higher standard.\n\nAs a swimmer, O\u2019Grady feels the same lack of coverage, and is hopeful that the Big Ten will expand that representation \u2013 through media and therefore through more funding. \u201cEven if [USC swim doesn\u2019t] get money directly, being in the Big Ten funds [the] athletic department. So, it\u2019ll fund our weight room, it\u2019ll fund [the] athletic dining hall,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t affect us directly, it still could be good for us.\u201d\n\nDespite USC swim leaving behind powerhouse schools like Cal and Stanford in the Pac-12, the true competition lies in individual times, something USC will have the opportunity to showcase during their NCAA postseason. O\u2019Grady believes that this variation of competition is good for student-athletes and their sports as a whole.\n\n\u201cI definitely, on a personal level, [don\u2019t] mind variation; I like change and everything,\u201d said O\u2019Grady. \u201cI was definitely excited in that way. It\u2019s something new, you know, we aren\u2019t just competing against the same schools over and over again.\u201d\n\nDespite rising new challenges, the move to the Big Ten has the potential to bring in more opportunities for student-athletes at USC, making USC football not the only program benefiting from a move to the Big Ten Conference. Come 2024, however, USC Athletics should be held accountable for streaming equity across all sports \u2013 whether that\u2019s under the lights at the Coliseum or on the pool deck at Uytengsu.\n```"}

(Photo by Louis Chen)\n\nBy Alexis Lara, Edward Huang and Anthony Slade\nOctober 03, 2022 at 7:13 pm PDT\n\nWith the midterm elections approaching on Nov. 8, many USC students are unsure of how or where to cast their ballots. This confusion developed after the announcement of the destruction of the previous on-campus voting location, Ground Zero Cafe, which rendered the space off limits.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, USC\u2019s student voter registration rate increased by 20%. However, following national voting patterns, USC\u2019s midterm election turnout pales in comparison to presidential primary elections. In 2018, the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement reported that less than 60% of registered California voters actually participated in the midterm election.\n\nAs students wait for the announcement of voting locations for the upcoming elections, many struggle with creating a plan to cast their ballots. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of students who can vote but don\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Amitai Segeb, a senior majoring in business administration. \u201cI don\u2019t think USC is doing anything either \u2013 I\u2019m not even sure when the midterm elections are. I\u2019ll probably just be notified the day of.\u201d\n\nStudents are able to check their registration status and voting locations at LA Vote. Yet, many students may lack the knowledge or motivation to engage in their civic duty. USC organizations like VoteSC have made efforts to increase voter registration through pop-up stands and information booths, but some students say the university itself can do more to foster civic engagement.\n\n\u201cI wish there were more ways to get the students involved, to more actively seek out ways to engage students in voting,\u201d said Audrey Xia, a junior majoring in business administration. \u201cI know we might have done some registration booths \u2013 it\u2019d be really cool to see some bigger campus initiatives to increase voter registration.\u201d\n\nOut-of-state students are additionally challenged by the geographical distance from their in-person voting locations. \u201cI\u2019m sure [USC] has resources for out-of-state students, but I just haven\u2019t seen them or interacted with them,\u201d said Gloria Jin, a junior majoring in environmental studies and public relations. \u201cI also don\u2019t know where to go to vote. I know last year, a lot of my friends that are California residents went to a booth they had on campus, but I didn\u2019t know how to register so I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRegistered voters hoping to participate in the midterm elections might also receive a mail-in ballot weeks before the election, but some students are unsure if they will actually receive theirs due to a change in address. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m between different addresses so they don\u2019t send me the right materials,\u201d Xia said. \u201cI wish I were more educated about [mail-in ballots]. I feel like we weren\u2019t educated on what we need to do to be prepared to vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to Xia, this places an increased pressure on the institution to engage their students in the civic process. \u201cUniversity is all about cultivating tomorrow\u2019s leaders,\u201d Xia said. \u201cCivic education is a very big part of that \u2013 and I think that\u2019s really missing in USC\u2019s programming in general.\u201d\n\nUSC has extensive detail, including maps of ballot boxes, about where students can vote here. The last day for California residents to register to vote for the midterm election is Oct. 24, two weeks before election day on Nov. 8. California also has a process for provisional same-day voter registration. Voting locations are announced 20-40 days prior to election day.\n\nUpdate: In the previous version of this story, there was no information provided regarding ballot box locations. The story has been changed to reflect this update on Oct. 4 at 3:52 p.m. We regret the error.\n```"}

The entire week will be filled with a multitude of sustainability-focused projects and events. With USC\u2019s recent sustainability efforts, we thought we\u2019d get students and staff to share their thoughts on how the university is doing with achieving their goals.\n\nToday officially marks USC\u2019s second annual Green Week. The entire week involves a variety of projects and activities centered around sustainability, and kicked off with the Arizona State-USC zero waste football game over the weekend. During the game\u2019s halftime, President Folt made a video addressing USC\u2019s continued efforts to promote sustainability.\n\nBut this is just one of the many ways USC hopes to celebrate the sustainability-focused event, as USC dining halls serve a meatless menu, and the USC Peace Garden encourages students to volunteer. Green Week goes hand-in hand with Assignment: Earth, \u201ca holistic commitment to addressing the impacts of climate change and creating a more sustainable future.\u201d The initiative seeks to accomplish multiple sustainability goals, including climate neutrality by 2025, diverting most of USC\u2019s waste from landfills, reducing our water use, and doubling sustainability research.\n\nSara Stienecker, Chair of the Campus Infrastructure and Sustainability Committee, highlights working directly with the university\u2019s sustainability staff and commends the university\u2019s efforts.\n\nSARA STEINECKER: I do sit on the president\u2019s working group on sustainability, so I do get to see the presentations on it. And I\u2019m very excited for what this university is going to be doing because I think we are making a very big effort to make sustainability one of our core points, and I think the Assignment Earth Project will help us get there.\n\nMark Gangi, a USC professor who lectures on sustainability and the environment, says he has also seen improvements in the way that USC approaches sustainability.\n\nMARK GANGI: It seems like they\u2019re doing really well. You know, what happens is when you you know, let\u2019s say looking at the school\u2019s waste stream, which seems to be a big a big part of of what they\u2019re doing. Right. And, you know, just having those different containers and talking about it really brings it into the minds of everyone on the campus and and will change behavior.\n\nGangi also complimented USC\u2019s commitment to prioritizing sustainability in and out of the classroom, putting it at the forefront of the university\u2019s vision.\n\nMARK GANGI: You know exactly what the school\u2019s doing to be more sustainable. It\u2019s how it\u2019s using that as a teaching tool and engaging, you know, the minds of, of, of our school population as they engage in solving these problems.\n\nBut despite these recent strides, students continue to have their criticisms. Connor Castillo, co-director of Environmental Student Assembly, expressed his concerns.\n\nCONNOR CASTILLO: I\u2019d say they are definitely putting in a lot of effort to reach net zero waste by 2028 to coincide with the Olympics. My only fear is that some of these goals that they put out are a bit too broad or general, and I think that\u2019s the roadmap to get there. For many who may not be within the Office of Sustainability or who just may not know a ton about USC\u2019s goal wouldn\u2019t really know how exactly we would get from point A where we are now to point B in 2028 where we\u2019re hopefully at net zero emissions.\n\nThe university says sustainability is a priority. In an email sent out on Thursday, Mick Dalrymple, USC\u2019s chief sustainability officer, made several announcements on sustainability efforts, including a postdoctoral fellowship program and a new sustainability data hub. As President Folt has said, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this assignment, together.\u201d\n```"}

Far-right incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro surprised many experts and pollsters and performed far better than they had predicted. But former left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - known as \u201cLula!\u201d - still won the most votes. With no clear winner in the first round, a run-off for the presidency of Brazil will be held October 30.\n\nIncumbent Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro faced against Luiz Inacio Lula for Brazil\u2019s presidency this past October 2. National polls predicted Lula to win with ease, but Bolsonaro managed to pull in enough votes to narrow the gap to five percentage points. With no candidates getting a clear majority of the votes, the election will be decided with a run off on October 30.\n\nWith 212 million people, Brazil is the fourth largest democracy in the world and the tenth largest economy. The sheer size of the country makes this years election a key moment not only in the history of the country, but on how Brazil will interact with the world moving forward.\n\nWith Bolsonaro having led Brazil with right Wing policies and Lula having been involved in several scandals during his previous presidency, Carol Wise, a Professor of Political Science and International Relations at USC, believes that the decision Brazilian will have to make is highly polarizing.\n\nCAROL WISE: However, Lula\u2019s looking a lot better than Bolsonaro. Do you want a convicted crook who got off? Or do you want somebody that\u2019s plowing down the environment, denying COVID, eradicating human rights?\n\nThis election comes amongst a recent wave of Latin American countries electing left leaning candidates across the board. But Brazil seems to be more torn between the two sides. Wise points out that this division can be attributed to the current divisive political climate that can be seen throughout the world\n\nWISE: Brazil\u2019s problems are not unique in the region. But unfortunately, I think this is the country that has been most influenced at the elite level by Trumpism. And it\u2019s really sad.\n\nHowever, Abraham Lowenthall, the founding director of the Latin American Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC, believes that although some might think this is a close race, calling conservatism and Bolsonaro the winners of this first round would be misleading.\n\nABRAHAM LOWENTHALL: He was 5.2% of the vote behind Lula. And that translated in votes to 6.2 million votes behind. So it\u2019s not like he was on his coattails. I mean, he lost decisively in this round.\n\nOn the other hand, Lowenthall believes that if Lula and the liberals achieve victory on October 30th that doesn\u2019t mean that Liberalism in Latin America is a uniform, homogenous block.\n\nLOWENTHALL: I think that would be an overreading of the situation. Now, each of these countries is different and each of these leftist oriented parties and politicians are very different.\n\nHowever, regardless of the polarizing discussions surrounding these topics, the people that are impacted the most are Brazilians. Most importantly, the lower income classes.\n\nJOAO PEDRO AGUIAR DE SOUZA: Brazil is a very unequal country, replete of inequality.\n\nJoao Pedro Aguiar de Souza is a Brazilian student at USC.\n\nAGUIAR DE SOUZA: And of course, always, no matter if the candidates left, right, center, up or down. The people who are almost always impacted the most are people from lower socioeconomic classes. And that goes without a doubt.\n\nLower income Brazilians would suffer the most from any violence which some people are afraid off before the October 30 run-off. Both Brazilian candidates have their baggage. Rodrigo Biolchini, a Brazilian USC student and member of BRASA believes people within the country are voting not for something, but against.\n\nRODRIGO BIOLCHINI: It\u2019s really important to really go deep into the discussion and not be blinded by the like a, A versus B narrative that it\u2019s either this or that. Because in many in many situations, people would vote for Bolsonaro or for Lula because they don\u2019t want to see the other one.\n\nThis is a sentiment that can be echoed in democracies around the world.\n```"}
{"key": "/2022/10/03/us-supreme-court-begins-new-term-following-the-overturning-of-roe-v-wade/", "response": "```\nThe U.S. Supreme Court begins its new session Monday.  By   Annie Bang ,  Jacob Wheeler  and  Julia Zara October 03, 2022 at  6:03 pm PDT \n \n \nHot issues and controversial topics are up for debate. The U.S. Supreme Court is back in session after the polarizing overturn of  Roe v. Wade . With newly elected Ketanji Brown Jackson, SCOTUS will discuss issues ranging from gay rights to affirmative action to voting laws. The curtains lifted today on another blockbuster U.S. Supreme Court term. Justices on the court may be trying to find a new normal after their decision to overturn  Roe v. Wade  lit a summer of protest and partisanship. A  New York Times  poll found sixty-two percent of registered voters disapprove of the Dobbs decision -- with thirty percent in support. Opposition is even stronger among women. Adam Winkler teaches law at UCLA. ADAM WINKLER: The Supreme Court is moving in a very severe rightward direction and on many issues out of line with the American people. Looking ahead to the new term, the justices will hear a flurry of consequential cases. These include  Moore v. Harper  (which will debate state authority in federal elections),  Merril v. Milligan  (which deals with racial gerrymandering) and  Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard . That one could impact university admissions processes, says Jessica Levinson. She teaches constitutional law at LMU. JESSICA LEVINSON: There\u2019s also a big question about affirmative action and whether or not the Supreme Court will allow colleges and universities to consider race as a factor when it\u2019s making admissions decision. The new term is the first for the first African American woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Jackson replaced a fellow liberal Justice, so her votes may not change many Supreme Court decisions. But her influence will be felt, says UCLA law professor Adam Winkler WINKLER: It is possible that through her persuasive power, she may make an impact, perhaps in how the court writes its decision ending race-based affirmative action because of her own experience as a racial minority and as someone who has experienced racial discrimination. But that influence is likely to only be marginal. Though SCOTUS may appear far removed from the average Joe, Winkler believes that the cases on the table are relevant to all Americans. WINKLER: I think everyone should care about the Supreme Court decisions because it will fundamentally reshape the law. And we all live in a society governed by law. In the context of the  Dobbs  decision, LMU\u2019s Levinson echoes this sentiment. LEVINSON: I think some people certainly will pay more attention to the Supreme Court now understanding that there are five people who can have huge control over our lives. The new term opens as trust in the Supreme Court and its job approval rating are at historic lows. In a recent Gallup poll, for the first time, just under half of Americans express trust in the Supreme Court.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Jaydelle Herbert\nOctober 03, 2022 at 3:37 pm PDT\n\nUSC women\u2019s volleyball defeated Utah in four sets 25-19, 21-25, 25-17, 25-21 at Galen Center on Sunday. Senior outside hitter Skylar Fields led with 25 kills, sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga led with 46 assists and graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams led with nine blocks.\n\nThe Trojans felt the electricity from the crowd and red light shining on the court. During the third set, freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson\u2019s high energy illuminated through her quick strikes to the right corner of the court. To help the Trojans gain a three-point lead on Utah in the third, 15-12, two Utah defenders weren\u2019t ready to defend off of Wilson\u2019s hit and let the ball land in front of their feet. The crowd jumped out of their seats as the Trojans huddled in excitement. Wilson had 16 kills against Utah, a career-high.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy about that,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI definitely think I need some improvement, but being able to have that many kills within the game, I\u2019m really happy about that.\u201d\n\nFields is leading the Pac-12 at 4.71 kills per set, secured 28 points and closed out the fourth set with a quick kill down the middle. Since USC played UCLA on Sept. 22, Fields is consistently scoring over 24 points every game. During the match, Fields said her mentality is quite simple.\n\n\u201cJust trying to win,\u201d Fields said.\n\nUSC started the first set with a 4-1 lead. Fields scored the first four points. The Trojans maintained a lead over Utah throughout the first set. Fields\u2019 and Wilson\u2019s back-to-back kills to Utah\u2019s back row made Utah\u2019s back row scramble to try and save the ball. Then, Williams\u2019 quick service ace caught Utah\u2019s defense off guard. Utah\u2019s back row tried to rally the ball but couldn\u2019t gain control after the ball bounced off of a defender\u2019s arm. USC won the first set 25-19.\n\nThe first tie score of the game came early in the second set. Utah broke away from the tie and had a lead of 5-1. Once Utah made a service error, USC picked up the pace and ran a quick offense. Fields ran up and swung her right arm around to smack the ball down in the middle of the court twice. Senior opposite hitter Emilia Weske and Williams defended the net with a block in front of Utah\u2019s front row. Freshman libero Gala Trubint\u2019s service ace made Utah\u2019s back row fall to their knees and miss the ball completely to lead 6-5. USC and Utah exchanged points with seven ties and five lead changes. After USC had a three-point run, Utah\u2019s quick offense closed the gap for USC to secure a win. Utah won the second set 25-21.\n\nThe third set was a battle for points with the crowd screaming and wincing as the back-and-forth affair continued. After Wilson ended the rally with a striking kill 15-12, the crowd were cheering loudly from the highest row. USC had its longest scoring run of six points, which led the team to another set win, 25-17.\n\nA strong block by Williams and Fields started the momentum for the Trojans early in the fourth set. Tuaniga jumped high to dump the ball between two Utah defenders as she earned her second kill of the night.\n\n\u201c[Tuaniga] said she wasn\u2019t in her wheelhouse today,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cShe stayed with it and scored a couple really good points at the end.

Dubbed the \u201cQueen of Alt-Rock Angst\u201d by Rolling Stone, Morissette revamped her squeaky-clean pop image with soul-splicing lyrics and heavy-handed rock influence through the release of her third studio album \u201cJagged Little Pill.\u201d The album sold more than 33 million copies, and in 1996, Morrisette won her first two Grammy awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album at the 38th ceremony.\n\nMorissette\u2019s gritty vocals and dense storytelling \u2014 a joint songwriting effort with producer Glen Ballard \u2014 captivated new audiences for years following the \u201cJagged Little Pill\u201d release. If Generation Z members aren\u2019t familiar with Morissette\u2019s legacy, however, she\u2019s reinvented herself once again via a Tony-award winning jukebox musical of the same name. Featuring two new songs, \u201cJagged Little Pill,\u201d the musical, was created in collaboration with \u201cJennifer\u2019s Body\u201d screenwriter Diablo Cody.\n\nFor the first time, audiences can experience the story centered on Morissette\u2019s lyrics as the production embarks on its first national tour, which was launched by a successful opening night on September 14 in Los Angeles at the Pantages Theatre and played through Sunday, October 2. The show hosted a rambunctious crowd at its debut despite a brief stop caused by technical difficulties during act two.\n\nA multi-narrative story particular to modern social issues unfolded on the Pantages stage, hoisted by Morissette\u2019s transparent lyrics, Tom Kitt\u2019s edgy orchestration with an onstage band, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui\u2019s restless choreography and Diane Paulus\u2019 stunning direction. The plot of \u201cJagged Little Pill\u201d surrounds the Healy family, a suburban trope of individuals forced to face a dynamic set of problems in their Connecticut neighborhood: Mary Jane \u201cMJ\u201d Healy (Heidi Blickenstaff), a \u201cfix-it\u201d mother burdened with maintaining the perfect family image, suffers from a worsening opioid dependency; her husband Steve (Chris Hoch) is a workaholic with a porn addiction; their son Nick (Dillon Klena) is a prized child who\u2019s just been admitted to Harvard when his future threatens to upend itself upon withholding information about the rape of his longtime friend Bella (Allison Sheppard); and adopted Black and bisexual daughter Frankie (Lauren Chanel) turns to activism in place her family\u2019s total acceptance of her.\n\nThe performers who portray the women of the Healy family, along with Frankie\u2019s partner Jo (Jade McLeod), stole the spotlight from their male co-stars. Broadway veteran Heidi Blickenstaff delivered a duplicitous reprise of her role as Mary Jane, struggling to overcome her family\u2019s imperfections through substance abuse \u2014 a haunting performance comparable to Alice Ripley\u2019s Diana Goodman in \u201cNext to Normal\u201d on Broadway in the late 2000s. Blickenstaff shifts from seriousness to dry humor, garnering robust laughter from the audience; her jokes about family holidays and hot yoga were well-received by the L.A. crowd \u2014 overheard discussing her one-liners during the intermission.\n\nMeanwhile, Blickenstaff\u2019s vocals across the stage, but mainly in her chilling rendition of \u201cUninvited,\u201d demanded attention from audience members in the most alluring and unsettling way. In her national tour debut, Lauren Chanel exhibits the almost-too-meta teenage daughter of the family, Frankie. Chanel\u2019s boisterous voice and punchy energy compliments her renditions of Morissette\u2019s \u201cUnprodigal Daughter,\u201d scream-shouting lyrics about running away from home, and \u201cIronic,\u201d sang out as a spoken-word poem to her classmates and newfound love interest Phoenix (Rishi Golani). Golani\u2019s character is likable despite his getting between Frankie and Jo\u2019s relationship.\n\nWhile this part of the story is difficult to watch for any person who knows the pain of teenage heartbreak, it leads to the most anticipated number of the show, \u201cYou Oughta Know.\u201d McLeod\u2019s performance of Morissette\u2019s most popular song was the standout performance of the night. The depths of McLeod\u2019s voice and passion in her performance led to a standing ovation from the audience near the end of the second and final act.\n\nFollowing the casts\u2019 final bows, the audience was delighted with a surprise appearance by Alanis Morissette, Diablo Cody and Glen Ballard on stage. Morissette saluted the touring cast for a job well done and a tough road ahead, acknowledging the fervor and vigor required to uphold a show like \u201cJagged Little Pill.\u201d The sparks set off by the opening act to Broadway in Hollywood\u2019s 2022-2023 season are the result of a performance ready to invigorate audiences and complement Morissette\u2019s music, so long as they\u2019re prepared to leave Pantages with more energy and anarchy in their system than they arrived with.\n```"}

(Photo by Tomoki Chien)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza October 02, 2022 at 10:29 pm PDT\n\nThe energy was palpable in Uytengsu Aquatic Center Sunday afternoon. The Trojans were confident, coming off their win against No. 8 UCSB. USC was looking to continue its winning ways against a UCI team that the Trojans beat in their past 35 meetings. USC came out a bit sluggish against UCSB Friday but was able to rattle off seven straight goals to pull out the win. Although UCI is ranked only one spot behind UCSB in the national polls, Sunday\u2019s game was much more dominant for the No. 5 Trojans, who pulled out a 16-10 win against the Anteaters.\n\nFrom the opening sprint, it was clear that USC had the edge. The Trojans drew a penalty just seconds into the game. Graduate driver Massimo Di Martire converted the penalty shot to give the Trojans a lead which they would never relinquish. Di Martire contributed three more goals over the course of the game and finished with four in total to bump his season total up to 36 goals.\n\nDespite his crushing performance, Di Martire felt that some improvements could be made before the team faces No. 14 San Jose State Saturday. \u201cI made a lot of mistakes on defense,\u201d Di Martire said. \u201cWe have to keep practicing and training as we are doing. We need to face every match as the final.\u201d\n\nHead coach Marko Pintaric had only positive things to say about the Italian newcomer. \u201cSolid game for [Di Martire],\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cHe always produces a lot of good points for us.\u201d\n\nBut the game did not solely rest on Di Martire\u2019s shoulders. In total, 10 different Trojans contributed goals. Redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen, sophomore driver Jake Carter and redshirt sophomore utility Reed Stemler contributed two goals apiece. \u201cWe just kept rotating more people,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cWe are in the process of really evaluating and giving chances to more than just 14 players. We played our older groups a little more in this game and changed the rotation a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe USC defense looked formidable all game, except for a few sporadic moments where the effort relented a bit. The Trojans had eight steals in the game, a result from Pintaric\u2019s recent focus on defensive improvement. \u201cThe emphasis was to fix the defense and to play for the goalies more,\u201d Pintaric said, \u201cand that\u2019s a campaign we\u2019ve been on since the last loss in the NorCal Tournament.\u201d\n\nThe defense was not without its faults, though. The Trojans allowed sophomore center Tyler Padua and sophomore attacker Dylan Patist to score three goals each: \u201cWe did make mistakes,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cWe need to keep emphasizing defense. The 10 goals we allowed is 10 too many. We\u2019re going to analyze these mistakes and see how we can improve and eliminate them. Irvine is a dangerous team with dangerous shooters \u2013 if you don\u2019t tighten up the defense, you don\u2019t have a chance of winning the games.\u201d\n\nDespite the Trojans\u2019 Sunday performance, the team knows that the work does not stop with the win over UC Irvine. \u201cWe have a goal here,\u201d Di Martire said. \u201cWe want to be undefeated for the whole season. Our goal and our purpose is to win every game here, until the end of the season.\u201d\n\nTo fulfill that goal, the Trojans will have to carry this momentum into their upcoming games. USC will eventually face No. 2 Cal in two weeks, but right now, the Trojans are focused on taking on No. 14 San Jose State on Saturday.\n```"}

The championships featured six of the best teams on both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s sides. Since there were only six teams, this tournament was single elimination instead of the usual double elimination. Also, the top two seeds had a first-round bye. Now that we have the details of the tournament out of the way, let\u2019s talk about what actually happened. I\u2019ll start on the women\u2019s side. The tournament kicked off with No. 4 seed Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth vs No. 5 Julia Scoles and Geena Urango. This was an all LSU vs all USC matchup and it was a great start to the tournament. Unfortunately for the former Trojans, it did not go their way. Scoles and Urango were up 11-13 in the first set when Nuss and Kloth went on a 9-0 run and ran away with the set. The pressure from Kloth at the net continued to be too much as the LSU alumni took the match in straight sets. The three vs five matchup also finished in straight sets. The No. 5 seed Zana Muno and Sarah Pavan had never played together and it showed. With the indoor conditions, Kelly Cheng and Betsi Flint looked incredible, and even when it was close in the second set, the outcome never felt in doubt. Both of the winning teams from day one carried their momentum into Saturday. Kloth and Nuss played first, taking on the one seed of Sara Hughes and Kelley Kolinske. Kloth and Nuss dominated the first set winning 21-12. They took the second set as well with Nuss seemingly everywhere on the court making Hughes and Kolinske overthink their hits. Flint and Cheng faced off against second-seeded Terese Cannon and Sarah Sponcil. Cannon and Sponcil passed a little sloppy at times, and that proved to be the difference maker. Cheng and Flint played very consistently all night long and took the match in straight sets 21-16, 21-18. The Cheng/Flint vs Kloth/Nuss was an exhilarating match. Nuss showed up and showed out in the finals, with 17 digs and 20 kills. All three other players had nine kills. The shallow sand gave Nuss more options offensively, and she took advantage. Cheng and Flint never found their footing in this match and had a hitting percentage of just .167. Nuss and Kloth took home the championship with a 21-16, 21-17 win. The men\u2019s side was equally exciting. It started with fourth-seeded Paul Lotman and Miles Partain vs fifth-seeded Casey Patterson and Andy Benesh. Unfortunately, Phil Daulhauser \u2013 who was supposed to be Patterson\u2019s partner could not compete due to medical reasons. The newly formed duo of Patterson and Benesh couldn\u2019t contain Lotman and Partain. Both Lotman and Partain have an extensive indoor volleyball background, and it showed all weekend. Partain used the fake jump set to perfection at times and sprinkled in a few on two hits to keep Benesh guessing at the net. The chemistry between Lotman and Partain proved to be too much winning in straight sets. The next match was No. 3 seed Taylor Crabb and Taylor Sander vs No. 6 seed Chase Budinger and Troy Field. Once again, the players with extensive indoor experience came out on top. Crabb and Sander have both played for team USA indoor volleyball, and the conditions in Phoenix were perfect for them. Sander\u2019s serve seemed to have even more pop than usual. He was firing all weekend long. Sander and Crabb cruised to a victory in straight sets 21-13, 21-18. Just like on the women\u2019s side, the winners of the first day continued their momentum into day two. Lotman and Partain took on the No. 1 seed of Tri Bourne and Trevor Crabb. They needed three sets to take the victory, but Partain\u2019s 31 kills were enough to put him and Lotman into the finals. The matchup between Sander and Crabb vs the No. 2 seed Theo Brunner and Chaim Schalk was also a dogfight. But Sander and Crabb were able to squeak out the win and head onto the finals. The championship was extremely high level. All four players had indoor experience and seemed poised and ready for the moment. Sander came up big in the finals. His serve was huge, and he had a ridiculous .769 hitting percentage. Partain and Lotman played incredibly well, but only one team could come out on top. Sander and Crabb got their first win as partners in exciting fashion with a 21-17, 17-21, 15-13 win. The play of the \u201cweek\u201d came from the men\u2019s final with an incredible rally showcasing why both teams made it to the finals: My goodness \ud83d\ude31.

The founder of outdoor gear company Patagonia, long known for environmental activism, said Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2022, that the company is transferring all of its voting shares into a trust \u201cdedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.\u201d Photo courtesy of AP/Gene J. Puskar.\n\nBy Mei Zhang October 02, 2022 at 4:04 pm PDT\n\nWhen I first learned that Patagonia founder and owner, Yvon Chouinard, donated 100% of his company to combat climate change, I felt a foreign feeling when it comes to the climate crisis\u2013\u2013optimism. Especially since this news came on the heels of key climate legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the $54 billion California Climate Commitment, I was glad that something was finally being done to solve the climate crisis.\n\nOther USC students were more reserved. USC student Aastha Jani mentioned that though she thought it was \u201ccool\u201d they were taking this step, she\u2019s cautious to laud billionaires. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make me feel more hopeful about climate change, because we were celebrating the exception, and not the norm,\u201d said Jani, who is a communications major. \u201cThis still shows that people in power with more capital still control what goes on, but climate change is an issue that impacts everyone. It shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of people who were able to amass large sums of wealth.\u201d\n\nIt is true that Chouinard and his family directed $3 billion towards environmentalism. But it is also true that this is a stark aberration from the norm, because most of the time, businesses don\u2019t champion social good. The American capitalist system is designed so that businesses are accountable only to their shareholders, and their accountability metric is making as much profit as possible. Unfortunately, this means that most of the time businesses are optimizing for efficiency, while humanitarianism and sustainability are put to the wayside. Or they are directly opposed, as seen through the working conditions in Tesla\u2019s assembly lines or Amazon\u2019s warehouses.\n\nIn this way, Patagonia is an exception, championing social good values over profits. This unique set of priorities has its roots in the founder\u2019s strong belief in environmentalism. \u201cI never wanted to be a businessman\u201d\n\nWhilst Chouinard is a billionaire and considered among business elites, he seems to be an anomaly in every way. For one, I think he would hate that I referred to him as one of the \u201cbusiness elites.\u201d When Forbes magazine listed him as a billionaire, he said it \u201creally, really pissed him off.\u201d Chouinard drives a Subaru and doesn\u2019t use a cellphone or a laptop. His unorthodox lifestyle and passion for the outdoors are reflected in Patagonia\u2019s unique business conduct that pursues strong cultural values of environmentalism and community, and frequently sponsors ski and climbing trips for employees. In 2015, President Obama recognized them for their commitment to working families.\n\nPatagonia claims their raw materials consist of 100% organic cotton and large proportions of recycled nylon and polyester. The company is credited with creating one of the first large-scale return and repair programs for their clothing. They also partner with Fair Trade USA to ensure ethical manufacturing, though only a portion of their styles is Fair Trade Certified. In 2012, Patagonia became California\u2019s first certified Benefit Corporation.\n\n\u201cEarth is now our only shareholder\u201d\n\nChouinard\u2019s recent decision to donate his private, for-profit company for \u201cclimate change\u201d has raised some questions among people about what it really means. Here\u2019s a breakdown: 2% of the company, which refers to the total amount of the company\u2019s voting shares, went to the Patagonia Purpose Trust. This organization has power over Patagonia as a company: it chooses board members and management, values, and overall business practices. The purpose, as indicated by its name, is to make sure Patagonia never strays from its original founding principles in environmental good. Functionally, Patagonia will be making the same decisions it has been, since the Trust is under control of the Chouinard family. However, the legal charter in the Trust ensures that in the future it will still operate with these same core values and will choose future leadership based on the values listed in its legal charter.\n\nThe other 98% of the company will form the Holdfast Collective, a newly created nonprofit whose primary focus is combating climate change. This means that all of the profit that Patagonia makes, which is roughly $100 million annually, goes straight to this nonprofit.\n\n\u201cI was prepared to hate them\u201d\n\nWhile the USC students I spoke to generally responded positively to this move, there was still a sense of skepticism regarding large corporations and social good. Benjamin Morehouse had not heard about this until I interviewed him, but when I explained Chouinard\u2019s move to him, he was enthused. \u201cThis is a huge step for a clothing company,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that they are putting their money where their mouth is.\u201d\n\nThe mixed reactions to this news underlie a harsh reality: people feel like the climate fight is out of their hands and the big corporations who control the world\u2019s economy are inactive towards the crisis. When I spoke with USC student Olivia Benalcazar, who had also not heard about this, I found her response to be more suggestive of the general distrust students feel. \u201cTo be honest, when you first asked me \u2018Did you hear about Patagonia?\u2019, my initial thought was that Patagonia did something horrible when it comes to climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause so many big companies had. I was prepared to hate them.\u201d```"}

I chose arthouses. I occupy those dark and often half-empty spaces, specifically in the back row, more than once a week \u2014 and lying to my parents about my whereabouts out of the fear of their slippery slope logic became the norm. This year, on one day in May, I lied again. I drove to The Landmark Pico theater in Los Angeles for a screening of \u201cPetite Maman,\u201d \u201cVortex,\u201d and \u201cThe Northman\u201d \u2014 a triple feature from hell. I never bothered to question their discounted tickets that evening. As someone who worked a minimum wage retail job at the time, discounted tickets were the least of my problems. The Pico closed its doors a week later after failing to reach the required terms to extend its lease. It went quietly that week, according to L.A. Times reporter Greg Braxton. The only hints of the theater indefinitely shutting its doors, Braxton noted, were the cleanup crew thanking patrons as they exited and a lonely tip jar dismally labeled \u201cwe really appreciate it.\u201d\n\nI felt what I can only describe as hearing news of a sudden loss: \u201cThat\u2019s impossible, I was just there. I just spoke to them.\u201d Bewildered was an understatement given that Landmark Theatres screens everything under the sun, whether or not we consider those movies to be \u201chigh art.\u201d This is nothing new. Instead, there\u2019s always something new to carry the burden of blame. Earlier this year, Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf told Variety that arthouse cinema is dying because of video streaming. He posed the question, \u201cYou can eat your food in your room, but why do you go to a restaurant to eat with others? You can see the film in your mobile phone alone, but you go to the cinema to see film with others.\u201d\n\nOnce, in a drunken haze, I snuck into Little Tokyo\u2019s Downtown Independent in 2017 to watch a documentary in a room that was clearly violating occupancy laws. That one-screen joint was also forced to close in 2020 in the wake of a mishandled pandemic. In 1996, L.A. Times reporter Katie Folmar said that the two-screen Westlake Village Theater closed because \u201cit would be unable to compete with the new Mann\u2019s eight-screen theater that opened this week a few blocks away.\u201d Decades before I was born, in the 1950s, theaters across the country were forced to close with the advent of television.\n\nWe can still fall back on the Mezzanine and American Cinematheque affiliates, and wealthy revivalists like Quentin Tarantino \u2014 a few people and places championing honest expression with fewer monetary conditions and dedicating their time to a losing game by serving their communities. It\u2019s the gradual erasure of these arthouses, bastions of culture, that challenges my faith in what we value as a society built upon challenging the status quo. If we don\u2019t cherish institutions that preserve culture and the immersive and insulated communal experience, what will that mean for the most social species on Earth?\n\nHighbrow connotations like \u201carthouse,\u201d \u201cindependent,\u201d or \u201cforeign\u201d make it easier for us to sideline these cinemas as niche enterprises, and forget that movies \u2014 full stop \u2014 inform the human condition. In appraisal of French New Wave maverick Jean-Luc Godard, The New York Times film critic Manhola Dargis said that the commodification of movies by Hollywood made them easier for us. But Godard\u2019s movies reminded us that \u201c[w]e were the ones impoverished for not seeing that cinema can be more than laughter and tears, dollars and awards.\u201d\n\nThis is how conversations about the cultures that surround us can continue in L.A. I once had the privilege of interviewing Charles Burnett, an indie film legend and pioneer of the L.A. Rebellion \u2014 an independent filmmaking movement spearheaded by Black UCLA film students between the late 60s and late 80s. Naturally nervous as hell, I listened over the phone as he told me about the time a film festival in Hawaii screened his film \u201cTo Sleep With Anger.\u201d Afterwards, an audience member told Burnett that she didn\u2019t know Black people had washing machines. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019\u201d Burnett said. \u201cBut before that, that\u2019s all the images she\u2019d gotten, these images produced by Hollywood.\u201d\n\nFollowing what was considered a quiet death in L.A., Landmark Theatres signed a lease agreement with a floundering Laemmle Playhouse 7 \u2014 tucked away in the picturesque suburbs of Pasadena \u2014 earlier this year. The Playhouse, like The Pico, was generous in mirroring the pleasures of my own company when I needed it the most, coupled with an exhaustive list of emotions and revelations. In my heedless last moments of the latter, I crossed out just about everything. And believe me when I say, I\u2019m weary, too.\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Eddie Sun October 02, 2022 at 1:46 am PDT\n\nThe USC Trojans hoped last week\u2019s offensive performance against Oregon State was just an aberration, and not a sign of things to come. Good news for the team: Head coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s offense returned to its old ways against the Arizona State Sun Devils, scoring early, quickly and often. The Trojans first three drives all went the length of the field for touchdowns. All three drives each only took about four minutes off the clock.\n\nHowever, nearly the exact same could be said for USC\u2019s defense which, before last week, was prone to giving up ground in the run game. The \u201cbend-don\u2019t-break\u201d mentality that characterizes defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s unit offered little resistance to Arizona State\u2019s run game in the first half. But in the second half, the USC offense continued to hum, while the defense upped its intensity. After allowing 17 points and 218 total yards in the first half, the group only gave up 113 yards and a single touchdown in the second half on the way to a 42-25 victory.\n\nSophomore quarterback Caleb Williams and the passing attack were in sync from the get-go, peppering the Sun Devils with short passes that gained chunk yardage. Riley got the ball out of Williams\u2019 hands quickly by utilizing the running backs and receivers in screens, and letting them gain yards after catch. Unlike last week against Oregon State, where Williams struggled to diagnose defensive coverages and find open targets, he looked entirely comfortable making throws and operating the offense.\n\n\u201cI thought [Williams] really threw the ball well tonight,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe balls were on target, on the money and gave our guys a lot of chances to make plays. So he was a tremendous playmaker.\u201d\n\nOn the other end, redshirt junior dual-threat quarterback Emory Jones and graduate student running back Xazavian Valladay led the Arizona State offense in the first half. The Sun Devils gashed USC for 101 rushing yards, gaining more than six yards per carry. The Trojan defense also didn\u2019t come up with a takeaway until the game was all but decided. Despite the offense\u2019s early production, USC\u2019s struggles in fitting the run and strong play by Jones kept the game from being over early. The Trojans entered halftime with only a four-point lead.\n\nAs the game progressed, and Arizona State defended the spread attack with more success, Williams flashed his uncanny ability to improvise, showing why he was a top-ranked recruit in 2021 and the highest-ranked player in the transfer portal last year.\n\n\u201cHe did a great job in some of the scramble situations again and got us out of trouble a couple of times,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHim being able to evade people in the pocket the last two weeks have been really impressive.\u201d\n\nIn USC\u2019s second drive, facing a third-and-4 on its own side of the field, Williams escaped what looked like a sure sack from two pass rushers, scrambling to gain a first down to extend the drive. A couple minutes later, at the Sun Devils\u2019 seven-yard line, Williams sprinted to his right at full speed to evade a rusher, then threw back across his body to sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams in the middle of the end zone for a touchdown.\n\nThe full Caleb Williams experience could perhaps be summarized in USC\u2019s next possession. Forced back to the Trojans\u2019 six-yard line, with the pocket collapsing in every direction, Williams jumped off two feet to make a throw to the boundary, over a lurking defensive back, for a 13-yard completion to junior wide receiver Jordan Addison.\n\n\u201cI go off and do my job, I turn around, it looks like he\u2019s about to be sacked and he Houdini\u2019s out of it and all of a sudden we have a 20-yard gain,\u201d redshirt senior running back Travis Dye said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it either ... He can make a bad situation look just phenomenal.\u201d\n\nThe drive continued with Williams displaying the full range of his skills \u2013\u2013 his ability to feel pressure, use his foot speed and strong arm to extend plays and make off-script throws \u2013\u2013 and was capped off with a four-yard touchdown pass to redshirt senior tight end Malcolm Epps.\n\nWilliams finished the night 27-of-37 for 348 passing yards with three touchdowns and an interception. The interception was his first of the season, on the offense\u2019s opening drive of the second half, coming on a botched goal-line fade to Addison.\n\nThe USC defense forced a three-and-out on the ensuing possession, and the offense followed with a touchdown drive, which made it a two-score game.\n\n\u201cIt was how we responded [to the interception], which is what I was happy about,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAs a team, myself, the defense going out doing their thing, and then we go back out there and we go score.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will look to remain undefeated in next Saturday\u2019s matchup at the Coliseum against Washington State. While USC\u2019s start has turned heads around the country, Dye hopes the Trojans will maintain the focus and intensity that has propelled the team so far.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose on this team, and that can be a problem, but we\u2019re going to get it right,\u201d Dye said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that our guys know that winning like this is very rare.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Nolan Ezzet October 01, 2022 at 5:48 pm PDT\n\nThe Trojans move to 10-4 as their offense led them to a victory at Galen Center over Colorado Friday in four sets 25-15, 23-25, 25-19, 28-26. A large part of the Trojans\u2019 offensive success came from sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga\u2019s serving. She recorded 10 service aces, breaking the school record in a single game.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a performance like that in a long time,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cHer serve is just so unique, right? And then when she hits it deep like that, it hits ... shoulder level and it\u2019s still going in. And that makes it really tough to pass the ball.\u201d\n\nThe offense was also assisted by Pac-12 preseason all-conference outside hitter Skylar Fields, who recorded 24 kills with a .309 hitting percentage.\n\nUSC started the first set with a 5-1 lead. Though the Buffaloes tied it at 5-5, the Trojans took control of the set and pulled away late. The Trojans reached a 24-15 lead and were looking to finish the set. Graduate student libero Kelli Barry passed it to Tuaniga, who everyone thought would set it to Fields, but instead tapped the ball over the net, faking out the Buffaloes and recording the set-winning kill.\n\nUSC began the second set with a 7-3 lead, but three attack errors and a service error allowed Colorado to rally back to a 9-8 lead. The Trojans committed 10 errors, which was pivotal in a set they narrowly lost 25-23.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thing of how to manage the game better, manage the ball, [and] pass[ing],\u201d Fields said.\n\nKeller also hopes to improve in the blocking game. \u201cI think we started touching more volleyballs at the net tonight than we did [previously], but we need to start blocking those balls,\u201d Keller said.\n\nWhen the third set began, the Trojans jumped out to an 11-3 lead. Five of the 11 points came from kills, which all belonged to Fields. The Buffaloes fought back to cut the deficit to four, 13-9. Tuaniga was up to serve, and the Cardinal & Gold Classic most outstanding player delivered. She ripped off two service aces, which freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson followed up with a kill. Colorado called a timeout at 16-9.\n\nWhen play resumed, Tuaniga racked up two more service aces in a row.\n\nThe fourth set consisted of 33 lead-changes. The first few points displayed elite offense on both ends with tremendous kills but lacked defensive highlights. Play embodied elite setting and killing, but the liberos on both sides repeatedly missed dig attempts. Toward the end, however, the defense on both sides improved, leading to longer points. Both liberos successfully dug more often.\n\nThe set was tied at 26-26. Fields then made a last-second dig as she dove way out to her side, and it would have also been a kill had Wilson\u2019s hand not skimmed the ball before it crossed the net. This gave USC a 27-26 lead, and an attack error from Colorado gave the Trojans the victory.\n\nThroughout the game, Buffalo fans made their presence known, but the Trojans were certainly louder in their own arena. Fans screamed after every point won, the DJ got everyone on their feet during key moments, and the band screamed comical chants like \u201cWe want tacos!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crowd definitely gives us energy, especially during long rallies,\u201d Fields said. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to have them behind our back.\u201d\n\nUSC even had a special group of supporters show up: the girls volleyball team from Jackson Middle School.\n\n\u201cIt was a really cool moment because I just know like that was us when we were younger,\u201d Tuaniga said.\n\nFor Keller, his team\u2019s inexperience leaves plenty of room for improvement. \u201cWe have a lot of freshmen on the floor, and we\u2019re learning how to play the game and learning how to do really small, unique things, but they add up to points here and there,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is once we get a rhythm going, we\u2019re gonna start getting points more in bunches.\u201d\n\nUSC will look to continue their success as they face off against Utah at Galen Center Sunday Oct. 2.\n```"}

(Photo by La Reva Myles)\n\nBy La Reva Myles\nOctober 01, 2022 at 11:09 am PDT\n\nI\u2019ve heard love called a divine madness. My divine madness drew me back to my southern country music roots. Attending AMERICANAFEST, in a way, was both intoxicating and frightening. When love comes calling, you\u2019ll do crazy things you\u2019d never imagine. That\u2019s what I felt after joining the Black Country Music Association (BCMA) and coming to Nashville, Tennessee in 1999 to sing in a showcase of Black country singers.\n\nWe all had sent our songs ahead to Nashville to be arranged and played by a backup band of professional studio musicians who were so good, I couldn\u2019t believe they were playing my songs. Frankie Staton, founder of the BCMA, took us on a Nashville tour in 1999, which included promoting our showcase at Fan Fair where country music fans wait in long lines to get autographs from their favorite country music artists. Many of the attendees just stared at us standing behind our table while crumpling up our show invitations and throwing them on the ground.\n\nDuring that tour, Staton also introduced us to DeFord Bailey Jr., son of the first Black member of the Grand Ole Opry from 1926-1941, at the ground-breaking ceremony for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. That meeting with Bailey inspired me to promise that by the end of my life, I would do everything I could to make sure there were more Black members in the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter Fan Fair, I sang at a showcase at the Gibson Guitar Caf\u00e9 in downtown Nashville with singers like myself who had come from all over the U.S. We sang to a mostly white audience who looked at us as though they didn\u2019t understand what they were seeing. The looks on their faces said it all. Why would Black people be singing country music? Maybe the alcohol they were drinking made it all seem like a dream when they woke up the next morning.\n\nBefore the 2021 AMERICANAFEST, The Americana Music Association, which produces the festival, established a new Diversity and Inclusion Committee, tasked with \u201caddressing issues of inclusivity, representation and identity within the Americana community.\u201d This year\u2019s program showcased 175 diverse artists at 36 venues and access to 300 events from Sept. 13-17 in Nashville.\n\nLast year\u2019s AMERICANAFEST started a movement in the world of Black country music by presenting at its festival, Black Opry and Black Opry Revue, a blog and showcase of Black country music singers, which has grown to over 200 artists since its founding by Holly G in 2021. Holly G\u2019s Black Opry network of Black country music artists in 2021 led to her creating The Outlaw House, an Airbnb where all Black country music singer-songwriters would have a place to network and provide support for each other after their nightly performances.\n\nThe growing number of performers who were a part of Black Opry Revue in 2021 led to an even larger gathering in 2022, as this year\u2019s festival and conference gave many new artists the opportunity to join this tribe.\n\nI arrived in Nashville on Tuesday afternoon and on Wednesday evening while attending AMERICANAFEST 2022, watched a viewing party of the 21st Annual Americana Honors & Awards being held at the Ryman Auditorium, the mother church of country music. There, Allison Russell, a Black country music artist, won the Americana Award for debut album. This viewing party was followed by an amazing live performance by War and Treaty, an R&B singing couple who had performed earlier during the awards ceremony.\n\nOn Thursday \u2013 my third day at AMERICANAFEST \u2013 there were so many panels and live concerts to choose from that it helped to have a focus. Because mine was Black country music, I attended Black Opry: Path To Joy, featuring a panel with Holly G and other Black country music singers like Rissi Palmer, Leon Timbo, Autumn Nicholas, Jett Holden and artist management representative Gina Miller. Sitting in the audience I saw Frankie Staton, founder of the BCMA, who provided the showcase opportunity for me to sing 22 years earlier.\n\nThat evening I went to see Rissi Palmer and members of the Black Opry Revue perform during their own showcases at local venues in and around downtown Nashville. Because I had mentioned that I was a part of the BCMA showcase 22 years earlier during the Black Opry: Path To Joy panel, I was invited to The Outlaw House after their performances, where they were in the process of making a film about Black Opry and over 200 artists who had joined this movement. My ticket for admission was that I was asked \u2014 no, required \u2014 to perform and I chose a song from my showcase 22 years ago, \u201cBest Kept Mystery.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, my last day at AMERICANAFEST, I felt as though I had come full circle. My journey that began during the Country Music Hall of Fame visit in 2000 was perfectly bookended by attending a discussion panel and performances by Black country music singers in the Ford Theater at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. Featured at the event were Holly G and Black country music artists The Kentucky Gentlemen, Nikki Morgan, Aaron Vance and Julie Williams.\n\nThe Country Music Hall of Fame groundbreaking ceremony was the location where I made a promise to myself, 22 years earlier, to make sure there were more Black country music members in the Hall of Fame by the end of my life. I was now witnessing how far Holly G had come on her path to making my vision a reality.\n\nWith the rising popularity of Black country music since last year\u2019s AMERICANAFEST and the changes Holly G\u2019s Black Opry have brought to Nashville since my initial visit, I\u2019m more inspired than ever to see how my experience and skills can be used to increase the growth of Black country music and this movement in the future.\n\nBlack Opry Revue will be performing at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Saturday Nov. 5 at 7 p.m.\n```"}

The week will feature activities for the whole campus, including everything from free vegan food to complimentary Metro rides to celebrate the actions USC has taken to reach its sustainability goals. Various organizations on campus are hosting events throughout the week for students to enjoy, starting with Saturday night\u2019s football game and ending with a \u201cspooktacular\u201d Peace Garden festival.\n\nSustainability has become a priority for the university in recent years, as President Carol L. Folt listed sustainability as a goal of hers when she delivered her State of the University address last spring. Associate director of the Office of Sustainability Ellen Dux told Annenberg Media that the university\u2019s challenge to complete Assignment: Earth has a larger mission.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is framed around 2028 because that\u2019s when the Olympics are coming to campus,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to be in top form, ready to do our best when everybody\u2019s focus is on us.\u201d This schoolwide plan is designed to reduce climate change and increase sustainability by 2028. Green Week is one step in that direction, she said.\n\nEnvironmental Students Assembly co-executive director and junior environmental studies major Connor Castillo said initiatives like Green Week help keep sustainability top of mind for students.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have reminders throughout the year to be sustainably conscious. Of course, there\u2019s more that the university can do, [but] these university efforts are not negative or something that should go away,\u201d Castillo said.\n\nEnvironmental Students Assembly and the Office of Sustainability will partner with leaders Tuesday night at the TCC Forum for the Student Sustainability Leader Summit to discuss a streamlined mission for greener efforts campuswide.\n\nHere are some of Annenberg Media\u2019s tips for navigating Green Week 2022.\n\nZero Waste Challenge at USC vs. Arizona State\n\nUSC\u2019s Green Week will kick off with the Annual Pac-12 Zero Waste Challenge Saturday at the Coliseum when USC football takes on Arizona State. This Pac-12 initiative encourages universities to work with partners like concessions, vendors and merchandise producers to reduce the amount of waste that they produce. All participating universities send in a scorecard to the Pac-12 that rates the institutions on things like the amount of waste they divert and innovation.\n\nLast year, USC earned third place in the challenge and prevented 90% of its waste from being transported to landfills. This challenge encourages USC to apply zero waste practices by developing effective sustainability habits, some of which include promoting the use of reusable bottles rather than plastic ones and using the reduce, reuse and recycle method.\n\nRegenerate: Art, Culture, and Sustainability Workshop and Panel\n\nOn Oct. 3, the USC community can participate in Regenerate: Art, Culture, and Sustainability Workshop and Panel, an evening at the USC Fisher Museum of Art (HAR) where student artists and creatives can learn more about sustainable art innovation and participate in conversations about sustainability in art. The event will highlight student artists and storytelling exhibits sponsored by the USC Arts & Climate Collective (ACC), an eco-friendly art workshop led by interdisciplinary artist and faculty member Eric Junker.\n\nArtist, curator, and USC professor China Adams will lead a roundtable discussion regarding art, culture, and sustainability with student members of the ACC. Admission is free and open to all USC students, staff, and faculty. RSVP is required.\n\nFree Vegan Meals on Campus\n\nThe Jubilee Vegan Cafe will be serving free vegan food at the University Religious Center (URC) courtyard on Oct. 4 from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. The cafe is run by Progressive Christians @USC, alongside the USC Office of Religious and Spiritual Life as well as Vegans of L.A. The cafe is open to all USC community members, regardless of religious affiliation, and will have more lunches to follow, on Tuesdays through Nov. 29.\n\nRide the L.A. Metro for Free\n\nFor California Clean Air Day, students can ride the Metro for free on Oct. 5. Buses and trains help decrease pollution because they emit fewer emissions per person riding, according to L.A. Metro. The more people that use transit, the cleaner the air. The Metro week continues with free rides on the entire Metro Bus, Rail and Bike system from noon on Oct. 7 until the end of service on Oct. 9, in honor of the opening of the K Line. The Metro weekend helps with transportation to a gamut of events, including CicLAvia, the Cowboys vs. Rams game and the Nashville vs. LAFC game in Exposition Park.\n\nWorkshops and volunteer days at the Shrine Place Garden\n\nThe USC Peace Garden at Shrine Place Garden will hold open gardening hours on Oct. 5 from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., welcoming all members of the USC community. USC\u2019s Peace Garden announced a programming schedule for the Fall semester, including open garden hours, workshops, volunteer days and other events. This semester, the organization will focus on growing food and to planting California native, drought-tolerant ornamental plants. Stay tuned via @uscpeacegarden for more information on upcoming events.\n\nEnvironmental Student Assembly co-executive director and sophomore environmental studies major Valerie Kuo also suggested another way for students to become more aware of how they can be sustainable in their day-to-day life: through education.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re an economics major maybe take an environmental economics class,\u201d she said. \u201cThink about how your career path relates to sustainability.\u201d\n\nThough Green Week offers opportunities for students to consciously make sustainable efforts, Dux offered that students should try to carry out their sustainable actions outside of the designated week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constant reinforcement. So that\u2019s what we want to do every year during Green Week,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re doing our job right every year or around Green Week, we will have the opportunity to say, here are some big new wins that the university is accomplishing along our path to that 2028 Assignment: Earth framework.\u201d```"}

After a near loss against Oregon State last week, the undefeated Trojans will face a struggling Arizona State team Saturday night.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 defense has been nothing but phenomenal this season. USC\u2019s defense leads the nation with 11 interceptions. \u201cIf you play at a high level, if you compete at a high level and you do so with a team effort, we will not only play you, we will start you and we will champion you,\u201d said defensive coordinator Alex Grinch after Wednesday\u2019s practice.\n\nAlthough the defense is firing on all cylinders, the Trojan offense has slowed down considerably in the past couple of weeks. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams went 16-for-36 for 180 yards and one touchdown against Oregon State, Williams\u2019 lowest stat totals and completion percentage of the season so far.\n\nConsistency has been a key goal this season for Williams, and it\u2019s clear that he still needs to improve in that aspect of his game after his production against Oregon State. \u201cWe need to coach better.,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said after Tuesday\u2019s practice when asked about Williams\u2019 performance. \u201cWe need to prep our guys better and we need to play better and more precise.\u201d\n\nWhether or not better coaching and preparation will lead Williams out of his current slump, it will be an interesting quarterback matchup this weekend regardless. Arizona State redshirt junior quarterback Emory Jones is a dual-threat athlete who might be able to take advantage of USC\u2019s diminished defensive line. Jones had a season high of 261 passing yards on 21-of-36 completions against Utah last week. Jones just might be peaking at the right time to catch the Trojans unprepared.\n\n\u201c[Jones] can make all the throws but also extend plays with his feet,\u201d senior inside linebacker Ralen Goforth said after Tuesday\u2019s practice.\n\nRedshirt sophomore edge rusher Romello Height is likely to miss out on the rest of the season after having a procedure on his shoulder, according to Riley. Height injured his shoulder early in the game against Fresno State and did not return from the locker room. With Height being removed from the lineup, the burden will be placed on the rest of the defensive line. It could be tough sledding for the Trojans if the USC defensive line isn\u2019t up to the task.\n\nSophomore inside linebacker and former ASU outside linebacker Eric Gentry had a notable performance against Oregon State last week. Gentry collected an interception from Oregon State quarterback Chance Nolan, which allowed the Trojan offense to set up a field goal that put USC on the scoreboard. Eyes are on Gentry this week as he faces his former team at a new position. However, the inside linebacker appears to be unphased and remains focused on performing well and assisting his team. \u201cJust another football game.,\u201d Gentry said after Wednesday\u2019s practice.\n\nAfter a rocky start to the season, the Sun Devils will face USC on a three-game losing streak. Former Arizona State head coach Herm Edwards was dismissed from his coaching duties following a 31-20 loss to Eastern Michigan in Week 3. Since then, the Sun Devils have been under the leadership of interim head coach Shaun Aguano, the team\u2019s former running backs coach.\n\nDespite the coaching change, the Trojans are approaching this game the same way as they would have at the start of the season. \u201cYou can\u2019t really switch your mindset,\u201d Goforth said. \u201cYou know the mindset of the team is that we have to prepare and not take it lightly.\u201d\n\nThe 4-0 Trojans will kick off against the 1-3 Sun Devils this Saturday, Oct. 1 at 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

Perhaps mats are already laid out on the floor, or meditative music is playing in the background. But students experienced something quite different when they practice yoga at USC\u2019s Fisher Museum of Art. Instead, this group did their class in the midst of an art exhibit featuring works created by mental health advocate and surrealist artist Louise Bourgeois.\n\nBourgeois was a French-American artist, well-known for her large-scale sculptures and works that take inspiration from her lifelong struggle with trauma and anxiety from her childhood. The exhibition showcases 119 prints, textiles and a series of eight holograms that build on the \u201craw emotional terrain\u201d of Bourgeois\u2019 artistic practice.\n\nOn Thursday, USC students and staff held their class inside of her exhibit, titled \u201cWhat is the Shape of This Problem?\u201d This free yoga class was taught by instructor Siwen Xi, who is pursuing her doctoral degree in music teaching and learning at USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music. Xi had to adapt her typical yoga practices to better fit the new environment of the art exhibit.\n\n\u201cI used the words on the wall as inspiration and encouragement. It\u2019s important for me to blend with the environment,\u201d she said. The art, some of which included a written series of affirmations like \u201cyes\u201d and \u201crejuvenate,\u201d also gave her inspiration about the energy of the space and how much energy she should push throughout the session, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it was amazing to do yoga in such a cool space, especially with the exhibit going on,\u201d junior art history major Skylar Hansen-Raj said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful exhibit and [students] should definitely come check it out.\u201d\n\nTanya Aggarwal, a sophomore business major, said she\u2019s practiced yoga for most of her life but that this alternative environment added to the experience. \u201cBeing in a museum made this experience really surreal because when we had to hold different poses, we could read the text,\u201d Aggarwal said. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to the gym a lot and that\u2019s very intense. This place is just very relaxing and so easy on the eyes.\u201d\n\nXi is a certified yoga teacher with Yoga Alliance in Dharma yoga, yin yoga, pregnancy yoga and children\u2019s yoga. She began her journey of yoga and meditation in 2010 when she was in high school, suffering from anxiety due to auditions and exams, she said.\n\nHansen-Raj said she also experiences anxiety and benefits from practicing yoga consistently. \u201cI feel like it helps reduce my stress and anxiety a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a USC student is so crazy and there\u2019s so much to do all the time, so [I] definitely feel a lot more at peace and grounded after a yoga session.\u201d\n\nXi explained that her favorite moment at the end of the yoga session was when the students felt rewarded and relieved in the final resting pose after challenging themselves to the half-frog pose, in which yogis pull their foot up to the back of their knee.\n\n\u201cThe energy from a very strenuous and tiring task to go back to how they sleep at night....was a good response to what I taught that day,\u201d Xi said.\n\nThe Fisher Museum regularly hosts yoga classes in its exhibits, and USC students have another chance to practice in the Bourgeois exhibit with Xi on Oct. 27.\n```"}

He fired up his men and watched as they went on a scorching 7-0 run to soundly defeat UC Santa Barbara 10-6.\n\nFreshman utility Andrej Grgurevic led the charge by scoring a career-high three goals in the second half, scoring the tying and go-ahead strikes for the Trojans. Redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt also contributed three goals to the winning effort, moving up to 12th on the all-time USC goals list. Redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen pitched in with two more strikes. In all, five Trojans found the net, including senior driver Marcus Longton, who extended his scoring streak to 15 games. He is the only Trojan to have scored in every game this season.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just the offense that came alive in the second half. Graduate goalie Kyle McKenney held the Gauchos scoreless for 16 straight minutes, including two crucial penalty blocks in the third quarter. Overall, McKenney prevented eight Gaucho strikes from finding the net.\n\n\u201cComing out of halftime, the boys were fired up, and I knew I had to clutch up for them,\u201d McKenney said. \u201cSo, I mainly focused on just not letting [UC Santa Barbara] get past me. We had a great comeback win, and I\u2019m super proud of my teammates.\u201d\n\n\u201c[McKenney] really came through for us when we were down,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cHe changed the game with those two penalty blocks.\u201d\n\nPintaric\u2019s defense kept the pressure on the Gauchos, swiping the ball 15 times, with five steals coming from Grgurevic. \u201cThe whole defensive effort for us this game was great,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cWe did a really good job of countering [UC Santa Barbara\u2019s] drivers.\u201d\n\nWith the stunning victory, the Trojans now sit at an overall record of 11-4. They will face off against No. 9 UC Irvine at home on Sunday. The Trojans got the best of the Anteaters earlier this season with a 10-4 victory on Sept. 3. USC has won its last 35 meetings against UCI and leads the overall series 82-23.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re super excited to come home and play against Irvine,\u201d McKenney said. \u201cWe always love hearing the fans cheer at the [Uytengsu Aquatics] Center. We\u2019re coming off of a great win, so it will be fun to try to get another at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always great playing at home, especially after all this time on the road,\u201d Pintaric said. \u201cI know the guys are fired up to play against a great opponent in Irvine, especially with this win.\u201d\n```"}

But residents around Baldwin Hills, which is not part of the ordinance, are upset.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t this [area] being banned?\u201d asked Nicole King, a mother of three who lives near Ladera Little League park, a fence away from an active oil drilling site. \u201cIs it the demographics? Is our livelihood not important?\u201d\n\nThe ordinance will gradually shut down 473 oil wells, accounting for almost a third of the oil wells across the county. While a small portion of wells have specific plans and discretionary permits, 855 wells in the unincorporated parts of the Baldwin Hills community have not been addressed in the ordinance.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning has not identified a specific procedure or a tentative plan for oil drilling in the Baldwin Hills Community Standard District since June 8, 2022. Yet, the department said in this report that they will address it in future efforts for the Baldwin Hills Community Standard District. As of Friday, the department has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nLos Angeles is historically a lucrative area for the oil industry. It\u2019s home to the country\u2019s largest oil field with thousands of wells scattered around homes, schools and parks. But, less than 1% of unpurified oil processed in Southern California refineries actually comes from wells in Los Angeles, according to Councilman Paul Krekorian.\n\n\u201c[The ordinance] is a really big step for people living near drill sites who have been disproportionately affected,\u2019\u2019 Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said in the L.A. County board meeting.\n\nBut while several community activists praised the county\u2019s efforts to shut down wells, people living around Baldwin Hills worried about being left out. Studies have found living next to urban drilling sites can irritate the eyes, nose and throat and have adverse impact on infant health.\n\nCommunity-focused studies show \u201cincrease risk to preterm birth, childhood cancers, heart disease as well as asthma attacks,\u201d said Jill Johnston, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine.\n\nCulver City resident Jajuana Calloway was jogging near Ladera Little League Park with her friends on Wednesday morning. She said she was worried about the health threat of the drills.\n\n\u201cBeing a cancer survivor over 20 years, I have high concern,\u201d she said.\n```"}

Gavin Newsom signed a bill aimed at making it easier for farmworkers to unionize in Sacramento, Calif., Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2022.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nBy Grace Gerstner, Cami Twomey and Josh Flowers September 30, 2022 at 4:05 pm PDT\n\nAfter pressure from President Biden, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed new legislation Wednesday that makes it easier for farmworkers to join labor unions. Assembly Bill 2183 allows agricultural workers to cast unionization ballots by mail or by dropping off a ballot at the Agricultural Labor Board, instead of at secret in-person election sites, often on farm owners\u2019 property. The United Farm Workers and the California Labor Federation argue that onsite voting allows voter suppression and union-busting efforts.\n\nIn his statement announcing his signature, Newsom said that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s farmworkers are the lifeblood of our state, and they have the fundamental right to unionize and advocate for themselves in the workplace.\u201d Maureen McGuire, the CEO of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, commented on this Californian pride saying, \u201cI think this is a great concern and that we should all be really proud to be Californians.\u201d\n\nDespite the benefit to workers, legal experts are expecting challenges to the bill if it passes. \u201cThis legislation will be a game changer if it is allowed to stand as written and enacted. It won\u2019t surprise me to see agricultural employers [or] business groups try to challenge it in court,\u201d Thomas Lenz, a USC labor law professor, said.\n\nPreviously, Newsom was hesitant to accept the bill because of security concerns with the use of mailing ballots. He feared that procedural issues could compromise the integrity of unionization votes. McGuire also said that the bill \u201chas more to do with changing the way that the elections are run and changing the types of penalties to reduce the ability for employers to participate in the conversation.\u201d\n\nIn September, dozens of United Farm Workers supporters trekked over 335 miles from Delano, California to Sacramento and camped out of the Capitol building for several weeks to garner attention for their cause and obtain Newsom\u2019s support. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi all publicly shared their support for the AB 2183 bill after the United Farm Workers\u2019 24-day long march received national attention.\n\nThe fact that Harris and Pelosi, both from California, were supportive was not surprising to Lenz. \u201cIt would make sense to me that they would take interest in something happening in their home state,\u201d said Lenz.\n\nIn an official statement, Biden backed the workers\u2019 movement, saying that \u201cIn the state with the largest population of farmworkers, the least we owe them is an easier path to make a free and fair choice to organize a union,\u201d he said. \u201cI am grateful to California\u2019s elected officials and union leaders for leading the way.\u201d\n\nMichael Schilf, a graduate of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, is working on a forthcoming documentary, titled \u201cThe Road to Sacramento,\u201d about the lives of migrant workers, the injustices they face and the 335-mile march. Schilf said that most migrant farmers don\u2019t vote due to intimidation and deportation as fear tactics. \u201cSometimes an entire family works in the field, so [growers] may threaten to fire the entire family,\u201d he said.\n\nThis bill promises to protect and prevent workers from this mistreatment, discrimination, and intimidation.

{"key": "/2022/09/30/what-call-me-crazy-told-me-about-myself/", "response": "```\nWhat \u201cCall Me Crazy\u2019\u201d told me about myself\n\nIn light of actress, director and screenwriter Anne Heche\u2019s death, her 2001 memoir \u201cCall Me Crazy\u201d remains an unfortunate token of today\u2019s mental health conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s too late for me to tell Anne Heche that I love her. I love anyone like her, really. Sometimes that means I love myself. In her book \u201cCall Me Crazy,\u201d Heche describes the precipice of her \u201cinsanity\u201d at the time. After her breakup with Ellen Degeneres in 2001, she took ecstasy and sped off to Las Vegas. The exact motivations of this trip and its aftermath are lost between the PR message delivered by her team (she was driving to a music festival when she became overcome by heat exhaustion) and her recollection (she took the pill in order to join a spaceship\u2019s excursion to heaven in pursuit of love). Whatever the reason, she was found days later nearly nude muttering nonsense at a suburban home. She blames Celestia, her alternate personality, for the bulk of her intense episodes but admits to a certain extent that Celestia\u2019s existence was a requisite in surviving the world of abuse that she was raised in. She also recalled a moment when filming \u201cDonnie Brasco\u201d where holes began appearing on her hands and feet \u2014 stigmata. The hallucinations would lead her to believe that she was the next vessel for immaculate conception.\n\nIn the time since this book was published, Heche remained relatively silent. Then, on August 5, 2022, she drove her car into a home in Mar Vista, Los Angeles. She was topless when pulled out of the fiery wreck 45 minutes later. These are the kinds of experiences that don\u2019t fit along with the acceptable aesthetic of mental health issues. In \u201cCall Me Crazy,\u201d Heche doesn\u2019t sound ashamed of her abnormal disposition. I can identify with that, I\u2019ve commonly embraced my mental health issues and I use them as a sort of inspiration for my work. Now, however, one of us is dead.\n\nI appreciated the common decency offered by the entertainment media industry following her death. It was one of the first times I noticed real progress in the movement to destigmatize mental health issues. Still, nobody wanted to talk about it. That is how it goes with mental health in my own experience. Even your most supportive confidantes struggle to say anything (please say anything) when faced by the system of \u201clogic\u201d that guides their loved ones.\n\nIn my queer baby era, I was excited to find out that Portia de Rossi was gay. A new season of \u201cArrested Development\u201d had dropped, and I reveled in my \u201cdevelopments\u201d about her. My research led me to a YouTube video detailing the love life of her wife Ellen DeGeneres (2013 was a difficult time for representation). It was there when I first heard the name Anne Heche and the last time I would until her death.\n\nIn \u201cCall Me Crazy,\u201d Heche describes her journey in \u201cgetting the crazy out.\u201d It haunted me the most out of everything I learned about her. I\u2019ve spent years wondering when it will end \u2014 when I have finally done enough, achieved enough, and reached a level of security in life to protect me from myself. I shared the impression that you could someday be okay. This ending to Heche\u2019s life serves as a stark reminder that okay doesn\u2019t exist. It makes me wonder whether the craziness is only able to be staved off for as long as my daughter really needs me and that my life is just a wave of emotion that I\u2019ll float on until it all becomes too much.\n\nHaving hopefully frontloaded my trauma into the first quarter of my existence, the fear that some random inconvenience or loss in my life will break me terrifies me daily. I\u2019ve grown more and more weary in the past year having watched the few cultural figures I have who represent more severe mental illness be pummeled by the world. Most recently there was Gabbie Hanna, a YouTube celebrity whose public mental health crises have been on my radar for years. She danced around her home in her bright red sports bra and matching yoga pants as she unknowingly documented her own delusions in a manic haze. At one point, she was God. A stranger watched, located her home and directed himself there in order to \u201chelp.\u201d Posting it all to TikTok, he (under false pretenses) gained entry from the vulnerable Hanna. People advocating for Hanna and railing against the violation weren\u2019t rare, but they were lost in a sea of people more interested in seeing where the show would go. This situation was exemplary of the typical reaction to laugh at mental health crises that are exhibited through erratic behavior.\n\nEveryone railed against the inhumane conservatorship of Britney Spears, but, again, there is little conversation about the help that she does need. Since the walls protecting her sanitized image have come down, we have borne witness to a disappointing truth. Spears is not okay. Because of the trauma she faced being infantilized for decades by her father, Spears refuses to address any mental health issues. The result has been further self-isolation from her loved ones and complete opposition to any meaningful psychiatric help.\n\nThis is a problem that I have with my own upbringing. I was somewhat coddled as a result of my painful childhood. For years my quirks would not be addressed, but excused as a result of my poor mental health. Sheltered, too, because my feelings and life were too complicated for my peers. Soon after I fled the nest, I entered into an abusive relationship that further prevented me from gathering life experience through isolation. I don\u2019t know how to be in a healthy relationship, I don\u2019t know how to take care of myself, I don\u2019t know how to manage my life \u2014 basic things required to be a functioning adult.\n\nWe are vulnerable to parasocial relationships, especially with the internet at our hands, but the worry that we are overstepping has completely inhibited our ability to call a spade a spade. We\u2019re recovering from an era that lasted until the 1967 where lobotomies were handed out to so-called crazed or hysteric women like candy, but there must be some balance between locking up the people that we don\u2019t want to deal with and letting them exist freely without any sense of structure or stability. So far goes the empathy for someone\u2019s hardships that it turns into neglect. Where does that leave us? Where does that leave me?\n\nAs far as I can see, I am doomed to continue suffering from my disease in increasingly public ways until I die. That\u2019s what will happen until mental health issues, and bipolar disorder specifically, aren\u2019t destigmatized. People like us need to be free to admit if our emotions are getting ugly again. Not thrown into a (likely poorly run) psych ward or put on a completely numbing medication. Not everyone has access to those options and it appears as though even those who do are not able to receive proper help.\n\nDuring the worst time in my life, I faced hospitalization after hospitalization. I was put on medications that would put me to sleep for most of the day and leave me groggy for the rest. I was also the most isolated that I had ever been from my close ones. They didn\u2019t understand and I was afraid of scaring them, but in my haze I never thought that waiting on calls from the hospital caused more anxiety. I was just as afraid to talk about what I knew everyone saw as they were by what they were seeing.\n\nWhether you suffer from a mental health issue or you know someone who does, we are all responsible for ending its stigmatization. My biggest takeaway from \u201cCall Me Crazy\u201d was a selfish one, unfortunately. I don\u2019t want to live and die like Heche, forever fighting my demons. I don\u2019t want my value of life to be based on how different I am than everyone else. Sometimes I want to be told, \u201cYou\u2019re being a little crazy.\u201d\n```"}
